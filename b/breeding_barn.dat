40|$|Feather- {{associated}} {{bacteria are}} widespread inhabitants of avian plumage. However, {{the determinants of}} the between-individual variation in plumage bacterial loads are less well understood. Infection intensities can be determined by ecological factors, such as breeding habitat, and can be actively regulated by hosts via preening. Preening, yet, is a resource intensive activity, and thus might be traded-off against reproductive investment in breeding birds. Here, we studied barn swallows Hirundo rustica to assess the bacterial cost of reproduction in relation to nesting site micro-habitats. Barn swallows prefer to breed {{in the company of}} large-sized farm animals, although the presence of mammalian livestock in barns assures a warm and humid micro-climate that favours bacterial proliferation. Thus, we experimentally manipulated brood sizes of birds <b>breeding</b> in <b>barns</b> with, or without, farm animals and measured total cultivable bacteria (TCB) and feather-degrading bacteria (FDB) from the plumage. We found that the abundance of feather-associated bacteria (i. e. both TCB and FDB) in females, but not males, <b>breeding</b> in <b>barns</b> with livestock were significantly higher than in conspecifics <b>breeding</b> in empty <b>barns.</b> Plumage bacterial loads, however, were not affected by brood size manipulations in either sex.

The {{objective was to}} evaluate how these raptors, which differ markedly in their hunting activity periods (owls are nocturnal and kites diurnal), share their mammalian food component. 2, 087 prey consumed by Barn Owls and 1, 276 by White-tailed Kites were identified. They presented a high overlap of food-niches (Pianka’s index was 0. 98). Based on the daily activity period of their main small mammal prey, a lower overlap would be expected.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{project to}} release barn owls in semi-urban areas within Sebokeng was {{initiated}} when the Gauteng Department of Health received complaints from Sebokeng residents about {{the increase in}} black house rats Rattus rattus. This project was designed to investigate the efficacy of using owls as biological control agents of rats at three schools in Sebokeng, and to inform learners at these schools about barn owls, {{in light of the}} learners’ strong sense of their culture and the associated beliefs and superstitions. There were two aims to the project. Firstly, to assess whether and how released barn owls impact on rat populations {{in the vicinity of the}} schools. Secondly, to provide environmental education to previously disadvantaged communities, and to assess how experiential group work using Outcomes Based Education (OBE) teaching changes the attitudes of learners towards owls. Owl boxes with two owlets each were established at two schools (SPS 1 and SPS 3); another school (SPS 2) had a resident <b>breeding</b> <b>barn</b> owl pair. A fourth school, SPS 4, was used as a control and no owls were released here. Snap trapping of rats took place at these schools and SPS 4 to assess the impact of owls on rat populations.

40|$|The {{effects of}} swine {{gestation}} housing on sow and litter performance were evaluated at the Iowa State University Lauren Christian Swine Research and Demonstration Farm near Atlantic, IA. The gestation housing systems were 1) individual gestation crates in a mechanically ventilated, partially slatted floor, manure flush confinement building (CRATE); and 2) group pens in deep-bedded, naturally ventilated hoop structures (HOOP). The HOOP sows were fed with individual feed stalls. The sows were artificially inseminated in a confinement <b>breeding</b> <b>barn</b> with slatted floors and were later moved to their assigned gestation housing treatment. Sows {{continued in the}} same gestation housing their entire time at the farm. All first-litter gilts were gestated in individual gestation crates to minimize sow size differential in the groups. There were 35 sows per group in the HOOP barns. Farrowing occurred every 2 weeks on a year-round basis. All sows were fed 4. 5 lb/day and increased to 6 lb/day during the last trimester of gestation. During the winter HOOP sows were fed 25 % more and CRATE sows were fed 5 % more. Reproductive performance was summarized for 433 litters during the period March 2001 through September 2002. This is a progress report of a continuing study. Preliminary trends were a shorter wean-to-breed interval, fewer still born and mummified pigs (combined), one more live pig born per litter, two more pigs weaned/sow/year, and much lower sow culling and mortality rates for HOOP sows compared to CRATE sows.

Gilts received grower diets formulated to provide 0. 68 % (low), 0. 79 % (medium) or 0. 90 % (high) SID lysine from 100 days of age until approximately 90 kg BW. Then, gilts were fed finisher diets containing 0. 52 % (low), 0. 60 % (medium) or 0. 68 % (high) SID lysine until they were moved to the <b>breeding</b> <b>barn</b> at approximately 220 days of ageData on BW, bakfat thickness, loin area, feed and lysine intake and age at puberty was collected at different intervals during the study.

Overall, 34 % of gilts displayed standing estrus before 220 days of age. The number of gilts that reached puberty was not different among dietary treatments; however, gilts fed the high and medium lysine diet reached puberty 10 days and 6 days before gilts fed the low lysine diet, respectively.

40|$|Proximity logging is a {{new tool}} for {{understanding}} social behavior as it allows for accurate quantification of social networks. We report results from field calibration and deployment tests of miniaturized proximity tags (Encounternet), digital transceivers that log encounters between tagged individuals. We examined radio signal behavior in relation to tag attach-ment (tag, tag on bird, tag on saline-filled balloon) to understand how radio signal strength {{is affected by the}} tag mounting technique used for calibration tests. We investigated inter-tag and inter-receiver station variability, and in each calibration test we accounted for the effects of antennae orientation. Additionally, we used data from a live deployment on <b>breeding</b> <b>barn</b> swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to analyze the quality of the logs, including recipro-cal agreement in dyadic logs. We evaluated the impact (in terms of mass changes) of tag attachment on the birds. We were able to statistically distinguish between RSSI values associated with different close-proximity (< 5 m) tag-tag distances regardless of antennae orientation. Inter-tag variability was low, but we did find significant inter-receiver station vari-ability. Reciprocal agreement of dyadic logs was high and social networks were constructed from proximity tag logs based on two different RSSI thresholds. There was no evidence of significant mass loss in the time birds were wearing tags. We conclude that proximity log-gers are accurate and effective for quantifying social behavior. However, because RSSI and distance cannot be perfectly resolved, data from proximity loggers are most appropriate for comparing networks based on specific RSSI thresholds. The Encounternet system is flexible and customizable, and tags are now light enough for use on small animals (< 50 g) ...|$|E

Sows were artificially inseminated in a mechanically ventilated, partially slatted floor confinement <b>breeding</b> <b>barn.</b> Sows were moved {{as a group}} to their assigned gestation housing treatment by the ninth day post-weaning. Sows {{were randomly assigned to}} gestation housing treatment when the project commenced. All first parity gilts were gestated in individual crates and randomly assigned to a gestation group after breeding for the second parity. Farrowing occurred throughout the year on a bi-weekly schedule. All sows received 2. 04 kg per day of a cornsoybean meal diet. During the last trimester of gestation, feed allowance was increased to 2. 72 kg. During the winter H sows were fed 25 % more feed and C sows were fed 5 % more feed. Reproductive performance was summarized for 957 litters and analyzed using general linear models. Number born alive per litter was different for the two housing treatments (P 0. 1). H sows also weaned 0. 4 pigs more per litter (P 0. 1). Failure to conceive was the leading reason for culling in both treatments. There was a trend for sows gestated in C to be culled for feet and leg unsoundness. H sows tended to be culled for poor body condition.

The aim of this research was to assess the effect of landscape parameters on <b>breeding</b> success of <b>barn</b> owls throughout the Rother and Arun River catchments, Sussex, UK. We used a Geographic Information System to describe the habitat mosaic and landscape structure within an estimated home range area of 3 km 2 around 85 artificial nest box sites. Results showed that land cover was less heterogeneous at successful sites, with home ranges dominated by a few habitat types of regular patch shapes. Unsuccessful nesting sites had significantly more improved grassland, suburban land and wetlands than successful sites. Cluster analysis and Principle Components Analysis was used to assess the similarity of the habitat mosaic within these areas and pellet analysis was undertaken to assess barn owl diet and prey availability. Ten prey species were recovered from pellets, field vole (Microtus agrestis), common shrews (Sorex araneus) and house mice (Mus musculus) making up nearly 90 % of recoveries. However box sites varied in relative proportions of small mammal, and hence prey availability. Results indicated that land use and landscape structure can affect <b>breeding</b> success in <b>barn</b> owls. Higher levels of poor quality small mammal habitat were associated with unsuccessful sites. However, at a landscape scale, the habitat mosaic across the study area lacked variation, limiting analysis and clear correlations between habitat type and positive breeding success, suggesting that a finer scale was needed in future studies utilising this approach...|$|R

40|$|Sex {{ratio of}} adults (tertiary sex ratio, TSR) {{is a major}} feature of animal populations with {{consequences}} for their behaviour, genetic structure and viability. Spatial and temporal variation in TSR occurs within species but the mechanisms behind it are poorly understood. In this long-term study of a declining population of a socially monogamous, colonial, migratory bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), we first analyzed population-level variation in TSR ( =  proportion of males) of yearlings at sexual maturation in relation to ecological conditions as gauged by annual survival rate of adults. TSR was male-biased both among yearlings and older individuals, but male bias of yearlings was more pronounced after years with larger decline in adult survival. Thus, male offspring were less susceptible to the adverse ecological conditions that cause increased mortality. Dispersal and settling site decisions can have major consequences on fitness via the effects of local TSR on mating and sperm competition. <b>Breeding</b> <b>barn</b> swallows are highly philopatric while natal dispersal is high and, together with mortality, is the main determinant of colony TSR. We thus also investigated the mechanisms of breeding colony choice by yearlings and found that TSR of new-settlers in a given colony and year was negatively predicted by TSR of returning, early arriving older individuals in that year, but not by overall TSR at the colony in the previous year. This suggests that in our male-biased population new-settler males respond to local TSR upon arrival to choose the sites with larger breeding opportunities. Hence, variation in ecological conditions as reflected by adult survival can shift the TSR of individuals recruiting into a local population, with potentially various demographic consequences. However, breeding site choice based on TSR tends to homogenize TSR at a population level likely by facilitating settling of dispersing males in colonies with less male-biased TSR...|$|E

For the cow barn economy is very important, as this {{is essential for the}} subsequent provision of income to the <b>breeding</b> <b>barn.</b> The primary purpose of the modern barn is most comfortable being of the animals. Cosy is a major factor in achieving high production and longevity. The quality of milk is largely dependent {{on the state of the}} equipment. A daily hygiene is needed, because this is an important factor for a good outcome milk. To the quality of milk also contribute regulated ventilation, appropriate temperature, humidity, lighting and quality food. The purpose of the research is to obtain the opinion of farmers on the use of milking equipment and the suitability thereof. We determined the satisfaction of farmers with equipment, pleasure and comfort of cows. We asked them about the consequences of long-term working with animals. The results of the degree paper showed that farmers must adapt equipment in the cow barn and especially in the milking parlor. This is the only way they can manage their work in a position which does not force them in improper posture and prevent pain. The main reason for choosing a particular method of milking is to facilitate the work itself...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} effects of a short period of a chronically {{elevated}} corticosterone level, the main stress hormone in birds, in an ecological context and draws a link to the mechanisms explaining individual differences in the sensitivity to stress. The barn owl, as a model species, provides excellent opportunities to investigate parental investment and nestling development in natural conditions and allows experimental manipulations. 	I chose an experimental approach to manipulate stress hormone levels in free-living barn owls, using newly available self-degradable pellets releasing corticosterone. These pellets proved to be a powerful tool to elevate corticosterone levels. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) -axis responded strongly to the corticosterone administration resulting in a decreased HPA-axis responsiveness as demonstrated by the decreased endogenous response to an acute stressor of corticosterone-implanted birds (chapter 1). Furthermore, the increase of circulating corticosterone after implantation of the pellet and the regulation of free corticosterone through corticosterone-binding globulins (CBG) varied with environmental conditions and food regimes of the nestlings (chapter 6). These results imply that for an understanding of the biological relevance of effects of stress it is not sufficient to study laboratory animals or animals in captivity. On the contrary it is crucial to study free-living animals and observe the context the animal is living in; otherwise we most likely miss or misinterpret important aspects of effects of stress. 	Elevated corticosterone levels in <b>breeding</b> <b>barn</b> owl males resulted in a decreased male investment into the brood, which the female did not compensate for, but were not inhibitory to current reproduction (chapter 2). In nestling barn owls a short period of increased corticosterone levels caused a decrease in body mass gain, wing length, and tarsus growth. These reduced growth rates persisted much longer than the corticosterone levels were elevated; at fledging body mass and wing length of corticosterone-implanted nestlings were still lower than in untreated nest mates (chapter 3). Elevated corticosterone levels clearly entailed costs in terms of reduced resistance against oxidative stress, and, because antibody production was reduced, in terms of a higher risk of infections and progression of diseases (chapter 7). All these results together suggest that a short period (only two to three days!) of elevated corticosterone levels influence strongly parental investment and nestling growth and have far longer-lasting effects than the effects that are manifest during the time of elevated corticosterone levels. Such a short period of stress can ultimately shape the phenotype and most likely also influence fitness at adulthood. 	I used the hypothesis suggested by Ducrest et al. that eumelanin-based coloration is genetically associated with resistance to stress in vertebrates and formulated the prediction that darker, more eumelanic, individuals are more resistant to stress. This hypothesis is based on a literature review of genetic and pharmacological studies. Thus it is crucial to test experimentally whether the degree of eumelanin-based coloration is indeed associated with resistance to stress. In this thesis I performed such experiments in breeding males and nestlings. I found that elevated corticosterone levels affected darker individuals less than whiter ones. More eumelanic males reduced provisioning rates less than whiter males (chapter 2), nestling growth was less affected in darker nestlings (chapter 3), and nestlings of darker genetic mothers had lower total and free corticosterone levels after corticosterone administration than nestlings of whiter mothers (chapter 4). These results together support the hypothesis that the degree of eumelanin-based coloration signals the ability to cope with stressful environmental situations and may explain why melanin-based coloration is a mate choice criterion. 	We could also demonstrate that elevated corticosterone levels influenced feather phaeomelanin production, which suggests that corticosterone indeed influences the condition-dependent part of melanin production and could therefore reflect the fitness of the individual during feather growth (chapter 5). 	The present thesis adds new information on the signaling function of eumelanin-based coloration in the barn owl, as dark owls were significantly better able to cope with an experimental elevation in corticosterone levels than lightly colored owls. Stress sensitivity is an important trait since it influences many other fitness components and when signaled in melanin-based coloration can play a role in sexual selection...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the impact of different quantities and forms of iodine in ration dairy cows on the concentration of hormones of the thyroid in the blood plasma. The experiment was done with a herd of Red cows breeding in the conversion to breed in the breeding of Holstein dairy cows in Klatovy. Iodine was given in both inorganic and organic form. Before experimenting, the value of total and free forms of hormones was very low. During the experiment, increased concentrations of hormones in connection with the intake of inorganic iodine, the significant deviations showed free forms of thyroid hoemones. Nevertheless, the addition of organic iodine was not fully substituted for the reduction of inorganic iodine content. The thesis also discusses the assessment of the thyroid status by Czech red cattlebreeding on the school farm. The aim was to compare the activity of the thyroid gland in high-yield dairy cows <b>breeding</b> in a <b>barn</b> environment and cattle on pasture reared cattle. For red cattle reared on pasture, there were characteristically higher concentration levels of total and free hormones compared with high yield dairy cows. Nevertheless, in comparison with the reference value,there was a concentration of TT 4 for Czech red cattlelower, it coresponded well as dairy cows, rather lower iodine supply. In connection with the rise (higher content) TT 4, possibly fT 4, there was a similar tendency for the TT 3 and fT 3, so we can´t assume a deeper state of iodine deficiencies and its associationwith an underactive thyroid gland...|$|R
40|$|The {{livestock}} economy {{played an}} important role in the agriculture of the area around Kaliningrad until the end of the eighties. Particularly the milk economy, but also the breeding of beef and pork were significant sources of income for the large agricultural firms. The changes in the economic situation of the agricultural firms went hand in hand with the changes in the economic and political situation. The privatisation of the old combines primarily lead to them taking on a new legal form. All other changes and transformations took longer to assert themselves. New, private agricultural firms were also founded, however, these are equipped with a small amount of land and, above all, very little capital resources. This shortage of finances which affects all companies, regardless of their legal forms, has considerable effects on the lives tock industry. The livestock figures which, during the period of the socialist planned economy, were distributed relatively evenly across the entire area, are dropping and are concentrated on certain favourable areas. The newly created private firms generally have low numbers of cattle, due to the fact that they are unable to invest in <b>barns,</b> <b>breeding</b> animals and high performance fodder. Should the urgently required measures for the support of the animal production fail to be im plemented by the regional administration over a long period of time, then the fear would be justified that the agriculture will suffer a setback which it will hardly be able to compensate. The continued exodus of young and well educated specialists from the agricultural sector will continue further and the percentage of old people in the village population will increase. To a growing extent, a subsistence economy is being operated which will further hinder the competitiveness of the agriculture in the region around Kaliningrad in comparison to, e. g. the neighbouring states of Poland and Lithuania...|$|R
40|$|Populations {{of several}} Neotropical migratory bird species have {{experienced}} {{declines in the}} recent decades but long-distance migrant aerial insectivores seem to be declining at greater rates than any other group. The Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) is a long-distance migrant and an aerial insectivore whose breeding populations have declined drastically in northern regions of North America but remain stable in {{certain areas of the}} southern United States. However, reasons for differential population trends and whether factors on breeding and/or wintering grounds could be causing these declines remain unclear. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate causes of differential population dynamics experienced by Barn Swallows in North America by 1) studying patterns of migratory connectivity of populations using a three stable isotope approach (δ 2 H, δ 13 C and δ 15 N) and 2) evaluating evidence for factors on breeding and/or wintering grounds causing regional differences in population trends. Tail feathers of Barn Swallow grown on the wintering grounds were collected during breeding season in 2009, 2010 and 2011 across the breeding range of the species. Feathers were examined isotopically (δ 2 H, δ 13 C and δ 15 N) and used to determine the relative strength of migratory connectivity of populations and to identify approximate wintering regions in South America. Long-term mark-recapture data from two breeding colonies in Washington State and Ontario were compared to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for breeding and wintering months as a measure of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to study the fundamental effect of large-scale climatic conditions on annual survival rates. Similarly, long-term reproductive parameters (i. e. fledging success, total number of eggs laid, chicks per nest) of breeding individuals in Washington State and Manitoba were used to determine the effects of local weather variation on reproductive performance. Winter-grown feathers grouped according to population sizes were additionally analyzed for costicosterone (CORT) concentrations to test whether declining northern populations have higher exposure to stressors on their wintering grounds in South America. Stable isotope (δ 2 H, δ 13 C and δ 15 N) analyses revealed evidence for a diverse pattern of migratory connectivity among breeding populations. Four isotopically distinct clusters corresponding to different wintering regions were identified and a progressive longitudinal shift in wintering grounds was detected. This study found evidence for a differential effect of ENSO-related weather conditions on inter-annual survivorship of two different <b>breeding</b> populations of <b>Barn</b> Swallows in North America. Annual survivorship of <b>Barn</b> Swallows <b>breeding</b> in Washington State was strongly correlated to ENSO during breeding and wintering months, while no correlation was found for birds breeding in Ontario, potentially due to the geographical variation of the effect of ENSO on weather conditions across North America and South America and the differential degree of migratory connectivity of populations. The length of cold periods (total number of consecutive days (≥ 2 d periods) with maximum daily temperatures lower than 11 ºC) was found to have also a strong effect on annual survival rates of birds breeding in Washington State. Analyses of historical weather data showed that declining breeding populations have been exposed to more extensive cold periods than stable populations, suggesting a relationship between length of cold periods in spring and population trends. Annual reproductive performance was significantly affected by environmental conditions early in the breeding season related to ambient temperature, while precipitation variables had little effect. Wintering ground stressors related to CORT seem to have no significant effect on population size changes, since feather-CORT levels from declining populations were similar to those from stable populations. This study has provided a first attempt to identify factors occurring on breeding and/or wintering grounds that could have an effect on population sizes of Barn Swallows in North America. Weather conditions during breeding and wintering months and the degree of migratory connectivity of populations seem to be playing a significant role in the population trends of the species...|$|R
