5|$|On 24 July 1930 Palmer's {{launched}} its thousandth ship, the tanker Peter Hurll, but {{by this time}} the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the Great Depression, and there were no new orders on the firm's books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.|$|E

5|$|The Tiananmen Square {{self-immolation}} incident {{took place}} in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001.

Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account of event, suggesting the self-immolations were staged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> discredit Falun Gong.|$|E
