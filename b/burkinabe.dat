25|$|Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkina's {{people are}} {{concentrated}} {{in the south and}} center of the country, where their density sometimes exceeds 48persons per square kilometer (125/sq.mi.). Hundreds of thousands of <b>Burkinabe</b> migrate regularly to Ivory Coast and Ghana, mainly for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are affected by external events; the September2002 coup attempt in Ivory Coast and the ensuing fighting meant that hundreds of thousands of <b>Burkinabe</b> returned to Burkina Faso.

30|$|In addition, {{country of}} origin {{indicated}} a statistically {{significant effect on the}} livelihood status of the immigrant traders (Table 3). While immigrant retailers from Mali were about 0.733 less likely to have improved job security, it was found that immigrants who originated from Togo were about twelve times more likely to achieve improved job security as compared to the reference category. The analysis (Table 3) further showed that whereas <b>Burkinabes</b> were 0.494 times less likely to achieve improved food security as compared to those from other countries, it was discovered that immigrants who were of Nigerian origin were eight {{times more likely to have}} improved food security. In general, the immigrants’ countries of origin were significantly associated with their general livelihood status and immigrants from Mali (0.335) and those from Niger (0.350) were less likely to achieve improvement in their overall livelihood status (Table 3) which authenticates what has been observed in the conceptual framework for the study (Fig. 1) that socio-economic disparities between migrants’ areas of origin has the proclivity to impact positively or negatively on their livelihood status.|$|R
50|$|Houphouët-Boigny and Thomas Sankara, {{the leader}} of Burkina Faso, had a highly {{turbulent}} relationship. Tensions reached their climax in 1985 when Côte d'Ivoire <b>Burkinabés</b> accused authorities {{of being involved in}} a conspiracy to forcibly recruit young students to training camps in Libya. Houphouët-Boigny responded by inviting the dissident Jean-Claude Kamboulé to take refuge inCôte d'Ivoire so that he could organise opposition to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|R
50|$|By 1950, Abidjan {{had just}} {{exceeded}} {{a population of}} 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million {{by the end of}} 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year, doubling every six or seven years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3-6%. Birth rate growth was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. The migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within Ivory Coast, and about 30,000 from abroad per year. From within Ivory Coast, the migration pattern was dominated by Akan (South-east, 48%), then Mandé (North-west, 24%) and Krou (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was <b>Burkinabes</b> (30%), Malians (22%), Ghanaians (19%), Nigerien (11%), and Guineans (9%). Of the Non-African migration, Lebanese migration was higher than European migration, with the French being largest of these. All in all, non-African migration represents 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which is still the highest in the area.|$|R
25|$|Education in Burkina Faso {{is divided}} into primary, {{secondary}} and higher education. High school costs approximately CFA25,000 ($50 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most <b>Burkinabè</b> families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.|$|E
25|$|On 15 October 1987, Sankara, {{along with}} twelve other officials, {{was killed in}} a coup d'état {{organized}} by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague and Burkina Faso's president until October2014. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days. A majority of <b>Burkinabé</b> citizens hold that France's foreign ministry, the Quai d'Orsay, was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup.|$|E
25|$|The theatre of Burkina Faso {{combines}} traditional <b>Burkinabè</b> {{performance with}} the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people {{to produce a}} distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with masks. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by French theatre. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by forum theatre aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the impact on}} Burkina Faso of eliminating tariffs on imports from the EU under EPAs, considering trade, revenue and welfare effects. At complete elimination of tariffs on all products imports from trade classification sections (TDC 01 - 13) from the EU. Burkina Faso is likely to experience both welfare gains and losses depending on the values of imports of each trade classification section in question. The overall welfare effect relative to GDP tends to be very small and positive, but potential tariff revenue losses are enormous even when the country has up to fifteen - twenty-five years in which to implement the tariff reductions, unless with scope for tax substitution. EPAs effects are concentrated on those product sections where trade creation outweighs trade diversion such as Animal products, Vegetable products, Animal/Veg. products, Mineral products, and Textiles products. Besides, product sections with the greatest market opportunities for EU suppliers to displace {{any of the other}} suppliers, ECOWAS and/or ROW include sections where trade diversion outweighs trade creation effects, such as prepared foodstuffs, product of chemicals, plastics, raw hides & skin, etc. The sensitive products (SPs) to be excluded from tariff removal should include sections in which ECOWAS member nations are suppliers to regional importers so that excluding them as SPs would improve the welfare gain compared to estimates where tariff are removed from those products in which ECOWAS have zero potential. The results at this level of aggregation will provide useful information to the on-going negotiations between ECOWAS and the EU in determining <b>Burkinabe's</b> products to be exempted from tariff removal during EPAs based on the severity of the effects on varied trade classification (TDC) sections, among other considerations...|$|R
40|$|As is {{the case}} in many {{developing}} countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, a very large fraction of young individuals stop going to school very early in life and transition into the labor force. In fact, according to the 2003 Survey of Household Living Conditions (SHLS), around 20 % of young <b>Burkinabes</b> aged 6 – 11 are reported to be illiterate and over 60 % of those aged 10 – 11 report having no schooling at all. Obvious concerns then are to assess how those young people perform in the labor force, to study how their fortunes evolve through time, and to compare their labor market outcomes to those of more educated individuals. At the same time, {{it would be useful to}} assess how the households in which those young individuals live fare generally in terms of relative poverty or in terms of changing economic circumstances so as to be able to identify potential causal mechanisms linking household characteristics and youth outcomes.

25|$|The {{music of}} Burkina Faso {{includes}} the folk music of 60 different ethnic groups. The Mossi people, centrally located around the capital, Ouagadougou, account for 40% {{of the population}} while, to the south, Gurunsi, Gurma, Dagaaba and Lobi populations, speaking Gur languages {{closely related to the}} Mossi language, extend into the coastal states. In the north and east the Fulani of the Sahel preponderate, while in the south and west the Mande languages are common; Samo, Bissa, Bobo, Senufo and Marka. <b>Burkinabé</b> traditional music has continued to thrive and musical output remains quite diverse. Popular music is mostly in French: Burkina Faso has yet to produce a major pan-African success.|$|E
