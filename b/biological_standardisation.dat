40|$|Biological {{diversity}} is an abstract, scientific concept and both evaluating its condition and, to great extent, justifying its conservation requires expert knowledge. Accordingly, regulating and managing <b>biological</b> diversity presupposes <b>standardisation</b> and methods for managing uncertainty. To be acted on, the concept must be promoted, passing, in this process, through various institutions, such as intergovernmental organisations and national administrations. This paper examines how {{the principle of}} biological diversity conservation is defined, focusing on the values of biological diversity and how this notion has 'travelled the world'. The paper includes a study of how the principle of biological diversity was applied in a specific case of insect control in Sweden. biological diversity, intrinsic value, instrumental value, sustainable development, insect control,...|$|R

40|$|A {{collaborative}} study involving nine independent assays by eight laboratories has recalibrated the anti-D {{concentration of the}} International Reference Preparation of Anti-D Immunoglobulin (68 / 417) {{in terms of the}} International Standard for Anti-Rho (anti-D) Incomplete Blood Typing Serum (64 / 16). This study was carried out when it was found that 68 / 419 had been calibrated not against 64 / 16, as originally intended, but inadvertently against another preparation. Based on the results, a revised rounded off value of 300 IU anti-D per ampoule of 68 / 419 was assigned by the Expert Committee on <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> of WHO at its 30 th meeting.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{candidate}} preparations {{of human}} sequence recombinant Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) were formulated and lyophilized at NIBSC prior to evaluation in a collaborative study for their suitability {{to serve as}} a replacement international standard. The preparations were tested by eight laboratories using in vitro bioassays and immunoassays. The candidate preparation 86 / 500 was judged suitable {{to serve as a}} replacement international standard based on the data obtained for activity and stability. On the basis of the results reported here, the preparation coded 86 / 500 was established by the WHO Expert Committee on <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> (ECBS) in 2012 as the WHO 2 nd IS for human IL- 2 with an assigned value for IL- 2 activity of 210 IU/ampoule.

40|$|A {{collaborative}} study {{was run by}} the <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> Programme (BSP) {{under the aegis of}} the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM, Council of Europe) and the European Union (EU) Commission, to address the issue of the poor standardisation of serological assays used for the evaluation of seasonal influenza vaccines in Europe. The Phase 1 of the study focused on the compliance to Commitee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) criteria by 6 manufacturers and 5 public laboratories. It confirmed the poor inter-laboratory correlation of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test results. Phase 2 consisted in a reproducibility study examining the impact of extended method standardisation and the use of reference sera on inter-laboratory variation. Six manufacturers and 5 public laboratories contributed HI results, while the 5 public laboratories also performed single radial haemolysis (SRH) tests on the same sample panels. Results showed that method standardisation failed to significantly improve the inter-laboratory variation. Correction for pre-vaccination titres (Beyer correction) was found to have limited effect to improve the bias constituted by the Protection Rate (PR) criterion. The reasons underlying the difficulty in standardization of HI and SRH tests are discussed and improved approaches for the compliance testing to CHMP criteria are suggested...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVariability in viral load {{measurements}} using {{nucleic acid}} amplification techniques (NAT) {{has a significant}} impact on the management of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) -associated diseases, and has highlighted a need for standardisation of these measurements. The aim of this collaborative study was to evaluate the suitability of a range of candidate reference materials to harmonise EBV viral load measurements in a wide range of NAT assays. Candidate materials included lyophilised and liquid whole virus preparations of the EBV B 95 - 8 strain, and preparations of Namalwa and Raji cells. Variability between the individual laboratory mean estimates for each candidate was 2. 5  log 10 copies/mL. The agreement between laboratories was improved when the potency of each candidate was expressed relative to the lyophilised B 95 - 8 preparation. The results of the study indicate the suitability of this candidate as the 1 st WHO International Standard for EBV for NAT. It was established in October 2011 by the WHO's Expert Committee on <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> with an assigned potency of 5  ×  106 International Units (IU) (NIBSC code 09 / 260). It is intended to be used for the calibration of secondary reference materials, used in EBV NAT assays, in IU, thereby improving the comparability of patient viral load measurements...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) core antigen and RNA in serum samples {{leads to a}} highly variable ratio of both. It {{is not clear whether}} {{this is due to the}} inaccuracy of RNA quantification or whether both are independent parameters in a certain range. We established a real-time reverse transcription (RT) -PCR for HCV RNA that combines very high sensitivity with a large dynamic range and minimal standard deviations. The assay was calibrated with the first international standard, 96 / 790, and the international genotype panel for HCV from the National Institute of <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> and Control. A linear readout was obtained between 200 and 5 × 107 IU/ml. The detection limit was 80 IU/ml, the reproducibility was < 0. 05 log, and the standard error within one run was < 0. 01. Comparison of the method with the Roche Monitor competitive RT-PCR revealed its high accuracy. The core protein concentration was determined within a range from 1. 5 to 400 pg/ml by using the preliminary trak-C assay from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. Correlating the HCV RNA levels with core antigen concentrations in 197 serum samples from 23 interferon-treated patients, a average ratio of 7, 900 IU of HCV RNA per pg of core antigen was estimated, but the variability of this ratio exceeded largely the variability of the two assays, ranging from 50 to 20, 000 IU/pg. Theoretically, HCV should contain ca. 43, 000 IU of RNA/pg core. In conclusion, the core antigen assay seems to detect, in addition to complete virions, RNA-free core protein structures, which enhances its sensitivity (98 % in this group). The variable ratio of RNA and core protein is not mainly due to standard deviations of quantification but could be an additional parameter for treatment follow-up and state of viral replication...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Characteristics of the T 4 and T 3 {{radioimmunoassay}} kits {{that are}} commercially {{available in the}} UK are described. Useful comparative data and criticism are given about many of these kits. Some unacceptable variation in accuracy is demonstrated. An expanding variety of basically similar reagents for radioassay procedures is becoming commercially available. It seems that this profusion ofmanufactur-ing sources is causing some clinical scientists to doubt the reliability of certain 'kit ' procedures. However, we believe that selected immunoassay reagents manufactured outside the district hospital or area laboratory will have a useful and fairly permanent place in the laboratory, exactly as bulk reagents for automated analysis have at present. A recent World Health Organisation report on <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> states 'it would be desirable to adopt a national scheme for the licensing of all reagents used [...] . this would include the registration of kits and reagents, and release of batches only {{on the recommendation of}} the national Received for publication 20 April 1976 centre [...] ' The report (World Health Organisation 1975) {{goes on to say that}} while peripheral labora-tories would do the more 'frequently needed assays eg, h-PL, some steroids, T 4 [...] ., a peripheral laboratory would only rarely do its own labelling of antigens'. We doubt whether it would be wise or practical to single out reagents for binding assay and cytochemical bioassay systems from all the other reagents used in medical diagnosis-for registration and approval. However, there will always be a need for information about the purity of reagents, and ease and comparability of analyses performed with them, to suggest the better and best 'buys'.

40|$|Background Bacterial {{contamination}} of platelet concentrates (PCs) still remains {{a significant problem}} in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. The International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases, Subgroup on Bacteria, organised an international study on Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria References {{to be used as}} a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. Material and Methods Four Bacteria References (Staphylococcus epidermidis PEI-B- 06, Streptococcus pyogenes PEI-B- 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae PEI-B- 08 and Escherichia coli PEI-B- 19) were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in PCs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in PCs after low spiking (0 3 and 0 03 CFU/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. Results Bacteria References were correctly identified in 98 % of all 52 identifications. S. pyogenes and E. coli grew in PCs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. The results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95 % confidence intervals were for S. epidermidis: 1. 19 - 1. 32 x 10 (7) CFU/ml, S. pyogenes: 0. 58 - 0. 69 x 10 (7) CFU/ml, K. pneumoniae: 18. 71 - 20. 26 x 10 (7) CFU/ml and E. coli: 1. 78 - 2. 10 x 10 (7) CFU/ml. Conclusion The study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in PCs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. These aims were successfully fulfilled. The WHO Expert Committee <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first Repository for Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria Reference Strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repositor...|$|E
40|$|The {{potency of}} {{allergen}} extracts is determined as total allergenic activity without consideration of their composition and the units differ from one manufacturer to another, making {{it very difficult}} to compare the different products. Recently, purified major allergens have been obtained by recombinant DNA technology and produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. In principle, such recombinant allergens could be established as reference standards and could help for the standardisation of the major allergen content of allergen extracts. Two recombinant major allergens, one from birch pollen, rBet v 1, and one from Timothy grass pollen, Phl p 5 a, have been selected {{at the end of the}} CREATE programme as a potential starting point for the establishment as European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) Reference Standards through a project run by the <b>Biological</b> <b>Standardisation</b> Programme (BSP) of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM). To this end, bulk candidate recombinant materials, produced under GMP conditions, were procured from two European manufacturers and subsequently formulated and lyophilised. Four ELISA systems from three different manufacturers were included in the project, two for Bet v 1 and two for Phl p 5 a with the aim of establishing reference methods for determination of the respective major antigens both in natural allergen extracts as well as in recombinant allergen products. The project was run in 3 phases: a preparatory and preliminary testing phase (feasibility phase or Phase 1), an extended feasibility phase carried out in 3 laboratories (Phase 2) to confirm the transferability of the methods and an international collaborative study with a large number of participating laboratories (Phase 3). This article describes the work done in Phase 1 and Phase 2, i. e. the physico-chemical and biological characterisation of the recombinant candidate reference standards, the assessment of their suitability for the intended purpose as well as the evaluation of the candidate ELISA systems. The results show that both candidate reference standards are suitable for the intended purpose. In addition, three out of the four ELISA systems that were included in the preliminary phase were found to be appropriate for further evaluation in the collaborative study which was organised in 2011. The results of the collaborative study will be published separatel...|$|E
