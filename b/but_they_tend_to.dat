5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> settle off the island permanently.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group tolerate the other <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E

Fleischer devised an improvement in animation through a combined projector and easel for tracing images from live action film. This device, known as a rotoscope, enabled Fleischer to produce the first realistic animation since the initial works of Winsor McCay. Although his patent was granted in 1917, Max and his brothers Joe and Dave Fleischer made their first series of tests between 1914 and 1916.|$|R
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be high in tannins {{which makes them}} bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) {{and those of the}} European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> spoil quickly.|$|E

50|$|Calvert {{acted in}} various ways to {{restrain}} {{the influence of the}} Protestant majority. In 1670 he restricted suffrage to men who owned 50 acre or more, or held property worth more than 40 pounds. He also restricted election to Maryland's House of Delegates to those who owned at least 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land. In 1676 he directed the voters to return half as many delegates to the assembly, two instead of four.

25|$|Despite their name, rare-earth {{elements}} are – {{with the exception}} of the radioactive promethium – relatively plentiful in Earth's crust, with cerium being the 25th most abundant element at 68 parts per million, or as abundant as copper. They are not especially rare, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> occur together in nature and are difficult to separate from one another. However, because of their geochemical properties, rare-earth {{elements are}} typically dispersed and not often found concentrated as rare-earth minerals in economically exploitable ore deposits. The first such mineral discovered was gadolinite, a mineral composed of cerium, yttrium, iron, silicon and other elements. This mineral was extracted from a mine in the village of Ytterby in Sweden; four of the rare-earth elements bear names derived from this single location.|$|E

25|$|Jewish cuisines {{vary widely}} {{depending}} on their regions of origin, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be broadly categorized into Sephardi (Iberian and North African), Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and Central Asian) and Ashkenazi (Eastern and Central European) families. Still, there is significant overlap, between the different cuisines, as Jews have often migrated great distances and as different regions where Jews have settled (e.g. Southeastern Europe) {{have been influenced by}} different cultures over time. For example, Balkan Jewish cuisine contains both Ashkenazi / European and Sephardic-Turkish influences, as this part of Europe (up to the borders of present-day Austria and Poland) was for a time part of the Ottoman Empire. Since the rise of Ashkenazi Jewish migration to 19th-Century Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel, increased contact between Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jews has led to a rising importance of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine amongst Jews of all ethnicities.|$|E
25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{children}} from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education {{are more likely}} to graduate from high school, attend college, hold a job and have higher earnings. In 2010, the U.S. ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education. Gains in enrollment stalled after 2010, as did growth in funding, due to budget cuts arising from the Great Recession. Per-pupil spending in state-funded programs declined by 12% after inflation since 2010. The U.S. differs from other countries in that it funds public education primarily through sub-national (state and local) taxes. The quality of funding for public education varies based on the tax base of the school system, with significant variation in local taxes and spending per pupil. Better teachers also raise the educational attainment and future earnings of students, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> migrate to higher income school districts. Among developed countries, 70% of 3-year-olds go to preschool, versus 38% in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Lancelot is Morgan's prime {{object of}} sexual desire but he {{consistently}} refuses her obsessive advances {{due to his}} great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan either courts, drugs, enchants and imprisons the knight on several occasions. One tale has Lancelot captured in Cart Castle (Charyot) by her and two other lustful enchantress, Queen Sebile (Sedile) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan, each of whom wants to make him her lover, but he refuses to choose and escapes with a help {{of one of their}} maidservants, Rocedon. Sebile and Morgan are close companions, working their magic together, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Lancelot's brother Sir Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century Prophesies de Merlin; a resulting contest between them is won by Nimue with a help from Merlin. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored as usual. Morgan's other allies in Prophecies include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake. Sometimes she is successful, such as when she sends Lucifer {{in the guise of a}} dragon against Sir Segurant.|$|E

His reanalysis of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848 showed that the actual rate of the precession disagreed from that predicted from Newton's theory by 38″ (arc seconds) per tropical century (later re-estimated at 43″ by [...] Simon Newcomb in 1882). A number of ad hoc and ultimately unsuccessful solutions were proposed, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> introduce more problems.|$|R
50|$|The early skaffie boats {{located on}} the Stotfield beach were small with rounded stems and raked sterns. They were two-masted with a tall dipping lug sail and a mizzen sail. Their short keel gave them good {{manoeuvrability}} in good weather, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be unstable in bad weather. They were usually crewed by around six people. Above all, though, they were light enough to be hauled up on to the beaches. The boats were un-decked and provided no shelter for the crew. Because of {{the vulnerability of the}} boats, they stayed only a few miles out to sea {{in full view of the}} land.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the larvae}} reach their maximum size, {{metamorphosis}} occurs. Sexual maturity is reached in this species at {{three to four}} years old. The adults and juveniles tend to be restricted to the stream edges, hiding under rocks and other debris during the day. Seasonal migration does occur, but not all individuals undertake them. Research done in Quebec suggests a postbreeding migration into the forest occurs in June. These adult salamanders may move over 100 m from the stream. The second migration is that of the newly metamorphosed juveniles leaving the stream, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> remain closer to it. About 75% of individuals dispersing over 100 m into the forest did not return, and they were believed to have been consumed by predators. The majority of above-ground movements are made after dark and in wet weather. The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after dark, when they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the stream bank or forest floor. Food items recorded include wood roaches, arachnids, worms, isopods, millipedes, beetles, snails, springtails, flies, hymenopterans, sowbugs, mayflies, annelids, stonefly nymphs, and thrips and rarely trout fry. Adult population densities are variable by habitat quality. Adults are also territorial, so if resources are scarce, the population is less dense. In some populations, densities are as low as 0.02-0.04 animals/m2. In other areas, localized densities can be as high as 11 individuals /m2. Adults overwinter up to 80cm deep into the soil of the stream bank in cold climates, but may remain somewhat active in southern regions, and may continue feeding during this period.|$|E

500|$|If the Earth were a {{non-rotating}} planet, {{solar heating}} would cause winds across the mid-latitudes {{to blow in}} a poleward direction, away from the subtropical ridge. [...] However, the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of Earth causes winds to steer {{to the right of}} what would otherwise be expected across the Northern Hemisphere, and left of what would be expected in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] This is why winds across the Northern Hemisphere tend to blow from the southwest, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] When pressures are lower over the poles, the strength of the westerlies increases, which has the effect of warming the mid-latitudes. [...] This occurs when the Arctic oscillation is positive, and during winter low pressure near the poles is stronger than it would be during the summer. [...] When it is negative and pressures are higher over the poles, the flow is more meridional, blowing {{from the direction of the}} pole towards the equator, which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes.|$|E
