5|$|After {{a strong}} {{start to the}} {{following}} season for both club and player, Jarvis injured his hamstring in the defeat to Reading on 30 September 2008 and was expected to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for approximately six weeks. He made his return in the 1–0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers on 6 December, and remained a first choice player as the club won promotion to the Premier League as champions.|$|E

He then broke his tibia in a Club World Cup match in Yokohama against Al Sadd. Doctors said he was to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action {{for up to six}} months, but this {{eventually}} led to him missing the entire 2011–12 season with both Barcelona and the Spanish football team at Euro 2012.|$|E
5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer. However, he thought that success would also lead his 13 players who would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> contract, to demand more money for a renewal.|$|E

5|$|An 86th-minute {{equaliser}} from McBreen gave York a 1–1 draw {{at home to}} Salisbury City, which {{maintained the}} team's unbeaten record at Bootham Crescent. Parslow signed a new contract with the club, and Rotherham midfielder Peter Holmes joined on a one-month loan. A second defeat of the season came after losing 2–0 away to Kidderminster, Brian Smikle and Justin Richards scoring for the home team. Beadle was released by the club {{towards the end of}} his loan spell at Whitby, due to him looking for regular first-team football. This was followed by the departure of Bore, who returned to Grimsby from his loan spell early. A 3–3 draw away against Stevenage was achieved after the team were 2–0 down after 19 minutes, with the York goals coming from Sodje, Holmes and Farrell. Sodje picked up a hamstring injury during this match, meaning he would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for four to six weeks.|$|E

5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A second source states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout the entire day), for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a serious German technical failure in air-to-air communication.|$|E

5|$|Campbell {{made his}} return to {{training}} in March 2011. Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered a recurrence of the ligament injury in the same knee {{in preparation for a}} match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of action {{for the remainder of the}} 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season. Though he was proposed to return in March 2012, Steve Bruce revealed that Campbell was in the frame to return to action around Christmas time – three months ahead of schedule.|$|E
40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the loop}} <b>is</b> {{a form of}} partial ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether the feeling of failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop can be eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless <b>of</b> who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R

5|$|In June, Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (the unified {{version of}} the World Tag Team Championship from the Raw brand and the WWE Tag Team Championship from the SmackDown brand) with Chris Jericho at The Bash after he and Jericho were {{inserted}} into what was originally a match between reigning champions The Colóns and Legacy. The win made Edge a record setting 12 time World Tag Team Champion. On July 3, Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon while competing at a live event in San Diego in a match against Jeff Hardy, and later underwent surgery. It was reported that he could <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action {{for up to a}} year. During Edge's absence, Jericho replaced him with Big Show (forming Jeri-Show) and Jericho began to speak badly of Edge, mocking him for his injury.|$|E

Kim and Havok brawled on the following edition of Impact Wrestling. In September, Kim injured her shoulder during a pre-match brawl with Havok.

The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E
5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E
