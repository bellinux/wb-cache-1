5|$|The {{two major}} {{evacuation}} points chosen for Operation Frequent Wind were the DAO Compound adjacent to Tan Son Nhut Airport for American and Vietnamese civilian evacuees, and the US Embassy, Saigon for Embassy staff. The {{plan for the}} evacuation included buses positioned at 28 buildings throughout metropolitan Saigon designated as pick-up points, with American civilian <b>bus</b> <b>drivers</b> standing by at those buildings. The buses would follow one of four planned evacuation routes from downtown Saigon to the DAO Compound, each route named after a Western Trail: Santa Fe, Oregon, Texas, etc.|$|E
5|$|International District/Chinatown station, {{the southernmost}} tunnel station, is {{partially}} open-air and located immediately below a public plaza at Union Station. The station has connections to Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail at King Street Station a block to the west, accessible through the Weller Street Bridge, {{as well as}} the First Hill Streetcar on Jackson Street, stopping east of 5th Avenue South. Other attractions near the station include CenturyLink Field to the west and Uwajimaya a block to the southeast. South of the station, the light rail tracks, and bus lanes are separated by railway signals at an underground bus layover and staging area next to the tunnel comfort room for <b>bus</b> <b>drivers.</b> The southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of Airport Way and 5th Avenue South at the western terminus of the Interstate 90 express lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. Light rail trains and southbound buses continue from the tunnel in separated lanes on the SODO Busway, while eastbound buses use a ramp that merges with the Interstate 90 express lanes that will be retrofitted for the East Link light rail service in 2023.|$|E

The <b>bus</b> <b>driver's</b> wife will soon fall for her boss according to the future displayed by the time machines. Steven tells the <b>driver</b> that the <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> should not worry, as the future may not happen. Steven, of course, does not really believe this. He believes the future is unchangeable. The <b>bus</b> <b>driver,</b> angry and cynical, tells Steven the same can happen to Steven's own future. Steven is easily swayed into believing his future may not come either. Steven is also growing impatient {{because he has a}} long time to wait before Bryony will become a woman. When Steven discovers that Bryony's family is selling their home and moving away he is frantic. He will never meet Bryony if the family moves away.|$|R

40|$|There {{are likely}} to be {{individual}} differences in <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> behaviour when adhering to strict schedules under time pressure. A reliable and valid assessment of these individual differences would be useful for bus companies keen to mitigate risk of crash involvement. This paper reports on three studies to develop and validate a self-report measure of <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> behaviour. For study 1, two principal components analyses of a pilot questionnaire revealed six components describing <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> behaviour and four <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> coping components. In study 2, test-retest reliability of the components were tested in a sub-sample and found to be adequate. Further, the 10 components were used to predict bus crash involvement at three levels of culpability with consistently significant associations found for two components. For study 3, avoidance coping was consistently associated with celeration variables in a bus simulator, especially for a time-pressured drive. Statement of Relevance:The instrument can be used by <b>bus</b> companies for <b>driver</b> stress and fatigue management training to identify at-risk <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> behaviour. Training to reduce the tendency to engage in avoidance coping strategies, improve evaluative coping strategies and hazard monitoring when under stress may improve <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> safety...|$|R
25|$|There is also {{evidence}} from OHP that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. For example, Kompier {{and his colleagues}} have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in <b>bus</b> <b>drivers</b> has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.|$|E

25|$|The student {{movement}} began to coalesce after the government's assault on Vocational School #5, which {{marked the first}} major infringement on student autonomy. The movement began to gain support from students outside the capital and from other segments of society, which continued to build until that October. Students formed brigadas (brigades), groups of six or more students who distributed leaflets about the issues in the streets, markets, and most often on public buses. These parochial organizations, the smallest units of the CNH, decided the scope and issues which the {{student movement}} would take up. These included both rural and urban concerns. The brigadistas would board buses {{to speak to the}} passengers about the government's corruption and repression, while others distributed leaflets and collected donations. Eventually, the passengers and <b>bus</b> <b>drivers</b> began to sympathize with the students’ demands for democracy and justice, and the students collected increasing amounts of money. But the aggressive militancy among the students began to disillusion some <b>bus</b> <b>drivers</b> about the students’ motives, and they suspected the youths of seeking power for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the first}} week of service the bus network had seen high usage. Some of the buses, which have a maximum {{capacity}} of 45 passengers, only had room for standing left. Some <b>bus</b> <b>drivers</b> reported as many as 100 passengers on a bus at one time. Due to the new, zero-fare bus service success, many taxi drivers were losing business. Taxi drivers have seen a considerable decrease in the demand for taxis while lines were forming for the buses.|$|E

As the Rabbi is waiting, an Israeli <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> {{approaches}} the gates of heaven. Without a second thought, the angel who was consulting with God let the <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> through. The Rabbi points at the <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> and yells, [...] "Hey! How come he gets in so quickly? He's a simple <b>bus</b> <b>driver,</b> while I'm a Rabbi!" [...] The angel explains, [...] "Dear Rabbi, you don't understand. When you would be giving your sermon during the prayer services, your whole congregation would fall asleep. When this <b>bus</b> <b>driver</b> drove towards Tel Aviv, all his passengers would be at the edge of their seats praying to God!" ...|$|R

25|$|In 1900, Montgomery {{had passed}} a city {{ordinance}} to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats {{to achieve that}} goal.
