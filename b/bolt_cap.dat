40|$|Purpose. The work {{sets forth}} the search results of new, more {{efficient}} design solutions for metal silos, namely, {{the analysis of}} existing types of profiles cross-section in a steel wall of such silo and development of less material-intensive section of corrugated profile. Methodology. To achieve the set goal there were researched the existing types of capacitive structure profiles and their strain-stress state under the load. The analysis {{was performed on the}} results of computational experiments. The prototype object was mathematical computer models. The calculations were made using the finite-element method. For computational experiment there was used the design-computing system Structure CAD for Windows. Findings. In this work there were obtained the data allowing to assess work of the profiles and to find more effective type of cross-section in terms of its material consumption. In the process of joint study of the authors a new type of profile for capacitive structures was developed; it has higher utilization efficiency and the attachment point of individual steel sheets with this type of profile. Both solutions are easy to install, reliable in operation and can be manufactured in the conditions of modern industrial production using standard equipment, materials and components. Originality. A new type of corrugated profile cross-section for steel silo walls was proposed; it has higher load carrying capacity and rigidity and allows reducing the metal thickness without changing the structure carrying capacity that results in material consumption reduction of the whole structure. For this and similar types of profiles there was designed and proposed the attachment point of individual corrugated sheets screwed with extending flange, which enables the unit connection in case of small size corrugations, where the distance is not sufficient to accommodate the <b>bolt</b> <b>cap</b> between the individual corrugations. Practical value. Application of the proposed solutions can increase efficiency, manufacturability and maintainability of steel silo wall structures. The results obtained during the research show promise for further development of research on finding new and more economic solutions for corrugated steel silo wall design, as well as other ways to reduce material consumption of bulk material storage structures...|$|E

50|$|To {{apply the}} {{right-hand}} rule, place one's loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing {{in the direction}} one wants the screw, nut, <b>bolt,</b> or <b>cap</b> ultimately to move, and the curl of the fingers, from the palm to the tips, will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw, nut, <b>bolt</b> or <b>cap</b> to achieve the desired result. Almost all threaded objects obey this rule {{except for a few}} left-handed exceptions described below.|$|R
50|$|Typical nuts, screws, <b>bolts,</b> bottle <b>caps,</b> and jar lids are {{tightened}} (moved {{away from}} the observer) clockwise and loosened (moved towards the observer) counterclockwise {{in accordance with the}} right-hand rule.|$|R
50|$|Tightening a {{threadless}} headset requires {{tightening the}} preload <b>bolt</b> (or <b>cap</b> <b>bolt)</b> in the <b>cap</b> {{on the top}} of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star nut driven down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset bearing cups. The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to turn smoothly without binding or excessive friction.|$|R

Moving parts also {{do not include}} any mechanical locks, switches, nuts and <b>bolts,</b> screw <b>caps</b> for bottles etc. A system with no moving parts is described as [...] "solid state".|$|R

50|$|Changes to {{the diesel}} engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, {{in line with}} the updated Defender models. This {{electronically}} managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross <b>bolted</b> <b>caps,</b> different con rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK). ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.|$|R
50|$|The blocks are all {{strongly}} {{made using}} cast iron with large interconnected main bearing cradles and two <b>bolt</b> main bearing <b>caps.</b> Forged steel crankshafts, and cast iron main bearing support girdles became standard with the 3VZ-FE. Piston and ring construction are typical parts, with rods varying between large and very large for stock V6 production engines.|$|R

50|$|Work {{hardening}} may {{be desirable}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} context. An example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes of a cutter inadvertently work-harden the workpiece surface, causing damage to the cutter during the later passes. Certain alloys {{are more prone to}} this than others; superalloys such as Inconel require machining strategies that take it into account. An example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape change. These processes are known as cold working or cold forming processes. They are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature below its recrystallization temperature, usually at ambient temperature. Cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing. Applications include the heading of <b>bolts</b> and <b>cap</b> screws and the finishing of cold rolled steel. In cold forming, metal is formed at high speed and high pressure using tool steel or carbide dies. The cold working of the metal increasing the hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.|$|R
5000|$|With {{threadless}} stems, a [...] "star-nut" [...] {{is driven}} {{down into the}} threadless steerer tube and {{held in place by}} two barbed flanges. The top <b>cap</b> <b>bolts</b> into, and pulls against, the star-nut, thereby preloading the headset bearings. (See: photograph of Star-nut) Newer model forks, with carbon fiber steerer tubes, use an expander plug instead of a star nut, which once installed serves the same purpose as the star nut, but will not damage carbon fiber forks as a starnut will (by design a star-nut digs into the surrounding tube, which, while safe with aluminum, can weaken carbon fiber to the point of failure).|$|R

50|$|January 17, 1989 KFMY, PA-32-300, N4763T, Injuries: 1 Minor. The pilot {{stated that}} during the initial climb after takeoff, he heard a 'pop' & the engine started running rough. He {{turned back toward the}} airport. About 2 min later, there was a loud noise, which was {{followed}} by a progressive loss of all power. Subsequently, the aircraft was damaged during an emergency landing at night in a marshy area about 1 to 2 mi from the airport. An exam of the engine revealed the #5 connecting rod <b>cap</b> <b>bolt</b> had failed, which resulted in further damage of the engine. Probable cause: Failure of the #5 connecting rod bolt. Factors related to the accident were: Dark night and the soft and wet (marshy) terrain conditions in the emergency landing area.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{although}} {{rated at}} five litres and , was specially made to withstand racing conditions. The block was specially cast and crankcase was fitted with four <b>bolt</b> main bearing <b>caps.</b> The heads were revised with high-flow intake ports and roller rockers. Special connecting rods, crankshafts, and pistons were fitted {{as well as}} a custom exhaust. The key feature though was the fabled Walkinshaw twin throttle body inlet manifold, which had been specially developed for the Group A and featured sequential setup with a smaller and larger throttle body. This was fitted with a restrictor plate on the larger, secondary throttle body, which actually let less air through than the smaller throttle body. Some reports have indicated that as much as 50-60 horsepower can be gained from the removal of the restrictor plates.|$|R
50|$|Up {{to eight}} stories high, the {{building}} occupies {{an entire city}} block. The massively simplified facade of the bank clearly owes something to classicism. Wagner's key idea was to celebrate modern materials by developing new forms. The entire facade is covered with square marble plates. These {{are attached to the}} main brick structure with mortar and ornamented with iron <b>bolts</b> with aluminum <b>caps,</b> which themselves form a pattern. The building's harmonious synthesis between form and functionality was highly acclaimed by critics. The metal rivets do not obstruct the facade but resemble decorative elements. The use of marble also makes the maintenance and cleaning of the facade very easy and inexpensive, another important functional element in Wagner's design. The architect kept the design very minimalistic and simple; his aim was to convey the sense of a strong, impenetrable bank in which customers would know their money was safe.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Chrysler {{offered a}} special Six-Pack {{version of the}} 340 with triple 2-barrel carburetors rated at [...] Gross that was {{specific}} to Challenger TA and Cuda AAR models. This version featured a heavy duty short block with additional webbing to allow for aftermarket installed 4 <b>bolt</b> main bearing <b>caps.</b> The application-specific cylinder heads featured relocated intake pushrod passages with offset rocker arms that allowed the pushrods to be {{moved away from the}} intake ports, which could improve airflow if the pushrod-clearance [...] "hump" [...] was ground away from the intake port by the end user. An aluminum intake manifold mounted three Holley carburetors, and a dual points ignition system was fitted. The best vintage road test data for these cars yielded quarter mile trap speeds of 100 MPH, which suggests roughly 275 [...] "net" [...] HP for a car of that curb weight, using Hale's Trap Speed formula (Peak Flywheel HP = (Trap Speed/234)^3 * race weight.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1960s, Chrysler {{decided to}} adapt the 318 cu.in. small block V8 into a lightweight, high output engine equally suited for drag strip or street {{performance}} use. Its block was bored out to 4.04 in but 3.31 in stroke left unchanged, resulting in the 340 cu in (5.6 L). Anticipating higher loads resulting from racing operation, the engineers fitted a forged shot peened steel crankshaft instead of the cast nodular iron unit used in the 318. This also included shot peened and forged pushrods, connecting rods and pistons. A 4-barrel carburetor was mated to a high-rise, dual plane intake manifold feeding high-flow cylinder heads that are still considered among the best of that era. Its big ports used 2.02 in intake and 1.60 in exhaust valves. An aggressive cam was fitted {{to take advantage of}} the much better breathing top end. 1968 4-Speed cars got an even hotter cam, but it was discontinued for 1969, where both automatic and manual cars shared the same cam. The engine was equipped with hydraulic lifters and two <b>bolt</b> main bearing <b>caps,</b> leading some to initially underestimate the 340's potential. The '68-'71 340's compression ratio was 10.5:1, placing it near the limit of what was possible on pump gasoline during that era. The 340 also used additional heavy-duty parts, such as a double-row roller timing chain and sump-mounted windage tray. Power output was officially stated as [...] Gross for the 4 barrel.|$|R
2500|$|While at Rio, {{the crew}} noticed {{one of the}} engines had {{noticeable}} carbon buildup from being run at low speed during the propaganda flight days earlier. [...] On the return flight from South America, the automatic valve for gas cell 3 stuck open. [...] Gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line. It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew only used the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines [...] (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing <b>cap</b> <b>bolts</b> for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case. The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. [...] With three engines operating at a speed of [...] and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship's pressure altitude.

40|$|This thesis compiles {{information}} {{of a kind}} of bracket named “Trunnion cap” which is used at some of the loaders and trucks that are developed at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro, the information is needed to create a technical guideline for design of new trunnion caps. The thesis is limited to investigate trunnion caps that are used to attach steering cylinders on six different vehicles, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 and ST 1520. It investigates what angles the force generated by the steering cylinders acts from, which varies from a range of 6 to 96 degrees depending on which vehicle and frame it is. The forces generated by the steering cylinder have also been calculated regarding the maximum pressure which is between 21, 5 and 30 MPa for the different vehicles. Any kind of useful information from customers has also been searched partly by asking employees at Atlas Copco customer centres around the world if they are aware of any occasions were trunnion <b>caps</b> or <b>bolts</b> to trunnion <b>caps</b> have broke down. The results indicate that no problems exist today and that old problems had to do with lack of service. Even the internal databases for service reports have been searched for failures that regard parts to trunnion caps but no relevant information was found. The tolerances for the holes in the trunnion caps and to the pins that are assembled to the trunnion caps has also been identified with a result that vary, some assemblies have a tight fitting while others have a loose fitting. Finally has the availability of bolts with property class 8. 8 and 10. 9 been investigated where it has been noticed that the lead time for bolts with property class 8. 8 more often is shorter than it is for bolts with property class 10. 9. Detta examensarbete sammanställer och tar fram information om en typ av fäste som kallas “Trunnion cap” som används på några av de truckar och lastare som utvecklas på Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB i Örebro. Informationen behövs för att skapa en konstruktionsriktlinje för trunnion caps. Arbetet är begränsat till att undersöka de trunnion caps som används vid infästning av styrcylindrar på sex olika fordon, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 och ST 1520. Det undersöker från vilka vinklar kraften som genereras av styrcylindern verkar från. Dessa vinklar verkar inom ett intervall från 6 till 96 grader. Själva kraften har också beräknats med avseende på maximalt styrtryck vilket varierar från 21, 5 till 30 MPa beroende på fordon. Värdefull information från kunder har också eftersökts delvis genom att fråga anställda vid några av Atlas Copcos marknadsbolag runt om i världen om de är medvetna om några tillfällen då trunnion caps eller bultar till trunnion caps har havererat. Svaren på denna fråga tyder på att inga problem existerar idag men att de problem som funnits tidigare berott på bristande service. Även Atlas Copcos interna databaser för servicerapporter har genomsökts på rapporter som rör delar till trunnion caps, dock utan att någon relevant information hittats. Examensarbetet har även sammanställt de toleranser som hålen i trunnion caps:en samt axeln som monteras dit har. Resultatet varierar då några sammanställningar har greppassning medan andra har spelpassning. Slutligen har även tillgängligheten på bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 och 10. 9 undersökts där det har noterats att ledtiden för bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 i allmänhet är kortare än för bultar med hållfasthetsklass 10. 9...|$|R
