5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spirit,</b> and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|After Ingrid's {{apparent}} death, {{her soul}} transfers {{back to her}} original body (a mummified corpse) that is protected in a magical sarcophagus hidden in an alternate dimension. It is revealed that Ingrid possesses a form of immortality; she can return her soul to her original body and recover her strength. While locked in her decaying body, she instructs Sebastian to feed her regularly with blood stolen from Mary {{as a form of}} nourishment. When Sebastian seeks advice from Ingrid on how to form a romantic relationship with the newly resurrected Mary, she tells him to use witchcraft; Sebastian refuses to use magic to force Mary to love him. By drinking Mary's blood, Ingrid gains enough power to possess Mary temporarily and starts to have sex with the Devil. However, she is interrupted by Anne, who kills the Devil's human host and sends him back to hell. Anne announces that she plans to carry the Devil's child, and serve as his queen instead of Ingrid. Despite her attempts to reconnect with her daughter, Ingrid is killed by Anne. Restoring Mary's soul back to her body, Anne destroys Ingrid's <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>spirit</b> permanently.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{building}} two chancels {{is not entirely}} clear. Many scholars {{suggest that there is}} some symbolic significance, such as empire and church, or <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>spirit,</b> but no irrefutable evidence for these theories exists. Others claim that the construction has a functional purpose for ceremonial processions. Whatever the original intent of the double chancel, the eastern chancel came to serve as the location for the mass and the western chancel was reserved for the bishop and pontiffs.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester {{started a}} Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed {{and cared for}} at a charge of one {{shilling}} (five pence a day).

As well as strengthening the character of the killer by heightening their connection with the acausal forces of death and destruction, such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by the ONA, because they remove from society individuals whom the group deems to be worthless human beings. Monette noted that no ONA nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner, but that members had joined the police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing.|$|E

500|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{the first}} theologian in the Reformed tradition, also {{rejected}} {{the view of}} transubstantiation, but he disagreed with Luther by holding that Christ's body is not physically present in the Eucharist. He held, following Augustine, that Christ's whole person (<b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>spirit),</b> is presented to believers in the Eucharist, but that this does not occur by Christ's body being eaten with the mouth. This view has been labeled [...] "mystical real presence", meaning that those who partake have a direct experience of God's presence, or [...] "spiritual real presence" [...] because Christ's presence is by his spirit. Zwingli also {{did not believe that}} the sacrament actually confers the grace which is offered in the sacrament, but that the outer signs of bread and wine testify to that grace and awaken the memory of Christ's death.|$|E
