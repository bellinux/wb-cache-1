50|$|To {{minimise}} {{the effects}} of clogging and particle build-up a <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> system must accommodate approximately 1-5% of the bulk flow as back flush, operating at approximately 6-8 bar. Beyond this range particulates may become fragmented making them difficult {{to be removed from}} the system, and potentially cause fluidisation of the system.|$|E
50|$|Back flush is {{used for}} {{materials}} which are required for the product and have a fixed relationship with it. Depending on how backflushing is implemented in the accounting software being used and depending on organizational rules, the <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> may create error records which need to be analyzed by someone in charge for the cost accounting. One possible reason {{for the creation of}} these error records can be that there is no sufficient book inventory available in the designated <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> location (shop floor). By simply deleting the error record, without working it out, could mean that the costs are not assigned correctly to products and/or even that the expenses in the financial accounting (inventory accounts) are not being recorded. The error record as such, is not a specific consequence of using <b>back</b> <b>flushing.</b> It may exist also when a MES system is being used when no <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> is needed. The {{reason for this is that}} any error in transmitting and/or interpreting the data being sent by the MES system to the ERP system is consigned and needs to be worked out. When using <b>back</b> <b>flushing,</b> any scrap, material usage variance (using more or less than specified in the BOM) or substitution must be reported separately in order to maintain acceptable inventory accuracy. These are typically implemented as unplanned transactions. The downside of unplanned transactions is that they are prone to error. Unplanned inventory transactions must be eliminated and replaced creatively with planned transactions because even a very low percentage of misreported transactions will take inventory accuracy quickly to an unacceptable level. That is why the usage of backflushing is recommended only if 2 conditions are met: low I/O Variation and low Production Lead Times. Without low part I/O variation through low scrap, non-standard usage, and substitution, system inventory levels become unreliable. The exception transactions just cannot come through quickly or accurately enough to tame the beast. Loss of trust in the system occurs. Without short manufacturing lead times, components get moved into production but don’t get relieved right away from the ERP inventory. This leads to confusion. Evident discrepancies between physical and system inventory counts cause frustration and lack of trust in the system. Without accurate and timely inventory levels, internal production plans and external purchase orders cannot be scheduled effectively, leading to inventory shortages and excess inventory. Inventory shortages cause disruptions to the manufacturing schedule, forcing additional setups, forced substitutions, overtime, premium freight charges, missed shipments and lost capacity. Excess inventory increases obsolescence, and consumes precious cash flow and shelf space. Both excess inventory and shortages can indirectly lead to poor quality. A plant cannot cycle-count its way to accurate inventories. Cycle counting is not timely enough to be of benefit. And cycle counts are more likely to introduce errors than to correct them.|$|E

50|$|These {{methods include}} {{stabilizing}} freeze without restricting water flow, such as implementing weirs and ice booms, installing water jets {{to break up}} any accumulation that might occur, and using manual labour to rake away the accumulation. This final method is often not preferred because of high labour costs, cold, wet and late night working conditions. <b>Back</b> <b>flushing</b> is another technology that uses the idea of cancelling out the differential pressure caused by the frazil ice accumulation. This technology creates a high pressure on the downstream side of objects to reverse the differential pressure.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{perpetual}} inventory, backflushing is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At goods receipt the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to Work-In-Process inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the goods receipt of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining quantity of unused material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating work-in-process accounts, backflush costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that backflush costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (stock accounts). It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{handling}} of debris in small hydro power intakes is assessed by evaluating the concept of <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> with a horizontally fixed trash rack. The concept of <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> is to reverse the flow over the trash rack {{for a short period}} of time in order to detach and evacuate clogged debris through a flushing pipe or gate. In this study the concept of <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> with a horizontal trash rack is evaluated for two different designs; a one chamber design and a two chamber design. The one chamber design is based on H. Brekke?s conceptual idea. The two chamber design is also based on H. Brekke?s idea but it is also inspired by Bergedammen. Bergedammen is an intake designed with two chambers making it possible to continue power production while <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> one chamber at the time. The efficiency of <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> as well as the hydraulic performance during normal operation is mainly evaluated using numerical modelling and a CFD-software. The concept of <b>back</b> <b>flushing,</b> general intake hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is covered by the literature study in this thesis. The evaluation of the <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> concept is initiated by a physical demonstration model with two chambers. The demonstration model is built and tested for flushing efficiency and performance during normal operation. The following numerical tests are performed on 4 different model designs. The first model illustrates a full scale one chamber design. The second model illustrates a full scale two chamber design. The third model is identical to the demonstration model. The forth model is designed as a result of the demonstration model and the previous numerical models, where important model parameters were identified. The important model parameters for effective flushing and hydraulic performance during normal operation is identified as the height of the weir, the vertical position of the trash rack, the length of the model and the amount of water available for flushing. The numerical analyses evaluate the flushing efficiency by assessing the velocity distribution over the trash rack. The hydraulic performance of the models during normal operation is evaluated by assessing streamlines, head loss and turbulent kinetic energy levels (TKE) by the outlet. During flushing the most important parameter is the height between the top of the weir and the trash rack. A high weir results in an even velocity distribution over the trash rack. A low weir results in uneven velocities with higher velocities along the weir. During normal production the length of the model and the height of the weir are important parameters affecting both the total head loss and TKE-values. The results achieved by the numerical modelling should be validated, as further research, on a scale model designed and built in the lab. The test program for the scale model is presented in this study. </p...|$|E

Thus, loss of low-boiling compounds relative to water was greatest on Tenax GC and limited {{the use of this}} polymer for quantitative study of samples containing low-boiling volatile compounds. The residual water in Porapak Q precolumns employed in the usual procedure for collection of volatile materials by entrainment from aqueous systems, could be completely eluted in 15 min with a N₂ purge of 30 ml/min at 55 °C. without appreciable loss of collected organic compounds. Retention times of high-boiling organic compounds were determined on the precolumns, and those containing Tenax GC had shorter times than Chromosorb 102 or Porapak Q. Under conditions employed for unloading trapped compounds from precolumns, fewer compounds remained on Tenax GC precolumns. Thus, Tenax GC appeared to be the trapping polymer of choice in investigations involving high-boiling compounds. <b>Back</b> <b>flushing</b> of Porapak Q, Chromosorb 102, and Tenax GC precolumns during unloading was essential in order to recover the trapped organics within the time allotted for unloading at 135 °C.

However, as pressure on time increases, farmers are faced with 3 options: (1) adjust the milking routine to suit the time available, (2) undertake the task less thoroughly, or (3) examine which elements of the milking routine can be automated and substitute capital expenditure for labor. A study was undertaken on 5 farms in the United Kingdom in October and November 2007 to assess the effect on milking time of installing a commercial automatic postmilking teat disinfection and cluster <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> system (ADF). Two of the farms recruited for the study were intending to purchase the ADF system in the near future and 3 farms had already invested in the technology The farms ranged in size from 120 to 550 cows and included three 90 degrees rapid exit parlors, a herringbone parlor, and an abreast parlor. All 5 farms were visited for 2 successive milkings before the ADF was installed or disabled, and a detailed time and motion analysis was undertaken. After ADF was installed or the system reactivated, a further 2 rankings were monitored. All monitored farms showed a measurable reduction in milking time after the ADF system was installed. However, the magnitude of the reduction was greater than would be expected by simply removing the elements of postmilking teat disinfection and cluster sanitization.

40|$|Spermatozoa {{are quite}} unique amongst cell types. Although {{produced}} in the testis, both nuclear gene transcription and translation are switched off once the pre-cursor round cell begins to elongate and differentiate into what is morphologically recognized as a spermatozoon. However, the spermatozoon is very immature, having no ability for motility or egg recognition. Both of these events occur once the spermatozoa transit a secondary organ known as the epididymis. During the ~ 12 day passage that it takes for a sperm cell {{to pass through the}} epididymis, post-translational modifications of existing proteins play a pivotal role in the maturation of the cell. One major facet of such is protein phosphorylation. In order to characterize phosphorylation events taking place during sperm maturation, both pure sperm cell populations and pre-fractionation of phosphopeptides must be established. Using <b>back</b> <b>flushing</b> techniques, a method for the isolation of pure spermatozoa of high quality and yield from the distal or caudal epididymides is outlined.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and evaluate preliminary strength measurement techniques for high temperature candle filter ash deposits. The efficient performance of a high temperature gas filtering system is essential for many of the new thermal cycles being proposed for power plants of the future. These new cycles hold the promise of higher thermal efficiency and lower emissions of pollutants. Many of these cycles involve the combustion or gasification of coal to produce high temperature gases to eventually be used in gas turbines. These high temperature gases must be relatively free of particulates. Today, the candle filter appears to be the leading candidate for high temperature particulate removal. The performance of a candle filter depends on the ash deposits shattering into relatively large particles during the pulse cleaning (<b>back</b> <b>flushing)</b> of the filters. These relatively large particles fall into the ash hopper and are removed from the system. Therefore, these 1247 particles must be sufficiently large so that they will not be re-entrained by the gas flow. The shattering process is dictated by the strength characteristics of the ash deposits. Consequently, the {{objective of}} this research is to develop measurements for the desired strength characteristics of the ash deposits. Experimental procedures were developed to measure Young`s modulus of the ash deposit at room temperature and the failure tensile strain of ash deposits from room temperature to elevated temperatures.

Manual injections of 200 μL were made with an external loop, and the samples were loaded on a HotSep Tracy column (Kromasil C 18; 5 x 1 mm (inner diameter (ID)), 5 μm). After a loading time of 3. 5 min the analytes were back flushed from the pre-column and transferred to the separation column, a HotSep Kromasil C 18 column (50 x 0. 3 mm (ID), 3. 5 μm), using an eluent consisting of AcN – H 2 O (gradient) with 20 mM NH 4 +HCOO- and 0. 05 % FA added, delivered at a flow rate of 0. 005 mL/min.
