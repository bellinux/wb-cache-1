The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) has recently been converted into FORTRAN computer code that is compatible with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. The current release of CMAQv 4. 7 includes the temporal allocation of emissions from the <b>Biogenic</b> <b>Emission</b> Inventory System (BEIS) as an in-line module. We compare the algorithmic differences between these two <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> models as a first step to using MEGAN in the CMAQ modeling system.

40|$|Acetone {{may be an}} {{important}} source of reactive odd hydrogen in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. This source of odd hydrogen may affect the concentration of a number of species, including ozone, nitrogen oxides, methane, and others. Traditional, acetone had been considered a by-product of the photochemical oxidation of other species, and had not entered models as a primary emission. However, recent work estimates a global source term of 40 - 60 Tg acetone/year. Of this, 25 % is directly emitted during biomass burning, and 20 % is directly emitted by evergreens and other plants. Only 3 % is due to anthropogenic/industrial emissions. The bulk of the remainder, 51 % of the acetone source, is a secondary product from the oxidation of propane, isobutane, and isobutene. Also, while it is speculated that the oxidation of pinene (a <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission)</b> may also contribute about 6 Tg/year, this term is highly uncertain. Thus, the two largest primary sources of acetone are <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> and biomass burning, with industrial/anthropogenic emissions very small in comparison...|$|E

Important parameters such as the leaf area index are fully determined by the global vegetation model and the influences of light extinction (for isoprene emissions) and leaf age (for isoprene and methanol emissions) are also taken into account. We study the interannual variability of <b>biogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> using the satellite-based climate forcing ISLSCP-II as well as relevant CO 2 atmospheric levels, for the 1983 – 1995 period. Mean global emissions of 460 TgC/yr for isoprene, 117 TgC/yr for monoterpenes, 106 TgC/yr for methanol and 42 TgC/yr for acetone are predicted. The mean global <b>emission</b> of all <b>biogenic</b> compounds is 752 ± 16 TgC/yr with extremes ranging from 717 TgC/yr in 1986 to 778 TgC/yr in 1995, that is a 8. 5 % increase between both.

40|$|Biomass burning is {{a source}} of {{greenhouse}} gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. In addition, biomass burning {{is a source}} of chemically active gases, including carbon monoxide, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and nitric oxide. These gases, along with methane, lead to the chemical production of tropospheric ozone (another greenhouse gas) as well as control the concentration of the hydroxyl radical, which regulates the lifetime of almost every atmospheric gas. Following biomass burning, <b>biogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> of nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, and methane are significantly enhanced. It is hypothesized that enhanced postburn <b>biogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> of these gases are related to fire-induced changes in soil chemistry and/or microbial ecology.

We describe a new relaxed eddy accumulation system combined with a dual-channel gas chromatography - flame ionization detection used for volatile organic compound (VOC) flux measurements in the urban area, focusing {{on the results of}} selected anthropogenic VOCs, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), and biogenic VOCs including isoprene and its oxidation products, methacrolein (MACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). We present diurnal variations of concentrations and fluxes of BTEX, and isoprene and its oxidation products during summer time (May 22 - July 22, 2008) and winter time (January 1 - February 28). The measured BTEX values exhibited diurnal cycles with a morning peak during weekdays related to rush-hour traffic and additional workday daytime flux maxima for toluene and xylenes in summer time. However, in winter time there was no additional workday daytime peaks due mainly to the different flux footprints between the two seasons. A comparison with different EPA National Emission Inventories (NEI) with our summer time flux data suggests potential underestimates in the NEI by a factor of 3 to 5. The mixing ratios and fluxes of isoprene, MACR and MVK were measured during the same time period in summer 2008. The presented results show that the isoprene was affected by both tail-pipe emission sources during the morning rush hours and <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> sources in daytime. The observed daytime mixing ratios of isoprene were much lower than over forested areas, caused by a comparatively low density of isoprene emitters in the tower's footprint area. The average daytime isoprene flux agreed well with emission rates predicted by a temperature and light only emission model (Guenther et al., 1993).

Various emissions and climate conditions with different <b>biogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and domain resolutions were implemented to study the sensitivity of future air quality trends from the impacts of changing <b>biogenic</b> <b>emissions.</b> A comparison of GEOS-Chem and CMAQ was performed to investigate the effect of downscaling on the prediction of future air quality trends. For ozone, the impacts of global climate change are relatively smaller when compared to the impacts of anticipated future emissions reduction, except for the Northeast area, where increasing <b>biogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> due to climate change have stronger positive effects (increases) to the regional ozone air quality. The combination effect from both climate change and emission reductions leads to approximately a 10 % or 5 ppbv decrease of the maximum daily average eight-hour ozone (MDA 8) over the Eastern United States. For PM 2. 5, the impacts of global climate change have shown insignificant effect, where as the impacts of anticipated future emissions reduction account for the majority of overall PM 2. 5 reductions. The annual average 24 -h PM 2. 5 of the future-year condition was found to be about 40 % lower than the one from the present-year condition, of which 60 % of its overall reductions are contributed to by the decrease of SO 4 and NO 3 particulate matters.

The {{first part of this}} article focuses on the development and validation of a simple <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> scheme designed for regional studies. Experimental data sets relative to Boreal, Tropical, Temperate and Mediterranean ecosystems are used to estimate the robustness of the scheme at the canopy scale, and over contrasted climatic and ecological conditions. A good agreement is generally found when comparing field measurements and simulated emission fluxes, encouraging us to consider the model suitable for regional application. Limitations of the scheme are nevertheless outlined as well as further on-going improvements. In {{the second part of the}} article, the emission scheme is used on line in the broader context of a meso-scale atmospheric chemistry model. Dynamically idealized simulations are carried out to study the chemical interactions of pollutant plumes with realistic isoprene emissions coming from a Mediterranean oak forest. Two types of anthropogenic sources, respectively representative of the Marseille (urban) and Martigues (industrial) French Mediterranean sites, and both characterized by different VOC/NOx are considered. For the Marseille scenario, the impact of <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> on ozone production is larger when the forest is situated in a sub-urban configuration (i. e. downwind distance TOWN-FOREST - 1). In this case the enhancement of ozone production due to isoprene can reach + 37 % in term of maximum surface concentrations and + 11 % in term of total ozone production. The impact of <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> decreases quite rapidly when the TOWN-FOREST distance increases. For the Martigues scenario, the biogenic impact on the plume is significant up to TOWN-FOREST distance of 90 km where the ozone maximum surface concentration enhancement can still reach + 30 %. For both cases, the importance of the VOC/NO x ratio in the anthropogenic plume and its evolution when interacting with the forest emission are outlined. In complement to real case studies, this idealized approach can be particularly useful for process and sensitivity studies and constitutes a valuable tool to build regional ozone control strategies...|$|E

The model results are compared with O 3 and isoprene observations from 117 and 9 stations of the EMEP network, respectively. Model computations show that the fire episode altered the O 3 sensitivity in the area. In particular, the fire emissions increased surface O 3 over Northern and Eastern Europe by up to 80 % (40 – 45 ppb).

Isoprene has a short lifetime, and hence {{it is very difficult}} to evaluate its emission estimates against measurements. For this reason, we coupled two isoprene emission models with the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM), and evaluated the simulated background ozone concentrations based on different models for isoprene emissions. In this research, results of using the two global <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> models; GEIA (Global Emissions Inventory Activity) and MEGAN (the global Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) are compared and evaluated. The total annual emissions of isoprene for the year 2006 estimated by using MEGAN is 592 Tg yr− 1 for an extended area of the Northern Hemisphere, which is 21 % higher than that estimated by using GEIA. The overall feature of the emissions from the two models is quite similar, but differences are found mainly in Africa's savannah and in the southern part of North America. Differences in spatial distribution of emission factors are found to be a key source of these discrepancies. In spite of the short life-time of isoprene, a direct evaluation of isoprene concentrations using the two <b>biogenic</b> <b>emission</b> models in DEHM has been made against available measurements in Europe. Results show an agreement between two models simulations and the measurements in general and that the CTM is able to simulate isoprene concentrations.

In contrast, the impact of using GEIA is higher in the Amazon region with more than 8 % higher ozone concentrations compared to that of using MEGAN. Comparing the ozone concentrations obtained by DEHM using the two different isoprene models with measurements from Europe and North America, show an agreement on the hourly, mean daily and daily maximum values.

We also present the first observations of its oxidation products (4 -methoxybenzaldehyde and 4 -methyoxy benzene acetaldehyde) in the ambient atmosphere. Methyl chavicol is a major essential oil component of many plant species. This work suggests that methyl chavicol {{plays a significant role}} in the atmospheric chemistry of Blodgett Forest, and potentially other sites, and should be included explicitly in both biogenic volatile organic carbon emission and atmospheric chemistry models...|$|E
