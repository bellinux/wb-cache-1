5|$|Meanwhile, Jim discovers {{another side}} of Stanley, who {{demonstrates}} uncharacteristic energy and zeal for life. Stanley explains this is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> on vacation.|$|E
5|$|A mutant who is {{friends with}} Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> very {{angry at the}} general public for how they treat the mutant community. He {{has the ability to}} control (although not create) fire. He later joins Magneto and Mystique. The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were {{impressed}} with his performance in Tadpole.|$|E
5|$|Agent Lang visits Mahone {{and offers}} him a deal: {{eight years in}} a St. Louis prison in {{exchange}} for testifying against {{the government in the}} Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.|$|E
5000|$|Johan was {{automatically}} {{nominated by}} Big Brother. <b>He</b> also <b>was</b> {{not allowed to}} nominate <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> immune from being nominated last week <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Africa.|$|R
50|$|The {{first to}} die was Draupadi; she was {{imperfect}} because she preferred Arjuna over her other husbands. Then it <b>was</b> Sahadeva, imperfect <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smug about his knowledge. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> followed by Nakula, imperfect <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> arrogant about his good looks. Then fell Arjuna, imperfect <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always jealous of other archers. Next <b>was</b> Bhima, imperfect <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a glutton. Only the eldest Pandava, Yudhisthira, {{reached the door}} of Swarga Loka, carried on Lord Indra's chariot. On reaching Heaven he did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead he saw Karna, Bhishma, Dronacharya etc. and their sons.|$|R
5000|$|... “We {{request that}} Tom be paid his salary <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> denied an {{opportunity}} to practice his trade <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> injured in an illegal camp of the Steelers, that was {{in violation of the}} NFL Constitution.” ...|$|R
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the player, and partially <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E
5|$|At a New Year's Eve {{party that}} year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side. Harry spends New Year's alone, {{walking around the}} city. As Sally decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and {{declares}} his love for her. She argues {{that the only reason}} he is there is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> lonely, but he lists the many things he realized he loves about her. They kiss and marry three months later.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he?" [...] and Nat {{smiled with}} pleasure, for Demi's regard {{seemed to be}} valued by all the boys, partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Father Bhaer's nephew, and partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> such a sober, {{conscientious}} little fellow.|$|R
60|$|One admission, however, {{will not}} be made, namely, that Michael could not love as devotedly, as wholeheartedly, unselfishly, madly, self-sacrificingly as a human. He did so love--not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Michael, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a dog.|$|R
60|$|When Mr Tapley {{stopped in}} these {{calculations}} in simple addition, he did it, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at all {{tired of the}} exercise, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out of breath. The pause reminded him of other duties.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the medieval}} Trojan tradition, Achilles withdraws from {{fighting}} in the war <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to marry Polyxena. Eventually, {{so many of his}} followers are killed that he decides to rejoin the battle leading to Troilus' death and, in turn, to Hecuba, Polyxena and Paris plotting Achilles' murder.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, House is annoyed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{not able to}} spend enough time with his friend, James Wilson. He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Fox backed John B. Harwood {{over the}} more liberal Russell Bramley for Speaker. He stated that <b>he</b> {{supported}} Harwood <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{a departure from the}} previous House leadership and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> supported by Fox's mentor, George Caruolo.|$|R
60|$|That {{day they}} all went home to Monna Brigida's, in the Borgo degli Albizzi. Romola had made known, to Tessa by gentle degrees, that Naldo could never come to her again: not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> cruel, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead.|$|R
60|$|Madame Staubach {{was very}} nearly angry, but she {{reminded}} herself that people cannot be crushed by rose-leaves. Peter Steinmarc was to <b>be</b> taken, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Peter Steinmarc, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> somebody very different, better mannered, and more agreeable.|$|R
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{prone to}} bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best}} of her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had not decided what would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E
5|$|During their play-date, Bart {{notices that}} Ralph's father has a police master key capable of opening any door in Springfield. Bart and Ralph thus steal {{the key and}} decide to enter several closed stores at night. After encountering Nelson and his gang, the boys go to a {{condemned}} penitentiary. When Ralph objects <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> afraid, the bullies leave, but not before tossing the key into the penitentiary. Ralph and Bart enter the prison to retrieve the key, {{and in the process}} stumble onto a room housing an old electric chair. After testing out the chair, the two flee when an elderly guard approaches.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed him}} to her so quickly {{that he did not}} see her face. Jon stood feeling exactly as he used to when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a naughty little boy; sore <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not loving, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{justified}} in his own eyes.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always up to some mischievous business.|$|R
6000|$|The Pharisee was a sectarian; the Publican was an officer. The Pharisee, even <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a sectarian, was had {{the more}} in esteem; and the Publican, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an officer, was had the more in reproach. To speak {{a little to}} both these: ...|$|R
5|$|Homer {{does well}} in his first fights, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{competing}} against opponents almost as out of shape as he is. At every match, he follows Moe's advice and gains widespread attention, eventually becoming the top ranked fighter in the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association. Moe's former boxing manager Lucius Sweet visits Moe and announces that the current Heavyweight Champion Drederick Tatum is being released from prison and is ready for a comeback fight, and Sweet wants Tatum to fight Homer. Lucius hopes that due to Homer's fame as a human punching bag, he will at least be able to endure a few rounds. Moe, despite knowing that Tatum is far too strong for a fighter of Homer's ability, promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, a love {{triangle}} develops between Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza) and Ann. In an interview, Ann says Andy {{is a fun}} {{person but}} was a terrible boyfriend <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> completely reliant on others. When learning self-defense from Ron, Ann takes down Andy with a wrist grab, impressing Andy but making April jealous. After Andy is accidentally knocked out by Ron, Ann later approaches Andy at his shoe shine stand and brings him gifts to help him feel better. April arrives and Andy gives her a vegetarian muffin. Surprised Andy got something for someone other than himself, Ann believes Andy has changed.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
5000|$|Bollman is {{important}} not only <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perhaps the most successful of the latter (self taught engineers) class, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> probably also the last. <b>He</b> may <b>be</b> {{said to be a}} true representative of the transitional period between intuitive and exact engineering.

60|$|Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, and Lord Chancellor of England, {{commanded}} {{the love of}} his intimates, but did not possess those qualities of cheap glitter that make for popularity with the masses. Nor did he court popularity elsewhere. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> austere in his morals, grave and sober in his conduct, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hated by those who made up the debauched court of his prince. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deeply religious in his principles, the Puritans mistrusted him for a bigot. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> autocratic in his policy <b>he</b> <b>was</b> detested by the Commons, the day of autocracy being done.|$|R

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either his duty to the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that {{the consequences of his}} choice will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully finds black oil in de la Cruz's skull {{during an}} autopsy—the oil {{is dead and}} {{seems to have been}} irradiated. She concludes that he may have had some {{immunity}} to the black oil <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of black oil on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that somebody has set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts his arm to check for the presence of black oil.|$|E
