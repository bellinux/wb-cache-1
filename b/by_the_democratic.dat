5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, {{had made}} peace with Tammany boss Charles Murphy, and again sought New York state office. In July, however, he was drafted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Convention as the vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Ohio {{governor}} James M. Cox. Roosevelt selected Howe as his campaign manager. The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost overwhelmingly to Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E
50|$|Independent Serbia (Serbian: Самостална Србија, Samostalna Srbija) was a {{political}} coalition in Serbia led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> Party of Serbia.

50|$|The {{main actors}} of the {{election}} remain entrenched from the previous election cycle - the right-centre block led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Croatian <b>Democratic</b> Union (HDZ), and the left-centre block led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Social <b>Democratic</b> Party of Croatia.|$|R
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey and one <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} opened {{one of the}} first {{commercial}} airports in the world, the precursor of today's Albany International Airport. During the 1920s a powerful political machine controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party arose in the state capital, connected to politics in New York City as well. It marshalled the power of immigrants and their descendants in both cities.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{politics}} {{since the}} second half of the 20th century have generally been dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, and the state has a reputation for being the most liberal state in the country. In 1974, Elaine Noble became the first openly lesbian or gay candidate elected to a state legislature in US history. The state housed the first openly gay member of the United States House of Representatives, Gerry Studds, in 1972 and in 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{voted in}} favor of the Senate's version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 10, 2009; he was one of only three Republicans to break ranks with the party and support the bill, which was favored by President Barack Obama and was {{unanimously}} supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> senators. As a result of his support, many in the Republican mainstream began calling for his removal from office.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Democratic {{convention}} {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896. Much activity took place {{in advance of the}} formal opening as the silver and (vastly outnumbered) gold forces prepared their strategies. Silver forces were supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Bimetallic Committee, the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland. Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership, but Cleveland, trusting few in his party, did not involve himself further in the gold efforts, but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{in its original}} form was sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, {{a version of the}} legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious groups was passed by the United States Senate. The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were three}} Democratic challengers running for <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> nomination: Steve Filson, a Navy veteran and former airline pilot; Gerald M.

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from legislators, the government (through the Executive Council) agreed {{to extend the}} levy's suspension from two to five years. The amendment for the five-year suspension, one of several proposed amendments to the Employees Retraining Ordinance Notice 2008, was tabled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong and would apply to first-time and renewed contracts and visas issued between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2013.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Kurosawa, {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> {{ideals of}} the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards {{the individual and the}} self. The first such film, No Regrets for Our Youth (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.|$|E
5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to run <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances {{in the general}} election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E

5|$|Descended from a {{prominent}} political family, Beckham {{was chosen as}} Democrat William Goebel's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 {{despite the fact that}} he turned 30, the minimum age for governor, during the campaign. Goebel lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot Goebel. A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to Goebel, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and Beckham over the governorship. Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Beckham later won a special election to fill the remainder of Goebel's term (since less than half the term had expired) and election in his own right in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Hsu started helping {{members of}} the World United Formosans for Independence return to Taiwan in 1991. In 1992, after being {{nominated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Progressive Party (DPP), Hsu was elected {{to become a member}} of the Legislative Yuan. In 1995, he was not nominated by the DPP, but was still elected as an independent candidate. He lost the election for the office of mayor of Tainan in 1997 and instead became the secretary-general of the New National Coalition (新國家連線) shortly after the establishment of the organization. He was re-elected legislator in the 1998 legislative election. Hsu stepped out of the New National Coalition and rejoined the DPP shortly after his re-election to the Legislative Yuan. He was nominated by the DPP Central Executive Committee as the party's candidate for the Tainan mayoral race.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the Democrats held a {{majority}} in the Ohio legislature. In a caucus meeting to determine the party's choice for United States Senator, many Democratic legislators looked to replace the incumbent Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, because they disagreed with his advocacy of civil service reform and low tariffs. Some of Pendleton's opponents, led by Oliver Payne, promoted Henry Payne for the Senate seat, recalling his opposition to both of those positions during his time in the House. After a secret ballot <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> caucus, Payne received 46 out of 80 votes. Because Oliver was a trustee and treasurer of the Standard Oil company, many of the Pendleton supporters immediately alleged that $100,000 from the oil trust had been used to bribe Democratic legislators, and claimed that an open ballot would not have favored Payne.|$|E
50|$|The {{constituency}} {{was created}} for the 2002 election, following {{a reduction in the}} number of Bundestag constituencies.

5|$|On August 18, 1918, {{incumbent}} senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed George B. Martin {{to finish}} James' term, {{which was to}} expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed {{the advantage of a}} united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from President Woodrow Wilson bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{was sworn}} in as the Masten District City Councilman on January 4, 2001 after being {{appointed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Committee. His east side district included 27% of Buffalo's African American population. The Buffalo City Council had a brief African-American majority during Thompson's appointed half term that ended following the subsequent elections in September and November 2001. After African-Americans lost their majority the council voted along racial lines by a 76 margin to shrink the common council from thirteen to nine members by eliminating the four at-large positions (three of which were held by African-Americans). The city voters endorsed the proposal by a 35,84919,036 margin which largely went along racial lines. Thompson retained his council position in the 2001, 2003 and 2005 elections. Thompson served as a John Edwards delegate at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
