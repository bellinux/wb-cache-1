25|$|Peru {{contains}} over {{two-thirds of}} all tropical glaciers which provide important water sources for the dry western half of the country. These glaciers are rapidly melting {{as a result of}} climate change, making the flow of rivers more irregular, leading to more droughts and floods. A report by a team from the World Bank published in June 2007 in the bulletin of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) predicts that many of the lower glaciers in the Andes will <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> the next decade or so, and that glacial runoff may dry up altogether within 20 years. The last comprehensive satellite survey by Peru's National Environmental Council, carried out in 1997, found that the area covered by glaciers had shrunk by 22% since the early 1960s. Partial surveys by geologists suggest that {{the rate at which the}} glaciers are melting has sped up over the past decade.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} be the nominee, he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and hung up the phone. The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke to {{hundreds of thousands of people}} from their chosen venues.|$|E

In a summary of observations with the Mars Orbiter Camera, researchers speculated that some dry ice may have been deposited between the Mariner 9 and the Mars Global Surveyor mission.

2500|$|In January 2011, during rehearsals for his then {{upcoming}} [...] "Future History World Tour", Derulo {{was practicing}} a stunt {{when he fell}} and broke his C2 vertebrae – leaving him in a neck brace {{for six months and}} forcing him to cancel his first headlining tour. [...] "I was not able to dance, I couldn't even really bop my head. It's the simple things that you take for granted — not being able to perform for that amount of time, and also knowing that it could <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> an instant." [...] said Jason during an interview. [...] "I wouldn't change the accident for anything because I've grown so much from it," [...] Jason admits. Derulo then decided to channel all of this creative energy into studio time, on writing and recording his third album. He had written over 300 songs, recorded between 100 and 120 of those songs for the album and had to narrow them down to 12. A very difficult process for him as he states [...] "I wanted {{to be sure that the}} album was a roller coaster ride, that every single song was totally different from the last... I wanted to be sure this album was far different from that one, to make sure that the growth was present. I'm 23 now. I really wanted this album to be a direct representation of who I am. I didn't want to hide anything. This album, I wanted to tell a story.|$|E
