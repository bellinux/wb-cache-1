Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth.

Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E

5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the late}} 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden, the main source for {{information}} on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments, which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts. These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.|$|E
