5|$|Robson {{qualified}} for the China Open and reached the second round but she lost to Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets. At the HP Open in Japan, she was seeded 8th, {{the first time in}} her career she had been seeded at a WTA tournament.

5|$|Stanford won all its 1926 games, {{crushing}} California 41–7 and narrowly defeating USC 13–12. Warner's {{team was}} invited to the Rose Bowl to play Alabama.

After the game, both teams were recognized as national champions {{by a number of}} publications.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is demanding to read.|$|E

5|$|In March 1991, {{during a}} game in New Jersey, Barkley {{attempted}} to spit on a fan that had been heckling with racial slurs <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> was his spit hitting a little girl. Rod Thorn, the NBA's president of operations at the time, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and verbally abusing the fan. It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it. Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family. He apologized and, among other things, provided them tickets to future games.|$|E
5|$|Jean-François Champollion was {{the last}} of seven {{children}} (two of whom died before he was born). He was raised in humble circumstances; his father Jacques Champollion was a book trader from Valjouffrey near Grenoble who had settled {{in the small town of}} Figeac in the Department of Lot. His father was a notorious drunk, and his mother seems to have been largely an absent figure in the life of young Champollion, who was mostly raised by his older brother Jacques-Joseph. One biographer, Andrew Robinson, even speculated that Champollion was not in fact the son of Jacques Champollion's wife Jeanne-Françoise Gualieu, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an extramarital affair.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{made his}} {{professional}} debut as an 18-year-old on September 20, 1996, in Miami, Florida and defeated Michael Johnson by technical knockout {{in the second}} round. On April 14, 1998, Judah defeated Angel Beltre in the second round. Judah accidentally butted heads with Esteban Flores in a fight in March 1999. Flores was cut on his forehead, and the match was halted in the third round. The bout was originally recorded as a technical draw, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> was changed to a no contest in May 1999.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{could only}} manage a 1–1 draw at Wimbledon on 3 April as Beckham’s well-drilled shot {{cancelled}} out Jason Euell's opener {{in the fifth}} minute. Despite several of the first-team members being rested for the Juventus tie, United won 3–0 at Old Trafford against Sheffield Wednesday and battled well to earn a point against Leeds at Elland Road after the midweek tie at Juventus. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> allowed Arsenal {{to move to the}} top of the Premiership for the first time this season, albeit having played one game more, after scoring six against Middlesbrough at the Riverside.|$|E
5|$|The {{allied forces}} of Olaf and Constantine met {{the forces of}} Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh, at a site which {{is the subject of}} much debate, {{although}} current scholarly consensus identifies the site as Bromborough in Cheshire. Olaf and Constantine commanded the Viking troops while Æthelstan alongside his brother Edmund led the English troops into the battle. Contemporary accounts indicate both sides suffered many casualties <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> was a decisive English victory. Olaf and Constantine survived the battle and returned to Ireland and Scotland respectively, however one of Constantine's sons died. The battle is well-attested, with references in Irish chronicles, and a poetic telling of the battle in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The numerous references to it in various chronicles throughout the British Isles testify to its perceived importance at the time.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E

5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland. VAT sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, rear-wheel driven vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all vehicles were continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The vehicles were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} rear-wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of the vehicles were clearly better than the others <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and VAT.|$|E
5|$|The Flyers {{hosted a}} {{practice}} {{game against the}} Muncie Tigers on September 26, 1920, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> {{of the game is}} unknown. The Flyers' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents. The Independents beat the Flyers 45–0. As a result, the Staleys, who were supposed to play the Flyers the next week, cancelled because they wanted to play a better team. The Flyers tried to schedule game {{for the next few weeks}} but were unsuccessful. Since there were no rules to keep players on teams, several Flyers' players left and played for other teams. The Flyers scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later, but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead. The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles. The Flyers were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC—two teams of Muncie. These games are not counted in the APFA standings.|$|E
