40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this paper}} is to revisit the theme of non-resonant {{electronic}} ballasts focusing on a specific topology introduced in the last few years. Its complete mathematical analysis, which has not been fully explored in the past, and its practical implementation as a dc-fed electronic <b>ballast</b> <b>unit</b> is provided. The ballast here presented was successfully prototyped and is capable of pre-heating, igniting and driving two or more fluorescent light bulbs in series and has intrinsic protection against broken filaments and lamp absence. Furthermore, it relies solely on a single power switch and a relatively small-sized inductor per lamp, plus simple op-amp based control circuitry. An external protection circuitry is also presented in this paper, for protecting the power switch against lamp faulty conditions. I...|$|E
40|$|Ballasted flocculation, {{also known}} as high rate clarification, is a physical-chemical {{treatment}} process that uses continuously recycled media {{and a variety of}} additives to improve the settling properties of suspended solids through improved floc bridging. The objective of this process is to form microfloc particles with a specific gravity of greater than two. Faster floc formation and decreased particle settling time allow clarification to occur up to ten times faster than with conventional clarification, allowing treatment of flows at a significantly higher rate than allowed by traditional <b>unit</b> processes. <b>Ballasted</b> flocculation <b>units</b> function through the addition of a coagulant, such as ferric sulfate; an anionic polymer; and a ballast material such as microsand, a microcarrier, or chemically enhanced sludge. When coupled with chemical addition, this ballast material {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing coagulation-sedimentation time (Liao, et al., 1999). For instance, <b>ballasted</b> flocculation <b>units</b> have operated with overflow rates of 815 to 3, 260 L/m 2 �min (20 to 80 gal/ft 2 �min) while achieving total suspended solids removal of 80 to 95 percent (Tarallo, et al., 1998). The compact size of <b>ballasted</b> flocculation <b>units</b> makes them particularly attractive for retrofit and high rate applications.

40|$|Development {{of energy}} {{efficient}} products and exploration of {{energy saving potential}} are major challenges for present day’s technology. Ceramic Metal Halide lamp is the latest improved version of metal halide lamp that finds its wide applications in indoor commercial lighting especially in retail shop lighting. This lamp shows better performance in terms of higher lumen per watt and colour constancy in comparison to conventional metal halide lamp. The inherent negative incremental impedance of CMH lamp demands the use of current control device in the lamp circuit and perfect matching of lamp ballast combination is required for efficient lamp operation. The electrical and photometric performance of two sets of commercial 70 watt CMH lamp and intregated <b>ballast</b> <b>units</b> were measured to investigate their compatibility for optimum lamp operation. The measured data were utilized to develop an electrical model for lamp ballast combination.

5000|$|To wire the system, the <b>ballast</b> {{resistor}} <b>unit</b> (early vehicles) or {{ballast resistor}} wire feeding the points-type coil {{needs to be}} bypassed with regular copper wire. This is because the points system used this resistor to reduce the voltage to the coil to around 9 volts while the ignition switch is in the [...] "run" [...] position to prevent overheating the points. The points system has a [...] "bypass" [...] wire from the ignition switch or the starter solenoid to deliver full battery voltage to the coil during cranking. The HEI system needs the full battery voltage at all times to work its best. One common hookup method is to replace the ballast resistor or wire with a normal copper wire and attach both wires to the HEI's power input terminal. This ensures the HEI receives full power while running.|$|R

Accordingly, the full-scale BFU at the largest wastewater treatment plant in Europe (Seine Aval plant near Paris, France) is investigated during three sampling campaigns. Of the 97 molecules targeted, 57 substances including 18 priority substances and 11 priority hazardous substances were detected in the BFU influents confirming that wet weather flow (WWF) treatment has definitively proven to be necessary. The WWF treatment by ballasted flocculation appears as a promising but not a fully adapted technology for use in densely urbanized areas to considerably mitigate the CSO impacts. On operating at the optimal chemical and sand doses, this process appears to be a suitable technology to remove particles, carbonaceous and phosphorous pollutants, particulate metals and most of hydrophobic organic compounds whilst nitrogenous pollutants and most of hydrophilic compounds are from poorly (< 20 %) to moderately (< 50 %) removed. The BFU appeared less sensitive to the influent concentration fluctuations and hydraulic peak load (at the scale of the campaigns considered) than to the adjustments of chemical doses and sand injection. Investigating the performance of such process, could serve to develop management strategies that enable mitigating the impacts of CSOs on receiving water in compliance with the Water Framework Directive objectives. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{variety of}} methods were {{successfully}} applied to examine the efficacy of a modular ballast water system according to the standards as adopted by the International Maritime Organization. The ballast water treatment system had a capacity of 530 m 3 h− 1 consisted of a pump system, a hydrocyclone, a 50 μm mesh-size self-cleaning filter and an installation for {{the addition of a}} chemical disinfectant (PERACLEAN® Ocean). The land-based testing facility used natural sea water of high turbidity during the spring phytoplankton bloom. The mesozooplankton fraction was inspected with a standard binocular. Larger zooplankton were effectively removed with the filter; the smaller sized fraction containing larvae and nauplia were killed after chemical treatment. The phytoplankton component was monitored using flow cytometry. The huge colonies of the phytoplankton Phaeocystis globosa were disrupted in the hydrocyclone liberating the colony cells which passed as single cells through the filter. These cells remained viable but were finally killed in the secondary (chemical) step. Bacteria also passed all mechanical treatment steps unharmed but were killed in the final step. Viability tests with SYTOX Green, which were specifically designed for phytoplankton, showed that mechanical treatment did not affect the percentage of viable cells a short-term, but after several hours the viable cell counts dropped down to 70 %. Phytoplankton cells recovered within a single day and formed a new dense bloom rapidly. The bacteriostatic component of the chemical disinfectant (H 2 O 2) remained present for several days preventing regrowth of bacteria for up to 15 days after addition. In conclusion, the IMO standards were met using the modular <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>unit</b> and the applied instruments and assays were effective and rapid tools to qualify and quantify the organisms present as well as their viability...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{response}} variables (RAOs) of a semi submersible unit are inspected. Both operational and survival condition {{as well as}} a shallow draft are inspected. The survival condition is inspected with respect to an element analysis. And both operational- and shallow draft condition are case studies, where the operational condition is inspected for two different damage cases. The unit in question is a four column semi submersible, based on the GG 5000 design. This is a relatively new design, and the first vessel to get this design is in its final engineering stage. Construction start is planned to be in August this year (2012). This unit will get the name COSLProspector and will be built in CIMC Yantai Raffles shipyard in China. The unit is symmetrical about the centre line and close to symmetrical about the vertical transverse plane, only pontoon tips are different. Because of this, no significant simplifications have been necessary in order to simplify the calculation due to computational time. Another reason for not doing any simplifications to the geometry {{is due to the fact}} that the results are desired to be the most realistic. However, to reduce computational time, only half the unit has been modelled due to symmetry about centre line. To find the appropriate element size for the mesh, an element analysis has been carried out. The results from this analysis resulted in a chosen element size of 2. 5 m. This element size both gives accurate results, and requires a relatively short computational time. The units resonance periods has been investigated, and verified by help of hand calculations and comparison with RAOs done by Global Maritime (2011). However not all the values were identical to each other, but many factors can influence on that result. The GM value was not changed in this thesis, but was in Global Maritime (2011), in addition the additional damping was in this thesis taken as 3 % of critical damping, while in Global Maritime (2011), Morrison elements were taken into account. These factors, and perhaps a few shortenings are assumed to be the reason for the small difference in the responses, they are however small differences for most of the periods. Two damage cases have been modelled by flooding two different water ballast tanks. These damages will give an angle of list for the unit. Damage case 1 gives an angle of list of 13. 18 o with a rotation of heel axis of 7 o forward. Damage case 2 gives a list angle of 11. 68 o with a rotation of the heel axis of 39 o forward. An earlier study like this one is done by Henriksen (2011), found in Grenland Groups internal archive. AQWA does not give out the tilt angles in damage cases as this is not the main purpose of this program. Therefore, the list angles for the different cases have been obtained from the report done by Henriksen (2011). However, AQWA will be used to obtain the RAOs for both cases, as well as confirm floating equilibrium in such conditions. It is assumed that the tanks are completely emptied for air, and that seawater is filling the entire volume. A table showing the different tanks flooded and its weight with seawater is shown in table 1. Unit	Volume [m 3]	Sea water weight [MT]BWT ST- 2 	 692. 51 	 709. 82 BWT ST- 8 	 616. 83 	 632. 25 Table 1 : Weight of water for flooded tanksWhen it comes to the RAOs in the damage cases, they are very hard to read. This is mainly due to the fact that the motions in these cases are highly dependent on each other due to coupled motions. Due to an angle of list, the unit is no longer symmetric. As a consequence of this a RAO for a specific degree of freedom can no longer be read like it is only this degree of freedom which is affecting the responses, but one or more of the other degrees of freedom are strongly influencing. This makes some of the peaks appear where not normally expected. It is also noticeable that the highest motions are encountered for damage case 1, which is natural because this case has the highest list angle. The resonance periods are lower in the damage cases compared to the normal operational condition, however not to a degree which is dangerously low. The lowest resonance period is still in heave. From the RAOs in the shallow draft case, it can be noticed that the highest responses in heave are encountered for the shallow condition (14. 5 m) compared to the survival condition (15. 5 m) and operational condition (17. 5 m), however only up to about 18 s, where after that it has the smallest response, and the operational condition has the highest. In roll and pitch the trends are fairly similar. The graphs are a little uneven until the first cancellation period, and then the shallow draft gives a higher response until reaching the resonance period. In the resonance region, the operational condition has the highest response for both roll and pitch, same as for the heave. As a conclusion, the optimal approach in a situation where the unit is heavily tilted is to try to <b>ballast</b> the <b>unit</b> to an even keel. But of course risks of doing this are a possibility, such as slamming problems and the fact that the resonance periods will be shorter...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} aimed at carrying out analysis of Energy Bags, reinforced fabric bags used for subsea {{compressed air energy storage}}. Subsea compressed air energy storage {{is a completely}} new method of large-scale energy storage designed to be integrated with direct-compression offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters. Energy Bags are impermeable bags anchored to the seabed at significant depths (e. g. 500 m) in which high pressure air, compressed by specially designed wind turbines and wave energy converters, is stored at pressures roughly equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water. Energy Bags {{do not need to be}} particularly strong because most of the reaction to the pressure load is provided by the surrounding water, and high energy densities are available at such depths as 500 m. This thesis investigates the deformed shapes of Energy Bags and studies optimal designs. Three analysis methods are developed which vary in their complexity, ease of use, and accuracy. First, a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is derived which describes the deformed shape of an axisymmetric Energy Bag. This model is later used in an optimisation study to find the shapes of bag which minimise the cost of materials (reinforcement, fabric, and <b>ballast)</b> per <b>unit</b> of energy stored. Circumferential reinforcement, hanging masses from the inside of the bag (which it was hoped would lower the total cost) and fill level are all included as variables in the optimisation, and it is found that for reasonable materials costs an Energy Bag could cost less than £ 10, 000 /MWh when anchored at 500 m. This compares favourably with all other methods of large-scale energy storage. However, the bags used in the optimisation study have wide bases, which will require sealing against the seabed (unless water is to be allowed into the bags). Problems are encountered when trying to use the ODE method to find the shapes of partially inflated bags, and it is generally not very easy to use. Next, we carry out finite element analysis (FEA) of an axisymmetric Energy Bag using cable elements. This is much more user-friendly and flexible than the ODE method. Partially inflated bag shapes are found, and pressure-volume curves are presented which show the almost isobaric performance of an Energy Bag. It is found that material mass limits the extent to which the bag can be deflated before it becomes unstable. The axisymmetric FEA is used to study bags with much more realistic circumferential reinforcement than the ODE method, and we also look at bags with an unsealed base, which allow water in through the base as they deflate. A three-dimensional FEA tool is presented which models an Energy Bag as a cable-reinforced membrane using cable and membrane elements, and special measures had to be taken to deal with wrinkling. We assume that the bag is rotationally symmetric, comprising a number of symmetric lobes. The 3 D FEA is used to find the stress distribution in the membrane of the bag, however a converged solution cannot always be found. It is not certain why this is the case but it is anticipated that it is because deformed bags are not always rotationally symmetric. The 3 D FEA could also be used to model other membrane structures such as balloons, parachutes, roofs and sails, as well as nets. The standard cutting patterns for lobes in lobed balloons are analysed, and a new cutting pattern known as the Constant Tension lobe is generated. This is an extension of the Constant Radius lobe and takes into account the pressure gradient found in both air and water, minimising waste material. The Constant Tension lobe is particularly appropriate for Energy Bags because of the large pressure gradient in water. The Ultra High Performance Vessel architecture is also presented, upon which the design of the prototype Energy Bags is based. The fabric structure of an Ultra High Performance Vessel comprises only two sheets of fabric (rather than many separate lobes welded together), and tendon shortening and “bellows” serve to ensure that there is no meridional stress in the fabric. An analytical optimisation is used to show that the zero pressure bag that minimises cost of materials per unit of energy stored has equal costs of reinforcement and membrane. The axisymmetric FEA is also used to find the optimum bag size and maximum fill level for a bag which comes down to a single point at the base (as opposed to a wide base bag). Finally, testing of two 1. 8 m diameter superpressure Energy Bags has been commenced during the course of this work, and the prototypes and test rig are documented in this thesis. The prototypes were manufactured for us by Thin Red Line Aerospace Ltd., a Canadian manufacturer of deployable fabric structures for use in space. They are being cycled back-to-back in order to prove the concept, assess the performance of an Energy Bag over time, and identify any problems that need to be addressed. One of the bags had a few small leaks from the moment it was first inflated, but the other has remained airtight to date. It was found that if an Energy Bag is to be airtight, special attention must be paid to the welds at the seams and the sealing around the airline fittings.
