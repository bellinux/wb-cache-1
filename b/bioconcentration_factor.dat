40|$|As {{a result}} of {{operations}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS), over 50 radionuclides have been released to the atmosphere and to onsite streams and seepage basins. Now, many of these radionuclides are available to aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms for uptake and cycling through the food chain. Knowledge about the uptake and cycling of these radionuclides is now crucial in evaluating waste management and clean-up alternatives for the site. Numerous {{studies have been conducted}} at the SRS over the past forty years to study the uptake and distribution of radionuclides in the Savannah River Site environment. In many instances, <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> have been calculated to quantify the uptake of a radionuclide by an organism from the surrounding medium (i. e., soil or water). In the past, it has been common practice to use <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> from the literature because site-specific data were not readily available. However, because of the variability of <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> due to experimental or environmental conditions, site-specific data should be used when available. This report compiles and summarizes site-specific <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> for selected radionuclides released at the Savannah River Site (SRS). An extensive literature search yielded site-specific <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> for cesium, strontium, cobalt, plutonium, americium, curium, and tritium. These eight radionuclides have been the primary radionuclides studied at SRS because of their long half lives or because they are major contributors to radiological dose from exposure. For most radionuclides, it was determined that the site-specific <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> were higher than those reported in literature.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{considers}} {{whether the}} current standard toxicokinetic methods are an accurate and applicable assessment of xenobiotic exposure in an aquatic freshwater invertebrate. An in vivo exposure examined the uptake and elimination kinetics for eight pharmaceutical compounds in the amphipod crustacean, Gammarus pulex by measuring their concentrations in both biological material {{and in the}} exposure medium over a 96 h period. Selected pharmaceuticals included two anti-inflammatories (diclofenac and ibuprofen), two beta-blockers (propranolol and metoprolol), an anti-depressant (imipramine), an anti-histamine (ranitidine) and two beta-agonists (formoterol and terbutaline). Kinetic <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> (BCFs) for the selected pharmaceuticals were derived from a first-order one-compartment model using either the simultaneous or sequential modelling methods. Using the simultaneous method for parameter estimation, BCF values ranged from 12 to 212. In contrast, the sequential method for parameter estimation resulted in <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> ranging from 19 to 4533. Observed toxicokinetic plots showed statistically significant lack-of-fits and further interrogation of the models revealed a decreasing trend in the uptake rate constant over time for rantidine, diclofenac, imipramine, metoprolol, formoterol and terbutaline. Previous published toxicokinetic data for 14 organic micro-pollutants were also assessed and similar trends were identified to those observed in this study. The decreasing trend of the uptake rate constant over time highlights the need to interpret modelled data more comprehensively to ensure uncertainties associated with uptake and elimination parameters for determining <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> are minimised...|$|R

50|$|A <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factor</b> {{greater than}} 1 is {{indicative}} of a hydrophobic or lipophilic chemical. It is an indicator of how probable a chemical is to bioaccumulate. These chemicals have high lipid affinities and will concentrate in tissues with high lipid content instead of in an aqueous environment like the cytosol. Models are used to predict chemical partitioning in the environment which in turn allows the prediction of the biological fate of lipophilic chemicals.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR). The CBR is the whole-body concentration of a chemical {{that is associated with}} a given adverse biological response and it is estimated using a partition coefficient and a <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factor.</b> The whole-body residues are reasonable first approximations of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s). Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues, modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this variability should be considered. The effects of mixture toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally additive, chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which to measure and assess {{bioaccumulation}} and bioconcentration. These include: octanol-water partition coefficients (KOW), <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factors</b> (BCF), bioaccumulation factors (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF). Each of these can be calculated using either empirical data or measurements {{as well as from}} mathematical models.

River bed sediments and fish samples were collected si-multaneously at five sites over seven months (September 2008 -April 2009). Concentrations of aluminium, manganese and cobalt in the selected fish organs and sediment were estimated using the Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS). Water limnochemical aspects, dissolved oxy-gen, pH, temperature and conductivity were measured concomitantly at each site.

Dissolved manganese (Mn(II)) is the dominant metal with lower concentrations of dissolved zinc (Zn(II)), nickel (Ni(II)), copper (Cu(II)), iron (Fe(II,III)), and cobalt (Co(II)). In this study, uptake of metals by plants along the perennial reach of Pinal Creek was measured. Specifically, water speedwell (Veronica anagallis-aquatica), rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis (L.)

50|$|Amine oxides with {{an average}} chain length of 12.6 have been {{measured}} to be water-soluble at ~410 g L−1. They are considered to have low bioaccumulation potential in aquatic species based on log Kow data from chain lengths less than C14 (<b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factor</b> < 87%).

The highest effluent concentrations were found in oxidation ditch and trickling filter treatment plants. On average, over 96% removal has been found with secondary activated sludge treatment. Acute toxicity in fish, as indicated by 96h LC50 tests, is in the range of 1,000-3,000 ug L−1 for carbon chain lengths less than C14. LC50 values for chain lengths greater than C14 range from 600 to 1400 ug L−1. Chronic toxicity data for fish is 420 ug/L. When normalized to C12.9, the NOEC is 310 ug L−1 for growth and hatchability.|$|E
50|$|Endrin {{regularly}} {{enters the}} environment {{when applied to}} crops or when rain washes it off. It {{has been found in}} water, sediments, atmospheric air and biotic environment, even after uses have been stopped. Organochlorine pesticides strongly resist degradation, are poorly soluble in water but highly soluble in lipids, which is called lipophilic. This leads to bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of organisms, mainly those dwelling in water. A high <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>factor</b> of 1335-10,000 has been reported in fish. Endrin binds very strongly to organic matter in soil and aquatic sediments due to their high adsorption coefficient, making it less likely to leach into groundwater, even though contaminated groundwater samples have been found. In 2009, EPA released data indicating that the endrin in soil could last up to 14 years or more. The extent of endrin's persistence depends highly on local conditions. For example, high temperature (230 °C) or intense sunlight leads to more rapid breakdown of endrin into endrin ketone and endrin aldehyde, however, this breakdown is less than 5%.|$|E

To this end, we exposed Danio rerio for 21 d to 15 N-tamoxifen concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 10 mg/L and used an analytic method based on stable isotopes to evaluate the tamoxifen content in these organisms. The evolution of the 15 N/ 14 N ratio was thus measured in liver, muscle and gonads of exposed fish compared to control fish.
