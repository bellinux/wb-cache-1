5000|$|At around 8.45 on Tuesday {{evening of}} 13 October 1914, the {{inhabitants}} of Appley Bridge (indeed Lancashire and Cheshire too) were treated to a sudden and spectacular illumination of the night sky, caused by a meteorite that {{was found in a}} farmer's field in the village the following day. Found just 18 inches {{below the surface of the}} field, with the appearance of <b>burnt</b> <b>iron,</b> the small rock weighed almost 33 lb (15 kg). An article in the [...] "Scientific News" [...] (No. 2588, 30 October 1914) stated, [...] "a small fragment which had been detached from the larger mass was put on view in a shop-window at Appley Bridge."In September 2014 a book about the meteorite, by local author Russell Parry, was published.|$|E
5000|$|The cairns furthest {{down towards}} the sea {{are from the}} Late Iron Age and Viking times, while those on higher ground are {{probably}} older; theoretically, they could be from the Late Bronze Age, as was previously assumed. However, recent research shows that all the cairns of Mølen are probably from the Iron Age. Almost all the cairns have one or more depressions from plundering or so-called [...] "haugbrot". [...] "Haugbrot" [...] refers to ritual removal of the dead; the reason why this was done is not clear. The low boat-shaped stone setting was excavated in the 1970s. It is a grave where a ship had probably been <b>burnt.</b> <b>Iron</b> nails and carbon were found, and these have been dated to approximately 30?250 A.D.|$|E

5000|$|Moses Finley remarked, [...] "fugitive slaves {{are almost}} an {{obsession}} in the sources". Rome forbade the harbouring of fugitive slaves, and professional slave-catchers were hired {{to hunt down}} runaways. Advertisements were posted with precise descriptions of escaped slaves, and offered rewards. If caught, fugitives could be punished by being whipped, <b>burnt</b> with <b>iron,</b> or killed. Those who lived were branded on the forehead with the letters FUG, for fugitivus. Sometimes slaves had a metal collar riveted around the neck. One such collar is preserved at Rome and states in Latin, [...] "I have run away. Catch me. If you {{take me back to}} my master Zoninus, you'll be rewarded." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the ship}} was being broken up, off of Plum Beach, near Port Washington, Long Island, a fire broke out on the forward decks, which was where boards were being <b>burnt</b> for <b>iron</b> spikes. The fire spread to several other nearby, former navy ships, which were also due to be broken up for salvage, these were the Minnesota, the Susquehanna, South Carolina, Iowa, and the Congress. Along with the Colorado, these other ships went down after they were burnt. The company that had been {{breaking}} the ships up, Stannard & Co., claimed {{at the time that}} the fire may have caused a more than $100,000 loss.|$|R
50|$|Excavation {{of the pit}} {{containing}} the large hoard has revealed evidence of timber posts, possibly from a hut, and large quantities of <b>burnt</b> daub, late <b>Iron</b> Age and early Roman pottery. The presence of slag and furnace linings along with some coins which have been cut in half, could suggest that the coins were being melted down. It may be that new coins were being minted here.|$|R
60|$|The {{exhibitions}} next {{in popularity}} to these itinerant theatres are the travelling menageries, or, to speak more intelligibly, the ‘Wild-beast shows,’ where a military band in beef-eater’s costume, with leopard-skin caps, play incessantly; and where large highly-coloured representations of tigers tearing men’s heads open, and a lion being <b>burnt</b> with red-hot <b>irons</b> to induce {{him to drop}} his victim, are hung up outside, by way of attracting visitors.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the first}} Church Missionary Society station in New Zealand, the store was {{designed}} by John Hobbs to replace an earlier wooden store house. The Stone Store was erected between 1832 and 1836 by mason William Parrott, carpenter Ben Nesbitt {{and a team of}} Māori. Construction was of sandstone from Australia, local volcanic rocks and <b>burnt</b> shell mortar. <b>Iron</b> ties and window bars were forged by James Kemp, (though these unfortunately corroded the sandstone). Initially it had a wooden belfry on one side.|$|R

The magnetic survey comprises seven profiles in N-S and E-W direction with station interval of 0. 5 m. [Orthogonal set of] 2 D electrical resistivity tomography data consisting of four parallel and three perpendicular profiles were collected using Wenner array with electrode spacing ranging from 0. 5 – 3. 0 m.

50|$|Tori feuded with Jacqueline in April and May 1999 {{and then}} began {{pursuing}} Ivory's Women's Championship in July. After Ivory defeated Tori at SummerSlam, their feud {{became more and more}} heated, leading to the first ever WWF women's Hardcore match on the September 6, 1999 edition of Raw. Ivory retained her title once more in a match which involved Tori having a mirror smashed over her head and being <b>burnt</b> with an <b>iron.</b> On September 26, Tori attempted to gain a measure of retribution by attacking Ivory during a match, but instead was pushed into a crate by Ivory.|$|R
60|$|While the Renshaws had {{contented}} {{themselves with}} stoves, Mr. Atherton {{had gone to}} the expense and trouble of having a great open fireplace, with a brick chimney outside the wall. Here, even on the hottest day, two or three logs <b>burnt</b> upon old-fashioned <b>iron</b> dogs. On the wall above was a sort of trophy of oriental weapons. Two very large and comfortable easy chairs stood {{by the side of the}} hearth, and in the centre of the room stood an old oak table, richly carved and black with age. A book-case of similar age and make, with its shelves well filled with standard works, stood against the one wall unoccupied by the divan.|$|R

40|$|Non-invasive {{geophysical}} methods {{are increasingly being}} used in archaeological studies. In this study, magnetic and electrical resistivity tomography geophysical techniques were integrated to locate subsurface archaeological materials. The survey consists of four parallel and three perpendicular profiles with station interval of 0. 5 m for both magnetic and electrical resistivity tomography. Wenner array with electrode spacing ranging from 0. 5 – 3. 0 m was used to collect the electrical resistivity data. The results show that high total magnetic intensity anomalies correspond to high inverse model resistivities. The regions with high magnetic and resistivity anomalies {{were thought to be}} locations of archaeological materials; the corresponding depths to these materials were inferred from the resulting geophysical images. Test units conducted at the regions of high total magnetic intensity and inverse model resistivity yield archaeological materials including <b>burnt</b> pipes (Tuyere), <b>iron</b> slag, iron smelting, and pottery fragments at approximate depths inferred from the geophysical images...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{geophysical}} {{techniques have}} been used to delineate subsurface archaeological materials in Ile-Ife Southwestern Nigeria. The magnetic survey comprises seven orthogonal profiles in N-S and E-W direction with station interval of 0. 5 m. Orthogonal set of 2 D electrical resistivity tomography data consisting of four parallel and three perpendicular profiles were collected using Wenner array with electrode spacing ranging from 0. 5 – 3. 0 m. The 3 D inversion schemes applied on the collated 2 D data set were based on non-linear least-square optimization technique. The results obtained show that regions of high magnetic intensities coincide with high model resistivity values. Trial pits carried out at these regions yield <b>burnt</b> pipes “TUYERE”, <b>iron</b> slag, iron smelting, charcoal specks, stone tools, and pottery fragments (e. g. decorative potsherds, pot-rims, and pot-lids). These recovered archaeological materials have further proven the study area to be an ancient iron smelting site within Ile-Ife. The research has also demonstrated that integrated geophysical techniques provide fast and cost effective tools in pre-excavation investigation of archaeological materials...|$|R
5000|$|In 1560, Frederick II of Denmark {{ordered his}} vassal Otte Brahe to {{establish}} lights at Skagen, Anholt and Kullen (in Sweden) {{to mark the}} main route through Danish waters from the North Sea to the Baltic. Initially wood and seaweed were used a fuel for the light, burnt on a tiled floor {{at the top of}} a wooden tower. Later coal was used for all Danish lights as it provided better illumination but it often caused the wooden towers to catch fire. It was Jens Pedersen Grove from Helsingør who designed the vippefyr which consisted of a tipping mechanism where the coal could be <b>burnt</b> in an <b>iron</b> container hoisted up into the air so that it could be seen from afar while avoiding damage to the wooden structure. Vippefyr simply means [...] "tipping light" [...] or [...] "rocking light". Thanks to its success, vippefyr were also constructed at Falsterbo in southern Sweden and on the island of Anholt in the Kattegat. The latter remained in operation until 1788.|$|R
60|$|All such nations first {{manifest}} {{themselves as a}} pure and beautiful animal race, with intense energy and imagination. They live lives of hardship by choice, and by grand instinct of manly discipline: they become fierce and irresistible soldiers; the nation is always its own army, and their king, or chief head of government, is always their first soldier. Pharaoh, or David, or Leonidas, or Valerius, or Barbarossa, or Coeur de Lion, or St. Louis, or Dandolo, or Frederick the Great:--Egyptian, Jew, Greek, Roman, German, English, French, Venetian,--that is inviolable law for them all; their king must be their first soldier, or they cannot be in progressive power. Then, after their great military period, comes the domestic period; in which, without betraying the discipline of war, they add to their great soldiership the delights and possessions of a delicate and tender home-life: and then, for all nations, {{is the time of}} their perfect art, which is the fruit, the evidence, the reward of their national ideal of character, developed by the finished care of the occupations of peace. That is the history of all true art that ever was, or can be: palpably the history of it,--unmistakably,--written on the forehead of it in letters of light,--in tongues of fire, by which the seal of virtue is branded as deep as ever <b>iron</b> <b>burnt</b> into a convict's flesh the seal of crime. But always, hitherto, after the great period, has followed the day of luxury, and pursuit of the arts for pleasure only. And all has so ended.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other literati purges, the Fourth Literati Purge pf 1545, or Ulsa Sahwa (을사사화, 乙巳士禍), {{was largely}} a result of power {{struggle}} between relatives of the competing princes. After Jo Gwang-jo's fall, Nam Gon and Shim Jung's faction and Kim Anro's faction vied for power after Kim Anro's son married Jungjong's eldest daughter. Kim Anro was exiled by Nam Gon and Shim Jung for abusing power, but he returned from exile after Nam Gon's death and successfully drove out Shim Jung, {{who was accused of}} accepting bribes from Consort Park to help her put her son on the throne instead of crown prince. Later he framed Shim Jung and Consort Park on the charge of cursing the crown prince (A dead rat whose mouth, eyes, and ears were <b>burnt</b> with hot <b>iron</b> {{to make it look like}} a pig was discovered hanging from a tree in the crown prince's palace on his birthday. There also phrases cursing the crown prince, whose Chinese zodiac sign was Pig. Consort Park was suspected for she was already known to be plotting to put her son on the throne instead. It was later found out to be Kim Anro's doing after his fall.) Consort Park, her son Prince Buksong, and Shim Jung were executed. Kim Anro now unleashed the reign of terror against his political enemies in the name of protecting the crown prince. He even attempted to depose Queen Munjeong, who gave birth to a son who was later to become Myeongjong, but this led to his downfall and execution in 1537.|$|R
