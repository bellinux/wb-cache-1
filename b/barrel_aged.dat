In Australia, this is also the main grape used in the production of Liqueur Muscat, from the Victorian wine region of Rutherglen. Young, unaged and unfortified examples of Muscat blanc tend to exhibit the characteristic Muscat [...] "grapey" [...] aroma as well as citrus, rose and peach notes. Fortified and aged examples (particularly those that have been <b>barrel</b> <b>aged)</b> tend to be very dark in color due to oxidation with aroma notes of coffee, fruit cake, raisins and toffee.|$|E
