40|$|AbstractThe {{advent of}} 21 st century {{medicine}} {{will be based}} on a comprehensive approach to achieving the highly sensitive and specific detection of diseases, as well as the development of novel materials and devices based on biotic-abiotic interfacing as interventional modalities. Novel technologies that enable early identification of physiological changes will serve as a gateway tool for the proper treatment of these disorders. Toward the realization of these technologies, microfabrication and nanofabrication methods have been applied to biomedical systems that allow scientists to interact with cellular and molecular systems on their native size scales. Future enabling systems will build on the foundation composed of such devices. With respect to the envisioned fruition of biofunctional nanomaterials and systems, foundational studies of biological systems and molecules, as well as their interfacing with biocompatible materials, have produced a domain of components that can be integrated and engineered toward eventual cytomimetic materials for transplantation. In addition, the potential underscoring of their future applications in nanoscale medicine is based on the ability to engineer and design intelligent membrane/protein self-assembling and organization phenomena that are typically found in nature into these artificial composite systems. These devices will provide a powerful suite of solutions with broad applicabilities in nanomedicine, for example, (1) the use of concomitant protein functionality toward energy production and the powering of medical implants and (2) replacement of damaged cells (e. g., heart and neuron) with implantable biologically intelligent engineered materials. This work will examine key advances in the areas of diagnostics and synthetic biology that have led to visionary contributions to next-generation medicine. Furthermore, we present 2 devices that will contribute to the realization of compelling biosensing and <b>biofunctional</b> <b>material</b> technologies. These systems include advanced diagnostic platforms for whole-cell detection, as well as copolymeric materials that have been functionalized by the coupled activity of their embedded membrane proteins. They are envisioned to successfully bridge the gap between foundational scientific progress and the realization of rapid point-of-care disease assessment and biofunctional devices with higher-order behavior...|$|E
40|$|Biosynthesis of {{long-chain}} n- 3 {{fatty acids}} from precursors is limited. In vivo effect of squalene (SQ) on the metabolic fate of n- 3 fatty acid precursors in obese/diabetic KK-A(y) rodent model was evaluated in our work. Soybean oil, being rich in ALA (18 : 3 n- 3; a known precursor of EPA/DHA), {{was chosen as}} the n- 3 fatty acid precursor rich source. A high-fat diet (20 %) containing 7 % soybean oil (SO) was fed to obesity/diabetes-prone male KK-A(y) mice (control). In the case of diets fed to test groups, soybean oil was replaced with 5 % SO and 2 % SQ. Hepatic DHA levels increased (four fold) in SQ fed group over control (p< 0. 05). Gene and protein expressions of (5) and (6) desaturases, key enzymes involved in the fatty acid metabolism, further supported the results. Also, SQ exhibited a hypotriglyceridemic and hypoglycemic effect. The results clearly indicated the effect of SQ in modulating the n- 3 fatty acid metabolism, including EPA/DHA synthesis in the presence of n- 3 fatty acid precursor. This is the first report of enhancement of in vivo DHA/EPA by SQ and in turn, modulating the physiological fatty acid profile. Practical applications: Squalene (SQ) is an important marine <b>biofunctional</b> <b>material</b> that is found in some terrestrial sources as well. Squalene, being a cholesterol precursor, forms an interesting subject of research for its effect in vivo. SQ significantly enhanced proportions of EPA and/or DHA when their n- 3 fatty acid precursors were available in the diet. The study further establishes the usefulness of SQ in functional food formulations. The work provides an important basis for further evaluation of the role of SQ in normal and disease conditions. KK-A(y) mice were fed high fat/sucrose diet to induce obesity/diabetes. Fat source in control diet was lard and soybean oil while experimental group diet contained 2 % squalene+ 13 % lard+ 5 % soybean oil. Feeding squalene for 4 weeks modulated fatty acid metabolism with increased docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and decrease in triglycerides (TG), compared to control. The enhanced DHA in the fatty acid profile was supported by upregulated mRNA expression of (5) -desaturase enzyme and protein expression of (5) and (6) desaturases (FADS 1 and FADS 2). Additionally, squalene had a hypoglycemic effect in the mice...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the adsorption of the nucleic acid bases- adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T) and uracil (U) - {{on the outer}} wall of a high curvature semiconducting single-walled boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) by first-principles density functional theory calculations. The calculated binding energy shows the order: G>A≈C≈T≈U implying that the interaction strength of the high curvature BNNT with the nucleobases, G being an exception, is nearly the same. A higher binding energy for the G-BNNT conjugate appears to result from a hybridization of the molecular orbitals of G and BNNT.

The recent development of controlled polymerization and post-modification methods together with efficient coupling strategies based on "click chemistry" approaches allows the preparation of highly precise polymer systems that combine the ability to self-assemble into well-defined and predictable structures, together with a pre-defined or molecularly encoded bioactivity (such as interaction, inhibition, recognition). Even if polymers {{have been used for}} many years in the field of biomaterials mostly because of their mechanical properties and inert character, we believe that a novel area is arising, where polymers will {{be at the center of}} innovation.

40|$|An {{increased}} interest for hygiene {{in everyday life}} as well as in food, feed and medical issues lead to a strong interest in films and blends to prevent the growth and accumulation of harmful bacteria. A growing trend is to use synthetic and natural antimicrobial polymers, to provide non-migratory and non-depleting protection agents for application in films, coatings and packaging. In food packaging, antimicrobial effects add up to the barrier properties of the materials, to increase the shelf life and product quality. Chitosan is a natural bioactive polysaccharide with intrinsic antimicrobial activity and, due to its exceptional physicochemical properties imparted by the polysaccharide backbone, has been recognized as a natural alternative to chemically synthesized antimicrobial polymers. This, associated with the increasing preference for <b>biofunctional</b> <b>materials</b> from renewable resources, resulted in a significant interest on the potential for application of chitosan in packaging materials.

40|$|Surface {{modification}} is {{an important}} and predominant technique for obtaining biofunction and biocompatibility in metals for biomedical use. The surface modification technique {{is a process that}} changes the surface composition, structure and morphology of a material, leaving the bulk mechanical properties intact. A tremendous number of surface modification techniques using dry and wet processes to improve the hard tissue compatibility of titanium have been developed. Some are now commercially available. Most of these processes have been developed by Japanese institutions since the 1990 s. A second approach is the immobilization of biofunctional molecules to the metal surface to control the adsorption of proteins and adhesion of cells, platelets and bacteria. The immobilization of poly(ethylene glycol) to a metal surface with electrodeposition and its effect on biofunction are reviewed. The creation of a metal–polymer composite is another way to obtain metal-based <b>biofunctional</b> <b>materials.</b> The relationship between the shear bonding strength and the chemical structure at the bonding interface of a Ti-segmentated polyurethane composite through a silane coupling agent is explained...|$|R
40|$|Single-wall carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWCNTs) are {{a promising}} material for future biological {{applications such as}} imaging and targeted drug delivery. SWCNTs can be made soluble in water through surface functionalization, a priority for their use in biology. By studying the surface chemistry of SWCNTs, various functionalization methods can be accomplished without perturbing their electronic structure. This study probes the use of pyrene derivatives and phospholipids to non-covalently functionalize SWCNTs, maintaining useful surface properties. Phospholipids cross-linked to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or 1 -pyrenebutyric acid conjugated to DNA is anchored onto the sidewalls of SWCNTs by hydrophobic interactions or π-stacking. The PEG/DNA portion is water soluble and biocompatible, thus solubilizing the SWCNTs. <b>Biofunctional</b> <b>materials</b> such as DNA or proteins can {{be attached to the}} functionalized nanotubes and used for biological applications. Functionalization is characterized by optical methods and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Length sorting of SWCNTs fit for use in bio-functionalization is also explored. By functionalizing SWCNTs with groups that are cytologically compatible, allowing for their dispersion in water, they show greater promise in future biological applications...|$|R
40|$|Microneedles have {{recently}} been adopted {{for use as a}} painless and safe method of transdermal therapeutic delivery through physically permeating the stratum corneum. While microneedles create pathways to introduce drugs, they can also act as conduits for biosignal sensing. Here, we explore the development of microneedles as both biosensing and drug delivery platforms. Microneedle sensors are being developed for continuous monitoring of biopotentials and bioanalytes through the use of conductive and electrochemically reactive biomaterials. The range of therapeutics being delivered through microneedle devices has diversified, while novel bioabsorbable microneedles are undergoing first-in-human clinical studies. We foresee that future microneedle platform development will focus on the incorporation of <b>biofunctional</b> <b>materials,</b> designed to deliver therapeutics in a stimulus responsive fashion. Biofunctional microneedle patches will require improved methods of attaching to and conforming to epithelial tissues in dynamic environments {{for longer periods of time}} and thus present an assortment of new design challenges.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{a leading cause of}} death worldwide. Since adult cardiac cells are limited in their proliferation, cardiac tissue with dead or damaged cardiac cells {{downstream}} of the occluded vessel does not regenerate after myocardial infarction. The cardiac tissue is then replaced with nonfunctional fibrotic scar tissue rather than new cardiac cells, which leaves the heart weak. The limited proliferation ability of host cardiac cells has motivated investigators to research the potential cardiac regenerative ability of stem cells. Considerable {{progress has been made in}} this endeavor. However, the optimum type of stem cells along with the most suitable matrix-material and cellular microenvironmental cues are yet to be identified or agreed upon. This review presents an overview of various types of <b>biofunctional</b> <b>materials</b> and biomaterial matrices, which in combination with stem cells, have shown promises for cardiac tissue replacement and reinforcement. Engineered biomaterials also have applications in cardiac tissue engineering, in which tissue constructs are developed in vitro by combining stem cells and biomaterial scaffolds for drug screening or eventual implantation. This review highlights the benefits of using biomaterials in conjunction with stem cells to repair damaged myocardium and give a brief description of the properties of these biomaterials that make them such valuable tools to the field.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} details {{strategies for}} the fabrication of sophisticated <b>biofunctional</b> <b>materials</b> and their use in biomedical and biotechnological application. These unique biointerfaces were designed by integrating biological entities with synthetic polymers and extensively characterized using surface analytical tools. The {{first part of this}} dissertation focuses on the immobilization of specific moieties that render surfaces biomimetic. Synthesis of reactive polymers, poly(4 -formyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) and poly(4 -heptadecafluoronononyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) was accomplished via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization. These reactive polymer coatings enabled the immobilization of proteins and oligosaccharides via chemoselective carbonyl-hydrazide coupling reaction. On the other hand, an alkyne-functionalized polymer coating, poly(4 -ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) was synthesized for the conjugation of proteins, saccharides and cell-adhesive oligopeptides via alkyne-azide “click” reaction, in a spatioselective manner. These platforms were further used for surface-directed adhesion of human endothelial cells. Another application of reactive polymers was directed towards the fabrication of polymer coatings, which mimic endothelial cells with respect to nitric oxide generation for cardiovascular stents. Photo-reactive polymer coatings were deposited using CVD polymerization and used to incorporate Cu(II) ligated cyclen (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane) onto the surface of a stent. These catalytic sites containing copper generated NO from endogenous S-nitrosothiols present in blood, and the measured NO flux approached physiological ranges. These coatings attempt to solve the problems of restenosis and thrombosis associated with the placement of coronary artery stents. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, a chemically-defined polymer was fabricated, which supported long-term human embryonic stem (hES) cell cultures, for the first time, in the presence of several different culture media. Polymer, poly[2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl dimethyl-(3 -sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide] sustained the culture of hES cells for at least 25 passages in mouse fibroblast conditioned medium, at least 15 passages in commercially-available human cell conditioned medium and at least 10 passages in defined StemPro medium. Throughout the study, hES cells expressed undifferentiated cell markers, retained a normal karyotype and remained pluripotent. Development of a standardized culture matrix for hES cells represents a significant step towards future clinical applications of hES cells. Taken together, these approaches offer novel solutions for target applications in tissue engineering, biomedical devices and microfluidics and further expand our toolbox of strategies for creating biologically-relevant surfaces...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Type-I {{collagen}} self-assembles into a fibrillar gel at physiological {{temperature and}} pH {{to provide a}} cell-adhesive, supportive, structural network. As such, it is an attractive, popular scaffold for in vitro evaluations of cellular behavior and for tissue engineering applications. In this study, type-I collagen is modified to introduce methacrylate groups on the free amines of the lysine residues to create collagen methacrylamide (CMA). CMA retains the properties of collagen such as self-assembly, biodegradability, and natural bioactivity but is also photoactive and can be rapidly cross-linked or functionalized with acrylated molecules when irradiated with ultraviolet light {{in the presence of}} a photoinitiator. CMA also demonstrates unique temperature-dependent behavior. For natural type-I collagen, the overall structure of the fiber network remains largely static over time scales of a few hours upon heating and cooling at temperatures below its denaturation point. CMA, however, is rapidly thermoreversible and will oscillate between a liquid macromer suspension and a semisolid fibrillar hydrogel when the temperature is modulated between 10 and 37 °C. Using a series of mechanical, scattering, and spectroscopic methods, we demonstrate that structural reversibility is manifest across multiple scales from the protein topology of the triple helix up through the rheological properties of the CMA hydrogel. Electron microscopy imaging of CMA after various stages of heating and cooling shows that the canonical collagen-like D-periodic banding ultrastructure of the fibers is preserved. A rapidly thermoreversible collagen-based hydrogel is expected to have wide utility in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications as a <b>biofunctional,</b> biocompatible <b>material.</b> Thermal reversibility also makes CMA a powerful model for studying the complex process of hierarchical collagen self-assembly...|$|R
