5|$|The city {{immediately}} sued {{to prevent}} the move, {{on the basis that}} the lease of the stadium was active until 1998. Fans were in an uproar, staging protests, signing petitions, filing lawsuits and appealing to other NFL owners to block the relocation. Advertisers pulled out of the stadium, fearing fans' ire. Talks between the city, Modell and the NFL continued as the Browns finished the season with a 5–11 record. At the team's final home game against the Bengals, unruly fans in the Dawg Pound bleachers section rained debris, <b>beer</b> <b>bottles</b> and entire sections of seats onto the field, forcing officials to move play to the opposite end to ensure players' safety. Cleveland won the game, its only victory after the announcement of the move.|$|E

50|$|The main <b>beer</b> <b>bottle</b> must be {{protected}} and avoid enemies, otherwise a life is lost. If all lives are lost the game is over. Bottles that accompany the main <b>beer</b> <b>bottle</b> cannot ever be destroyed. Once a level has been completed, the player stops by at the pub to buy extra <b>bottles</b> of <b>beer</b> to assist the main <b>beer</b> <b>bottle.</b> Four standard bottles (Stange, Pony, Barbara Braeu and Dunkel) can be purchased from the counter and many others (Can 33CL, Chuebeli, Pokal, Xenon 2 Cannon, plus Bonus Guttere for lives and Speed) can be purchased from the Menu Card. Up to six bottles can accompany the main <b>beer</b> <b>bottle.</b> After each level, the player has the choice of selling the bottles for a small reduction of what they first cost.|$|R

The crowd booed and threw <b>beer</b> <b>bottles</b> onto the field, and the media were highly critical of this unsatisfactory conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The jetty {{received}} {{renewed interest}} with antique bottle collectors {{in the late}} 1960s as the ocean floor surrounding the jetty was covered with soda and <b>beer</b> <b>bottles.</b> Bottle collectors had frequently visited the site since its use was discontinued, but it was noticed that storms would reveal new materials from under the sea bed. The remains of the site were frequently visited by Scuba divers for recreation or bottle collecting. The site is pockmarked by holes dug by these collectors. These collectors had removed almost everything that is deemed attractive material leaving only broken pieces scattered across the site.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese brought beer to Colonial Korea in the 1930s in {{the form}} of German lager beers. After WWII and independence, until at least 1960, all beer in North Korea was {{produced}} domestically. By the 1980s, beer was in such good availability that the common North Korean could drink it. Until the mid-1990s when the state rationing system started to crumble, North Koreans would receive one bottle of Korean liquor soju and three bottles of beer for every major public holiday in North Korea. All North Korean beers are bottled in domestic made glass bottles that are of poor quality. During the North Korean famine, <b>beer</b> <b>bottles</b> were used for intravenous therapy (IV) due to the shortage of proper hospital equipment.|$|E
25|$|In late 1967 {{or early}} 1968, the penniless Driscoll left The Factory and {{disappeared}} into Manhattan's underground. On March 30, 1968, about three weeks after his 31st birthday, two little boys playing in a deserted East Village tenement at 371 East 10th St. found his body lying on a cot, with two empty <b>beer</b> <b>bottles</b> and religious pamphlets scattered on the ground. The medical examination determined that he had died from heart failure caused by an advanced hardening of the arteries because of his longtime drug abuse. There was no identification on the body, and photos taken of it and shown around the neighborhood yielded no positive identification. When Driscoll's body went unclaimed, he was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in New York City's Potter's Field on Hart Island.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} police arrived, {{a crowd of}} 120 had already gathered. Some people from the crowd lit a small bonfire in the street. The crowd {{appeared}} to be a mix of bikers, students, and transient people. A few members of the crowd began to throw <b>beer</b> <b>bottles</b> at the police, and then started yelling obscenities at them. The entire Kent police force was called to duty as well as officers from the county and surrounding communities. Kent Mayor LeRoy Satrom declared a state of emergency, called the office of Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to seek assistance, and ordered all of the bars closed. The decision to close the bars early increased the size of the angry crowd. Police eventually succeeded in using tear gas to disperse the crowd from downtown, forcing them to move several blocks back to the campus.|$|E

25|$|In February 2002, The Living End's line up {{changed as}} Demsey left and was {{replaced}} on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted {{to spend more time}} with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck <b>beer</b> <b>bottles.</b> The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria.|$|E
25|$|As of January 2013, the $17 {{admission}} fee is still imposed by Yaga's Entertainment - one Strand business, Crow's Southwest Cantina, has circulated a petition since Dean is allegedly profiteering but {{has stated that}} a free Mardi Gras is unsustainable. Houston TV station KTRK has stated that Mardi Gras! Galveston is becoming too expensive where local merchants are losing out just to pay {{to be on a}} public street. Galveston Convention Center and Visitor Bureau chair Leah Cast stated on FOX 26 Houston that charging the {{admission fee}}s brings in a quality event inclusive of Grammy-nominated musicians and balcony parties. A few Strand-area businesses claim that the admission fee keeps out the undesirable elements - during the February 9, 2013 festivities in the Strand Entertainment District, seven revelers who refused to leave the entertainment district were arrested by the Galveston Police Department during the street sweep where the police clear The Strand of all revelers. Angry revelers threw <b>beer</b> <b>bottles,</b> trash cans, and barricade fencing at the police where video footage were posted on YouTube. Over a year later during the March 1, 2014 Mardi Gras weekend, the same incident was repeated but Galveston Police officers fired tear gas at 19 partygoers who refused to comply with the police order to disperse.|$|E

He later became a friend of the Beatles, and {{protected}} them from drunken customers. Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment’s window onto the street below, and often started arguments with the audience, so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him, but it was Fascher’s job to protect Lennon and the group. In some occasions <b>beer</b> <b>bottles</b> were thrown at them.
