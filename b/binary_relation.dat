40|$|Abstract. We {{prove that}} algebras of <b>binary</b> <b>relations</b> whose {{similarity}} type includes intersection, union, {{and one of}} the residuals of relation composition form a nonfinitely axiomatizable quasivariety and that the equational theory is not finitely based. We apply this result to the problem of the completeness of the positive fragment of relevance logic with respect to <b>binary</b> <b>relations.</b> § 1. Introduction. Recently there has been a renewed interest in relation-algebraic semantics for substructural and, in particular, relevance logics (see, e. g., Bimbo ́ et al., 2009; Kowalski, 2007; Maddux, 2007, 2010; Mikulás, 2009, submitted). The idea is roughly the following: formulas are interpreted as <b>binary</b> <b>relations</b> and valid formulas correspond to valid algebraic equations of <b>binary</b> <b>relations.</b> In this paper, we look at the positiv...|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, an {{equivalence}} relation is a <b>binary</b> <b>relation</b> {{that is at}} the same time a reflexive relation, a symmetric relation and a transitive relation.

25|$|In general terms, a {{calculus}} is {{a formal}} system {{that consists of}} a set of syntactic expressions (well-formed formulas), a distinguished subset of these expressions (axioms), plus a set of formal rules that define a specific <b>binary</b> <b>relation,</b> intended to be interpreted as logical equivalence, on the space of expressions.|$|E
25|$|Let the {{non-empty}} set S be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, {{every element}} of S has a non-empty intersection with S. We define a <b>binary</b> <b>relation</b> R on S by , which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, {{there is some}} sequence (an) in S satisfying anRan+1 for all n in N. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such S exists.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} new semigroups of <b>binary</b> <b>relations</b> {{that arose}} naturally from investigating {{the transfer of}} information between automata and semigroups associated with automata. In particular we introduce a new multiplication on <b>binary</b> <b>relations</b> {{by means of an}} arbitrary but fixed “sandwich” relation. R. J. Plemmons and M. West have characterized Green's relations in the usual semigroup of <b>binary</b> <b>relations,</b> and we use these to investigate Green's relations in our semigroups.

30|$|Classical RST {{starts from}} an {{equivalence}} relation. Knowledge {{is based on}} the ability to partition a “universe” using the equivalence relation. The finer the partitioning, the more precise the knowledge will be. In an incomplete information system, overlaps may occur among several similar classes defined by the tolerance relation, the similarity relation, or the limited tolerance relation. Moreover, a covering is substituted for the partition of the universe. Thus, the equivalence relation cannot be satisfied for an incomplete information system. The same problems appear for general <b>binary</b> <b>relations.</b> However, research on uncertainty measures based on general <b>binary</b> <b>relations</b> is lacking (Huang et al. 2004). This lack of research motivates the investigation of an effective uncertainty measure based on general <b>binary</b> <b>relations.</b> In the following, an uncertainty measure based on general <b>binary</b> <b>relations</b> will be discussed.|$|R
25|$|Since {{interior}} algebras are (normal) Boolean algebras with operators, {{they can}} be represented by fields of sets on appropriate relational structures. In particular, since they are modal algebras, {{they can be}} represented as fields of sets on a set with a single <b>binary</b> <b>relation,</b> called a modal frame. The modal frames corresponding to interior algebras are precisely the preordered sets. Preordered sets (also called S4-frames) provide the Kripke semantics of the modal logic S4, and the connection between interior algebras and preorders is deeply related to their connection with modal logic.|$|E

Building upon the ideas of the other and Said's work on orientialism, Gregory critiques the economic policy, military apparatus, and transnational corporations as vehicles driving present day colonialism. Emphasizing ideas of discussing ideas around colonialism in the present tense, Gregory utilizes modern events such as the September 11 attacks to tell spatial stories around the colonial behavior happening due to the War on Terror.|$|E

500|$|In mathematics, {{a binary}} {{operation}} is commutative if changing {{the order of}} the operands does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. Most familiar as the name of the property that says [...] or , the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as [...] division and subtraction, that do not have it (for example, [...] ); such operations are not commutative, and so are referred to as noncommutative operations. The idea that simple operations such as the multiplication and addition of numbers are commutative, was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized. A corresponding property exists for binary relations; a <b>binary</b> <b>relation</b> is said to be symmetric if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, equality is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.|$|E
