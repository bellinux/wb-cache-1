The church was originally placed by him under the care of the clergy of the Church of S. Crisogono.

[...] In the seventh century Pope Honorius I (625-638) built a larger church for the increasing numbers of pilgrims; he placed the relics of the saint beneath the high altar, with a window of access from a semi-circular corridor that led behind and below the altar. [...] In the 17th century, it was given to the Discalced Carmelites, who completely remodeled it. The church underwent further rebuilding in the 19th century, having been heavily damaged during Garibaldi's attack on Rome in 1849; but it retains its plain brick facade of the late 15th century, with the arms of Pope Innocent VIII.|$|E

Circuit board fabricators particularly in North America are adopting techniques such as via filling capability with non-conductive, high Tg, low CTE plugging pastes. This paper describes the implementation of the via filling process in a highly effective and reliable fashion for high density, high aspect ratio printed wiring boards. Close attention is paid to use of these via filling materials under high temperature assembly conditions.

Printed circuit fabricators have choices on the technology required {{to build the}} multilayer circuits based {{on the level of}} the technology required. One innovative technology is sequential lamination where multilayer boards are formed by laminating together plated double-sided or multilayers with blind and <b>buried</b> <b>via</b> interconnections. The sequential lamination manufacturing technique can yield even more significant benefits in performance and circuit processing when combined with embedded resistor features within the printed board. Embedded passive technology allows the resistors to be placed on the same layer as the routed traces reducing the need for microvias. This technology also enables resistors to be placed at an optimum location to reduce the inductance impact of pads, stubs, and coupling. The sequential lamination process in combination with thin film embedded resistors requires a different processing sequence than conventional multilayer manufacturing with thin film embedded resistors. Materials for embedded resistor can be either stand-alone resistor foil or a resistor laminate. For sequential lamination applications copper foil with a resistive alloy is preferred rather than a resistor laminate material. The copper/resistor foil has very low profile, and small circuit features can be achieved. Consequently, resistors can be fabricated in signal or power ground layers with multiple resistor values and good finished tolerances. The resistor alloys are robust and have low thermal coefficient of resistivity. The resistors maintain their initial values and reliability through the multiple lamination steps and subsequent thermal excursions required by the sequential lamination process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceModeling up to 45 GHz of {{coupling}} between microvias and PCB cavities considering several {{boundary conditions}} thierry le gouguec 1, najib mahdi 1, ste ' phane cadiou 1, ce ' dric quendo 1, erich schlaffer 2, walter pessl 2 and alain lefevre 3 The {{recent developments in}} electronic cards such as the network equipment are characterized by the miniaturization of the board size and the increasing complexity of the layout. Because of these requirements, multi-layered printed circuit boards are commonly used and vias connecting signal lines on different layers, or integrated circuit devices to power and ground planes, are frequently used and often essential. However, a via is not an ideal transmission line. Besides, it creates discontinuities at high frequencies leading to high insertion loss degradation of signal which limits the performances of integrated circuit and systems. In this paper, the impacts of coupling between via and parallel-plates cavity on the response of microwave integrated devices are highlighted in the first part. Then, to describe the intrinsic interaction between the via transition and parallel-plate modes, the notion of parallel-plates matrix impedances is presented and new boundary conditions like open or plated through holes shielded boundaries of the cavities are introduced. Then, using this physics-based model, an intuitive equivalent circuit has been developed. Finally, the proposed approach and the equivalent circuits were validated by using comparisons with electromagnetic simulations and measurements in different scenarios. Three-dimensional (3 D) multi-layer technologies such as low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) [1] or high-density multi-layers printed circuit board (HD-PCB) [2] are currently being strongly developed because they offer considerable size reduction {{as well as the}} embedded function possibilities. For microwave applications such as filters, couplers, diplexers, etc. [3, 4], these 3 D structures offer new design possibilities for frequencies up to 100 GHz. HD-PCB structures consist of several metal layers separated by dielectric substrates. The vias and microvias used in multilayer PCBs allow connecting lines of different metallic levels together or connecting devices to the power and ground plane [5]. The different metal planes can also be connected together with metallic plated through holes (PTHs). With the rise of working frequencies, the stacked multilayer PCB structures are subjected to electromagnetic phenomena like standing waves in cavities or like coupling and interaction between neighboring components. As example of HD-PCB technology, the AT&S TM (PCB manufacturer) technology used during MIDIMU-HD project funded by the Euripides council is presented in Fig. 1. This HD multilayer consists of eight metallic layers (30 mm thickness) separated by Megtron 6 (Panasonic TM) sub-strate of 95 mm thickness (depending on the metal densities of each level) and with a relative permittivity 1 r ¼ 3. 3 and loss tangent tan(d) ¼ 0. 0065 at 40 GHz. A single microvia hole consists of a central cylinder with a diameter of 140 mm, a conductor pad with a diameter of 240 mm, and when this via passes through a metallic plane it will also have a clearance hole called anti-pad of diameter of 350 mm. AT&S is able to stack more than three microvias and to realize <b>buried</b> <b>via</b> with diameter of 200 mm. The PTHs connecting the metal level M 1 to the metal level M 8 are 200 mm of diameter. Obviously, these multilayer structures which involve parallel planes, dielectric layers, pads, and anti-pads are not ideal transmission components at high frequencies. The electrical behavior of a microvia can be modeled by serial inductance and resistance like is done for a metallic wire [6, 7]. The vias and microvias may cause mismatch [7], crosstalk, reflections, some additional signal delays, and consequently the degradation of signal performance. On the other hand, the coupling between vias, microvias, and parallel plates also {{plays an important role in}} the electrical performances of the via transition [8, 9]. The excitation of the parallel plate modes results in conversion of energy between propagation on line and propagation on guided plated structures which imply some transmission zeros...|$|E

40|$|Trend towards {{downsizing}} {{the product}} size {{and at the}} same time to bring more functionality in electronic products, demands electrically interconnecting several miniaturized electronic components with high counts of I (Input/Out put) on smaller and smaller size printed wiring boards [PWB]. These miniature components occupy lower foot print area but require higher routing interconnection densities. However, the conventional multilayer board technologies exhibit limitations when there is need to connect very high IØ components such as ball grid arrays, which require blind and buried interconnections within the multilayer mono-block. This limitation has given raise to newer methods of multi layer construction. Build–up multilayer PWB is now the technology of choice for enhanced routing capability including blind and buried interlayer connections. Build up methods are based on making very small vias within dielectric layers followed by metalisation. Typically blind and <b>buried</b> <b>vias</b> are very small, and hence called “micro vias” connecting the layers selectively within the multilayer mono-block. <b>Buried</b> <b>vias</b> make the interconnection between the consecutive layers, and blind vias connect the surface layers to any one of the interior layers in the build up multilayer board. If the blind vias are filled with a dielectric, the entire top and bottom surface area becomes available for high -density component mounting. The crux in build up board technologies is the method of creating micro-holes; a micro hole is a hole, which is less than 150 micro meter in diameter. Efforts are made to replace existing metalising techniques with “paste filling” methodologies, which would result in “SOLID CONDUCTING VIAS” CALLED AS “MICRO -INTERCONNECTS” The work reported in this thesis aims at demonstrating one such innovative ‘solid conducting via’ formation without using any of the known micro-hole formation techniques. Based on the results obtained some useful conclusions have been drawn which will perhaps go a long way in the name of “PRINTED PILLAR TECHNOLOGY” a novel methodology for building multilayer suitable for very high IØ components such as “ball grid arrays. ...|$|R

Then, we focus on a more restricted yet common problem: routing highspeed bus structures between two components across a channel. For this problem, we propose an algorithm to route nets on x-y layer pairs. However, for some board designs, <b>buried</b> <b>vias</b> are forbidden due to high manufacturing costs. For these types of designs, we propose a routing algorithm that can route nets within tight minimum and maximum length bounds on a single layer.
