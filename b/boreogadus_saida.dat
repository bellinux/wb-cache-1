25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida)</b> and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other deep-sea species. Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to 18.2 to 27.2kg.|$|E

50|$|Narwhals have a {{very intense}} summer feeding society. One study {{published}} in the Canadian Journal of Zoology tested 73 narwhals of different age and gender to see what they ate. The individuals were from the Pond Inlet and had their stomach contents tested from June 1978 until September 1979. The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida)</b> made up about 51% of the diet of the narwhals, with the next most common animal being the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), consisting of 37% of the weight of their diet. A year later, the percentages of both animals in the diet of narwhals had changed. Arctic cod represented 57%, and Greenland halibut 29% in 1979. The deep-water fish - halibut, redfish (Sebastes marinus), and polar cod (Arctogadus glacialis) - are found in the diet of the males, which means that the narwhals can dive deeper than 500 m below sea level. The study found that the dietary needs of the narwhal did not differ among genders or ages.|$|E

Major fish species include polar cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida),</b> Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis), saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis), least cisco (Coregonus sardinella), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis), inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) and flatfish.The {{eastern part of the}} sea is a major habitat of beluga whales with an estimated population of 39,000. This population is stable and might even be increasing; it is not affected by the offshore oil exploration in the area. Belugas spend summer in the coastal area and Mackenzie River delta, which are free of ice then, and in winter migrate log distances to the polynyas of the deep sea. Genetic analyses have confirmed that belugas of the Beaufort Sea are clearly distinct from those of other Canadian and Alaskan waters, despite they often share a common wintering habitat.|$|E

Two gadoids Arctogadus glacialis and <b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida</b> were abundant in many trawl hauls. In this study, the stomach contents and the stable isotope composition were determined in 60 Arctogadus glacialis and 50 <b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida</b> from Tyrolerfjord and Dove Bugt. The diets were examined by Stomach Contents Analysis (SCA) and compared with chi-square test and Schoener index.

Significant differences were found, mainly in the proportions of two crustaceans, the mysid Mysis oculata and the copepod Metridia longa. Fish {{was found in the}} stomachs of large Arctogadus glacialis. The stable isotope composition was analyzed with Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA). Differences were discovered between species and fjords. Arctogadus glacialis had δ 13 C mean of - 20. 81 and - 21. 33 ‰, δ 15 N mean of 14. 92 and 14. 21 ‰, in Tyrolerfjord and Dove Bugt, respectively. <b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida</b> had δ 13 C mean of - 21. 25 and - 21. 52 ‰, δ 15 N mean of 13. 64 and 14. 47 ‰ in the respective fjords.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Although Arctic cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida)</b> {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as an important trophic link to top predators in Arctic marine ecosystems, the challenges of conducting fieldwork in the Arctic make this species difficult to study. We establish some basic relationships to improve prey energetics modeling when only in-field parameters (e. g., fork length) can be measured. We investigated the intraspecific relationships among energy density, fork length, mass, and water content for Arctic cod captured by Black Guillemots and Thick-billed Murres at two sites (Western Beaufort and Hudson Bay). Dry energy density was similar between sites (21. 6 – 22. 2 kJ g- 1) and increased with fork length (Dry EDkJ/g = 0. 028 (± 0. 01) • Fork Lengthmm + 18. 12 (± 1. 33). Even though fish lost some water as they were transported to the nest by avian predators, wet energy density also increased with fork length. We suggest that environmental conditions had a similar effect on growth at these two locations although they occur in very different oceanographic regimes. Arctic cod, especially large cod, {{is one of the}} most energy-rich prey species in the Arctic. Our results highlight the importance of this valuable prey to Arctic ecosystems and the utility of using seabirds opportunistically as samplers of the marine environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Arctic cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida)</b> were {{captured}} from Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, shipped to Vancouver and reared in holding tanks {{for up to}} three years. Spawning and development of larvae were monitored in two separate years. Fish that were in the laboratory for less than one year spawned during the normal spawning period for wild fish, January to February. The timing of spawning was altered by water temperature and light regime. Elevated water temperature caused spawning to occur earlier, and increased mortality and rate of deformity in larvae. The absence of “light ” and “dark ” seasons may have caused spawning to deviate from the predicted time in successive years. Larvae hatched at 87 – 91 ˚C·days. The newly hatched planktonic larvae were 5 – 6 mm long (total length), non-pigmented, and had poor swimming ability, likely because of the large yolk sac (1. 5 mm in length). Even though swimming ability remained poor for the entire rearing time (up to 100 days), it improved as the yolk dissipated. Yolk nutrition lasted 20 to 40 days after hatching. Healthy larvae remained within the top 15 cm of the water column, and fed on brine shrimp and barnacle nauplii, and oyster trochophores. Growth rate under laboratory conditions was similar to those for fish sampled from the field. Fish that were not near the surface did not grow.

Young polar cod were sampled in the ice-water interface layer in the central Arctic Ocean during late summer 2012. Diets and carbon sources of these fish were examined using 4 approaches: 1) stomach content analysis, 2) fatty acid (FA) analysis, 3) bulk nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analysis (BSIA) and 4) compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of FAs. The ice-associated (sympagic) amphipod Apherusa glacialis dominated the stomach contents by mass, indicating a high importance of sympagic fauna in young polar cod diets. The biomass of food measured in stomachs implied constant feeding at daily rates of 1. 2...|$|E
40|$|The diet of ringed seals (Pusa hispida) from {{coastal and}} {{offshore}} areas of Northeast Greenland {{was determined by}} identifying, to the lowest taxonomic limit possible, all hard-part contents from the gastrointestinal tract of 51 seals sampled (2002 - 2004) in spring (April to June, N = 35) and autumn (September to October, N = 16). The autumn diet was characterized by high numbers of Parathemisto libellula, and the spring diet was comprised primarily of polar cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida),</b> with few invertebrates consumed. The coastal seal diet samples had a diverse fish prey composition (during both the spring and autumn), whereas the open water seals had eaten mostly crustaceans with P. libellula being most abundant. The sample sizes from the various locations and seasons were not large enough to explore age-class effects on diet in addition. Similar to earlier studies, {{this study suggests that}} the ringed seal is a generalist that exploits prey based on availability, with a few key species dominating the diet in an area at least on a seasonal basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{harp seal}} Phoca groenlandica, which is {{numerous}} and {{widespread in the}} Northwest Atlantic, may have a significant influences {{on the structure of}} this ecosystem. To qualify this influence, we must understand the functional relationship between harp seals and their prey. If seals are discriminating in their choice of prey, then their consumption of a particular species will not necessarily vary in relation to its availability or catchability. By applying Chesson's index of selectivity to stomach contents and research trawl data collected in several near- and offshore locations, we found that harp seals preferentially selected capelin Mallotus villosus relative to other prey species, irrespective of their local abundance, when given the choice. Arctic cod <b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida</b> were also preferred in enarshore areas, but not in the offshore. In general, these predators were neutrally selective towards Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides and Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides. These patterns rationalize the dietary patterns reported for harp seals generally. They also explain the harp seals' switch from a reliance on capelin in nearshore waters (where their respective energy densities are similar...|$|E
40|$|Arctic and boreal/temperate {{species are}} likely to be {{evolutionary}} adapted to different light regimes. Currently, the boreal/temperate Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is coexisting with the native polar cod (<b>Boreogadus</b> <b>saida)</b> in the Arctic waters around Svalbard, Norway. Here, we studied light/dark adaptative optical plasticity of their eye lenses by exposing fish to bright light during the polar night. Schlieren photography, high-definition laser scanning and ray tracing were used to determine the optical properties of excised crystalline lenses. Both species have multifocal lenses, an optical adaptation for improved color vision. In polar cod, the optical properties of the lens were independent of light exposure. In the more southern Atlantic cod, the optical properties of the lens changed within hours upon exposure to light, even after months of darkness. Such fast optical adjustment has previously only been shown in a tropical cichlid. During the polar night the Atlantic cod lens seems to be unregulated and dysfunctional since it had an unsuitable focal length and severe spherical aberration. We present a system, to our knowledge unique, for studying visual plasticity on different timescales in relation to evolutionary history and present the first study on the polar cod visual system...|$|E
