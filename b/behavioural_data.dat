25|$|First {{described}} by John Latham as Mycteria asiatica, this species was later {{placed in the}} genus Xenorhynchus based on morphology. Based on behavioural similarities, Kahl suggested {{the placement of the}} species in the genus Ephippiorhynchus, which then included a single species, the saddle-billed stork. This placement of both the black-necked stork and saddle-billed stork in the same genus was later supported by osteological and <b>behavioural</b> <b>data,</b> and DNA-DNA hybridisation and cytochrome – b data. The genera Xenorhynchus and Ephippiorhynchus were both erected at the same time, and as first revisor, Kahl selected the latter as the valid genus for the two species. This and the saddle-billed stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis are the only stork species that show marked sexual dimorphism in iris colour.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the attractiveness of public transport systems, information technology has great potential to add value to their usage. In particular, the availability of digital sources of <b>behavioural</b> transport <b>data</b> opens up new directions {{for the development of}} transport information services which are focused on the passengers' engagement in public transport. This will enable novel perceptions of transport services, encompassing aspects of personal transport behaviour - information related to the transport routines of individual travellers, social transport behaviour - information which creates an understanding of the collective transport usage of social groups - and dimensions of quality-of-transport information which include novel measures of travel experiences such as overcrowding. In this paper, we introduce and discuss a design space of how <b>behavioural</b> transport <b>data</b> can shape more user-centric transport information services in order to inform future research activities in this area...|$|R
500|$|The {{bumblebee}} tribe Bombini {{is one of}} {{four groups}} of corbiculate bees (those with pollen baskets) in the Apidae, the others being the Apini (honeybees), Euglossini (orchid bees), and Meliponini (stingless bees). The corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group. Advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in the group, giving rise to controversy, now largely settled, as to the phylogenetic origins of the four tribes; it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once, requiring the Apini to be close to the Meliponini, which they do not resemble. It is now thought that the Apini (with advanced societies) and Euglossini are closely related, while the primitively eusocial Bombini are close to the Meliponini, which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour. Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth comment that [...] "While remarkable, a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior."

40|$|Many {{recent studies}} of {{internet}} gambling – particularly those that have analysed <b>behavioural</b> tracking <b>data</b> – have used variables such 'bet size' and 'number of games played' as proxy measures for 'gambling intensity'. In this paper {{it is argued that}} the most stable and reliable measure for 'gambling intensity' is the 'theoretical loss' (a product of total bet size and house advantage). In the long run, the theoretical loss corresponds with the Gross Gaming Revenue generated by commercial gaming operators. For shorter periods of time, theoretical loss is the most stable measure of gambling intensity as it is not distorted by gamblers' occasional wins. Even for single bets, the theoretical loss reflects the amount a player is willing to risk. Using <b>behavioural</b> tracking <b>data</b> of 100, 000 players who played online casino, lottery and poker games, this paper also demonstrates that bet size does not equate to or explain theoretical loss as it {{does not take into account}} the house advantage. This lack of accuracy is shown to be even more pronounced for gamblers who play a variety of games...|$|R
40|$|The gall-inducing midge, Dasineura oxycoccana Johnson (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is a pest of cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, and highbush blueberry, V. corymbosum, in British Columbia. Dasineura oxycoccana was {{initially}} found on highbush blueberry {{and more recently}} on cranberry. Given the close proximity of many cranberry and blueberry farms in British Columbia, {{it was hypothesized that}} D. oxycoccana was moving from highbush blueberry onto cranberry. I investigated whether D. oxycoccana populations from these two crops were the same species, host races or sibling species. I examined two mechanisms that could contribute to reproductive isolation between these populations: temporal isolation and <b>behavioural</b> isolation. Phenological <b>data</b> show that D. oxycoccana populations were not temporally isolated, because several generations were active at the same time on both crops. <b>Behavioural</b> isolation <b>data</b> from mating experiments show that these populations are completely reproductively isolated and most likely represent cryptic species...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between mating system and genetic variation in ungulates is {{examined in the}} light of <b>behavioural</b> and ecological <b>data</b> on selected species. Overall results confirm that a model based on increasing genetic variability with decreasing degree of polygyny is realistic. However, this generalization presents a number of difficulties due to (i) species with populations that adopt different mating systems (ii) populations with males adopting different mating strategies (iii) species with similar mating systems but different rut duration, and these must be considered. In conclusion, the difficulty in conducting this kind of comparative studies and the need to restrict comparisons to rather closely related taxa (ie within families) where sound <b>behavioural</b> and ecological <b>data</b> are available are evidenced...|$|R
