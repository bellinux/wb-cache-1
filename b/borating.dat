Scott a copper plated tungsten wire is immersed for about 30 s in chromic acid andthen washed thoroughly in running tap water. Then it is dipped into a saturated solution of borax and heated to bright red heatin the oxidizing part of a gas flame. Possibly followed by quenching in water and drying. Another method is to oxidize thecopper slightly in a gas flame and then to dip it into borax solution and let it dry.

50|$|In {{the copper}} disc seal, as {{proposed}} by W.G. Houskeeper, {{the end of a}} glass tube is closed by a round copper disc. An additional ring of glass {{on the opposite side of}} the disc increases the possible thickness of the disc to more than 0.3 mm. Best mechanical strength is obtained if both sides of the disc are fused to the same type of glass tube and both tubes are under vacuum. The disc seal is of special practical interest because it is a simple method to make a seal to low expansion borosilicate glass without the need of special tools or materials. The keys to success are proper <b>borating,</b> heating of the joint to a temperature as close to the melting point of the copper as possible and to slow down the cooling, at least by packing the assembly into glass wool while it is still red hot.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal {{was invented}} {{which is still}} the common {{practice}} to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as <b>borating</b> the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. [...] The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.|$|E

Both countries have calcium and sodium <b>borate</b> deposits where colemanite, ulexite and borax are the principal minerals. We present here a comparison of the main <b>borate</b> deposits interlayered in continental Miocene volcaniclastic rocks of the Anatolian plateau (Turkey) and those of the Puna high plateau (Argentina). The main <b>borate</b> deposits of Turkey are at Emet, Bigadiç, Kestelek and K›rka. Emet is {{in the western part of}} the Kütahya province. In Emet, a sedimentary lacustrine sequence rich in tuffaceous materials hosts the colemanite section. There are limestones and marl layers at the base and top of the <b>borate</b> section. Arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment) are very abundant and spatially related to the <b>borates,</b> indicating a common genetic origin. The principal <b>borate</b> mineral is colemanite with minor ulexite, hydroboracite, meyerhofferite, and rarer species such as veatchite-A, tunellite, teruggite and cahnite. Colemanite occurs as nodules of different sizes, agglomerated in thick beds. Bigadiç has <b>borates</b> interbedded with tuffs, clay and limestone layers.

40|$|Problem formulation. Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear while in operation. Insufficient wear {{resistance}} of materials limits the growth of machines productivity {{as well as the}} terms of their exploitation. The required complex of properties of piston rings made of cast iron cannot be always reached by applying traditional methods of heat treatment or chemical heat treatment processing. Thus, application of traditional <b>borating</b> methods associated with diffusion of boron into the solid phase leads to the formation of the working layer exhibiting high brittleness. Therefore, the problem of increasing the wear resistance of piston rings without embrittlement is challenging. The use oflaser heating during <b>borating</b> provides the formation of a new layer with special properties. However, the optimum properties can be achieved only after determining the relationship between the parameters of running a process and the depth of the borated layer. Goal of research. To determine the influence of laser heating parameters on the depth of the borated layer, as the properties of piston rings depend on the depth of the latter. Conclusions. Increase in the speed of displacing parts during laser heating reduces the depth of the borated layer, and increase of the spot diameter enhances the depth of the layer. The phases and structural components of the borated layer were interpreted by means of X-ray and metallographic methods. The results of investigations can be applied to other machine parts, which {{are subject to}} intensive wear...|$|E
