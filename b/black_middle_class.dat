5|$|The Chilembwe {{uprising}} was {{a rebellion}} against British colonial rule in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) in January 1915, led by John Chilembwe, an American-educated Baptist minister, whose radical evangelical views of racial injustice {{may also have}} been influenced by millenarian Christian. Based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south-east of the country, the revolt was centred on the <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system, including forced labour, discrimination and the new demands on the indigenous population caused by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{on education and}} aspirations has been produced with the sole focus on the reproduction of class inequalities within a White <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> structure. There has only been {{a handful of studies}} of analytic engagement with <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> parents' expectations and aspirations regarding their children's futures in Britain. This gap creates an opportunity for new research to gain deeper insight into what decisions and choices are made by <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> parents and bring to light important knowledge of professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> educational attainment. The research presented here explored how <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> parents’ construct strategic approaches towards creating better futures for their children within a predominantly White <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> structure. Drawing on primary data taken from interviews with 25 Black African and <b>Black</b> Caribbean <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> parents’ (half from African or Caribbean heritage), this thesis analyses parents’ strategic decision making and navigation in an unequal playing field of education. Findings indicate adaptations of Bourdieu’s social, cultural and economic capitals to prepare and engage their children along certain pathways in order to create aspirational opportunities. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) it is argued that while class is very influential in explaining educational attainment, understanding <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> parents’ aspirations for their children requires a deeper understanding of race. Evidence from in-depth narratives provided an insight into parents' own biographies that were either originally working or <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> backgrounds in shaping their orientations to, and manner of engagement with, their children's futures. Drawing from the data <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> parents were beginning to be geographically mobile, moving out of inner London areas in search of a better quality of life for their children and a preferred school choice – with a higher quality of education found around the surrounding areas of London and the South East suburbs. Parents’ subjective biographies illustrated diverse parenting practices and values such as those sets of parents using their Christian faith to help build a solid foundation for moral values, self-confidence and respectability. The research offers new insights into the choices made and strategic approaches used to nurture high aspirations for <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> children’s futures...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{the recent}} {{theoretical}} {{developments in the}} fields of historiographical and literary research, as respectively promoted by Global History, Postcolonial Studies and World Literature, this paper deals with the formation processes of <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> on a global level, from both a socio-historical and cultural perspective. Starting from the criticism of the Eurocentric model, according to which non-European <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> are to be merely accounted for as imitations of European <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> recent investigations have shown that the longstanding debate between a singular and a plural modernity can be nuanced by the understanding of related socio-historical and cultural phenomena as deeply entangled. Analysing the rise of Southern African <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> as a specific case study, the aim {{of this paper is to}} emphasize the plural and entangled histories of <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> within two national contexts. The analysis of the dichotomy between the white rural <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> (as especially recognizable in the history of South African Boers) and the black urban lumpenproletariat as structuring the political and cultural history both of South Africa and Zimbabwe, in fact, is eventually challenged by the rise of <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in the postcolonial and post-apartheid era. As these processes are rooted in a peculiar habitat such as the farm and exerted through a specific and yet all-encompassing habitus, this paper will retrace these aspects in the history of Southern African literature in English, focusing on recent novels such as John Maxwell Coetzee’s Disgrace (1999) and Peter Godwin’s When A Crocodile Eats The Sun (2006) ...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on data {{collected}} during a 2 -year Economic and Social Research Council-funded project exploring the educational perspectives and strategies of middle-class families with a Black Caribbean heritage, this paper examines how participants, in professional or managerial occupations, position themselves {{in relation to}} the label ‘middle class’. Our analysis reveals five distinct groupings: those who are ‘comfortably middle class’, ‘middle-class ambivalent’, ‘working class with qualification’, ‘working class’ and a final group, ‘interrogators’. However, we note considerable commonality and fluidity across these groupings in terms of participants’ reasons for and, in some cases, hesitancy around inhabiting a particular class location. These responses must be understood {{in the context of the}} relative newness of the <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> and respondents’ broadly similar working-class trajectories alongside ongoing experiences of racism within a society that privileges and gives legitimacy to a dominant White middle-class norm. For many, there is not a straightforward way to be <b>Black</b> and <b>middle</b> <b>class...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to explore the {{perceptions}} of <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers as they relate to teaching and learning in high poverty urban schools. Participants included 11 senior early childhood education preservice teachers at a historically Black college in the southeast region of the United States. The study was conducted using qualitative inquiry. Background questionnaires, individual interviews, and a group interview served as the data sources. While there is an extensive body of knowledge focused on the increasing number of White preservice teachers who lack experience with students in diverse communities, there are limited studies pertaining to the perceptions of <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers who may lack experience with students in high poverty urban schools. In the Black community, color and social class have been inexorably linked for generations. Social class is conceivably one of the most significant sources of inequality in schools and was one of the first factors, after intelligence, researched by scholars as a source of difference in achievement. The study answered the following questions: (1) What are the perceptions of <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers regarding teaching and learning in high poverty urban schools? (2) To what extent do <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers believe they can be successful teachers in high poverty urban schools? The data demonstrated that <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers (a) prefer to teach in communities similar to their own school experiences; (b) believe students from high poverty urban schools can achieve at the same level as students in <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> schools, but are uncertain of the value their informal knowledge brings to the classroom; (c) recognize effective teaching strategies and best practices in classroom instruction; and (d) have mixed feelings regarding their ability to connect with students and parents in high poverty urban schools. Implications from the study include expanding the scope of field experiences for <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers in high poverty urban schools and recognizing <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper <b>class</b> preservice teachers in teacher education research...|$|R

25|$|The Pullman Company {{was also}} {{noted for its}} porters. The company hired black men almost {{exclusively}} for the porter positions (Men of Filipino descent were primarily hired for club car service positions). Although a porter's occupation was menial in some respects, it offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, {{as well as an}} opportunity to travel the country. Many credit Pullman porters as significantly contributing to the development of America's <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> In 1925, Pullman porters became unionized as the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), founded by A.

25|$|For many years, Compton {{was a much}} sought-after suburb for the <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> of Los Angeles. This past affluence is {{reflected}} in the area's appearance—Compton's streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family houses. However, several factors have contributed to Compton's gradual decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base, something that was already sparse due to limited commercial properties. In later years, there were middle-class whites who fled to the newly incorporated cities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Paramount and Norwalk in the late 1950s. These nearby communities remained largely white early on despite integration. This white middle class flight accelerated following the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E
25|$|Haiti elected its National Assembly in May 1946. The Assembly set 16 August 1946, as {{the date}} on which it would select a president. The leading {{candidates}} for the office—all of whom were black—were Dumarsais Estimé, a former school teacher, assembly member, and cabinet minister under Vincent; Félix d'Orléans Juste Constant, leader of the Haitian Communist Party (Parti Communiste d'Haïti—PCH); and former Garde commander Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte, who stood as the candidate of a progressive coalition that included the Worker Peasant Movement (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan—MOP). MOP chose to endorse Calixte, instead of a candidate from its own ranks, because the party's leader, Daniel Fignolé, was only twenty-six years old—too young to stand for the nation's highest office. Estimé, politically the most moderate of the three, drew support from the black population in the north, {{as well as from}} the emerging <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> The leaders of the military, who would not countenance the election of Juste Constant and who reacted warily to the populist Fignolé, also considered Estimé the safest candidate. After two rounds of polling, legislators gave Estimé the presidency.|$|E

500|$|In 1916, Waco, Texas, was {{a prosperous}} {{city with a}} {{population}} of more than 30,000. After it became associated with crime in the 19th century, community leaders sought to change its reputation, sending delegations across the U.S. to promote it as an idyllic locale. By the 1910s, Waco's economy had become strong and the city had gained a pious reputation. A <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> had emerged in the area, along with two black colleges. In the mid-1910s, blacks comprised about twenty percent of the Waco population. In her 2006 study of lynching, journalist Patricia Bernstein describes the city as then having a [...] "thin veneer" [...] of peace and respectability. Racial tension was present in the city: local newspapers often emphasized crimes committed by African Americans, and Sank Majors, a black man, was hanged from a bridge near downtown Waco in 1905. A small number of anti-lynching activists lived in the area, including the president of Waco's Baylor University. In 1916, several factors led to an increase in local racism, including the screening of The Birth of a Nation, a movie that promoted white supremacy and glorified the Ku Klux Klan, and the sale of photographs of a recently lynched black man in Temple, Texas.|$|E

Many Pullman porters supported community projects, including schools, and saved rigorously to ensure that their children were able to obtain an education and thus better employment.
