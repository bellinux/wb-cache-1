30|$|From Figure  5, we {{know that}} the message {{delivery}} rate of each algorithm increases with the growth in the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of nodes. Epidemic algorithm is most easily affected by the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of nodes. As the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of nodes is small, the rate of message delivered is relatively low but the rate of message delivered is more than that of three other protocols with the growth in the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of nodes. For DTSNS algorithm proposed in this paper, its message delivery rate is the largest when the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> is small. And its message delivery rate is only lower than that of Epidemic algorithm when the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> is large. It can be seen from Figure  6 that the result of message transmission delay is just opposite. Above all, it can show how each algorithm depends on network resource. Epidemic algorithm depends largely on the network resource compared with others. In other words, with sufficient network resource its performance is best; otherwise, its performance is worst. For DTSNS algorithm, no matter the case of the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity,</b> whether big or small, it still has good performance.|$|R

A change {{in one of}} the properties of such a protein has to be detected by an appropriate transducer, which completes the biochemical sensor. One of these properties is the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of a protein. If the binding of a substance to a protein can significantly change the proton binding, which accounts for the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of proteins, the detection of this changed <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> enables {{the construction of a new}} type of biosensor.

Three routeing policies, no alternative routeings, alternative routeings dynamic, and alternative routeings planned are first considered with four dispatching rules with infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, in real-life, the size of the local buffers in FMSs may be limited {{by the size of the}} part types. Therefore, further experiments to investigate the above three routeing policies with the four dispatching rules with finite <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> are also conducted in order to study the impact of limited <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> on system performance. In addition, the effect of changing part mix ratios is discussed with both infinite and finite <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity.</b> The performance measures considered are makespan, average machine utilisation, average flow-time, and average delay at local input buffers. The simulation results indicate that for infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity,</b> the alternative routeing planned policy, combined with the shortest total processing time dispatching rule, gives the best results for all the above performance measures. For finite <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity,</b> the alternative routeings dynamic policy gives the best results in three performance measures, except for average delay at local input buffers. Further, the effect of changing part mix ratios is not significant. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of soil in this study was found to depend mainly on carbonate content and cation exchange capacity (C. E. C.) of soils. The magnitude of <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> followed the order: illite $>$ montmorillonite $>$ natural clay soil $ gg$ kaolinite. The study of heavy metal retention in soils was performed both by soil suspension test and soil column test.
