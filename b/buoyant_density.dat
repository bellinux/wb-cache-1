In sucrose density gradients and in the analytical ultracentrifuge, MyLRV and MyLRV(- 3) sedimented as three components, T M and B, with sedimentation coefficients of 50 S, 109 S and 125 S respectively. TBRV-S also had three components sedimenting at 53 S (T), 99 S (M) and 120 S (B).

50|$|<b>Buoyant</b> <b>density</b> {{centrifugation}} {{uses the}} concept of buoyancy to separate molecules in solution. Usually a caesium chloride (CsCl) solution is used, but in the general case it's usually approximately the same density as the molecules {{that are to be}} centrifuged. The sample is put on top of the solution, and then the tube is spun at a very high speed for an extended time, at times lasting days. The CsCl molecules become densely packed toward the bottom, so even layers of different densities form. Since the original solution was approximately the same density, they go to a level where their density and the CsCl density are the same, to which they form a sharp, distinctive band. This method very sharply separates molecules, and is so sharp that it can even separate different molecular isotopes from one another. <b>Buoyant</b> <b>density</b> of majority of DNA is 1.7g/cm3 which is equal to density of 6M CsCl solution. <b>Buoyant</b> <b>density</b> of DNA changes with its GC content.|$|E

40|$|Some of the {{compounds}} used for density gradient separation of blood cells have high osmolarities at the concentrations {{needed to create}} the required specific densities. Several mixed media {{use a combination of}} hyperosmolar shrinkage and red cell aggregation to improve cell separation. Due to the characteristics of Percoll density gradient medium the density and osmolarity of the gradient can be controlled separately. In the present study, Percoll gradients were used to determine the <b>buoyant</b> <b>densities</b> of different human blood cells at the osmolarities 300 mosM, 350 mosM and 400 mosM. Cell volumes were measured at the same osmolarities using a Coulter counter with channelyzer. As expected, the cell <b>buoyant</b> <b>densities</b> increased and the cell volumes decreased at the higher osmolarities used. There were, however, quantitative differences between the cells with respect to the effects of an increased osmolarity, making a 350 mosM density gradient the most effective in separating mononuclear leukocytes from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A 400 mosM gradient offered the best possibilities to separate red blood cells from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A one-step centrifugation procedure, based on these principles, is presented. This procedure makes possible the simultaneous purification of mononuclear leukocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, suitable for functional assays...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{survival}} and <b>buoyant</b> <b>densities</b> of bacteriophages T 4 B, T 4 Bo 1, and T 4 D {{have demonstrated the}} following: (a) After suspension in a concentrated salt solution, T 4 B and T 4 D are sensitive both to osmotic shock and to subsequent exposure to low monovalent salt concentrations. (b) Sensitivity of T 4 B to dilution from a concentrated salt solution is dependent on dilution rate, that of T 4 D is less dependent, and that of T 4 Bo 1 is independent. (c) Sensitivity of all three phages to low salt concentrations depends on initial salt concentrations to a variable extent. (d) Density gradient profiles indicate that nearly half of osmotically shocked T 4 B retain their DNA. Similar analysis demonstrates that few, if any, T 4 Bo 1 lose DNA when subjected to a treatment causing 90 % loss of infectivity. (e) The effective <b>buoyant</b> <b>densities</b> of T 4 B and T 4 Bo 1 depend significantly on the dilution treatments to which the phages are subjected prior to centrifugation in CsCl gradients.
