40|$|Continuous protein {{production}} with <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> in insect-cell bioreactors {{is characterized}} by a dramatic drop in heterologous protein production within a few weeks. This is mainly due to the spontaneous deletion of the heterologous gene(s) from the baculovirus genome and/or to the rapid accumulation of defective interfering baculoviruses (DIs). Cell culture experiments with bacmid-derived baculoviruses showed that spontaneous deletions in the foreign bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences readily occurred, These deletions correlated with a low density of baculovirus homologous (repeat) regions (hrs), which are located dispersed throughout the baculovirus genome and are believed to act as origins of viral DNA replication (oris). To test the hypothesis that deletions are more likely to occur in regions with a low ori density, the properties of bacmidderived baculoviruses with an additional hr in the unstable BAC sequences were compared to the standard bacmidderived baculovirus in a continuous cascaded insect-cell bioreactor configuration. All viruses were equipped with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and a gene encoding the classical swine fever virus E 2 glycoprotein (CSFV-E 2). The insertion of an extra hr in the BAC vector led to improved genetic stability of adjacent sequences, resulting in prolonged protein expression. The maintenance of the BAC sequences appeared to be dependent on the orientation of the inserted hr. The advantages of the utilization of hrs to improve the stability of <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> for the large-scale protein production in insect-cell bioreactors are discussed.

Surprisingly, the tag was easily cleaved when the proteins were expressed in E. coli cells and the tag-free proteins showed fully restored activity. To shed light on this phenomenon we performed molecular dynamics simulations. The latter showed that the tags interact with the receptor binding domains and the flexible C-termini of the fusion proteins thus suppressing their complex formation with the hIFNγ receptor.

40|$|Since {{recombinant}} {{adeno-associated virus}} (rAAV) was first {{described as a}} potential mammalian cell transducing system, frequent reports purportedly solving the problems of scalable production have appeared. Yet few of these processes have enabled the development of robust and economical rAAV production. Two production platforms have emerged that have gained broad support for producing both research and clinical grade vectors. These processes differ fundamentally in several aspects. One approach is based on adherent mammalian cells and uses optimized chemical transient transfection for introducing the essential genetic components into the cells. The other approach utilizes suspension cultures of invertebrate cells. <b>Baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> are used for introducing the AAV genes into the cells. In addition, the baculovirus provides the helper functions necessary for efficient AAV DNA replication.

40|$|<b>Baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> are {{routinely}} {{used for the}} expression of heterologous proteins, affording the user relatively high product yields and a variety of post-translational modifications. The insect cell-baculovirus system utilizing the Autographa californica multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been studied here with regard to product yield and product quality. Product yield was demonstrated to be affected by both the time of infection and the multiplicity of infection. Through experimental results and population modeling of infected cultures, the product yield was maximized by infecting in the early-exponential growth phase with a low multiplicity of infection. The importance of intracellular protein degradation on cloned protein yield and product quality in this system was also studied. Intracellular degradation was observed throughout the infection; however, when compared to the synthesis rate, degradation was found to have an insignificant effect on system productivity. A population of discrete [beta]-galactosidase fragments was observed in protein-radiolabelling experiments. The synthesis rate of these fragments compared to the degradation rate of the complete [beta]-galactosidase molecule suggested that they are probably not a result of intracellular protein degradation. Although proteolytic origin cannot be excluded, transcript hybridization analysis suggests that premature transcript termination may be the cause. It is believed that after premature transcription termination, the transcript is translated to yield the fragmented polypeptides. Other evidence using different recombinant viruses, all expressing related forms of [beta]-galactosidase, are consistent with the hypothesis of premature transcription termination. Although the synthesis of [beta]-galactosidase was most thoroughly studied, transcript heterogeneity and protein heterogeneity were observed for a variety of recombinant viruses with the heterologous gene {{under the control of the}} polyhedrin promoter. When expressing a heterologous glycoprotein, the insect cell-baculovirus expression system produces a heterogeneous population of glycoforms different from those of authentic mammalian hosts. Four different cell lines that can be used as hosts for <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> were analyzed for the existence of endogenous exoglycosidases. Cells derived from Spodoptera frugiperda, Trichoplusia ni, Bombyx mori, and Malacosoma disstria contained N-acetyl-[beta]-glucosaminidase, -acetyl-[beta]-galactosaminidase, [beta]-galactosidase, and sialidase activities. These endogenous activities were also observed in the medium from uninfected and wild-type baculovirus-infected cultures. Lectin analysis of insect cell glycoproteins indicates that oligosaccharides formed in these hosts are susceptible to the exoglycosidase activities identified. On the basis of reports that insect cells lack terminal glycosyltransferases, mammalian [beta] 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase and [alpha] 2, 6 -sialyltransferase were cloned into <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors.</b> The degree of altered glycosylation resulting from the expression of these enzymes in insect cells, alone or together, will require more sensitive carbohydrate analysis than that provided by lectins. ...|$|R

The results demonstrate that the inner capsid protein VP 3 of EHDV- 1 can replace VP 3 protein of BTV in formation of the single-shelled corelike particles and the double-sheled viruslike particles. Moreover, we have demonstrated that all three minor core proteins (VP 1, VP 4, and VP 6) {{can be incorporated into}} the homologous and chimeric corelike and viruslike particles, indicating that the functional epitopes of the VP 3 protein are conserved for the morphological events of the virus.

This recombinant subunit vaccine overcomes some of the drawbacks of classical PPV vaccine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the use of}} a new <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vector</b> to enable the secretion of the major surface glycoprotein of HIV- 1 (gp 120) fused to the carboxy-terminus of the widely used affinity tag glutathione S -transferase. The secreted protein can be purified in a single step with the minimum of denaturation on immobilised glutathione and is as active as the parental molecule in binding CD 4. We use this molecule in a variety of assay formats to examine the gp 120 interaction with CD 26, a reported auxiliary molecule in the HIV entry process. We find no evidence of a CD 26 -gp 120 interaction in the absence or presence of CD 4...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} in vitro {{expression}} and purification of N-terminal fragments of human perlecan in insect cells. Three tailored fragments of human perlecan cDNA were {{introduced into the}} polyhedrin locus of <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> (BEVs) encoding amino acids 1 - 196 (domain I), 1 - 404 (domain I + IIa) and 1 - 506 (domain I + IIab). The integrity of the BEVs was checked by DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme analysis and Southern blotting. Northern hybridization and metabolic labeling with [35 S]methionine showed that expression of the perlecan-(1 - 404) - and the -(1 - 506) -peptide was successful, {{but in the case}} of the perlecan-(1 - 196) -peptide no recombinant protein was produced. Immunoblotting showed that both the (1 - 404) -peptide and (1 - 506) -peptide are recognized by 95 J 10, a monoclonal antibody that was previously raised against perlecan-(24 - 404) -peptide expressed in Escherichia coli. Gel permeation and anion-exchange chromatography were applied to purify the recombinant proteins. Glycosaminoglycans were demonstrated to be present. Deglycosylation with chondroitinase ABC showed that the perlecan-(1 - 404) -peptide was glycosylated with chondroitin sulfate residues. Consistent with these results, glycosaminoglycans isolated from the perlecan-(1 - 404) -peptide were identified as chondroitin sulfate by agarose gel electrophoresis. Furthermore the perlecan-(1 - 404) -peptide showed affinity to immobilized basic fibroblast growth factor. The availability of baculovirusderived recombinant perlecan fragments will facilitate domain-specific investigation of the structural and functional properties of perlecan in the future...|$|R
40|$|Replication factor C (RFC) is a five-subunit protein complex {{required}} for coordinate leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis during S phase and DNA repair in eukaryotic cells. It functions {{to load the}} proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a processivity factor for polymerases delta and epsilon, onto primed DNA templates. This process, which is ATP-dependent, is carried out by 1) recognition of the primer terminus by RFC () binding to and disruption of the PCNA trimer, and then 3) topologically linking the PCNA to the DNA. In this report, we describe the purification and properties of recombinant human RFC expressed in Sf 9 cells from <b>baculovirus</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors.</b> Like native RFC derived from 293 cells, recombinant RFC was found to support SV 40 DNA synthesis and polymerase delta DNA synthesis in vitro and to possess an ATPase activity that was highly stimulated by DNA and further augmented by PCNA. Assembly of RFC was observed to involve distinct subunit interactions in which both the 36 - and 38 -kDa subunits interacted with the 37 -kDa subunit, and the 40 -kDa subunit interacted with the 36 -kDa subunit- 37 -kDa subunit subcomplex. The 140 -kDa subunit was found to require interactions primarily with the 38 - and 40 -kDa subunits for incorporation into the complex. In addition, a stable subcomplex lacking the 140 -kDa subunit, although defective for DNA replication, was found to possess DNA-dependent ATPase activity that was not responsive to the addition of PCNA...|$|R
40|$|The coding regions for the {{seabream}} (sb) alpha GtH and beta FSH or beta LH were engineered {{into the}} <b>baculovirus</b> (bv) <b>expression</b> <b>vector</b> pAcUW 51, {{under the control}} of independent promoters. Expression resulted in subunit association and secretion of LH and FSH by the insect cells. A construct containing the full length beta LH cDNA, joined to the cDNA coding for the mature alpha subunit, was introduced into the pVL 1393 vector to determine whether the active conformation of the heterodimer could be achieved when the two subunits were synthesized as a single polypeptide chain. Media containing the recombinant FSH and LH were applied in vitro to sb gonads, and secretion of estradiol 17 beta (E 2), followed. Our results show that both conformations are capable of eliciting an in vitro biological response...|$|R
