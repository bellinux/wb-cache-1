5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), <b>brachypterous</b> (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E
5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or <b>brachypterous</b> ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are <b>brachypterous,</b> {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E
25|$|Some fairyflies possess {{slightly}} reduced (<b>brachypterous)</b> {{to greatly}} reduced (micropterous) wings, while others {{may even be}} completely wingless (apterous). Wing reduction or absence are usually exhibited {{by at least one}} sex (usually the females) of species which search for host eggs in confined areas (like leaf litter, soil, or the tubules of bracket fungi). They are also exhibited by species which inhabit windy habitats like oceanic islands or in high elevations, particularly endemic species which are found in isolated habitats or are located far from the nearest mainland. In these habitats, wings would only be a hindrance to the fairyflies, so are strongly selected against in evolution. For example, the three known species of fairyflies found in the far southern islands of Campbell and Auckland of the southwestern Pacific and South Georgia of the southern Atlantic, as well as 20% of the fairyfly fauna in the Juan Fernández Islands, Norfolk Island, and Lord Howe Island, are all wingless or short-winged. While wingless and short-winged species may also be found in islands near continents and in continental habitats, they usually constitute {{only a small percentage of}} the overall number of species.|$|E
2500|$|Female adult E. tiaratum {{are covered}} with thorn-like spikes for defense and camouflage. Their long, rounded bodies grow to about 5 to 8inches (20cm) long. The females are further {{described}} as [...] "heavy-bodied, <b>brachypterous</b> and (having) numerous spines and integumental expansions on the face and legs, including a tuft of spines on the conical occiput of the hypognathous head". As mentioned, {{the wings of the}} female are too small for flying, especially when she is gravid.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the only}} known from males, which are <b>brachypterous.</b> It {{is the only}} <b>brachypterous</b> species in the Notodontidae family. Females are {{undoubtedly}} also flightless and perhapswingless, but {{have not yet been}} found.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Brachypterous</b> neotenics, {{which are}} common in the French {{population}} of R. flavipes (formerly R. santonensis), and possibly other populations as well, develop from nymphs via a nymph-like pre-brachypterous neotenic stage. They can be distinguished from nymphs by their shorter wing buds (brachy-, [...] "short" [...] + -pterous, [...] "having wings"), light brown pigmentation, slight sclerotization, and longer abdomens. Like alates, <b>brachypterous</b> neotenics also have compound eyes and ocelli. Female neotenics lay eggs at a lower rate than queens, but when present in large numbers, they may {{play a significant role}} in the growth of the colony.|$|E
50|$|Eremiaphilidae is a {{small family}} of the order Mantodea (mantises). They are {{frequently}} wingless or <b>brachypterous,</b> and commonly encountered in desert environments. Their coloration often matches that of the sand or rocks in the habitat.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{are usually}} found in moist {{habitats}} such as damp meadows, marshes, bogs, and damp deciduous or mixed forests with rich undergrowth. Some species inhabit dry grasslands (some species of Anthomyza and the <b>brachypterous</b> Stiphrosoma sabulosum).|$|E
5000|$|The sexes are dimorphic. Females are <b>brachypterous</b> {{and show}} short hemielytrae, while males {{look like a}} typical mirid bug. In fact, they are fully winged (macropterous), with an {{elongated}} parallel-sided body. The nymphs are light red.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 13-17 mm. The wings are dull medium to dark grey. The costa of the forewings is bright ochre yellow. Adult males are on wing from July to August. Females are <b>brachypterous.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{members of}} this family display sexual dimorphism, males are <b>brachypterous,</b> {{which means that they}} have reduced, {{non-functional}} wings. A unique feature of this subfamily is that all the known species are primary gall formers on Banksia.|$|E
50|$|Adults tend {{to emerge}} in late June to early July. When the climate is mild enough, some can still {{be found at the}} end of October. <b>Brachypterous</b> forms {{disperse}} through the environment by walking along roadside grasses and ditches.|$|E
50|$|Epimydia is a genus of tiger moths in the Erebidae family. It {{consists}} {{of only one}} species, Epimydia dialampra, {{which can be found}} in mountainous steppe areas in South Siberia, East Yakutia and Northern Mongolia. Females are very small and <b>brachypterous.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 38-45 mm for males. The forewing ground colour is uniform smoky {{brown with}} a dull ash-white pattern. The hindwings are contrasting pale brown or yellowish-fawn. Females are <b>brachypterous</b> and dull brown. Adults are on wing from February to April.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 46-53 mm for males. Females are <b>brachypterous.</b> The {{colour pattern}} of the forewings is ash-white on chocolate brown. The hindwings are variable, from nearly as dark as the forewings to yellowish buff. Adults are on wing from February to April.|$|E

50|$|Hyperborea is a {{monotypic}} genus of tiger moths in the Erebidae family. The {{females are}} <b>brachypterous</b> (have reduced wings). The genus contains only one species, Hyperborea czekanowskii, which {{is found in}} the Russian Far East (Nzhnyaya Tunguska river, northern Yakutia, Kolyma river, Koryakia, Chukotka, Wrangel Island, Kamchatka, Stanovoi, Udokan) and Alaska.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary {{reproductive}}s, or neotenics, develop {{from either}} the reproductive line (<b>brachypterous</b> neotenics) or, in rare cases, the worker line (ergatoids). Ergatoids are the only members of the reproductive caste that have neither wing buds nor wings. Like workers, soldiers, and nymphs, they are eyeless. Ergatoids are seldom found in nature.|$|E
50|$|Adult {{males of}} this species like adult males of several other species of Parcoblatta are full winged and orangish in color. Adult females are <b>brachypterous</b> and can be from rusty brown to almost black. Nymphs can be brown to black. Adults and older nymphs usually have a blackish or dark stained head.|$|E
5000|$|Adult caddisflies {{are small}} moth-like insects; the adult Dolophilodes distinctus has brown wings with darker brown markings. Adult females {{emerging}} in summer are winged while those emerging in March are often <b>brachypterous</b> (have vestigial wings). These sometimes breed {{on the snow}} that is {{lying on the ground}} at this time of year.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 47-50 mm for males. Females are <b>brachypterous.</b> The forewing {{pattern in}} males is ash-white or creamy white on chocolate brown. The hindwings are smoky brown. In females, the forewings are patterned in broad, irregular fields of dark brown and brownish fawn. Adults {{can be found}} from March to April.|$|E
50|$|Both {{male and}} female adults are {{normally}} <b>brachypterous.</b> However, a macropterous form, f. diluta (described by Charpentier 1825) also exists. These have much longer wings, and usually make up less than 1% of the total population, but in some populations occur in much higher numbers, usually {{in areas where the}} bush-cricket’s range has recently expanded to.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} katydids, these insects have {{one pair of}} {{forewings}} (referred to as tegmina) and one pair of hindwings. In contrast to many other katydids however, the tegmina of Panoploscelis only partly cover the hindwings. The hindwings themselves are vestigial, extending only roughly 25% {{the length of the}} abdomen. These massive <b>brachypterous</b> insects are therefore incapable of flight.|$|E
