5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of <b>Biochemical</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Demand</b> (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E
5|$|The clear-cutting {{of forests}} in the 19th century {{adversely}} affected {{the ecology of the}} Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while fecal coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E

Compared to raw and decanted waters, the values of chemical and <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands,</b> NH 4 +, total phosphorus and PO 42 -in the purified water were significantly decreased. In contrast, the contents of nitrites and nitrates in the purified water were 56 and 177 times greater (a mean of 0. 11 g/L for N-NO 2 and 5. 5 g/L for N-NO 3). Using a principal component analysis, chemical and <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands,</b> NH 4 +, total phosphorus and PO 42 -were correlated with the raw water, while the purified water was correlated with nitrites, nitrates and electric conductivity. The huge increase of nitrites and nitrates noted in the purified water would {{be due to a}} malfunction of the system, probably in reason of an organic material overload which accumulated in sand filters during water alimentation of basins. Owing the nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the purified water, its reuse in agriculture poses a real problem for soil and vegetation so that an additional treatment is necessary for eliminating these both salts from the purified water...|$|R

5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high <b>Biochemical</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Demand</b> (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E

However, limited long-term research has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of such systems specifically on graywater. This paper aims to determine the viability and efficiency of constructed wetlands for graywater treatment, and assess the water quality produced from such systems.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{evaluating}} water resources is approached {{in terms of}} value foregone due to a substantial extra-basin diversion. A model was constructed to optimize storage-release schedules at each of several parallel and serially-located units of a multiple reservoir system, producing firm and dump energy, irrigation and downstream water, and assimilation of <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demanding</b> wastes. The model is based on the decomposition algorithm for linear programs, with dynamic programs at the subsystem level. A method of allowing individual serially-located subsystems (reaches) to "bid" for releases greater than indicated by the Master (linear) programs from upstream reaches is built into the model. Data for the Columbia and Snake Rivers were used to solve the model, first under "natural" water supply conditions, then under various assumed depletions. The difference between resulting optimal returns in the two cases is interpreted as the value foregone to a region due to a diversion of its water supplies.

30|$|Wastewater {{effluents}} {{from many}} industries, including paper, leather, textiles, rubber, plastics, printing, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food, contain {{several kinds of}} synthetic dyestuffs [1]. Dye-bearing wastewaters exhibit high chemical and <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands</b> [2]. The presence of even very low concentrations in discharge effluents to the environment is worrying for both toxicological and esthetic reasons [3, 4]. To reduce {{the negative effects of}} dye-contaminated wastewater on humans and the environment, the wastewater must be treated carefully before discharge into main streams [5]. Various physical, chemical and biological methods, including adsorption, biosorption coagulation and flocculation, advanced oxidation, ozonation, membrane filtration and liquid–liquid extraction, have been widely used for the treatment of dye-bearing wastewater [2, 6, 7, 8]. Adsorption is a very effective separation technique and is considered to be superior to other techniques for water treatment in terms of initial cost, simplicity of design, ease of operation and resilience to toxic substances [9, 10]. Although adsorption technologies are well established, a significant limitation is the cost of adsorbent materials. This has motivated the search for low-cost and renewable materials for use as sorbents and has led to a growing interest in the use of nonconventional and locally available materials such as natural materials and agricultural wastes.|$|R

Waste stabilization ponds are considered the most economical and efficient method of waste water treatment of small communities. This form of wastewater treatment relies upon the natural ability of a body of water to achieve self-purification. Self-purification involves the reduction of the bacterial content, satisfying the <b>biochemical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands</b> of the wastewater, stabilizing the organic content) and returning the dissolved oxygen content to desirable levels. Overall efficiency of waste stabilization ponds is a function of many interacting processes. The objective of the present study is to gain an understanding of the important factors and an insight into methods of stabilization pond management· that would ensure acceptable discharge standards. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize observations and information gathered at the Harris ponds during the period of July 1989 through October 1990.

Also in this study, QUAL 2 E was used as the water quality modeling analysis tool. It is suitable for one-dimensional analysis with constant flow and it is applied to predict the water quality model for the Johor River. The model was used to simulate both dissolved oxygen (DO) and biological <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (BOD 5) along the certain reach of the river.

Also In order to assess the vegetation buffer strips’ performance, and because of the reducing of the light penetration, harmful algal blooms, decrease in dissolved oxygen, total suspended solid (TSS) was estimated. All parameters are compared to the Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) provided by Department of Environment (DOE). From the finding, the average concentration of suspended solid was 17. 97 mg/l. The trap efficiency for pollution load reduction by vegetation buffer strip was estimated 9. 17 % and this value would be bigger during high discharges...|$|R
