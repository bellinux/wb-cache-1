5|$|The menu at the Whopper Bar {{features}} {{as many as}} 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or <b>blue</b> <b>cheese.</b> The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model {{in that it is}} in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, cheese slaw is {{sometimes}} prepared using <b>blue</b> <b>cheese,</b> and {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} hot dog dressing. In addition to the base ingredients, cabbage is also sometimes used in U.S. versions of the dish. U.S. versions have also been prepared using <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> salad dressing, instead of mayonnaise.|$|E
25|$|In Norway, brunost and gomme (food) {{are also}} popular toppings. As with crèpes, {{there are those who}} prefer a salted style with various mixes, such as <b>blue</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine whether multispectral imagery combined with chemometrics could accurately distinguish and classify different <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses.</b> The images of the pre-packed PDO Bleu d’Auvergne (n = 12) and Fourme d’Ambert (n = 23) <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> were acquired using a custom-design multispectral imager. The image acquisition was conducted in the ultraviolet (360 nm, 370 nm and 400 nm), visible (470 nm, 568 nm and 625 nm) and near-infrared (875 nm and 950 nm) spectral regions. The spectral functions of image texture based on the Fourier spectrum and image weights were extracted from the raw multivariate images using an image processing tool and a method of simultaneous decomposition of covariance matrices, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) of the spectrum functions showed a reliable discrimination of the Bleu d’Auvergne and Fourme d’Ambert <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Examination of the image weights using PLSDA allowed the pre-diction of the producers of the <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Our data demonstrated the ability of the multispectral imagery combined with chemometrics to characterize the quality and identity of the <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> i...|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{flavor of}} <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{tends to be}} sharp and salty. The smell of this food is due both to the mold and to types of bacteria encouraged to grow on the cheese: for example, the bacterium Brevibacterium linens {{is responsible for the}} smell of many <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses,</b> as well as foot odor and other human body odors.|$|R
25|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} of P. roqueforti, named andrastins A-D, {{are found}} in <b>blue</b> <b>cheese.</b> The andrastins inhibit proteins involved in the efflux of anticancer drugs from multidrug-resistant cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|Other {{toppings}} {{can include}} bacon, avocado or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, cheese sauce, chili (usually without beans), fried egg, scrambled egg, feta cheese, <b>blue</b> <b>cheese,</b> salsa, pineapple, jalapeños {{and other kinds}} of chili peppers, anchovies, slices of ham or bologna, pastrami or teriyaki-seasoned beef, tartar sauce, french fries, onion rings or potato chips.|$|E
25|$|Chicken Kiev is {{made from}} a boned and skinned breast which is cut lengthwise, pounded and stuffed with butter. Western recipes usually call for garlic butter, while in Russian ones regular butter is used. Herbs (parsley and dill) {{can be added to}} the butter. In some American recipes butter is {{replaced}} by <b>blue</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{industrial}} {{use of this}} species is the production of <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses,</b> such as its namesake Roquefort, Bleu de Bresse, Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage, Brebiblu, Cabrales, Cambozola (Blue Brie), Cashel Blue, Danish blue, Fourme d'Ambert, Fourme de Montbrison, Lanark Blue, Shropshire Blue and Stilton, and some varieties of Bleu d'Auvergne and Gorgonzola. [...] (Other <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses,</b> including Bleu de Gex and Rochebaron, use Penicillium glaucum.) ...|$|R
50|$|The fungus {{used for}} <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses,</b> Penicillium roqueforti also {{produces}} the mycotoxin Aristolochene, {{as well as}} the neurotoxic Roquefortine C.|$|R
50|$|Worldwide, {{a variety}} of cheeses are marketed under the Castello name, {{including}} semi-soft <b>cheeses,</b> semi-hard <b>cheeses,</b> <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses,</b> and cream cheeses.|$|R
25|$|The major {{industrial}} {{use of this}} fungus is the production of blue cheeses, flavouring agents, antifungals, polysaccharides, proteases and other enzymes. The fungus has been a constituent of Roquefort, Stilton, Danish blue, Cabrales, Gorgonzola and other blue cheeses that humans {{are known to have}} eaten since approximately AD 50; <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> is mentioned in literature as far back as AD 79, when Pliny the Elder remarked upon its rich flavour.|$|E
25|$|The Nauvoo <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheese</b> company started {{producing}} {{cheese in}} the 1930s. It {{was discovered that}} the cool, moist wine cellars in the area were ideal for aging cheese. The wine cellars, and the wine-making business originally started by the Icarians, saw a decline in use because of prohibition. In 2003 the Nauvoo Cheese company {{went out of business}} when it was purchased by Saputo food company and relocated to other facilities.|$|E
25|$|Sweet potato slices are fried in bacon drippings {{and eaten}} with the bacon on toast. Sweet potato fries or chips are another common preparation, and {{are made by}} julienning and deep frying sweet potatoes, in the fashion of French fried potatoes. Sweet potato fries are served {{with a variety of}} {{condiments}} such as <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> salad dressing. Baked sweet potatoes are sometimes offered in restaurants as an alternative to baked potatoes. They are often topped with brown sugar and butter. Sweet potato butter can be cooked into a gourmet spread. Sweet potato mash is served as a side dish, often at Thanksgiving dinner or with barbecue.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{are made in}} a similar way to <b>Blue</b> Stilton. These <b>cheeses</b> get their <b>blue</b> veins and {{distinct}} flavour from the use of one or more saprotrophic fungi such as Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium glaucum.|$|R
5000|$|In the European Union, many <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> such as Roquefort, Danablu, [...] Cabrales, Gorgonzola and Blue Stilton carry a {{protected}} designation of origin, meaning they can bear the name {{only if they}} have been made in a particular region in a certain country. Similarly, individual countries have protections of their own such as France's Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée and Italy's Denominazione di Origine Protetta. <b>Blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> with no protected origin name are designated simply [...] "blue cheese".|$|R

25|$|Tibor, Jason and Gabrielle battled {{it out for}} an Aussie Christmas episode {{which set}} a new {{standard}} {{so far in the}} show. Gold Coast chef/teacher Jason struggled with his signature dish round with his Cafe Del Mare (seafood platter For 2) which he served cold after cooking it too early. Gabs impressed the two male judges with an old favourite, aussie burgers minus the beetroot, and Tibor went over the top with a Jurassic feast of ostrich, barbecued pears with spiced honey, walnuts and <b>blue</b> <b>cheese.</b> The secret ingredient this week was turkey, and while Jason professed his loathe for the bird, he was the only contestant able to cook it properly. Mark, Julia and Ben refused to eat Tibor's and Gabrielle's turkey (as it was medium rare) and declared Jason the winner, although Mark thought he was not the best on the day, preferring Gabrielle as a choice. Clearly Jason's food was presented well and his technique was polished thus the judges wanted to see more and gave him the chance to do so as he was put through to the semi finals.|$|E
500|$|Hodad's {{is known}} for its bacon cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings, and giant milkshakes. At the {{original}} beach location, Hodad's served burgers for 25 cents (...) , with burger prices ranging from $4.25 to $8.25 by 2015. When Mike Hardin took over the business, he began to create burgers with large portions and in 2013, created the Guido Burger, inspired by Guy Fieri and his nickname 'Guido,' who featured Hodad's on his show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Another burger is the Blue Jay, a bacon cheeseburger with <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> and grilled onions. Hodad's bacon patties are of a similar consistency to that of a hash brown.|$|E
500|$|Surrounded by lemon, orange, {{and olive}} groves, the city's culinary {{characteristics}} are rich and heavily spiced but not hot, using various preparations of Ras el hanout (which means [...] "Head of the shop"), a [...] blend {{of dozens of}} spices which include ash berries, chilli, cinnamon, grains of paradise, monk’s pepper, nutmeg, and turmeric. A specialty {{of the city and}} the symbol of its cuisine is tanjia marrakshia a local tajine prepared with beef meat, spices and [...] "smen" [...] and slow-cooked in a traditional oven in hot ashes. Tajines can be prepared with chicken, lamb, beef or fish, adding fruits, olives and preserved lemon, vegetables and spices, including cumin, peppers, saffron, turmeric, and ras el hanout. The meal is prepared in a tajine pot and slow-cooked with steam. Another version of tajine includes vegetables and chickpeas seasoned with flower petals. Tajines may also be basted with [...] "smen" [...] moroccan ghee that has a flavour similar to <b>blue</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E

In 1978, {{it was one of}} the few establishments in Washington, D.C., to serve Guinness Stout on tap. In 1979, Washington Post restaurant reviewer Lon Tuck noted that Old Ebbitt's Omelet Room was one of the most famous locations in the city. Its trademark omelets were the [...] "Old Ebbitt" [...] (made with sharp cheddar cheese and Bermuda onions) and another made with chili and served with a garden salad with Roquefort <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> dressing. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler observed in 1981 that its signature dishes included chili, <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> and Welsh rarebit hamburgers, quiche Lorraine, a Reuben sandwich, and steaks. Its crab cakes were poorly reviewed as too bland and heavy with bread. It was one of the few dining places in the city to stay open until 1:00 A.M.|$|E
2500|$|A Buffalo wing, hot wing or wing is {{a chicken}} wing section (drumette or flat) that is {{traditionally}} fried unbreaded and then coated in sauce. Classic Buffalo-style chicken wing sauce {{is composed of}} a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and butter. They are traditionally served with celery sticks and <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> dressing. Buffalo wings get their name from where they were invented, at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York. In 1964, Teresa Bellissimo at the family-owned Anchor Bar, covered [...] chicken wings in her own special sauce and served them with a side of <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> and celery. In 1980, Frank Bellissimo, the husband of Teresa, told The New Yorker that her buffalo wings were invented out of necessity because the restaurant had gotten an overstock of chicken wings instead of other chicken parts that the couple didn't {{know what to do}} with. On the other hand, Dominic Bellissimo, the son of Frank and Teresa, disputed this story. Dominic claimed that the wings were an impromptu midnight snack that his mother created on his request while drinking with friends. Whatever the story, all of the Bellissimos have since died as {{there is no way to}} verify how buffalo wings were invented.|$|E

5|$|The mould Penicillium roqueforti {{contributes}} {{the blue}} coloration {{and much of}} the flavour in <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> such as Roquefort and Stilton. Mould fungi are processed to produce vegetarian meat substitutes such as Quorn.|$|R
2500|$|Hamburgers and veggie burgers {{served with}} chips and salad, are {{standard}} pub grub menu items. Many pubs specialize in [...] "gourmet" [...] burgers. These are usually high quality minced steak patties, topped with {{items such as}} <b>blue</b> <b>cheese,</b> brie, avocado et cetera. Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served {{in a similar way}} to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.|$|E
2500|$|Gorgonzola (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green rat {{apprentice}} candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder {{having a}} better job than him. He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> {{was one of the few}} foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name [...] "gorgonzola" [...] for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green opossum or a green rat. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode Sniffleball. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.|$|E
60|$|The pass grew ever steeper, but {{now that}} the {{travellers}} were no longer pestered by the Obobbomans they managed to struggle slowly on. And near about sunset they had tugged their way to the top, and came out again upon the mountain-side. They spread out their blankets and threw themselves down, panting, bruised, and outwearied. But they made no fire here yet, because their wood was running short, and all that they had would be needed against the small hours of the night. They nibbled at their <b>blue</b> <b>cheese</b> and a few cold eagle-bones, and, having cut one of their skin-bags to pieces, broke up the frozen milk and shared the lumps between them.|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} of <b>blue</b> <b>cheeses</b> include Gorgonzola cheese of Italy, {{which is made}} from cows' milk; and the French cheeses Fourme d'Ambert from Auvergne and made with cows' milk and Roquefort, which is made with ewes' milk.|$|R
