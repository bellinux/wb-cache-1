40|$|Tests {{have been}} made in a wind tunnel on a number of Savonius rotor {{configurations}} in wind speeds of 6 [...] 9 m/s. The variables tested were blade aspect ratio, <b>blade</b> <b>overlap</b> and gap and the effects of adding end extensions, end plates and shielding. For low aspect ratios (~ 1) with no additions the efficiency was low (- 0. 065) but for higher aspect ratios (- 5) with optimum blade configuration and shielding a maximum value of efficiency of 0. 25 was obtained. Tests with three and four bladed configurations gave appreciably lower values of efficiency. A special study was made of wind tunnel corrections for blockage ratios up to 0. 3...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that waste heats or naturally available heat sources can be utilized to produce swirling flow by a design similar to that of split channels which is currently used to initiate fire whirls in laboratories. The new design combines the conventional Savonius wind turbine and split channel mechanisms. Previous computational and preliminary experimental works indicate a performance improvement in the new design (named as swirling Savonius turbine) compared to the conventional Savonius design. In this study, wind tunnel experiments have been carried out to optimize the swirling Savonius turbine geometry in terms of maximum power coefficient by considering several design parameters. The results indicate that the <b>blade</b> <b>overlap</b> ratio, hot air inlet diameter and the condition of the top end plate have significant influence on power and torque coefficients, while a larger aspect ratio and closed top end plate have some favourable effects on the performance. The optimum configuration has been tested in four different wind velocities to determine its influence on the performance, and power coefficients were found to be higher in high wind velocities. The performance comparison of optimum configuration with conventional Savonius rotor showed an increase of 24. 12 % in the coefficient of power...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{experimental}} findings on a swirling fluidized bed which operates with an annular-blade distributor. Spherical PVC particles (which fall under type D in Geldarts classification) with two different sizes (5. 75 and 9. 84 mm) {{were used as}} bed material to study different bed configurations, {{taking into account the}} variation of fraction of open area (12. 9 and 17. 2 %), <b>blade</b> <b>overlapping</b> angles (9 and 12) and bed weight (500 to 2000 g) for superficial velocities is from 1 to 7 m sec - 1. The performance of the swirling fluidized bed was assessed in terms of pressure drop values, minimum fluidization velocity and fluidization quality by physical observation on regimes of operation. The most significant finding is that the pressure drop of the bed increased with superficial velocity after minimum fluidization, in contrast with a conventional fluidized bed. It was also found that the blade geometry has less effect on bed performance, compared to fraction of open area and particle size. New regimes of operation were discovered, and designated as wave regime and two-layer bed regime. The best configuration obtained in the current work, which provides stable swirling at lower pressure drops, is the one with 60 distributor <b>blades</b> and 12 <b>overlapping</b> angle, operating with 9. 84 mm particles...|$|R

50|$|In {{case of an}} {{even number}} of blades, the two spikes per <b>blade</b> will <b>overlap</b> each other, so the number of spikes visible will be the number of blades in the {{diaphragm}} used. This is most apparent in pictures taken in the dark with small bright spots, for example night cityscapes. Some cameras, such as the Olympus XA or lenses such as the MC Zenitar-ME1, however, use a two-bladed diaphragm with right-angle blades creating a square aperture.|$|R
30|$|Kumbernuss et al.[19] studied two-staged Savonius-type {{turbines}} {{with different}} number of blades, {{the shape of}} the <b>blades,</b> the <b>overlap</b> ratio, and the phase shift angle. The wind turbine was tested under four different wind speeds of 4, 6, 8, and 10  m/s. There were three turbines with the overlap ratios of 0, 0.16, and 0.32. The overlap ratio of 0.16 produced the better performance among the three, followed by the 0.32 overlap ratio. At lower and higher air velocities, the larger and smaller phase shift angles, respectively, will produce better performance of the turbines.|$|R

40|$|The leaf {{shape is}} an {{important}} taxonomic character. Compared to the classic morphological leaf features such as veins, margin indentations, sinuses, etc., the shape is simpler to obtain by using the 'magic wand' or other contouring tools that are available in most of imaging applications. The only exception is when leaves develop large lobes that get in touch or overlap each other, {{as the presence of}} hidden or closed portions of the leaf border precludes the application of automatic methods and forces the leaf contour to be traced manually. This is a time consuming and relatively accurate operation that, nevertheless, can not be avoided, as overlapping lobes are characteristic features of the leaves of several plant species and varieties. The method described in the paper overcomes this problem as it allows the leaf contour to be achieved even in the presence of touching or overlapping lobes. The method involves three steps: (1) the acquisition of leaf images using a transilluminator, (2) a two-level image segmentation that allows all leaf components (<b>blade,</b> <b>overlapping</b> lobes and closed sinuses) to be represented in a single binary image, and (3) the contouring and concatenation of all binary outlines in a single, self-intersecting closed contour that reproduces accurately the leaf shape. The method can be extended to acquire the shape of leaves of herbarium specimens, that are often overlapped but can not be easily handled and repositioned because of their extreme fragility and relevant taxonomic value...|$|R

40|$|In {{fluidized}} bed processes, bed pressure drop is crucial as it determines the pumping power required. However, the physical parameters {{that influence the}} bed pressure drop are yet to be fully established. The present work studies the effect of particle shape on bed pressure drop in a swirling {{fluidized bed}}. The three different shapes of particle used in the work are; cylindrical, spherical and ellipsoidal, with different bed weights (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 kg). <b>Blades</b> with <b>overlap</b> angle of 9 ° and blade inclination of 10 ° were used in this experiment. The results showed {{an increase in the}} bed pressure drop with an increase in bed weight for all three particles regardless of shape. Spherical shaped particles were seen to have the highest pressure drop compared to the others due to a smaller exposed surface area. When the data acquired in the work was plotted a hysteresis loop was observed which was due to the extra energy required for the rearrangement or unlocking of particle at incipient fluidization...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the experimental test results of Savonius-type vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) with different overlap ratios and shift angles. Each wind turbine was tested under four different wind speeds. The power coefficients (C P) of vertical axis wind turbines {{are governed by}} several key factors, e. g. the number of blades, {{the shape of the}} <b>blades,</b> the <b>overlap</b> ratio (OL) and the phase shift angle. The overlap ratio and the phase shift angle (PSA) are the most decisive ones since the measured data shows that their power coefficient drops or rises with them significantly. Three turbines with the overlap ratios of 0, 0. 16 and 0. 32 were designed and constructed. The wind turbines were then adjusted to the phase shift angles (PSA) of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 degrees before testing them in an open wind tunnel under the air velocities of 4 m/s, 6 m/s, 8 m/s and 10 m/s. The results show that a higher overlap ratio has a higher impact on improving the starting characteristics of the Savonius wind turbine than any phase shift angle changes. This investigation shows that a specific phase shift angle in relation to a specific air velocity will increase the power coefficient significantly. Besides the increase of the power coefficient seen at specific air velocities and phase shift angles, did the recorded data show an unexpected second performance peak which appeared at higher tip speed ratios. This is surprising since the Savonius turbine is considered as being a drag driven turbine, and suggests that the lift characteristics of Savonius turbines might be more significant than commonly considered.

50|$|If a {{point has}} been awarded, then the {{competitors}} {{return to their}} en-garde lines; if not, they remain approximately where they were when the bout was interrupted. The referee will then restart the bout as before. If the fencers were within lunging distance when the bout was interrupted {{and they are not}} required to return to their en-garde lines, the referee will ask both fencers to give sufficient ground to ensure a fair start. A common way of establishing the correct distance is to ask both fencers to straighten their arms and to step back to the point where their <b>blades</b> no longer <b>overlap</b> in the referee's view. If a fencer needs to stop the bout to adjust his/her mask or tie his/her shoe, or something else requires the referee's attention, he/she may do so by tapping their back foot and/or waving their back hand and the referee will generally call a halt. Tapping the front foot is called an appel and is actually a tactical move, intended to distract the opposing fencer; thus, the referee may ignore a front-foot tap.|$|R
50|$|Most {{scissors}} are best-suited for {{use with}} the right hand, but left-handed scissors are designed {{for use with}} the left hand. Because scissors have <b>overlapping</b> <b>blades,</b> they are not symmetric. This asymmetry is true regardless of the orientation {{and shape of the}} handles: the blade that is on top always forms the same diagonal regardless of orientation. Human hands are also asymmetric, and when closing, the thumb and fingers do not close vertically, but have a lateral component to the motion. Specifically, the thumb pushes out from the palm and the fingers pull inwards. For right-handed scissors held in the right hand, the thumb blade is closer to the user's body, so that the natural tendency of the right hand is to force the cutting blades together. Conversely, if right-handed scissors are held in the left hand, the natural tendency of the left hand would be to force the cutting blades laterally apart. Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right hand, the shearing edge is visible, but when they are used with the left hand, the cutting edge of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.|$|R
40|$|Under the {{intrinsic}} variability {{of the wind}} speed and its exponential relationship with the rotor torque, the power control systems play an increasingly important role in terms of efficiency {{and stability in the}} modern and large wind turbines. The paper describes a power control system based on swept band area dimensional regulation (DBB) that it is particularly well suited for off-shore wind turbines. After an introduction of the modern power control strategies and revised their current limitations, the theoretical fundamentals of the new approach are formulated. The system operates jointly with pitch or active stall controls but dedicated to the low wind speed range. In this range, the dynamic pair of <b>overlapping</b> <b>blade</b> segments may increase or decrease their swept band areas aiming to reach a constant rated power output. With maximum total swept area larger and with minimum swept area lesser than the current wind turbines of the same class, the proposed control system may provide the rated power of the wind turbine in a broader wind speed range. Preliminary simulation results in the experimental offshore wind site of “Mar de Canarias ” are presented. These results show an augmented annual energy yield that remarkably compensates the added complexity due to the incorporation of the new control system. ...|$|R
40|$|Small grazing motile epifaunal {{invertebrates}} play {{an important}} ecosystem role on coral reefs, influencing both the abundance and composition of macroalgal communities and acting as a key food source {{for a range of}} predatory fishes. The first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the associations between motile epifaunal communities and four common macroalgal species (Lobophora variegata, Dictyota divaricata, Microdictyon marinum and Halimeda opuntia) on fore-reef environments in the Exuma Cays (Bahamas, wider Caribbean). Secondly, we investigated the implications of the well documented rise of Caribbean macroalgal cover on invertebrate densities by surveying sites inside and outside the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP), where increases in parrotfish grazing intensity inside the marine reserves have led to reductions in macroalgal cover. Therefore, surveys compared similar reefs with significantly different macrolagal cover. Comparisons between macroalgal species revealed a four to fivefold difference in motile epifaunal densities per unit volume of macroalgae. Post-hoc tests revealed that this difference was significant only for Lobophora, with no difference observed among the other species. As macroalgae provide both a refuge from predation and a food source for grazing epifauna, the higher densities of epifauna observed in Lobophora may be attributed to either refuge from visual predators through morphological features (high cover of <b>overlapping</b> <b>blades</b> close to the substrate) or lack of palatability for parrotfish grazing, providing a more stable refuge. Our results revealed no significant differences in diversity, density or community structure of motile epifauna per unit volume of macroalgae between sites inside and outside the ECLSP. Since canopy height and invertivore biomass did not vary systematically across reserve boundaries, this suggests that algal cover does not affect the density of epifaunal invertebrates. However, areal cover was consistently higher for all macroalgal species at sites outside the ECLSP than those inside the reserve. Therefore, when scaled by aerial cover of macroalgae, total abundance of epifauna was twofold higher outside the ECLSP. We suggest that the increasing abundance of macroalgae on Caribbean reefs may be having dramatic effects on epifaunal invertebrate populations and potentially their ecological functions...|$|R
