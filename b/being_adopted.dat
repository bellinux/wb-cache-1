Most of the {{remaining}} members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after <b>being</b> <b>adopted</b> as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.|$|E

5|$|Dillon started DragonFly in {{the belief}} that the methods and {{techniques}} <b>being</b> <b>adopted</b> for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 would lead to poor system performance and cause maintenance difficulties. He sought to correct these suspected problems within the FreeBSD project. Due to ongoing conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas, his ability to directly change the FreeBSD codebase was eventually revoked. Despite this, the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together contributing bug fixes, driver updates, and other system improvements to each other.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated much controversy {{and led to}} the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}.

50|$|Human-centered {{computing}} {{researchers and}} practitioners usually come {{from one or}} more of disciplines such as computer science, human factors, sociology, psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, communication studies, graphic design and industrial design.

Others focus on designing and developing new computational artifacts.|$|R

5|$|In Italy, {{the idea}} of an Unknown Soldier {{memorial}} was particularly popular, both because lists of memorial names were less common and because Italy had suffered particularly heavily from unidentifiable casualties {{as a result of the}} campaigns in the Alps — as many of 60% of the corpses buried at Redipuglia were unidentifiable. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Rome was built in 1921, with other unidentifiable bodies <b>being</b> <b>adopted</b> by local cults of the dead across Italy. The Italian tomb was significant in political terms; Italy was deeply divided in the post-war years and the Liberal government hoped that the opening would reunify the country. In practice, the tomb became a point of tension between the Liberals and the Italian Fascist movement, and Benito Mussolini claimed to have timed his seizure of power the next year to ensure that the 1922 ceremonies at the tomb would occur under a Fascist government.|$|E
5|$|Martín also meets three orphan siblings, José, Laura, and Coqui, who {{resisted}} <b>being</b> <b>adopted</b> {{by different}} families.

Esperanza does not tell Martín about her relations with Quique, instead pretending to be his sister. She also does not tell Martín {{that she is a}} boxer. Quique and Constanza begin their own relationship, unknown by most other characters. Martín breaks off his relationship with Esperanza when he sees her goodbye kiss with Quique, as he realizes that she was lying to him.|$|E
5|$|On 6December1961, {{prior to}} the design being {{submitted}} to NATO, {{it was decided that}} the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy. In February1962, the Royal Navy's Admiralty received the aircraft concept with great interest as the Royal Navy {{was in the process of}} seeking a new interceptor aircraft for use on their aircraft carriers at the time. By March 1962, the Ministry of Defence was openly interested in the potential for the P.1154 <b>being</b> <b>adopted</b> as a replacement for both the RAF's fleet of Hawker Hunters and the Royal Navy's de Havilland Sea Vixens. Accordingly, in April 1962, a first draft of a new joint Naval/Air Staff requirement was issued in the form of Specification OR356/AW406, to which HSA had submitted a response by June of that year. Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention onto working upon this joint requirement.|$|E

25|$|Other non-Marxist critics {{argued that}} Cohen, {{in line with}} the Marxist tradition, underestimated the role played by the legal and {{political}} superstructure in shaping the character of the economic base. Finally, Cohen's anthropology was judged dubious: whether human <b>beings</b> <b>adopt</b> new and more productive technology is not a function of an ahistorical rationality, but depends {{on the extent to which}} these forms of technology are compatible with pre-existing beliefs and social practices. Cohen recognised and accepted some, though not all, of these criticisms in his History, Labour, and Freedom (1988).|$|R

These techniques are less aggressive than conventional tillage, and {{have a lot of}} effects on physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. Moreover, these techniques seem to have positive effects on yield, working time, carbon sequestration, and economic balances at farm level. They seem to be an interesting alternative to conventional tillage in terms of feasibility and sustainability...|$|R
5|$|The Organic Laws were {{drafted by}} a {{legislative}} committee on May 16, 1843 and June 28, 1843, before <b>being</b> <b>adopted</b> on July 5. Although not a formal constitution, the document outlined {{the laws of}} the government. Two years later, on July 2, 1845, a new set of Organic Laws was drafted to revise and clarify the previous version; this newer version was adopted by a majority vote of the people on July 26, 1845. This constitution-like document divided the government into three departments: a judiciary branch, an executive branch, and a legislature. The definition of the executive branch had previously been modified, in late 1844, from a three-person committee to a single governor; this change took effect in 1845.|$|E

Similar radar upgrades were also proposed for F-5F, with the derivative of AN/APQ-159, the AN/APQ-167, to replace the AN/APQ-157, but that was cancelled. The latest radar upgrade included the Emerson AN/APG-69, which was the successor of AN/APQ-159, incorporating mapping capability. However, most nations chose not to upgrade for financial reasons, and the radar saw very little service in USAF aggressor squadrons and Swiss air force.|$|R
