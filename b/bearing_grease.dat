50|$|Lubrication can be {{done with}} a grease, which has {{advantages}} that grease is normally held within the bearing releasing the lubricant oil as it is compressed by the balls. It provides a protective barrier for the bearing metal from the environment, but has disadvantages that this grease must be replaced periodically, and maximum load of bearing decreases (because if bearing gets too warm, grease melts and runs out of bearing).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the yield stress and start-up torque for six commonly used rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>greases</b> is presented. Both parameters were found to depend exponentially on temperature where the exponent changes below a low-temperature “break point. ” This break point {{was found to be}} related to the pourpoint of the base oil, although the start-up torques of the greases were an order higher in magnitude than that of their corresponding bled oils. The start-up torque is mostly used to measure the low-temperature limit of a grease. It was found here that this temperature is much lower than the break point. The start-up torque criterion is measured using a particular bearing type and conditions. The low-temperature break point for the yield stress is a more universal grease parameter that gives useful information about the behavior of a grease at low temperatures and can be used as one of the guidelines for grease selection for low-temperature application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Basically, rolling <b>bearings</b> <b>greases</b> are {{consisting}} of two main components: a lubricating liquid, generally oil, and a thickening agent. The most used lubricants of this type in rolling contacts lubrication are mineral oil and Lithium soaps based, their properties being improved by adding the appropriate additives for specific technical applications. Here it can be highlighted their particular constitutive aspect given by the soap three-dimensional network ({{consisting of}} twisted or flatted fibres) that contains the base oil. Both fibres elementary dimensions and the soap structural uniformity are different from a manufacturer to other being influenced by the processing technology, by the raw materials provenience or by the thickener quantity or the presence of additives. Lubricating greases behaviour is dependant on their initial structure and also by their rheology under the external loads influence, all this aspects having a strong influence on greases service life.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} new results {{examining the}} relationship between <b>bearing</b> <b>grease</b> composition and rolling-sliding friction in lubricated contacts. Friction coefficient and lubricating film thickness {{of a series of}} commercially available bearing greases and their bled oils were measured in laboratory tribometers.

The trends in measured friction coefficients were analysed in relation to grease composition in an attempt to establish the relative influence of individual grease components on friction. Two distinct operating regions with markedly different friction behaviour are identified for each grease. At relatively high speeds the greases behave approximately as their bled/base oils, while in the low speed region the frictional response is very dependent on their thickener type and properties of the lubricating film. Low viscosity, synthetic base oil seems to offer efficiency advantages in the high speed region regardless of thickener used, while the choice of thickener type is significant under low speed conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{two most}} often used methods for rolling {{bearings}} condition monitoring are thermographic inspection and vibrodiagnostic. However, analysis of the relevant literature has shown that so far there is no established correlation between rolling bearings surface temperatures and measured radial vibration intensities. These variables also strongly depend on rolling bearing’s service life and it’s environmental operating conditions, especially in case of open pit coal mine conveyor idler’s rolling bearings; where high concentration of debris particles (such as surface dust, dirt and excavated coal) is present.

40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{developments}} of IGBT technology, switching time and frequency are dramatically increased. At higher carrier frequencies, IGBTs induce more capacitive coupled current into a rotor and a stator frame {{and lead to}} faster bearing damage. Common mode voltage enables motor to create shaft voltage through electrostatic couplings between the rotor and the stator windings and between the rotor and the frame, and it can caused bearing currents when the shaft voltage exceeds a breakdown voltage level of the <b>bearing</b> <b>grease.</b> Also, high frequency leakage current occurs through stray capacitors between stator winding and the motor frame due to {{a high rate of}} the common mode dv/dt at motor terminals which can produce induced shaft voltage.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of the grease used to lubricate railroad bearings {{is believed to be}} caused by two processes: the mechanical processes occurring within the bearing and a diffusion process. Appropriate lubrication of the bearings is critical during railroad service operation. The study presented here will focus on the development of empirical models that can accurately predict the residual useful life of railroad <b>bearing</b> <b>grease.</b> Modeling techniques to be employed include regression, regression trees and split plots. The data set used {{in the development of the}} model consists of more than 100 samples of grease that were taken from railroad bearings. The bearings have been subjected to experimental variables such as load conditions, rotational speed, temperature, and mileage all of which have been observed in a laboratory setting. The mileage parameter is consistent with the total miles that were run using the grease from which the sample has been taken. Load, speed, and temperature values fluctuate within the total service operation of the bearing; therefore, a high value, a low value, and a weighted average are taken for the aforementioned parameters. The grease samples are taken from critical locations of the bearing, the inboard raceway, the outboard raceway and the spacer ring area, meaning that there are three samples collected from each railroad bearing, each having their own set of corresponding parameters. The oxidation induction time (OIT) of the grease is an indicator of the residual life of the grease; therefore, the OIT for each sample had been acquired using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). OIT is dependent upon mileage, load, speed, and temperature. This study was successful in developing an empirical model which can be utilized to predict the residual life for given operational characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of base oil type and viscosity on the frictional behaviour of lithium-thickened <b>bearing</b> <b>greases.</b> A series of model lithium greases were manufactured by systematically varying viscosity and type of base oil, so that {{the influence of}} a single base oil property could be studied in isolation. In addition, selected greases were blended with oleic acid, with the purpose of evaluating its effectiveness in further reducing grease friction. Friction coefficient and film thickness were measured in laboratory ball-on-disc tribometers over a range of speeds and temperatures. For a specific oil type, the influence of base oil viscosity on friction was found to be closely related to its effect on film thickness: greases formulated with PAO oils covering a wide range of viscosities gave very similar friction at the same nominal film thickness. For a given base oil viscosity, base oil type was found to have a strong influence on grease friction under all test conditions. PAO-based greases generally produced lower friction than mineral- and ester-based greases. Addition of oleic acid to the test greases did not significantly affect friction within the range of test conditions employed in this study. The results provide new insight into the frictional behaviour of greases, which may be used to help inform new low-friction grease formulations for rolling bearing applications...|$|R

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} {{are among}} the most widely used machine elements. As a result, reducing bearing frictional losses can {{have a significant impact on}} the overall energy efficiency of the vast majority of engineering systems. Given that rolling bearings are typically lubricated with grease, one of the most effective ways to improve bearing efficiency is through a suitable grease formulation. However, at present there is a lack of understanding of grease frictional behaviour in typical non-conformal, highly stressed bearing contacts. This limits the development of low-friction bearing greases, and thus further improvements in bearing efficiency. The current research work attempts to address this topic through an experimental investigation. Friction and film thickness tests were conducted on a wide selection of greases in ball-on-disc tribometers, under conditions broadly representative of rolling bearing contacts. Initial work was carried out with a series of commercially available greases, selected to cover a wide spectrum of thickener types, base oil types and viscosities, and practical bearing applications. These tests served to identify the most influential aspects of grease formulation on friction, and provide a reference line in terms of the current state of the art in low-friction bearing greases. Subsequently, the work was focussed on the study of a series of custom lithium-thickened greases. These were designed and manufactured with the purpose of isolating and investigating the effects of particular aspects of interest in grease formulation, including base oil type, base oil viscosity and the presence of friction modifiers. In addition, the performance of the corresponding bled and base oils was also studied to help shed some light on the prevailing mechanisms. The results show that two distinct operating regions, at high and low speeds, can be identified in the tribological performance of greases. At high speed greases behave approximately as their base oils. In this region, oil type was found to be the major parameter of influence on friction, with synthetic oils (particularly PAO) providing the lowest friction coefficients. In the same high speed region, the influence of base oil viscosity is that expected from a classical Stribeck relationship for oils, i. e. higher base oil viscosities in the grease formulation tend to produce higher friction as a result of thicker films. In contrast, at low speed grease behaviour is much more complex and is strongly influenced by both base oil and thickener properties. In this region the combination of lithium and PAO was shown to provide both thick films and low friction. No benefit in friction reduction was observed when a friction modifier, namely oleic acid, was added to the formulation of the greases. The influence of mechanical degradation of greases on their tribological performance was also evaluated. It was established that mechanical degradation has the effect of diminishing the friction and film thickness benefits provided by some of the greases at low speeds. A remarkable exception was found in the tribological behaviour of greases formulated with lithium and PAO oil, which was overall practically unaffected by mechanical degradation. Finally, based on the observed results, the combination of a low viscosity PAO base oil and lithium thickener was suggested as the most suitable formulation for a low-friction rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>grease.</b> Open Acces...|$|E

Unreviewed Safety Question Determination (USQD) TF- 96 - 0018 verified that the installation of two mixer pumps into Tank 241 -AZ- 101 was within the current Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Authorization Basis. USQDs TF- 96 - 0461, TF- 96 - 0448, and TF- 96 - 0805 verified that the installation of the in-tank video camera, thermocouples, and Ultrasonic Interface Level Analyzer (URSILLA), respectively, were within the current TWRS Authorization Basis. USQD TF- 96 - 1041 verified that the checkout testing of the installed equipment was within the current TWRS Authorization Basis. Installation of the pumps and equipment has been completed. An evaluation of safety considerations associated with operation of the mixer pumps for the mixer pump test is provided in this document. This document augments the existing AWF authorization basis as defined in the Interim Safety Basis (Stahl 1997), and as such, will use the existing Interim Operational Safety Requirements (IOSRs) of Heubach 1996 to adequately control the mixer pump test. The hazard and accident analysis is limited to the scope and impact of the mixer pump test, and therefore does not address hazards already addressed by the current AWF authorization basis. This document does not evaluate removal of the mixer pumps. Safety considerations for removal of the pumps will be addressed by separate safety documentation once that portion of the mission is defined. The mixer pump test has been evaluated to cover the use of either the existing ventilation system (241 -A- 702) or the ventilation system upgrade provided by Project W- 030. Analysis of Project W- 030 is outside of the scope of this document and is addressed in HNF-SD-WM-SARR- 039 (Draft) which, should the W- 030 system be in service {{at the time of the}} mixer pump test, will have been approved and made a part of the TWRS authorization basis. The test will use two high-capacity mixer pumps in various configurations and modes to demonstrate solids mobilization of waste in Tank 241 -AZ- 101. The information and experience gained during the test will provide data for comparison with sludge mobilization prediction models; provide data to estimate the number, location, and cycle times of the mixer pumps; and provide indication of the effects of mixer pump operation on the AWF tank systems and components. The slurry produced will be evaluated for future pretreatment processing. This process test does not transfer waste from the tank; the waste is mixed and confined within the existing system.
