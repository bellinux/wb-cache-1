5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and <b>brown</b> <b>skin.</b> For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{analysis}} of Cro-Magnon fossils indicates {{that they had}} larger skulls than modern populations, and possessed a dolichocephalic (long-headed) and low cranium, with a wide face. It also suggests that some Cro-Magnons may have had <b>brown</b> <b>skin.</b> The very light skin tone found in modern Northern Europeans is a relatively recent phenomenon. It may {{have appeared in the}} European line as recently as 6 to 12 thousand years ago, indicating that Cro-Magnons had <b>brown</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Three main {{areas of}} the world's {{geography}} have been mentioned: a mainland continent consisting of the Northern Lands and the Southern Lands, and the separate Western Continent. The Northern Lands seem to consist mostly of grassy plains and mountains, which resemble medieval Europe in setting, but with {{a wider variety of}} skin colors than was present in medieval Europe. For example, Roy Greenhilt and his family have dark <b>brown</b> <b>skin,</b> and are not referred to as coming from a different area or having a different cultural background than the characters with light skin. Other characters, such as the lawyer Phil Rodriguez, show a third (light <b>brown)</b> <b>skin</b> color. Non-human races, which are often player characters in D, such as dwarves and gnomes, have both dark- and light-skinned members as well.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} all these words of praise, no one left a more {{detailed}} description of Eleanor; the colour of her hair and eyes, for example, are unknown. The effigy on her tomb shows a tall and large-boned woman with <b>brown</b> <b>skin,</b> though {{this may not be}} an accurate representation. Her seal of 1152 shows a woman with a slender figure, but this is likely an impersonal image.|$|E

25|$|I {{am proud}} of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his <b>brown</b> <b>skin,</b> and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured.

25|$|Minocycline {{may cause}} upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, {{headache}} and vomiting. Minocycline increases sensitivity to sunlight. Minocycline {{may affect the}} quality of sleep and rarely cause sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline {{over an extended period of}} time can lead to blue-gray skin, fingernails and staining of scar tissue. This staining is not permanent but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; on the other hand a muddy <b>brown</b> <b>skin</b> color in sun exposed areas is usually a permanent skin discolouration. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.|$|E

The importance of Mulan and other non-white princesses {{can be seen in the}} 2009 study of the effects of children's cartoons on the body image of young girls by doctors Sharon Hayes and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn. The study revealed that in the group of girls ranging from 3 to 6 years old, 30.6% of the group would change their physical appearance if they could. Of these respondents, over half would change their hair and over a quarter would change something about their body, such as skin color. Of all girls surveyed, 8% said they would have to change their hair or skin color to become a princess, stating things like they would [...] "change from <b>brown</b> <b>skin</b> to white skin", for example. The interviewed group was predominantly white.|$|E
500|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} considered to be only one living species of tuatara, two species were previously identified: Sphenodon punctatus, or Northern tuatara, and the much rarer Sphenodon guntheri, or Brothers Island tuatara, which is confined to North Brother Island in Cook Strait. The specific name punctatus is Latin for [...] "spotted", and guntheri refers to German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther. A 2009 paper re-examined the genetic bases used to distinguish the two supposed species of tuatara, and concluded they only represent geographic variants, and only one species should be recognized. Consequently, the Northern tuatara is now classified as Sphenodon punctatus punctatus and the Brothers Island tuatara as Sphenodon punctatus guntheri. The Brothers Island tuatara has olive <b>brown</b> <b>skin</b> with yellowish patches, while the colour of the Northern tuatara ranges from olive green through grey to dark pink or brick red, often mottled, and always with white spots. In addition, the Brothers Island variant is considerably smaller. [...] An extinct species of Sphenodon was identified in November 1885 by William Colenso, who was sent an incomplete sub-fossil specimen from a local coal mine. Colenso named the new species S. diversum.|$|E

2500|$|Sholapith is a milky-white sponge-wood {{which is}} carved into {{delicate}} and beautiful objects of art. Shola is a plant which grow wild in marshy waterlogged areas.

2500|$|According to Ashley Montagu, [...] "among {{both the}} Northern and Eastern Hamites {{are to be}} found some of the most {{beautiful}} types of humanity". Typical Hamitic physical traits included narrow facial features; an orthognathous visage; light brown to dark <b>brown</b> <b>skin</b> tone; wavy, curly or straight hair; thick to thin lips without eversion; and a dolichocephalic to mesocephalic cranial index. These somatic attributes varied depending on the environment and through contact with non-Hamitic stocks. Among the Western Hamites, Semitic and Negroid influences could be found in urban areas, with a Nordic strain present in the northwestern mountains. Similar non-Hamitic elements also existed among the Eastern Hamites, but with a more marked Negroid influence in areas bordering the Upper Nile and Great Lakes and a pronounced Armenoid strain in the Eastern Desert.|$|E
2500|$|Women in Hawaii {{are women}} {{residing}} and {{are from the}} Hawaiian Islands. They are citizens of the United States because Hawaii {{is one of the}} 50 U.S. states. Hawaiian women descended from Polynesians who migrated, in two waves, to Hawaii. Together with men and children, the first wave of Polynesian women who became known as women of Hawaii came from the Marquesas Islands, probably about AD 400; the second wave of female Polynesian migrants came from Tahiti to Hawaii in the 9th or 10th century. In general, like Hawaiian men, Hawaiian women were people who have <b>brown</b> <b>skin</b> with straight or wavy black hair.

Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to.
