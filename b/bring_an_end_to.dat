5|$|Lochry's {{force was}} part of an army being raised by George Rogers Clark for a {{campaign}} against Detroit, the British regional headquarters. Clark, the preeminent American military leader on the northwestern frontier, worked with Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia in planning an expedition to capture Detroit, by which they hoped to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> British support of the Indian war effort. In early August 1781, Clark and about 400 men left Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania by boat, floating down the Ohio River a few days ahead of Lochry and his men, who were trying to catch up.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{to slavery}} began to {{organize}} in Indiana around 1805, and in 1809 abolitionists {{took control of}} the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves. By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution. In 1820, an Supreme Court of Indiana ruling in Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state. An additional Supreme Court ruling in 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark, helping to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was said}} to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, which led him to {{restrain}} the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E

5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, were {{conceived}} to successfully <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the series. Showrunners Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E

5|$|The third arc is the {{complicated}} love story of four childhood friends: Matilda, Irwin, Daena and Escad. Irwin is a half-demon who is angry that society prevents {{him from a}} relationship with the holy leader Matilda, and seeks to destroy the world in retribution. Escad seeks to destroy Irwin, and Daena tries to act as a mediator between all parties while keeping Matilda away from Irwin. The conflict eventually escalates into a war between humans and faeries.

5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry {{at the end of the}} conflict in 1153.|$|E
5|$|French-led {{international}} intervention {{ended the}} civil war and order was restored by 1861. Shahin's movement was in a precarious state in the war's aftermath; Shahin could not financially support his impoverished peasant partisans, the Maronite clergy was disillusioned with him, and Ottoman officialdom and the local nobility were arrayed against him. The Ottomans, the clergy and the nobility resolved to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> Shahin's movement because it represented the last obstacle to their political reorganization of Mount Lebanon into the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. Shahin threatened to convert to Protestantism together with his partisans if the Khazen sheikhs were restored to Keserwan, while Patriarch Massad of the Maronite Church was prepared to excommunicate Shahin and his supporters.|$|E

5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.|$|E
5|$|Lacking the {{available}} naval forces {{to launch a}} sizeable campaign in the Gulf, the British authorities attempted to use diplomacy to end the threat. In February 1806, the young Sultan of Oman, Sa'id II ibn Sultan, signed a treaty at Bandar Abbas promising to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> attacks originating from his territory, but by 1807 the French had installed consulates in Tehran and Muscat and attacks continued unabated with their encouragement. In 1807, Lord Minto, Governor General of India, determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire, Afghanistan and Persia {{in an effort to}} secure their support and prevent the French from gaining allies on India's western borders. As part of this diplomatic campaign, the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss the problem with the Persian government, but due to French influence in Tehran, he was unable to obtain any guarantees.|$|E

5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's business group is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E
5|$|The newly {{assembled}} coalition {{organized a}} number of small campaigns in Lithuania; the largest was undertaken at the end of summer. During this campaign the Knights burned wooden castles at Kernavė, possibly the first capital of Lithuania, which never recovered from the destruction. While the army was laying siege to Georgenburg, Grand Master Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein died. The coalition decided to abandon this siege and march on Vilnius instead, as such a large army could not easily be re-assembled. On 11 September 1390, the joint forces launched a five-week siege on the city. Vilnius' castles were held by Skirgaila, commanding combined Polish, Lithuanian, and Ruthenian troops. The Knights reduced much of the outer city to ruins and managed to destroy the Crooked Castle, which was never rebuilt. Vytautas' brother Tautvilas Kęstutaitis and Jogaila's brother Karigaila died during the siege. The besiegers ran into various difficulties. Their supplies of gunpowder were dwindling, the weather was deteriorating, the terms of service for some volunteers from western Europe ended, and the Knights needed a new Grand Master. They decided to return to Prussia. The siege did not <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the conflict, but it demonstrated an increased dissatisfaction with Jogaila among the regional inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Returns is set {{after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2. In XIII, Lightning is one of six people who are turned by a fal'Cie—one of a race created by the gods—into l'Cie, {{servants}} of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit; those that succeed in their Focus go into crystal stasis, while those that fail turn into monsters called Cie'th. The six were intended to cause the large, floating sphere named Cocoon to fall onto the world of Gran Pulse below, killing all the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe. The remaining l'Cie were made human again by the Goddess Etro, the deity responsible for maintaining the balance between the mortal world and the Unseen Realm. In XIII-2, it is revealed that Etro's interference allowed Chaos, an energy trapped in the Unseen Realm, to escape and distort the timeline as written {{after the fall of}} Cocoon. Lightning was drawn to Valhalla, Etro's citadel, and decided to stay and act as her protector. Three years after Cocoon's fall, Lightning's sister Serah sets out to correct the distortions and reunite with Lightning, while the people of Gran Pulse construct a new Cocoon, since the old one is destined to collapse. The protagonists unwittingly end up instigating the death of Etro, which allows Chaos to spill into the mortal world and <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> time itself. Serah also dies, causing Lightning to nearly lose hope. Reassured by her sister's spirit, Lightning chooses to enter crystal stasis to preserve her sister's memory and keep hope alive.|$|E
