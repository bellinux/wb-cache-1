40|$|A {{potential}} {{industrial process}} is profitable {{only if it}} is successfully implemented by the continuously developing chemical industry. Throughout last decades heterogeneous catalysis has opened doors to the creation of various know-how products which previously were considered unfeasible. Moreover, the use of heterogeneous catalysts allows improving existing processes to shift towards more ecological and cost efficient practices. In particular, polymer or fuel compounds could be eco-friendly produced from wood extractives, {{as an alternative to the}} conventional oil resources. This goal becomes even more attractive in light of the upcoming peak-oil. In the Nordic pulping industry turpentine is widely available as a tonnage by-product. Despite its interesting properties and promising application possibilities this fraction is commonly burned in the recovery boilers for energy. Although the chemical composition of turpentine depends strongly on the specific pulping process, α-pinene is the predominant compound and as such most studied. The general message of this thesis is the successful implementation of the heterogeneous catalysts in one-pot value-added upgrading of crude turpentine and specific terpenes, particularly α-pinene. Concepts allowing the production of fragrances, resins, plastics and pharmaceutical compounds are presented in the current study. Both commercial (Amberlyst 70) and self-prepared (Me/Al-SBA- 15 or TiO 2) catalysts were studied in several reactions including: acetoxylation, isomerization, dehydroisomerisation and oxidation. Both commercially purified α-pinene and crude thermo-mechanical turpentine were used as raw materials in the catalytic one-pot synthesis of value-added compounds. The experiments were performed in both batch and continuous reactor systems depending on the studied reaction. Successful results were obtained in case of several reactions. As an example, upon acetoxylation of α-pinene valuable fragrances – α-terpinyl and <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetates</b> – were produced with yields of 35 and 40 wt-%, respectively. Furthermore, in the dehydroisomerisation reaction of α-pinene, a yield of around 80 wt-% of an important fragrance, solvent and plastics precursor, ρ-cymene, was obtained. In the last case, thermo-mechanical turpentine was also successfully utilized. Still, some α-pinene oxidation tests leading to α-pinene oxide and verbenone fragrances were also carried out. Upon this study, further oxidation of ρ-cymene lead to the formation of ρ-methyl-acetophenone, a product essential for perfumery, pharmaceutical and pesticide industry as well as a potent polymer precursor. In addition, isomerization reactions were performed. Additionally, the catalytic materials were thoroughly characterized and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{in the area}} of acetate gas phase thermolysis indicate a mechanism which involves a similar transition state despite the acetate used.

Throuqh kinetic studies and product identification of the pyrolyzed products of <b>bornyl</b> and iso-bornyl <b>acetate,</b> an insight into the preferred mechanism can be obtained.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of 11 active compounds of essential oils (ACEO) on rumen fermentation characteristics and methane production. Two trials were conducted. In trial 1, ACEO (eugenol, carvacrol, citral, limonene, 1, 4 -cineole, p-cymene, linalool, <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> α-pinene, and β-pinene) at a dose of 1, 000 μL/L were incubated for 24 h in diluted rumen fluid with a 70 : 30 forage:concentrate substrate (16. 2 % crude protein; 36. 6 % neutral detergent fiber). Three fistulated Holstein cows were used as donors of rumen fluid. The reduction in methane production was observed with nine ACEO (up to 86 % reduction) compared with the control (p< 0. 05). Among these, only limonene, 1, 4 -cineole, <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and α-pinene did not inhibit volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, and only <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate</b> produced less methane per mol of VFA compared with the control (p< 0. 05). In a subsequent trial, the effects on rumen fermentation and methane production of two concentrations (500 and 2, 000 μL/L) of <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> the most promising ACEO from the first trial, were evaluated using the same in vitro incubation method that was used in the first trial.

Furthermore, the oil exhibited a very interesting antimicrobial profile after it was tested against seven gram-positive and –negative bacteria and two pathogenic fungi...|$|E
40|$|Plan: To review {{literature}} on the medicinal value of Coleus forskohlii Prologue: Coleus forskohlii is an aromatic plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae. The roots are fasciculate, thick, succulent and contain the unique chemical forskolin. Out of the 300 species of Coleus, only Coleus forskohlii contains the diterpene forskolin. Outcome: Coleus forskohlii contains abietane diterpenoids, 8, 13 -epoxy-labd- 14 -en- 11 -one-diterpenoids, 8, 13 -epoxy-labd- 14 -en- 11 -one-diterpene glycosides and an essential oil with <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate</b> as the major compound. Among them the most investigated compound forskolin has significant cardiovascular effects. Forskolin derivatives are used in cardiac care. Owing to the pharmaceutical value of forskolin, Coleus forskohlii is increasingly being cultivated all over India...|$|E
40|$|International audienceseeds of' Cedrus atlantica G. Manetti {{collected}} at two different locations [Ouled Yacoub (OY) and TaIa Guilef (TG) ] {{have been investigated}} for their essential oil components. By means of GC and GC/MS techniques, analysis of the oils has shown that their chemical composition was affected by geographical origin. Forty-lour and 28 components were identified in the seed oils of (OY) and (TG) 1 respectively. The main constituents were: [alpha]-pinene (37. 1 - 5. 5 %), [beta]-pinene (8. 6 - 1. 9 %), myreene (3. 6 - 0. 6 %), limonene (2. 5 - 0. 6 %), <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (5. 4 - 4. 0 %), (e) -[beta]-farnesene (6. 8 - 1. 9 %) and manool (8. 3 - 20. 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{essential}} oils obtained by hydro distillation of the aerial parts of Pituranthos scoparius {{were collected from}} different regions of Algeria and gave various yields ranging from 0. 6 up to 2. 8 % (v/w). These samples were analyzed by GC and GC-MS showing the occurrence of monoterpene hydrocarbons and some oxygenated compounds. The major components were alpha-pinene (4. 4 - 35. 8 %), limonene (0. 8 - 66. 5 %), <b>bornyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (tr- 9. 6 %), myristicin (tr- 31. 1) and dill apiole (0. 4 - 47. 3 %). The aerial parts of P. scoparius could be either very rich or very poor in limonene, myristicin or dill apiole. Cluster analysis shows differences in essential oil compositions of samples coming from the different area collected...|$|E
