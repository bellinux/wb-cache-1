5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park and the Friends of <b>Bushy</b> Park {{co-chair}} the Richmond and <b>Bushy</b> Parks Forum, comprising 38 {{local groups}} of local stakeholder organisations. The forum {{was formed in}} September 2010 to consider proposals to bring Richmond Park and <b>Bushy</b> Park– and London's other royal parks– {{under the control of}} the Mayor of London through a new Royal Parks Board and to make a joint response. Although welcoming the principles of the new governance arrangements, the forum (in 2011) and the Friends of Richmond Park (in 2012) have expressed concerns about the composition of the new board.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1763, {{most of the}} Native Americans {{broke off}} the siege at Fort Pitt in order to {{intercept}} 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the Battle of <b>Bushy</b> Run. Although his force suffered heavy casualties, Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at <b>Bushy</b> Run was celebrated in the British colonies—church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia—and praised by King George.|$|E
5|$|Xerochrysum 'Lemon Monarch' resembles 'Cockatoo', but its lemon-coloured flower heads {{have fewer}} bracts. It has <b>bushy</b> foliage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{term was}} also defined by David Brooks {{in a review}} of the 2001 book Reagan In His Own Hand: The Writings of Ronald Reagan That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America. Brooks {{differentiated}} Reaganites and <b>Bushies</b> as types of Republicans. While Reaganites were often Hayekian academics connected to think tanks, <b>Bushies</b> tended to be [...] "boring" [...] corporate careerists with [...] "neat desks and thin briefcases because their reading {{comes in the form of}} memos", who saw themselves as [...] "master managers" [...] and politics as a [...] "competition of interests" [...] rather than ideas. Although Brooks acknowledged that both groups were skeptical of government, their skepticism took different forms, with the Reaganites viewing the <b>Bushies</b> as skilled at political or bureaucratic wrangling, but lacking principles. According to Brooks, the failure of the <b>Bushies</b> in the first two years of the elder Bush administration, which led to major losses in the 1992 Congressional elections, brought about the ascendancy of [...] "ideologues" [...] such as Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, but their [...] "uncompromising" [...] approach once again returned the reins of the party to the <b>Bushies</b> by the 2000 election, in which George W. Bush was elected.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bushys</b> (Mount Murray Brewing) of Douglas, Isle of Man brews a {{light brown}} English bitter called [...] "Bushy's Buggane".|$|R
5|$|Mickey Mouse {{was already}} black-colored, but the {{advertising}} poster {{for the film}} shows Mickey dressed in blackface with exaggerated, orange lips; <b>bushy,</b> white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his trademark white gloves.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{air-breathing}} mammals {{who must}} surface {{to get the}} air they need. The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow (exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears {{by the time the}} flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a , heart-shaped to <b>bushy</b> blow through the blowholes.|$|E
5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken {{in recent years has}} been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, <b>bushy</b> areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and thus remarkable species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bushy's</b> Brewery {{is a local}} brewery in Braddan in the Isle of Man, {{which was}} founded by brother and sister Martin and Nicky Brunnschwieler in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|... Young Guns, {{at various}} times have fielded two teams {{including}} the <b>Bushies</b> and the Bats. Prior to 2010 the club was known as [...] "Lake Nash".|$|R

5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive <b>bushy,</b> forward-angled spray.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its <b>bushy</b> tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, <b>bushy</b> or leafy forms.|$|E
5000|$|Floribundas are {{typically}} stiff shrubs, smaller and <b>bushier</b> {{than the average}} hybrid tea but less dense and sprawling than the average polyantha. The first of Riethmuller's surviving floribundas, and the best, was 'Titian.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Goliath' was {{developed}} by Caledonia Nurseries of Guernsey, and has a <b>bushier</b> habit and globular flowers of up to 30 cm diameter. Long-flowering, it has oval leaves which lack the brownish hair underneath.|$|R
50|$|Beer is brewed on a {{commercial}} scale by Okells Brewery (established in 1850), <b>Bushy's</b> Brewery and Hooded Ram Brewing Company (established in 2013).The island has a beer purity law, resembling the German reinheitsgebot, dating to 1874.|$|R
5|$|Close to Hyde Park {{are smaller}} Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park. A {{number of large}} parks lie outside the city centre, {{including}} Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the south-east and <b>Bushy</b> Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the south-west, Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it {{is administered by the}} Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their <b>Bushy</b> House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a <b>bushy</b> tail and a sturdy body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
50|$|This verticordia {{has been}} {{difficult}} to propagate and establish in the garden but when successful produces a <b>bushier</b> plant than wild specimens. It has been propagated from cuttings but establishing them in the garden {{has been difficult}}.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} to Aloe dichotoma, but <b>bushier</b> and shorter in stature, rarely {{exceeding}} 60 centimeters in height. It {{might not be a}} distinct species; it has been treated as a variety and a subspecies of A. dichotoma.|$|R
5000|$|... {{we would}} like to replace 15-20 percent of the current U.S. Attorneys -- the underperforming ones [...] [...] [...] The vast {{majority}} of U.S. Attorneys, 80-85 percent, I would guess, are doing a great job, are loyal <b>Bushies,</b> etc., etc." ...|$|R
5|$|On 6 September, Eisenhower ordered both SHAEF Forward and SHAEF Main {{to move to}} Versailles as soon as possible. SHAEF Forward {{began its}} move on 15 September and it opened in Versailles on 20 September. SHAEF Main followed, moving from <b>Bushy</b> Park by air. This move was {{completed}} by October, and SHAEF remained there until 17 February 1945, when SHAEF Forward moved to Reims. By this time, SHAEF had grown in size to 16,000 officers and enlisted men, of whom 10,000 were American and 6,000 British.|$|E
5|$|Sufficient habitat {{complexity}} is {{a crucial}} requirement {{for the presence of}} this species, in order to support its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment. It is found in a variety of habitats, including: chalky downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, <b>bushy</b> slopes and hedgerows, dumps, coastal dunes, and stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a <b>bushy</b> mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E
5000|$|Pancho Villa - {{similar to}} the Fu Manchu but thicker; {{also known as a}} [...] "droopy {{moustache}}". Also {{similar to the}} Horseshoe. A Pancho Villa is much longer and <b>bushier</b> than the moustache normally worn by the historical Pancho Villa.|$|R
5000|$|In botany, {{ramification}} is the divergence of {{the stem}} and limbs of a plant into smaller ones, i.e. trunk into branches, branches into increasingly smaller branches, etc. Gardeners stimulate the process of ramification through pruning, thereby making trees, shrubs and other plants <b>bushier</b> and denser.|$|R
50|$|Zeatin is a {{plant hormone}} derived from adenine. Zeatin {{belongs to the}} family of plant-growth hormones called cytokinins and was {{discovered}} in immature corn kernels from the genus Zea. It promotes growth of lateral buds and when sprayed on meristems stimulates cell division to produce <b>bushier</b> plants.|$|R
5|$|The Saw Mill River and its {{adjacent}} terrain conferred some tactical {{advantages to}} those who knew it. One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman, Jake Acker, was hunting in a <b>bushy</b> area of the eastern flood plain at Elmsford. Spying {{a large group of}} British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm's tavern, Acker began sniping at them from his concealment. He fatally wounded one, changed his position amid the distraction, reloaded his musket, and killed another. Hearing the shots, other local Patriots came to Acker's aid, and eventually {{all but one of the}} larger force were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or black coat which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have <b>bushy</b> and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up {{from the back of}} the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and <b>bushy</b> tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
50|$|Squirrel gliders {{are able}} to curl their tails around {{branches}} to hold on. This feature is homologous to the ring tail possum (order of Diprodontia) which use their tail as an extra limb to grab hold of trees. It is longer but the squirrel gliders tail is <b>bushier.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Somali ostrich is {{differentiated}} ecologically {{from the}} Common ostrich, with {{which there is}} some range overlap, by preferring <b>bushier,</b> more thickly vegetated areas, where it feeds largely by browsing, whereas the latter is mainly a grazer on open savanna. There are also reports of interbreeding difficulties between the two taxa.|$|R
50|$|The Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii), {{also known}} as the rufous-bellied pademelon or red-bellied pademelon, is the sole endemic species of pademelon, {{marsupials}} found in Tasmania, and formerly throughout south-eastern Australia. This pademelon has developed heavier and <b>bushier</b> fur than its northern relatives, who inhabit northern Australia and Papua New Guinea.|$|R
