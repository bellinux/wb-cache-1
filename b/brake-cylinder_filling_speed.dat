40|$|The {{capillary}} <b>filling</b> <b>speed</b> of wetting liquids {{of varying}} viscosity and surface tension in hydrophilic nanochannels with an elastic capping layer has been analyzed. The channels, with a height just below 80 nm, are suspended {{by a thin}} flexible membrane that easily deforms due to the negative pressure which develops behind the moving meniscus. In the elastocapillary filling of the channels, two opposite effects compete: the decreased cross channel sections increase the flow resistance, while the Laplace pressure that acts as the driving force becomes more negative due to the increased meniscus curvature. Although the meniscus position shows a square root of time behavior as described by the Washburn relation, the net result of the induced bending of the membranes is a definite increase of the <b>filling</b> <b>speed.</b> We propose a relatively straightforward model for this elastocapillary process and present experimental results of the <b>filling</b> <b>speed</b> of ethanol, water, cyclohexane and acetone that {{are found to be}} in good agreement with the presented model, for membrane deflections of up to 80 percent of the original channel height...|$|R

It is anticipated that size enlargement via dry/wet granulation will improve the flowability of feed powders, but it is still unclear how significant the flowability can be enhanced. Therefore, in this study, an experimental investigation was performed to explore how dry granulation affects the flowability of pharmaceutical powders, such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCCs), mannitol and lactose. Both as-received powders and binary mixtures were considered. Granules of various sizes were produced using roll compaction followed by ribbon milling, and the flowability of as-received powders and produced granules was characterised using two methods: 1) the critical <b>filling</b> <b>speed</b> measured using a model die filling system and 2) the flow index measured using a Flodex tester. It was shown that the flowability increases as the size of the granules increases for all materials considered.

For example, the surface energy can differ significantly from macro-scale surface when the liquid pillar diameter is no longer orders larger than the range of van de Waals force, and the meniscus may be ‘pinned’ due to the abrupt change of surface topography or charges.

40|$|While {{capillary}} {{filling in}} channels of micrometers scale is experimentally verified to obey Washburn's law well, the <b>speed</b> of capillary <b>filling</b> in nanochannels is noticeably lower than described by Washburn's formula. This article reports the theoretical and experimental results on capillary filling in open-end and closed-end nanochannels. Nanochannels of 45 nm and 80 nm depth, 10 孠width, were etched in silicon and bonded to a glass cover. Experiments on filling of non-electrolytic liquid in silicon nanochannels were carried out. The filling processes were observed and recorded. To estimate {{the influence of}} electrokinetics, a mathematical model to calculate the electroviscous effect was established. This model shows that {{the contribution of the}} electroviscous effect in the reduction of <b>filling</b> <b>speed</b> is small. This result also agrees well with previous theoretical work on the electroviscous effect. That means that besides the electroviscous effect, there are other phenomena that contribute to the reduction of capillary <b>filling</b> <b>speed</b> in a nanochannel, such as air bubbles formation. Experimental investigation of capillary filling in open-end and closed-end nanochannels with different lengths was performed. The filling processes of ethanol and isopropanol and the behavior of the trapped air were recorded and evaluated. Analytical models based on the continuum assumption were used to evaluate the experimental data. We observed that the filling process consists of two stages. At the initial stage, experimental data agree well with the theoretical model, but with a higher apparent viscosity. In the final stage, condensation of the liquid phase and dissolution of the gas phase lead to total filling of the nanochannel. The observed phenomena are important for understanding the behavior of multiphase systems in nanochannels. Full Tex...|$|R

An experimental study, based on the Taguchi orthogonal array design, was conducted to characterize the effect of different processing parameters on the thin wall {{injection molding}} of thermoplastic composites, including melt temperature, mold temperature, <b>filling</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>filling</b> pressure, packing pressure, and packing time.

For the factors selected in the main experiments, melt temper-ature and melt filling pressure were found to be the principal parameters affecting the thin wall injection molding of thermoplastic composites.

30|$|Yang et al. has {{reported}} that water <b>filling</b> <b>speed</b> into a parylene microscale channel was increased by 2 orders by pretreating the channel with water, which was attributed to the water molecules' adsorption inside the channel and the resulted modification of parylene's surface energy [12]. As aforementioned, the PDMS filling into the silicon mold structures was improved by diluting it with a solvent such as toluene or hexane, which was attributed to the decrease of its viscosity [4]. Indeed, {{it is known that}} diluting PDMS drastically reduces its viscosity. For instance, its viscosity is reduced to 0.020  Pa[*]·[*]s by diluting it with heptane at 1 : 2 (PDMS/heptane) ratio [13], and for PDMS oligomers, the viscosity decreased from 0.362 to 0.050  Pa[*]·[*]s when diluted with toluene at 69 % by weight [14]. It is fair to estimate that Sylgard 184 PDMS's viscosity is decreased by 1 order if diluted with toluene at 40  wt% (60 % toluene, as is the case for [4]). Our study using undiluted PDMS with high viscosity suggests that the improved filling by dilution might be mainly due to the in situ modification of the mold surface energy and wetting property by the diluent.|$|R

The embossing process was studied in a combination of simulations and experiments. Firstly, the viscoelastic model of PLGA was built after testing the material properties.

The pressures inside the PLGA materials were different at various places during hot embossing, which lead to the differences of the <b>filling</b> <b>speeds.</b> As a result, the inner structures were easier to get formed than the outer structures.

To this end, we employ the redox-response of surface-anchored poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) films, which allows for a controlled and repeatable switching of the surface energy under low voltages (< 1 V). Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were used to confirm the presence of PFS coatings, to determine surface coverage and to study the redox reaction kinetics of the films inside of microchannels where a 0. 1 M sodium perchlorate aqueous solution served as electrolyte. SEM images attested thin, uniform and selective surface modification of the gold electrode by PFS films. Oxidation and reduction of the surface-immobilized PFS were both reached after a characteristic time below 20 s. Capillary filling experiments revealed that the meniscus speed clearly depends on the redox state of the PFS film. The velocity of the meniscus was reversibly switched between 1. 8 ± 0. 1 mm/s (reduced state) and 3. 4 ± 0. 1 mm/s (oxidized state). Model calculations, based on the Lucas-Washburn equation and adapted to our specific channel setup and partial surface modification, showed a linear dependency of the meniscus position on our observation time interval, in agreement with our experimental results.
