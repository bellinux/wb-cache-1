5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the <b>braking</b> <b>effect</b> is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, {{the source}} of the energy {{dissipated}} in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures. [...] Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake. [...] As speed decreases, the <b>braking</b> <b>effect</b> decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16km/h (10mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and axles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the approach and landing were normal with natural variations but that the spoilers were not deployed when the pilot pulled the lever. No conclusion to the cause was found, although the commission believed it must either have been a mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism or a fault {{in two of the}} four thrust lever micro switches. The pilots received warning of the failure of deployment and also noticed the lack of sufficient retardation, but failed to connect the two issues, instead focusing on the wheel brakes. This caused the removal of the anti-skid system, which caused hydroplaning and subsequently reduced <b>braking</b> <b>effect.</b> The lack of runway grooving was decisive for the hydroplaning to take place. The aircraft was estimated to travel at [...] {{at the time of the}} overrun. Had optimum braking taken place the aircraft would probably have come to a stop on the runway.

Wear properties of the untreated and cryotreated test specimens were experimentally determined using the pin on disc type tribometer (ASTM G 99 - 95). Similarly, the Rockwell hardness (HRC) of the specimens were tested in a hardness tester in accordance with ASTM E 18.

We investigate the combined effects of magnetic field, turbulence, and radiative transfer on the early phases of the collapse and the fragmentation of massive dense cores. We identify a new mechanism that inhibits initial fragmentation of massive dense cores, where magnetic field and radiative transfer interplay. We show that this interplay becomes stronger as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic braking is transporting angular momentum outwards and is lowering the rotational support and is thus increasing the infall velocity. This enhances the radiative feedback owing to the accretion shock on the first core. We speculate that highly magnetized massive dense cores are good candidates for isolated massive star formation, while moderately magnetized massive dense cores are more appropriate to form OB associations or small star clusters.
