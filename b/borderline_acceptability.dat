50|$|Dating {{from the}} 1970s, medical professionals, sociologists, anthropologists and other {{commentators}} noted the increasing visibility {{of a wide}} variety of health practices that had neither derived directly from nor been verified by biomedical science. Since that time, those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field. A variety of terms have been used, including heterodox, irregular, fringe and alternative medicine while others, particularly medical commentators, have been satisfied to label them as instances of quackery. The most persistent term has been alternative medicine but its use is problematic as it assumes a value-laden dichotomy between a medical fringe, implicitly of <b>borderline</b> <b>acceptability</b> at best, and a privileged medical orthodoxy, associated with validated medico-scientific norms. The use of the category of alternative medicine has also been criticized as it cannot be studied as an independent entity but must be understood in terms of a regionally and temporally specific medical orthodoxy. Its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists. As with near-synonymous expressions, such as unorthodox, complementary, marginal, or quackery, these linguistic devices have served, in the context of processes of professionalisation and market competition, to establish the authority of official medicine and police the boundary between it and its unconventional rivals.|$|E
40|$|The sensory {{determination}} of ammonia in raw, steamed and boiled ray wings using a scoring system {{appeared to be}} a valuable method of quality assessment. The <b>borderline</b> of <b>acceptability</b> was reached after 10 (± 1) days in ice. A combination of the steaming and boiling tests (with addition of acetic acid and salt) was useful to confirm definite spoilage or to indicate the approach to the <b>borderline</b> of <b>acceptability.</b> The chemical {{determination of}} ammonia {{appeared to be a}} useful objective method in addition to the organoleptic tests. Thornback ray was borderline at a concentration of 60 – 70 mg N. From the other related parameters determined (urea, pH, redox potential, total bacterial count, a-amino nitrogen) only pH appeared to be of value...|$|R
500|$|Around this period, the Ravens {{decided on}} a new, {{permanent}} name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the <b>borderline</b> of <b>acceptability.</b> In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... When we went to [...] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their [...] "kinky" [...] fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, [...] "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks." [...] "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.|$|R
