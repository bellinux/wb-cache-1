40|$|BACKGROUND Recently {{computed}} tomographic angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) {{have been}} used to image cerebrovascular structures. Although CTA and MRA are accurate and sensitive imaging modalities, limitations have been identified in relation to image interpretation. Stereolithographic (SL) <b>biomodelling</b> is a new technology that allows three-dimensional (3 D) CT and NIR data to be used to accurately manufacture solid plastic replicas of anatomical structures. A prospective trial of SL <b>biomodelling</b> in cerebrovascular surgery has been performed to investigate the feasibility and clinical utility of this new display medium. METHODS Fifteen patients with cerebral aneurysms and 1 patient with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were selected. 3 D CT and/or MR angiograms were acquired and 19 solid anatomical biomodels manufactured using the rapid prototyping technology of stereolithography. The biomodels were used for patient education, diagnosis, operative planning and surgical navigation. RESULTS The biomodels replicated the CTA and MRA source data. The accuracy of one biomodel was verified by comparison with a post mortem specimen, which corresponded exactly in the x and y planes but differed by 2 mm in the z plane. The ability to closely study an overview of complex cerebrovascular anatomy from any perspective on a solid biomodel was reported to enhance the surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s understanding, particularly when conventional images were equivocal. Cerebrovascular biomodels were found to be useful when positioning the patient 2 ̆ 7 s head for surgery, for selecting the best aneurysm clip and for the simulation of clipping. Patient informed consent was anecdotally improved. Disadvantages of the technology were the cost and manufacturing time. CONCLUSIONS Cerebrovascular <b>biomodelling</b> may have utility in complex cases or when the standard imaging is felt to be equivocal. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that biomodels enhance patient education, pre-operative planning and intra-operative stereotaxy, however the usefulness of biomodels compared to regular imaging modalities such as x-ray, CT and MR has not been quantified. Our objective was to quantify surgeon’s perceptions on the usefulness of biomodels compared to standard visualisation modalities for pre-operative planning and intra-operative anatomical reference. Physical biomodels were manufactured for a series of 26 consecutive patients with complex spinal pathologies using a stereolithographic technique based on CT data. The biomodels were used pre-operatively for surgical planning and customising implants, and intra-operatively for anatomical reference. Following surgery, a detailed biomodel utility survey was completed by the surgeons, and informal telephone interviews were conducted with patients. Twenty one deformity and five tumour cases were performed using biomodels. Surgeons stated that the anatomical detail was better visible on the biomodel than on other imaging modalities in 65 % of cases, and exclusively visible on the biomodel in 11 % of cases. Preoperative use of the biomodel led to a different decision regarding the choice of osteosynthetic materials used in 52 % of cases, and the implantation site of osteosynthetic material in 74 % of cases. Surgeons reported that the use of biomodels reduced operating time by a mean of 8 % in tumour patients, and 22 % in deformity procedures.

40|$|The paper explores a <b>biomodelling</b> method {{comprising}} {{of several}} visual and virtual reality methods to assess different surgical procedures using the computer. A computer tomography (CT) medical scan {{of a patient}} was obtained and was converted into a three dimensional virtual biomodel. This mandible biomodel was then subjected to graphical post-processing to split it into two portions mimicking actual surgery to correct jaw deformity. In such cases, screws and/or implants are used in various positions to link the {{two parts of the}} mandible. In this evaluation all possible configurations of a 5 holes L-plate implant (Synthes) were computed to evaluate the various surgical approaches. The nine configurations were ordered on stability of treatment based on the least amount of movement between the two bone parts upon receiving a virtual force of 500 N simulating a jaw bite. Although the best treatment method was highlighted for this particular case but other factors such as bone thickness need to be incorporated in order to further substantiate this option. This system could be used in future by maxillofacial surgeons as a pre-surgical planning tool to decide which of the various available configurations would be suitable for a given patient based on the patients' medical scan data. Such results would also pave the way for Evidence based Medicine practice (EBP) where the decision for a particular treatment approach would be guided and strengthened by data from virtual simulation studies of the outcome of the surgery.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} {{the technique of}} stereolithographic <b>biomodelling</b> and its application to a patient who was treated using orbital brachytherapy. Methods and Materials: The process uses a moving laser beam, directed by a computer, to draw cross-sections of the model {{onto the surface of}} photo-curable liquid plastic. Using a stereolithographic apparatus (SLA), solid or surface data is sliced by software into very thin cross-sections. A helium cadmium (HeCd) laser then generates a small intense spot of ultraviolet (UV) light that is moved across the top of a vat of liquid photo monomer by a computerised optical scanning system. The laser polymerises the liquid into a solid where it touches, precisely printing each cross-section. A vertical elevator lowers the newly formed layer, and a recoating and levelling system establishes the next layer 2 ̆ 7 s thickness. Successive cross-sections (0. 25 mm thick), each one adhering to the one below, are built {{one on top of the}} other, to form the part from the bottom up. The biomodel allowed the implant to be planned in detail prior to the surgery, The accurate placement of brachytherapy catheters was assured, and the dosimetry could be determined and optimised prior to the definitive procedure. Conclusions: Stereolithography is a useful technique in the area of orbital brachytherapy, It allows the implant to to be carried out with greater accuracy and confidence. For the patient, it minimises the risk to the eye and provides them with a greater understanding of the procedure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{intervertebral}} discs of the lumbar spine can {{be damaged}} {{as a result}} of trauma, disease or deformity. If an intervertebral disc becomes too compromised the current surgical solution is to fuse the vertebra at the affected spinal level. Spinal fusion presents its own complications which can limit its short and long term success. One of the key limiting factors is the loss of mobility at the affected level, this causes additional loading and accelerated degradation of the adjacent intervertebral discs. Therefore, the aim of this project was to develop an intervertebral disc implant which allowed natural motion at the affected level. The implant developed consists of a fluid filled welded bellows assembly. This arrangement is similar to a healthy intervertebral disc in which the fluid nucleus pulpous is contained by the annulus fibrosus. The proposed implant also incorporates overload and motion-restricting features to prevent the implant and spinal column being damaged. Artificial disc implants have been developed by other researchers. The implant developed in this project is unique as it does not generate any wear debris. This is significant as wear debris can cause a macrophage response and osteolysis, thus ultimately limiting the long term viability of implants which do produce wear debris. This thesis also details the development of <b>BioModelling</b> methodology for producing graphical reconstructions from medical scan data. These reconstructions can be used to produce plastic and metallic models for pre-operative planning purposes and implants for in-vivo use. While originally intended for the spinal implant work, it was ultimately used for other tasks. A case study illustrates its use in producing a maxilla implant. The final component of this project was to design and produce a femoral endoprosthesis for a patient with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. The patient's existing implants had failed and as a result an implant was required which could fully support all the applied loads whilst still allowing the patient's healthy hip and knee joints to be retained...|$|E

40|$|<b>BioModel</b> Engineering {{takes place}} at the {{interface}} of computing science, mathematics, engineering and biology, and provides a systematic approach for designing, constructing and analyzing computational models of biological systems. Some of its central concepts are inspired by efficient software engineering strategies. <b>BioModel</b> Engineering does not aim at engineering biological systems per se, but rather aims at describing their structure and behavior, in particular at the level of intracellular molecular processes, using computational tools and techniques in a principled way. The two major application areas of <b>BioModel</b> Engineering are systems biology and synthetic biology. In the former, the aim is the design and construction of models of existing biological systems, which explain observed properties and predict the response to experimental interventions; in the latter, <b>BioModel</b> Engineering is used as part of a general strategy for designing and constructing synthetic biological systems with novel functionalities. The overall steps in building computational models in a <b>BioModel</b> Engineering framework are: Problem Identification, Model Construction, Static and Dynamic Analysis, Simulation, and Model management and development. A major theme in <b>BioModel</b> Engineering is that of constructing a (qualitative) model means (1) finding the structure, (2) obtaining an initial state and (3) parameter fitting. In an approach that we have taken, the structure is obtained by piecewise construction of models from modular parts, the initial state which describes concentrations of species or numbers of molecules is obtained by analysis of the structure, and parameter fitting comprises determining the rate parameters of the kinetic equations by reference to trusted data.

40|$|Introduction: This work aims to pre-operatively {{manufacture}} custom-made low-cost implants {{and physical}} models (‘biomodels’) of fractured skulls. The pre-operative manufacturing of <b>biomodels</b> and implants allows physicians {{to study and}} plan surgery with a greater possibility of achieving the expected result. Customization contributes to both the esthetic and functional outcome of the implant because it considers the anatomy of each patient, while the low cost allows {{a greater number of}} people to potentially benefi t. Methods: From CT images of a fractured skull, a CAD model of the skull (<b>biomodel)</b> and a restorative implant were constructed digitally. The <b>biomodel</b> was then physically constructed with 3 D Printing, and Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) was used to manufacture the implant from a sheet of pure grade 2 titanium. Before cutting the implant’s fi nal shape from a pre-formed sheet, heat treatment was performed to avoid deformations caused by residual stresses generated during the ISF process. Results: A comparison of the dimensions of the implant and its respective CAD <b>biomodel</b> revealed geometric discrepancies that can affect both functional and aesthetic effi ciency. Nevertheless, the fi nal shape preserved symmetry between the right and left sides of the skull. Electron microscopy analysis did not indicate the presence of elements other than pure titanium. Conclusions: Dimensional variability can be decreased with changes in the manufacturing process (i. e., forming and cutting) and the heating ramp. Despite biomedical characteristics, there was no contamination of the implant by harmful chemical elements. 3 D Printing was effective in making the <b>biomodel,</b> enabling pre-operative planning and improving physicianpatient communication.

40|$|Background. Facilitating the {{handling}} of the increasing number of kinetic models is a challenging task in <b>biomodel</b> engineering.

In addition, an on-going trend in <b>biomodel</b> engineering is the representation of biological systems in the form of monolithic models, which are inherently complex due to the numerous interwoven components. This makes them hardly accessible to others, especially for curation and updating. Moreover, monolithic models usually cannot be linked without extensive restructuring.
