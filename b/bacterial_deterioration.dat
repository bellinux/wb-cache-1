40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy at Loughborough University. A survey of causes of post-harvest losses of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) carried out in Kenya in 1987, revealed that losses are experienced by both fish processors and traders of cured fish during processing, handling and storage. The heaviest losses occur {{during the rainy season}} which also corresponds to the period when the highest catches are realised. The major causes of losses were found to be <b>bacterial</b> <b>deterioration,</b> blowfly larvae infestation, moulds and fragmentation. [Continues. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>deterioration</b> of {{sugarcane}} during harvesting {{and processing}} is correlated with significant loss of sucrose yield and {{the accumulation of}} bacterial polysaccharides. Dextran, a homoglucan produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides, has been cited as the primary polysaccharide associated with sugarcane deterioration. A culture-based approach was used to isolate extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) producing bacterial strains from milled sugarcane stalks. Ribosomal RNA sequencing analysis grouped 25 isolates into 4 genera. This study identified 2 bacterial genera not previously associated with EPS production or sucrose degradation. All isolates produced polysaccharide when grown {{in the presence of}} sucrose. Monosaccharide analysis of purified polymers by Gas Chromatography revealed 17 EPSs consisting solely of glucose (homoglucans), while the remainder contained traces of mannose or fructose. Dextranase treatment of polysaccharides yielded full digestion profiles for only 11 extracts. Incomplete hydrolysis profiles of the remaining polysaccharides suggest the release of longer oligosaccharides which may interfere with sucrose crystal formation...|$|E
40|$|After {{analyzing}} excavated 17 - 18 th century silk fibers {{through a}} scanning electron microscopy, we disco-vered seven {{different kinds of}} fracture morphology. Using Morton & Hearle fiber fracture morphology, we classified the findings into four different categories. Type I is tensile failure resulting from brittle fracture, granular fracture, and ductile fracture. Type II is fatigue failure caused by tensile fatigue, flex fatigue, and axial split (fibrillation). Type III is <b>bacterial</b> <b>deterioration</b> discovered only in excavated artifacts. Type IV {{is a combination of}} the three above. Humid underground conditions and the infiltration of bacteria caused the fibers to swell and weaken its interfibrillar cohesion. Fractures occur when drying and processing an exca-vated artifact that is already in a fragile condition. Therefore, one must minimize damage through a prompt cleaning process and make sure that the least possible force is exerted on the fabric during any treatmen...|$|E
40|$|A. The harvester, or {{dealer who}} {{transports}} shellstock from the harvester {{to the original}} dealer, shall assure that all trucks used to transport shellstock are properly constructed, operated, and maintained to prevent contamination, deterioration, and decomposition. B. Storage bins on trucks or other vehicles used in the transport of shellstock for direct marketing shall be: (1) Kept clean with potable water or water from an approved area or conditionally approved area in the open status; and (2) Provided with effective drainage. C. Shellstock shall be transported in adequately refrigerated trucks or iced when the shellstock have been previously refrigerated or when ambient air temperature and time of travel are such that unacceptable <b>bacterial</b> growth or <b>deterioration</b> may occur. D. Prechilling trucks or other vehicles to 45 º or below shall be required when ambient air temperatures are such that unacceptable bacterial growth o...|$|R
30|$|Physical and {{chemical}} alteration of petroleum under surface or reservoir conditions caused by bacteria {{is referred to}} as “biodegradation” (Head et al. 2003; Watson et al. 2000; Röling et al. 2006; Elias et al. 2007). Microbial/bacterial deterioration essentially develops starting from bacteria and causes chemical structures and components rich in hydrogen to dissolve. This deterioration may develop under surface conditions, as well as petroleum–water contacts in migrations and reservoirs. Washing with water, usually observed together with biodegradation, has a very little impact on the physical {{and chemical}} properties of petroleum by itself, whereas <b>bacterial</b> activity increases <b>deterioration.</b> As a result of the reduction in light components, the remaining product becomes rich in polar and aromatic components, which means a drop in the economic value for the petroleum reservoir (Head et al. 2003; Watson et al. 2000; Röling et al. 2006; Elias et al. 2007). Components in different groups such as benzene, toluene, and other aromatics disappear sequentially or simultaneously due to biodegradation (Palmer 1993; Peters et al. 1986; Elias et al. 2007). The kinetics of biodegradation is associated with the composition of the petroleum and may develop rapidly (e.g., disappearance of n-alkanes) or slowly (e.g., disappearance of resins and asphaltenes).|$|R
40|$|Context: Papular pruritic eruptions (PPEs) are a {{commonly}} seen dermatological manifestation {{in children with}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) stage 2 disease, whereas recurrent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (> 2 episodes in 6 months) {{is the most common}} presenting illness in this category. Papular pruritic eruptions has been associated with progressive HIV disease in adults though it is categorized in early stage. Aim: To evaluate PPE as a clinical marker for progressive pediatric HIV. Setting and Design: In Pediatric HIV/AIDS clinic, Medical College, Kolkata, a prospective longitudinal hospital-based observational study was carried out. Materials and Methods: A total of 108 children in WHO stage 2 HIV disease aged between 2 and 12 years were selected, of which 58 had recurrent URTI without PPE and another 50 had PPE with or without secondary <b>bacterial</b> infection. Clinico-immunological <b>deterioration</b> was compared between the groups in terms of progression to undernutrition, WHO clinical stage 4 disease, severe immunodeficiency, need for initiation of Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy (HAART) and mortality over a period of 2 years. Statistical Analysis: SPSS statistical software version 10 was used. P value, relative risk (RR) with 95 &#x 0025; Confidence Interval (CI), sensitivity and specificity was estimated. P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Significantly higher incidence (P < 0. 001) of clinico-immunological progression of disease at a significantly shorter time period (P < 0. 05) was found in those with PPE in comparison to those without PPE. Papular pruritic eruption has high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value as a clinical marker for severe immunodeficiency. Conclusion: Papular pruritic eruption could be a useful clinical marker of progressive HIV disease in children...|$|R
