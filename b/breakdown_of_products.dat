40|$|Liquid lime sulfur (LLS) {{was applied}} to apples at various rates and timings to {{determine}} its effectiveness for controlling sooty blotch, flyspeck, and summer fruit rots. Four applications of LLS at either 2 qt or 4 qt controlled flyspeck {{just as well as}} four sprays of Topsin M plus Captan (the commercial standard). Four applications of LLS at 1 qt/ 100 gal were less effective, but applying the low rate six times improved performance to equal that of the standard treatment.   Two phosphorous acid products, Phostrol and NutriPhyte, were substituted for captan in several summer sprays and also provided effective control of sooty blotch and flyspeck.   Measurements of the spray solution pH and surface residue pH from newly sprayed leaves verified the alkaline nature of LLS sprays and raised the possibility that LLS sprays could cause rapid <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> that are subject to alkaline hydrolysis (e. g. Imidan), thereby compromising effectiveness of those products for controlling apple maggot.   No apple maggot damage was observed in test plots, but the incidence of apple maggot damage was low throughout the region in 2006.   Based on this trial, organic farmers could adopt LLS sprays during summer to control sooty blotch and flyspeck, but additional work is needed to determine if summer sprays of LLS sprays adversely affect fruit size or productivity of the sprayed trees.   The PA products provide interesting alternatives for controlling summer diseases on apples, but considerable additional work is required to determine how these low-risk fungicides can be used to best advantage in apple spray programs...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of novel, systemically administered radionuclide therapies (such as radioimmunother-apy) {{relies on the}} ability to predict dose-limiting toxicity to normal tissue. Where the kidney is the prin-cipal route of excretion of the radionuclide preparation and/or <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>products,</b> nephrotoxicity may be the dose-limiting factor. Until recently, conventional (MIRD) dosimetry assumed the distribution in the kidney to be uniform. A new MIRD phantom of the kidney models it as a set of uniform suborgans. In the work described here, the assumption of uniformity of distribution and of heterogeneity of dose rate (and, thus, absorbed dose) was tested in the mouse model. In this paper, we examine the nonuniformity of distribution and the subsequent dose rate for 4 antibody preparations (IgG (150 kD), F(ab) 2 (100 kD), Fab (50 kD) and sFv (27 kD)) labeled with 4 radionuclides (125 I, 131 I, 186 Re, and 90 Y) of interest in ra-dioimmunotherapy (RIT). The kidney was considered as a whole and as two suborgans (cortex and medulla), and the nonuniformity of the dose-rate distribution was measured by a correlation of modeled dose-rate distribution with the dose-rate distribution obtained for an equivalent uniform radionuclide dis-tribution. The heterogeneity of distribution, the inter- and intra-suborgan, was seen to increase as the mo-lecular weight of the antibodies decreased. The assumption of uniform activity distribution for the whole kidney gives a poor estimation of the distribution of the dose rate. In the cortex, the longer-range emit-ters smooth out the effect of heterogeneous distribution and, in mice, an assumption of uniform cortex self-dose distribution may be sufficient for simple calculations. It is unclear how much this smoothing would be relevant in the human kidney...|$|E

There were two series of experiments carried out. In the first, the harvested peritoneal cell population consisted of less than 90 % macrophages and additional polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes. The basal release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), 6 -ketoprostaglandin F 1 α (6 -keto-PGF 1 α) and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) was stimulated by all treatments. The A 23187 stimulated release of 6 -keto-PGF 1 α and LTB 4 was increased by all three compounds. The 6 -keto-PGF 1 α:TxB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α:LTB 4 ratios were increased by carnitine treatment. These results suggested that carnitine could modify the macrophage component of an inflammatory site in vivo. In the second series of experiments the harvested cell population was highly purified (> 95 % macrophages) and none of the compounds fed to the rats caused a change of either eicosanoid or TNFα formation. Moreover the 6 -keto-PGF 1 α:TxB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α:LTB 4 ratios were not enhanced by any of the compounds tested. It is conceivable that in the first series the increased ratios 6 -keto-PGF 1 α:TxB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α:LTB 4 reflected the effect of carnitine or its congeners on PMN leucocytes rather than on macrophages...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{register}} agrochemicals in Europe {{it is necessary}} to have a detailed understanding of the processes in the environment that break down agrochemicals. The existing framework for environmental assessment includes a consideration of soil water movement and microbial <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in soil and these processes are relatively understood and represented in models. However the breakdown of agrochemicals by the action of light incident on the soil surface by a process termed photolysis is not so well represented in models of environmental fate. The problem brought by Syngenta (one of the worlds leading agrochemical companies) to the workshop was how to include the effects of light degradation of chemicals into predictive models of environmental fate. Photolysis is known to occur in a very thin layer at the surface of soil. The workshop was asked to consider how the very rough nature of the upper surface of a ploughed field might affect the degradation of chemicals by sunlight. The discussions were directed down two avenues: - firstly to determine how the very small distances over which photolysis occurs might be adequately incorporated into models of transport in soils and, - secondly to consider how the rough surface might modify the illumination of the surface and hence alter degradation. The rate of degradation by photolysis is measured in the laboratory by illuminating a thin, typically about 1 or 2 mm, layer of soil with very strong xenon lamps. The amount of chemical is measured at various intervals and is fitted to a first-order process. Field experiments where the chemical is sprayed on a bare field show evidence of photolysis indicated by biphasic degradation patterns and the presence of breakdown products only formed by photolysis. This report addresses methods for mathematically modelling the action of photolysis on particular relevant chemical species. We start with a general discussion of mechanisms that transport chemicals within soil § 2. There is an existing computational model exploited by Syngenta for such modelling and we discuss how this performs and the predictions that can be derived using it § 3. The particular mechanism of photolysis is then considered. One aspect of this mechanism that is investigated is how the roughness of the surface of the soil could be adequately incorporated into the modelling. Some results relating to this are presented § 4. 2. Some of the original experimental data used to derive aspects of the model of photolysis are revisited and a simple model of the process presented and shown to fit the data very well § 5. By considering photolysis with a constant diffusion coefficient various analytical results are derived and general behaviour of the system outlined. This simple model is then applied to real field-based data and shown to give very good fit when simply extended to account for the moisture variations by utilising moisture dependent diffusion coefficients derived from the existing computational model § 5. 3. Some consequences of the simple model are then discussed § 6...|$|E
