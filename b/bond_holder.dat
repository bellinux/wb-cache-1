5|$|Following the 2008 {{closing of}} Copia, {{a group of}} investors, developers, advocates, and vintners named the Coalition to Preserve Copia was formed to explore a plan to {{preserve}} the building and grounds. Part of the group's plan included forming a Mello-Roos district with participation of local hotel properties to finance bonds to purchase the property, but their effort failed. In May 2009 local developer George Altamura spoke about his interest in purchasing the property. Other developers including the Culinary Institute of America also {{expressed an interest in}} acquiring the property. Copia's <b>bond</b> <b>holder,</b> ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation, listed the property for sale in October 2009. Napa Valley College's upper valley campus became the home of the center's library of around 1,000 cookbooks. By late 2010, local chefs had revived the center's garden and the parking lot had become the location of a weekly farmer's market. In 2011, the museum was reported to still maintain its original furnishings, with the gift store fully stocked and the restaurant still furnished. In an April 2012 auction, most of the center's fixtures, furniture, equipment, wine collection (around 3,500 bottles), dinnerware, displays, artistic items, and antiquities were sold.|$|E

50|$|The {{money to}} launch The Irish Press {{was raised in}} the United States during the Irish War of Independence by a bond drive to finance the First Dail. The amount raised was $5 million ($55 million {{adjusted}} for inflation as of 2011). However, 60 percent of this money was left in various banks in New York. Nobody has been able to explain why Éamon de Valera ordered the bulk of the money to be left in New York when he returned to Ireland in late 1920. In 1927, as a result of legal action between the Irish Free State government and de Valera, a court in New York ordered that the <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> be paid back outstanding money due to them. However de Valera's legal team had anticipated the ruling and had prepared for the outcome. A number of circulars were sent to the <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> asking them to sign over their holdings to de Valera. The <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> were paid 58 cents to the dollar. This money was then used as start up capital to launch The Irish Press. Following the 1933 Irish General Election de Valera used his Dáil majority to pass a measure allowing the <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> to be paid the remaining 42 percent of the money still owed.|$|R
25|$|Using {{the same}} {{application}} of vertical transactions MMT {{argues that the}} holder of the bond is irrelevant to the issuing government. As {{long as there is}} a demand for the issuer's currency, whether the <b>bond</b> <b>holder</b> is foreign or not, governments can never be insolvent when the debt obligations are in their own currency; this is because the government is not constrained in creating its own currency (although the <b>bond</b> <b>holder</b> may affect the exchange rate by converting to local currency). Similarly, according to the FX theory outlined above, the currency paid out at maturity cannot leave the country of issuance either.|$|E

50|$|On April 16, 2009, Finance Minister Maria Elsa Viteri {{embarked}} {{on a trip to}} Europe in a mission to present Ecuador's offer to buy back global bonds 2012 and 2030 at 30% of their current value. <b>Bond</b> <b>holders</b> had until mid-May (extended to June 3) to accept or make an offer. According to the Finance Minister, at least 70% of <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> have accept the governments' offer. On May 29, Ecuador made a payment of approximately 300 million dollars to part of the <b>bond</b> <b>holders.</b> The Finance Minister has said that on June 13, the government will reveal all the details of the repurchase. According to government reports, all or almost all of the bonds will be retired from the global market at a price of 30-35 on the dollar. These bonds constitute one fourth of Ecuador's debt. If Ecuador is able to retire these bonds, it would reduce the nation's debt by $2 billion, making this a great economic victory for president Rafael Correa and his administration.|$|R
2500|$|The total {{face value}} of an MBS {{decreases}} over time, because like mortgages, and unlike bonds, and most other fixed-income securities, the principal in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the <b>bond</b> <b>holder</b> at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value {{is measured by the}} MBS's [...] "factor", the percentage of the original [...] "face" [...] that remains to be repaid.|$|E

25|$|Subordinated {{bonds are}} those that have a lower {{priority}} than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the liquidator is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated <b>bond</b> <b>holders</b> are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds {{can be found in}} bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.|$|R
