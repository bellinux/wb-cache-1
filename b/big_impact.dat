He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E

5|$|Born in Chatham, Kent, Boyd {{started his}} career as a part of Charlton Athletic's youth system at the age of 15. A year later he was {{released}} by Charlton, and opted to join Conference National side Stevenage Borough in 2001. Boyd made his Stevenage debut at just 17 years of age during the 2002–03 season, featuring in a 3–1 defeat against Margate at Broadhall Way, although he was substituted at half–time. Despite appearing on the bench frequently, Boyd did not play again in the first-team the same season. The following season, Boyd played eleven times {{during the second half of}} the season under new manager Graham Westley, after impressing him during Boyd's involvement in the FA Youth Cup. Boyd made a <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> despite appearing as a substitute in the majority of the matches, assisting all three of Stevenage's goals in a 3–1 victory over Tamworth, and scoring his first Stevenage goal in a 2–1 win against Northwich Victoria in April 2004.|$|E
5|$|Sir Alex Ferguson {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the starting line-up for Paul Scholes, after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension. Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier, with Owen Hargreaves starting {{on the right side of}} midfield in a 4–4–2 formation in place of Park Ji-sung, who did not even make the substitutes bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing, where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right-back Michael Essien. This went against the prediction of The Guardians David Pleat, who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Ashley Cole would be key to the final. Ferguson hoped his substitutes might have a <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the match, just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999, when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich. A week before the game, Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in the starting line-up; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} newcomers {{represented the}} Linear Pottery culture. Their uniform culture survived in Poland {{in its original}} form until about 4600 BCE. Despite the <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> they made, the first waves came in small numbers - hundreds, or at most a few thousand people, judging by the sizes of the known settlements. They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north, {{all the way to}} the Baltic Sea. They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle, but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn't much interaction, as the two groups inhabited different environments. Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long-houses, some over 30 meters long, supported by wooden posts, the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Kraków just within the city limits.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E

25|$|Many {{well-known}} architects {{come from}} Birmingham. From the Victorian era, Yeoville Thomason, J. A. Chatwin and Martin & Chamberlain made a <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the city.

25|$|Early {{electrification}} was too {{limited to}} have a <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the late 19th century economy.

Daytime service became common during the early 20th century after the introduction of the AC motor, which tended to be used more during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or electric street railway (tram or streetcar).|$|E
