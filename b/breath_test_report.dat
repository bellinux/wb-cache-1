40|$|Questionnaires {{are widely}} used {{instruments}} to monitor gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. However, few of these questionnaires have been formally evaluated. We sought to evaluate our GI symptoms questionnaire in terms of clarity and reproducibility. Primary care patients referred for open access Helicobacter pylori urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> <b>reported</b> GI symptoms (type+severity) and demographic information by written questionnaire. In an interview, patients gave a personal description {{of the meaning of}} the GI symptoms on the questionnaire. Patients' descriptions of GI symptoms were compared with current definitions. Symptom severity scores were compared before and after, interview versus questionnaire. Of the 45 patients included, 19 (42 %) described all symptoms correctly, whereas 17 (38 %) described one symptom incorrectly. None of the patients made more than three mistakes. Regurgitation was the most common incorrectly described symptom (16 patients [36 %]), whereas the other individual symptoms were well explained. Symptom severities before the interview, after the interview and reported by questionnaire (mean value +/- SEM) were 2. 1 +/- 0. 2, 2. 1 +/- 0. 2, and 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 points on a 7 -point Likert scale (0 - 6), respectively. Mean severity reported by interview (95 % CI) was 1. 4 (1. 3 - 1. 5) times higher than reported by questionnaire (P <. 05). In conclusion, the GI symptom questionnaire is understandable and has good reproducibility for measuring the presence of GI symptoms, although symptom severity is consistently rated higher when reported by intervie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Gastric mucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (MALT) {{lymphoma}} is generally associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and, {{in the great}} majority of patients, regresses after eradication. H. pylori-negative MALT lymphoma occurs in a small minority of cases in which treatment is based on surgery or chemoradiotherapy. In the search for H. pylori based on histology and the C 13 urea <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> this <b>report</b> describes a case with a series of false-negative results, thus confirming the possibility of a lower detectability of H. pylori in patients with MALT gastric lymphoma and supporting the use of additional tests in evaluating such pathology, including polymerase chain reaction.

Survival rates at 4 years were 68 % in group 1, 35 % in group 2 and 17 % in group 3. Using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, survival rates at 4 years were 67 % in Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A, 40 % in class B and 7 % in class C. To assess the value of aminopyrine <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> {{as an adjunct to}} Child-Turcotte-Pugh score in prognostic evaluation of patients with cirrhosis, two approaches have been used: a regression analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model by including the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score and aminopyrine <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> value, and the log-rank test to assess the prognostic value of aminopyrine <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> in each Child-Turcotte-Pugh class separately. The regression analysis showed that both parameters, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score and the aminopyrine <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> results, were accepted in the model, suggesting that the aminopyrine <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> was still significantly related to survival once the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score had been entered into the model.

40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} infections in humans. There is a risk factor for gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastric cancer and MALT (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) -Lymphomas. There are several invasive and non-invasive methods available for the diagnosis of H. pylori. The 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is a non-invasive method recommended for monitoring H. pylori eradication therapy. However, this test is not yet used for primary assessment of H. pylori in Germany. Objectives: What are the clinical and health economic benefits of the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> in the primary assessment of H. pylori compared to other invasive and non-invasive methods? Methods: A systematic literature search including a hand search was performed for studies investigating test criteria and cost-effectiveness of the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> in comparison to other methods used in the primary assessment of H. pylori. Only studies that directly compared the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> to other H. pylori-tests were included. For the medical part, biopsy-based tests were used as the gold standard. Results: 30 medical studies are included. Compared to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) test, the sensitivity of the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is higher in twelve studies, lower in six studies and one study reports no differences. The specificity is higher in 13 studies, lower in three studies and two studies report no differences. Compared to the stool antigen test, the sensitivity of the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is higher in nine studies, lower in three studies and one study reports no difference. The specificity is higher in nine studies, lower in two studies and two studies report no differences. Compared to the urease test, the sensitivity of the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is higher in four studies, lower in three studies and four studies report no differences. The specificity is higher in five studies, lower in five studies and one study reports no difference. Compared to histology, the sensitivity of the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is higher in one study and lower in two studies. The specificity is higher in two studies and lower in one study. One study each compares the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> to the 14 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) <b>test,</b> respectively, and <b>reports</b> no difference in sensitivity and specificity with the 14 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> and lower sensitivity and higher specificity compared to PCR. The statistical significance of these differences is described for six of the 30 studies. Nine health economic evaluations are included in the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report. Among these studies, the test-and-treat strategy using the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is compared to test-and-treat using serology in six analyses and to test and treat using the stool antigen test in three analyses. Thereby, test-and-treat using the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is shown to be cost-effective over the serology based strategy in three models and is dominated by a test-and-treat strategy using the stool antigen test in one model. A cost-effectiveness comparison between the urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> approach and the empirical antisecretory therapy is carried out in four studies. Of these, two studies report that the strategy using the urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is cost-effective over the empirical antisecretory therapy. In two studies, test-and-treat using the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is compared to the empirical eradication therapy and in five studies to endoscopy-based strategies. The <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> approach dominates endoscopy in two studies and is dominated by this strategy in one study. Discussion: All included medical and economic studies are limited to a greater or lesser extent. Additionally, the results of the studies are heterogeneous regarding medical and economic outcomes respectively. Thus, the majority of the medical studies do not report the statistical significance of the differences in sensitivity and specificity. In direct comparisons the 13 C- urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> shows higher sensitivity and specificity than the IgG and stool antigen tests. In comparison to the urease test, results for sensitivity are inconsistent, and the specificity is slightly higher for the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b> There are not enough results for comparisons between the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> and the 14 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> histology and PCR to describe tendencies. The included economic studies suggest that the test-and-treat strategy using the 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is cost-effective compared to test-and-treat using serology as well as empirical antisecretory therapies. Due to a lack of valid studies, it is not possible to assess the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> approach in comparison to test-and-treat using the stool antigen test and the empirical eradication therapy respectively, regarding the cost-effectiveness. The results of economic analyses comparing test-and-treat using the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> to endoscopy strategies are too heterogeneous to draw any conclusions. Overall, none of the included economic models is able to completely capture the complexity of managing patients with dyspeptic complaints. Conclusions/Recommendations: Based on available medical and economic studies, there is no sufficient evidence to recommend test and-treat using 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> for the detection of H. pylori infection as the standard procedure for the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia in the German health care system. In addition, it must be considered that the DVGS guidelines of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Verdauungs- und Stoffwechselkrankheiten (DVGS) recommend endoscopy based methods for the management of patients with dyspeptic complaints...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} effect of a preliminary <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> law on drunk driving behavior. A preliminary <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> law reduces the procedural problems associated with obtaining evidence of drunk driving and thus increases the probability that a drunk driver will be arrested. In 1985, only 23 states had a preliminary <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> law. According to the theory of deterrence, increasing the probability of arrest for drunk driving will reduce the future occurrence of this behavior. The data set employed to test the theory is a time series from 1980 to 1985 of cross sections of the 48 contiguous states. Four highway mortality rates are used as measures of drunk driving. The effect of the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> law was estimated using four independent variable models and 12 dummy variable models. The four independent variable models were also estimated using Leamer's specification test. The purpose of using these alternative specifications and Leamer's specification test was to examine the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> coefficients for specification bias. The econometric results show that the passage of a <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> law has a significant deterrent effect on drunk driving. Simulations with these results suggest that if all states had a preliminary <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> law, highway mortality could be reduced by about 2000 deaths per year. ...|$|R

The results were analyzed to find the most useful time point to differentiate patients from controls. A questionnaire was used prior to, during and after the test to assess symptoms. Results: Twenty-four percent of patients and 44 % of controls had an abnormal <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> using hydrogen only, while with hydrogen and methane combined 29 % of patients and 44 % of controls had abnormal tests (p=ns). There was no time point that was eligible to differentiate patients from controls. More patients than controls reported of symptoms in relation to the test (p< 0, 05), but there was no clear relation between outcome of the <b>test</b> and symptom <b>report.</b> Interpretation: Our study shows no value of lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> in diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome...|$|R

In a group of 46 healthy elderly persons, however, significant anomalies between serology and <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> were observed. Only 83 % of the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> negative persons were seronegative, while only 68 % of the <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> positive persons were seropositive. These results can be explained in terms of age related atrophic gastritis and immune incompetence, causing reduced colonisation and decreased antibody production, respectively.

40|$|Context One of the {{limitations}} of 13 C-urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> for Helicobacter pylori infection diagnosis in Brazil is the substrate acquisition in capsule presentation. Objectives The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate a capsule-based 13 C-urea, manipulated by the Pharmacy Division, for the clinical practice. Methods Fifty patients underwent the conventional and the capsule <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b> Samples were collected at the baseline and after 10, 20 and 30 minutes of 13 C-urea ingestion. Urease and histology were used as gold standard in 83 patients. Results In a total of 50 patients, 17 were positive with the conventional 13 C-urea (75 mg) <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> at 10, 20 and 30 minutes. When these patients repeated <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> with capsule (50 mg), 17 were positive at 20 minutes and 15 at 10 and 30 minutes. The relative sensitivity of 13 C-urea with capsule was 100 % at 20 minutes and 88. 24 % at 10 and at 30 minutes. The relative specificity was 100 % at all time intervals. Among 83 patients that underwent capsule <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> and endoscopy the capsule <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> presented 100 % of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions Capsule based <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> with 50 mg 13 C-urea at twenty minutes was found highly sensitive and specific for the clinical setting. HEADINGS- Helicobacter pylori.

40|$|The most {{important}} contribution to improved knowledge of the prevalence of drink-driving in Sweden is a sample survey where drivers are tested at randomly selected sites and time points. The prerequisites for such a study have been investigated in this project, which has been conducted {{in collaboration with the}} head of the traffic police in three counties (Södermanland, Östergötland and Örebro) and representatives from the National Board of Forensic Medicine. The main aim of the study was to propose a method of how to conduct the survey; a proposition of a pilot study is presented here. Other issues regarding the statistics from random <b>breath</b> <b>tests,</b> police <b>reports</b> from road traffic accidents, and driving under the influence of other drugs than alcohol is also discussed. The aim of the pilot study is partly to find out the prevalence of drink-driving among the car drivers in the selected counties, partly to test the methodology suggested in this report. It is not possible in practice to investigate the whole road network and to cover all hours of the day. Therefore, a number of limitations are suggested. Both the urban and rural network is limited to the most frequently used roads. All days a week will be observed, but the working hours of the traffic police restricts the study to the time between 7 and 23. About 95 percent of the total traffic volume is produced within this time frame. The study will be spread out during a whole year in order to cover all seasons. The total sample size is set to 25, 000 tests. This number is set in consideration of the police capacity...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare future remnant liver function assessed by 99 mTc-technephyt dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy with results of methacetin <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> in the prediction of liver failure after major liver resection.   Materials and methods. Methacetin <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> and 99 mTc-technephyt hepatobiliary scintigraphy were performed prior to major resection in 53 high-risk patients, including 48 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer and 5 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver function determined with HBS was compared with methacetin <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> by unified scale. Results.  A strong positive association (r = 0. 706) was found between 13 C-methacetin <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> determined with 99 mTc-technephyt hepatobiliary scintigraphy Conclusions.  Preoperative 99 mTc-technephyt hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 13 C-methacetin <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> are a valuable techniques to estimate the risk of postoperative liver failure. They offers a unique combination of functional liver uptake and excretion with the ability to assess the preoperative liver function reserve and to estimate the remnant liver function preoperatively.

40|$|AIM: To explore whether {{patients}} with a defective ileocecal valve (ICV) /cecal distension reflex have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. METHODS: Using a colonoscope, under conscious sedation, the ICV was intubated and the colonoscope was placed within the terminal ileum (TI). A manometry catheter with 4 pressure channels, spaced 1 cm apart, was passed through the biopsy channel of the colonoscope into the TI. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn from the TI while the manometry catheter was advanced. The catheter was placed across the ICV so {{that at least one}} pressure port was within the TI, ICV and the cecum respectively. Pressures were continuously measured during air insufflation into the cecum, under direct endoscopic visualization, in 19 volunteers. Air was insufflated to a maximum of 40 mmHg to prevent barotrauma. All subjects underwent lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> one month after the colonoscopy. The results of the <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> were compared with the results of the pressures within the ICV during air insufflation. RESULTS: Nineteen subjects underwent colonoscopy with measurements of the ICV pressures after intubation of the ICV with a colonoscope. Initial baseline readings showed no statistical difference in the pressures of the TI and ICV, between subjects with positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> and normal lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests.</b> The average peak ICV pressure during air insufflation into the cecum in subjects with normal lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> was significantly higher than cecal pressures during air insufflation (49. 33 1; 7. 99 mmHg vs 16. 40 1; 2. 14 mmHg, P = 0. 0011). The average percentage difference of the area under the pressure curve of the ICV from the cecum during air insufflations in subjects with normal lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> was significantly higher (280. 72 % 1; 43. 29 % vs 100 % 1; 0 %, P = 0. 0006). The average peak ICV pressure during air insufflation into the cecum in subjects with positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> was not significantly different than cecal pressures during air insufflation 21. 23 1; 3. 52 mmHg vs 16. 10 1; 3. 39 mmHg. The average percentage difference of the area under the pressure curve of the ICV from the cecum during air insufflation was not significantly different 101. 08 % 1; 7. 96 % vs 100 % 1; 0 %. The total symptom score for subjects with normal lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> and subjects with positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> was not statistically different (13. 30 1; 4. 09 vs 24. 14 1; 6. 58). The ICV peak pressures during air insufflations were significantly higher in subjects with normal lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> than in subjects with positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> (P = 0. 005). The average percent difference of the area under the pressure curve in the ICV from cecum was significantly higher in subjects with normal lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> than in subjects with positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> (P = 0. 0012). Individuals with positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated symptom scores which were significantly higher for the following symptoms: not able to finish normal sized meal, feeling excessively full after meals, loss of appetite and bloating.

40|$|Background: Lactose {{maldigestion}} {{is usually}} diagnosed {{by means of}} the H- 2 <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b> When C- 13 -lactose is used as substrate, a (CO 2) -C- 13 breath rest can be performed simultaneously. In an earlier publication we described the relation between both the H 2 and (CO 2) -C- 13 exhalation in breath and the measured intestinal lactase activity after consumption of C- 13 -lactose. We found a discrepancy between both <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> results in 36 % of the cases. To investigate the possible cause of these incongruous <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> results, we studied gas production from carbohydrate in the colon, using C- 13 -lactulose as a non-absorbable substrate. Methods: Experiments were performed in 21 subjects, by applying 5 different doses of C- 13 -lactulose. Repeatability studies were performed in six of these subjects, using 10 g substrate (three tests with I-week intervals). Results: Both the H- 2 and the (CO 2) -C- 13 excretion in breath varied strongly interindividually and intraindividually after consumption of C- 13 -lactulose. In both cases no dose-response relation was observed. A significant positive linear relationship was found between Hz and (CO 2) -C- 13 exhalation (r = 0. 45, P < 0. 005). Extrapolation of these results to C- 13 -lactose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> indicates that the colonic contribution of (CO 2) -C- 13 production to the total (CO 2) -C- 13 excretion in breath varies but is on the average large enough to cause false-negative (CO 2) -C- 13 <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> results. Conclusions: Excretion in breath of (CO 2) -C- 13 produced in the colon during a C- 13 -lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> correlates with the breath Hz excretion. This could explain the occurrence of false-negative (CO 2) -C- 13 lactose <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> when colonic gas production is high and false-negative lactose Ha <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> results when gas production is low. It can also explain the improved sensitivity of the combined H- 2 /(CO 2) -C- 13 lactose breath rest compared with both <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> alone...|$|R
