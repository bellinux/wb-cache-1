25|$|Coffee may be brewed {{by several}} methods. It may be boiled, steeped, or pressurized. <b>Brewing</b> <b>coffee</b> by boiling was the {{earliest}} method, and Turkish coffee {{is an example}} of this method. It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a bríki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling {{at the bottom of the}} cup.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> on the {{cholesterol}} metabolism of the Wistar rat were investigated. Male rats were housed for 12 weeks in {{three groups of}} 8 animals and were giving drinking water or drinking water containing diluted <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee.</b> Dosis <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> were such that the total intake of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> was equal to resp. 0, 10 - 15 and 20 - 30 cups of coffee per day for a man weighing 60 kg. Parameters studied comprised growth, food intake, water intake and cholesterol metabolism (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, ratio HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol, triglycerides, fosfolipids and the percentages lipoprotein). No effects of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> were seen on growth, food intake, water intake and cholesterol metabolism. Different causes may have had their influence on this insusceptibility. Most likely however is the insusceptibility of the rat for components which influence the cholesterol metabolism. Recommendations for future investigaitons twords the cholesterol increasing effects of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> are: 1) Investigaitons with a susceptible species such as rabbits and preferably with the AX/JU rabbit. 2) Divide the animals according to a good balanced experimental design that is {{in such a manner}} that the mean cholesterol concentrations and the standard deviation of the groups are equal. 3) The <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> may be supplied by two oral routes by way of drinking and by way of consuming food in which lyphilized <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> is mixed. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an infrared spectroscopic evaluation method of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee,</b> whose quality and taste highly {{depend on the}} chemical contents, the interactions between the components, the pH value and the temperature, using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory. The objective {{of this study is}} to understand the influences of the pH values and temperature on the spectral features of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> and the main components, since the component balances of the organic acids originating from coffee beans and being produced during processes such as roasting and extraction could closely relate to the <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> characteristics. The absorption peak sifts of the ATR spectra of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> were observed as the influences of the pH and temperatures. Therefore, by analyzing the spectra of the coffee components under the various pH and temperature conditions based on the ionic dissociation equilibrium theory, the spectral behavior of the <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> model due to the pH and temperature changes could mainly result from those of the organic acids as the main components. Consequently, the infrared spectral information analysis would be acceptable as a new method to evaluate a profile of <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> for the quality evaluation relating to the taste and the non-intensive on-line monitoring of the coffee process...|$|R

50|$|The AeroPress is {{a device}} for <b>brewing</b> <b>coffee.</b> It {{was invented in}} 2005 by Aerobie {{president}} Alan Adler. Coffee is steeped for 10-50 seconds (depending on grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the plunger through the tube. The filters used are either the AeroPress paper filters or disc shaped thin metal filters. The maker describes the result as an espresso strength concentration of coffee, but its most frequent use is more in the filter brew strength.|$|E

Paired samples of green beans, in which the drying step or fermentation/washing step in their processing was altered, were roasted and brewed in a standard manner and their ATR-FT-IR spectra obtained. Difference spectra of the 1800 to 1680 [*]cm− 1 carbonyl region of water-subtracted spectra of paired samples of these <b>brewed</b> <b>coffees</b> provided data which indicated differences in <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> flavor due to changes in fermentation/washing steps and drying steps involved in the processing of coffee cherries.

50|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, making {{a cup of}} coffee was a simple process. Roasted and ground coffee beans were placed in a pot or pan, to which hot water was added, followed by attachment of a lid to commence the infusion process. Pots were designed specifically for <b>brewing</b> <b>coffee,</b> all with the purpose of trying to trap the coffee grounds before the coffee is poured. Typical designs feature a pot with a flat expanded bottom to catch sinking grounds and a sharp pour spout that traps the floating grinds. Other designs feature a wide bulge {{in the middle of the}} pot to catch grounds when coffee is poured.|$|E
