5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

In {{exchange}} for not being killed, Little Ease swears allegiance to Gentle. Gentle has Judith and Monday return to Godolphin's retreat to retrieve stones {{to be used in the}} ceremony, while there Judith encounters Dowd one last time. Before dying, Dowd leaves some doubt in Judith's mind about what Hapexamendios's intentions really are and whether the reconciliation will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> or not. Judith decides to head to Yzordderrex to see the Goddesses and find out from them whether or not the reconciliation should go forward. She tells Monday to return to Gentle with that message and heads to Yzordderrex.|$|E

According to Lawrence Wright, [...] "the entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole. People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was difficult to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters." [...] Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them out loud to each other.|$|E

It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world.

500|$|Portraying {{the head}} guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown {{was given the}} {{opportunity}} to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined believing it would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Morgan's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting [...] "fresh fish" [...] as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the Reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility.

Of Becky she states: [...] "Every scene she's in sparkles and she's {{been a very}} welcome presence in the Street this past year or so. Long may Queen Becky reign." [...] Deller has also praised her friendship with Claire branding it as good direction for the characters, stating: [...] "Claire has made the very smart move of becoming mates with HRH Queen Becky recently. This can only <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> as everything Becky touches turns to gold." [...] Francine Cohen of the Daily Mirror commented on Becky's storylines stating: [...] "Becky’s plots have ranged from drug busts to drunken rampages, but the most poignant yet has been her recent pregnancy, miscarriage and subsequent infertility." [...] Channel 5's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap recall Becky's most memorable moment as being her failed wedding attempt and joked: [...] "She might not remember her first wedding day but we all do!" ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Adults Only" [...] (AO) rating has {{attracted}} a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which {{has been criticized for}} stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is [...] "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for the ESRB system. The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are generally considered children's products; for example, the availability of a Wii version of Manhunt 2 was condemned by Senator Hillary Clinton over fears that children could use the game's motion controls to act out the game's [...] "many graphic torture scenes and murders".|$|E

500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Temple of the Dog was {{released}} on April 16, 1991, through A Records and initially sold 70,000 copies in the United States. Ament recalled that A requested a Pearl Jam sticker be on the cover—as they had just picked their new name—because [...] "it'll <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for us", but they refused. The album received favorable reviews but failed to chart. Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic later rated the album with four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the [...] "record sounds like a bridge between Mother Love Bone's theatrical '70s-rock updates and Pearl Jam's hard-rocking seriousness." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone also wrote in retrospect that the album [...] "deserves immortality." [...] The band members were pleased with the material, as it achieved its purpose; Cornell believed that [...] "Andy really would have liked" [...] the songs, and Gossard also asserted that he thought Wood would be [...] "blown away by the whole thing". Soon after the album's release, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam embarked on recording their next albums, and the Temple of the Dog project was brought to a close.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing....</b> We {{have to deal with}} {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

2500|$|In certain cases, {{exploiting}} {{a resource}} more may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> Carol M. Rose, in an 1986 article, discussed {{the concept of}} the [...] "comedy of the commons", where the public property in question exhibits [...] "increasing returns to scale" [...] in usage (hence the phrase, [...] "the more the merrier"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one.

According to Rose, public resources with the [...] "comedic" [...] characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.|$|E
2500|$|These views have {{support from}} some academics.
