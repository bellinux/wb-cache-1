5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|E

Many people died because of this. And while he was {{drinking}} wine it was required that he ride on someone’s <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse.|$|E
500|$|Blek is {{a puzzle}} {{game in which}} the player draws a [...] "snake-like" [...] black line on the screen that is {{recorded}} and played <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pattern, recurring repeatedly across the screen. The object is {{to draw a line}} that it will remove colored dot targets when it repeats across the screen without hitting a black dot. Lines that travel off the top or bottom of the screen reset the level, while lines that travel off the left or right of the screen reflect back towards the dots. Aside from repeating the player's drawn pattern, the stroke mimics the player's pace in drawing the stroke. The game begins with no prompt or tutorial other than to use a finger on the screen and experiment. The first puzzles are [...] "on open, white canvasses" [...] where the player can solve the simple puzzles [...] "by accident". The 80 levels progress in difficulty and require more complex solutions. Added elements include a [...] "chain reaction" [...] dot that launches other dots when struck. Its sound consists of a [...] "whoosh" [...] that accompanies the traveling stroke, a [...] "chime" [...] when colored dots are hit, and a human [...] "disappointed grumble" [...] when black dots are hit, resetting the level. The game is depicted in flat, plain colors, with no pause feature and no option menu other than Game Center achievements. Players navigate between puzzles using three small onscreen icons. There are no in-app purchases or in-game advertisements.|$|E

He chooses, among several other prizes, one week of free maid service. When his maid Joan arrives, Peter has her pull items out of his belly button (including, among other things, a ColecoVision set and a carton of Parliament Cigarettes to the shock of Peter, who says he hasn't smoked in ten years), and rides on her <b>back,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse, to the store. Peter decides to over-work Joan on her last night by giving Meg a watermelon filled with chocolate pudding and firecrackers, which explodes in her face. After being introduced to her by Peter, Quagmire {{falls in love with}} her. After dating Joan, Quagmire proposes marriage to her, which she accepts and the couple prepare their marriage ceremony. Lois, Peter and their neighbors visit Quagmire's house, finding that he has changed his personality significantly. Peter still believes this to be a prank and shows Quagmire porn magazines in an attempt to change him back to his former ways. Meanwhile, Lois begins to question whether she should keep breastfeeding Stewie, as he's hurting her when feeding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seventh and}} last rhyme is a limerick about an [...] "amiable guinea-pig" [...] (the first guinea pig in Potter's work) who brushes his hair <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> periwig and dons a blue tie. The verse is {{accompanied}} by three illustrations depicting the guinea pig {{in various stages of}} coiffing and dressing. Guinea pigs would have their own story told in the tale of Tupenny in Potter's The Fairy Caravan of 1929.|$|E

Archaeologist Giovanni Lilliu stressed in particular the similarity between the crescent-shaped hilt of the Mont'e Prama statue and the one held by the archer of Santa Vittoria di Serri, wearing the same loincloth, trimmed in the <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tailcoat, as the Monte Prama boxers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{documentary}} mini-series, [...] (released January 22, 2016, at Sundance), {{directed by}} Ezra Edelman and produced by Laylow Films, is an American 5-part, 7.5-hour film that previewed at the Tribeca and Sundance Film Festivals and is airing {{as part of}} the 30 for 30 series airing on the ABC and ESPN sister networks. This film adds [...] "rich contextual layers to the case, including a dive into the history of Los Angeles race relations that played such a central role in his acquittal". As James Poniewozik observed in his June 20, 2016, New York Times review: [...] "the director Ezra Edelman pulls back, way <b>back,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> news chopper over a freeway chase. Before you hear about the trial, the documentary says, you need to hear all the stories—the stories of race, celebrity, sports, America—that it's a part of." [...] The film won a 2017 Academy Award for best Documentary Feature.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, young Habib {{spent his}} summer {{vacations}} in Monastir, among women who he helped with chores: help the servant called Fatma, bring the Baklava tray {{to the oven}} of uncle Hamida, monitor cooking then basting a ladle of honey or participating in the olive grove process. He also {{spent a lot of}} time with his father who insisted that he pursued with a studious education so he could avoid Ali's fate in the army: [...] "I do not want you to be cut <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> workhorse. I do not want you to be like me, sentenced to wear a kit on your shoulders, all day long", did he say to his son. At the end of the holidays, he returned to his brother's in Tunis where, after lessons, he strolled streets and admired the bey coming, on each Thursday to the Kasbah, to chair the seal ceremony. He was also marked with the 2011 Jellaz Affair which ended with the execution of Manoubi Djardjar in Bab Saadoun, where he noticed the hostility and mocking laughter of preponderants. The exiles and repression following the Tramway boycott aiming to protest against the Jellaz issue, soon created an atmosphere of revolt and contestation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, with {{problems}} {{evident in the}} first reconstruction that were left unresolved by the re-excavations at Sutton Hoo, {{the decision was made}} to reexamine the evidence. [...] "After several months' consideration" [...] it was decided to disassemble the helmet and construct it anew. The cheek guards, face mask and neck guard were first removed from the helmet and x-rayed, revealing the wire mesh covered in plaster and overlaid by fragments. The wire was then [...] "rolled <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> carpet", and a saw used to separate each fragment. The remaining plaster was chipped away with a scalpel and needles. The final piece of the helmet, the skull cap, was next cut in half by pushing off the crest with [...] "long pins" [...] inserted through the bottom of the plaster head and then slicing through the middle of the head. The [...] "central core of plaster" [...] was then removed, and the remaining [...] "thin skin of plaster and iron" [...] separated into individual fragments [...] "in the same way as the ear flaps, neck guard and face mask." [...] This process of separation took four months and left the helmet in more than 500 fragments. The result was [...] "terrifying" [...] to Williams. [...] "One of only two known Anglo-Saxon helmets, an object illustrated in almost every book on the early medieval period, lay in pieces." ...|$|E

It had bony scutes on its <b>back,</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> alligator, but had a long snout filled with teeth, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ichthyosaur or a river dolphin.|$|R

2500|$|The album {{includes}} {{production from}} Cole himself, alongside Brian Kidd, No I.D. and L Music Cole wants his fans {{to expect a}} different sound, while he speaks about topics {{that have never been}} included in mainstream hip hop music before. The Source magazine said that Cole's [...] "evolution as a producer solely enhances the product" [...] and that [...] "Outside of co-production from No I.D., this album is all Cole at his rawest. Cole said the production on the song, called [...] "Lost Ones" [...] was influenced by New Zealand music artist Alex Gilbert. The album also features live Orchestra and Musical Sections arranged and produced by Larrance Dopson of 1500 or Nothin', with violin recorded by Ginny Luke on them songs, such as [...] "Rise and Shine", [...] "Lost Ones" [...] and [...] "Breakdown". During the final moments of working on his album, when Cole had lost hope for his dream collaboration with Jay-Z, he explained to Vibe how the collaboration came to fruition, [...] "He was in L.A. and I got [...] that day around the VMAs or whatever. He actually pushed back the mastering, we went to mastering with no Jay-Z verse. I was like 'oh okay cool, I guess he can't do it.' They were mastering the last song, and this is such a Jay-Z move, he called in and stopped the mastering and pushed it <b>back</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> week. Only he can do that." ...|$|E
