25|$|He {{began with}} the Minor County Bedfordshire, that being the county of his birth, and played three matches for them in August, 1946. He then joined Surrey. He played in only six {{first-class}} matches in total between 1947 and 1949, but made a <b>big</b> <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> 1950 when he played in 19 matches, scored his maiden century and averaged 31.37. He had a poor season the following year and appeared in only 11 matches, but in 1952 he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time, averaged 36.15 and was awarded his county cap. From then on he was a regular member of the side until worsening arthritis meant that after 1959 {{he was no longer}} fit enough for first-class cricket. He had two poor seasons in 1955 and 1958, but otherwise reached 1,000 runs every year, making six times in all. When he made his highest score of 191 against Kent at Blackheath in 1956, he put on 174 in two hours with Peter May for the third wicket.|$|E

Tanks would not only continue to be produced in huge numbers, but the technology advanced dramatically as well. Tanks became larger and their armour became thicker and much more effective. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with <b>big</b> <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> shell design and terminal effectiveness. However, nowadays most tanks in service still have manually breech-loaded guns, a trait of the earliest tanks which is shared with most self-propelled and field guns.|$|R
50|$|Magnum sets {{from the}} E301 to the 3AS1691, with their wooden cases, {{thermionic}} valve and braille dial markings were issued between 1939 and 1943.

Recently, {{there has been a}} revival of information theory in many fields. Information-theoretic measures, like the mutual information, have been utilized to optimize MIMO radar waveforms [11]. The loss of information due to sub-Nyquist sampling has been determined applying information theory [12, 13].

The locomotive was not classified and was simply referred to as [...] "the Mikado". On the CGR it was exceeded in size only by the Kitson-Meyer 0-6-0+0-6-0 of 1904.

Early in 1980 it also merged with the Revolutionary Communist League (Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse-tung Thought) led by Amiri Baraka. This organization, formerly known as the Congress of Afrikan People, was composed mostly of African-Americans and had stressed Black cultural nationalism.

5000|$|In the 70's, Jürgen Moser sketched a proof, {{based on}} K.A.M. theory, that outer billiards {{relative}} to a6-times-differentiable shape of positive curvature has all orbits bounded.In 1982, Raphael Douady gave the full {{proof of this}} result.A <b>big</b> <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> the polygonal case came {{over a period of}} several years whenthree teams of authors, Vivaldi-Shaidenko (1987), Kolodziej (1989), and Gutkin-Simanyi (1991), each using different methods,showed that outerbilliards relative to a quasirational polygon has all orbits bounded. The notion of quasirational is technical(see references) but it includes the class of regular polygons and convex rational polygons, namely those convex polygons whose vertices have rational coordinates. In the case of rational polygons, all the orbits areperiodic. In 1995, Tabachnikov showed that outer billiards for the regular pentagon has some aperiodic orbits,thus clarifying the distinction between the dynamics in the rational and regular cases.In 1996, Boyland showed that outer billiards relative to some shapes can have orbits which accumulate onthe shape.In 2005, D. Genin showed that all orbits are bounded when the shape is a trapezoid, thusshowing that quasirationality is not a necessary condition for the system to have all orbits bounded.(Not all trapezoids are quasirational.) ...|$|E

The MRPC allows us to easily construct detectors with many small gas gaps and thus we obtain good timing together with high detection efficiency.

This paper examines space-charge limited avalanche growth; this becomes a dominant effect for narrow gap resistive plate chambers. This effect controls gas gain and explains the reason for the excellent behaviour of MRPCs built with this gas gap...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSixty {{years ago}} the {{clinical}} neurophysiology of epilepsy had progressed to the stage that it posed questions that could be addressed by major <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> cellular electrophysiology made around the that time. However, it took about 25 – 30 years to build up serious momentum in understanding the mechanisms of epileptic discharges. Over the past 2 – 3 decades developments in pharmacology and molecular biology have substantially increased the depth and complexity of our insights into the {{nervous system in general}} and the epileptic brain in particular. One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> our understanding of the brain is in its plasticity in the adult – that is its ability to modify its structure and function. The current state of play is that for most chronic epileptic foci it is possible to identify multiple differences from normal brain tissue in both the structure and function of neurons, neuronal networks and glia. This review will chart some of this progress to give an idea of the pace of advances over the decades...|$|R
