40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of a bubbling phenomenon, including peritoneal surfaces, as a diagnostic test for endometriosis during laparoscopy. A prospectively con-trolled study of women with infertility of at least 1 year duration, who underwent laparoscopy, was conducted at a medical school-affiliated private infertility centre and research foundation. The study included 48 prospectively enrolled female infertility patients who underwent laparos-copy. Of these, 32 were found to suffer from endometriosis (group A) and 16 control patients did not show any evidence of disease (group B). The study involved the irrigation of the posterior cul-de-sac with short bursts of either saline or lactated Ringer's solution, utilizing a standard laparoscopic aspiration/irrigation system, and the subsequent observa-tion for an excessive soap-like bubbling phenomenon (posit-ive <b>bubble</b> <b>test)</b> in association with endometriosis. All 32 endometriosis patients (group A) demonstrated a positive <b>bubble</b> <b>test.</b> In contrast, only two of the 16 control patients (group B) were positive (P = 0. 00242, Fisher's exact test; odds ratio, 8. 000). A positive <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> during laparoscopy was thus 100 % sensitive and 88 % specific for the diagnosis of endometriosis by laparoscopy, resulting in positive and negative predictive values of 94 and 100 % respectively. Since the literature provides considerable evidence that the diagnosis of endometriosis during laparoscopy is frequently missed, a positive <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> during laparoscopy therefore may be considered a reason to search further (possibly with biopsies) for endometriosis in the absence of obviously visible disease. If confirmed, a positive <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> could then become an even more accurate single diagnostic test for endometriosis than laparoscopy...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Predicting {{maturity}} of the foetal lung {{is extremely important}} in many obstetric situations as respiratory distress syndrome caused by surfactant deficiency {{remains one of the}} leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The need for predicting the foetal lung maturity by means of an accurate test which is done rapidly and available in majority of centres was the objective for this study. AIM To find out the optimum lamellar body count which correlates with foetal lung maturity and to compare the lamellar body count with shake <b>bubble</b> <b>test.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective study was designed to evaluate the lamellar body count by standard haematology cell counter that is coulter counter and compare it with shake <b>bubble</b> <b>test.</b> Both the tests were done on 100 amniotic fluid samples in women with gestational age more than 28 weeks. Patients recruited were those who were sure of their last menstrual period (LMP), who were in active labour, and likely to deliver within 72 hours of collection of sample. Amniotic fluid samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis or by aspirating the forewaters per vaginum. Both shake <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> and lamellar body count were done on the sample. RESULTS Lamellar body counts ranged from 10, 000 - 2, 43, 000 /microlitre and had a linear relationship with gestational age. The cut-off level of 30, 000 /microlitre was considered to be optimum to predict foetal lung maturity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{existence}} of rational speculative bubbles in the Middle East and North African (MENA) stock markets. Design/methodology/approach – To complement shortcomings of the traditional <b>bubble</b> <b>tests,</b> such as unit root tests and cointegration tests, mainly relying on expectations of future steams of dividends, the authors employ fractional integration tests and duration dependence tests. Findings – Despite recent extreme fluctuations of MENA stock markets, fractional integration tests built on autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average models do not support the possibility of bubbles in the MENA stock markets. Similarly, duration dependence tests based on nonparametric Nelson-Aalen hazard functions not only reject the existence of bubbles but also support equality of hazard functions between domestic and the US-based investors without regard to the rapid financial liberalization and integration in the MENA stock markets. Originality/value – The reliable results of <b>bubble</b> <b>tests</b> of the MENA stock markets provide domestic and international investors as well as policy makers with invaluable benchmark to better understand the irregular and highly fluctuating stock market behaviors of the MENA stock markets compared to other developed and emerging stock markets. For domestic and international investors, the formal analysis of MENA stock markets behavior including rational speculative bubbles will help them in their portfolio decisions and hedging purposes. Similarly, the empirical results of <b>bubble</b> <b>tests</b> in the paper will be also helpful to policymakers in MENA countries to take actions to improve the functioning of these dynamic markets.

40|$|Identifying {{explosive}} bubbles {{under the}} influence of their periodically collapsing property has long been a concern in <b>bubble</b> <b>testing</b> literature. In this paper, we argue that the sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Phillips, Wu and Yu, 2009), which implements a right-tail ADF test and a sup test on a forward expanding sample sequence, is sensitive to the sample starting point when there are more than one bubble collapsing episodes within the sample range. To surmount this pitfall we propose an alternative method named the generalized sup ADF test, which amplifies the sample sequence by varying the sample starting point within its feasible range. This test improves the power of the <b>bubble</b> <b>testing</b> method significantly. We then apply both tests to the Hong Kong stock market from October 1980 to April 2009. The generalized sup ADF tests find evidence of explosive behavior in the Hang Seng Index, whereas the sup ADF tests suggest the opposite.

40|$|A new {{realization}} of a finite element level set method for simulation of immiscible fluid flows is introduced and validated on numerical bench-marks. The new method involves a mixed discretization {{of the dependent}} variables, discretizing the flow variables with non-conforming Rannacher-Turek finite elements while keeping a simple first order conforming dis-cretization of the level set field. A three step segregated solution approach is employed, first using a discrete projection method to decouple and com-pute the velocity and pressure separately, after which the level set field can be computed independently. The developed method is tested and validated on a static <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> case and on a numerical rising <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> case for which a very accurate benchmark solution has been established.

The standard procedure for the detection of a patent foramen ovale is transesophageal echo­cardiography. Transcranial Doppler sonography with <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> is almost as reliable as transesophageal echocardiography. Seventeen patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks hospitalized at the Department of Neurology in Novi Sad underwent examinations to detect a patent foramen ovale, which was found in 55. 6 % of patients with cryptogenic stroke. The average age of these patients was 30. 6 years. Transcranial Doppler sonography showed 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for the predicti­on of right-to-left shunts proven by transesophageal contrast echocardiography.

40|$|SUMMARY: The case is {{presented}} of a 46 year-old male, obese {{and a heavy}} smoker, who presented with acute dyspnea {{a few hours after}} elective arthroscopy of his left knee. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of severe hypoxaemia, and was started on anticoagulant therapy because of intermediate risk of pulmonary embolism. In view of the refractory hypoxaemia that worsened during intense Valsalva manoeuvre, the suspicion of an intracardiac (interatrial) right-to-left shunt was raised, most probably a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD). In view of the severe hypoxaemia and the anticoagulant therapy, initial assessment with transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination with <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> study was deemed preferable and this confirmed a shunt. Subsequent transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) <b>bubble</b> <b>test</b> assessment demonstrated the presence of a PFO. Recent recommendations favour TCD as the method of choice for detecting PFO because it is non-invasive, cheaper, faster to perform and comparable with TEE in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|This study {{looks for}} the {{presence}} of rational speculative bubbles in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) using unit-root, variance ratio, duration dependence and regime switching regression tests. The regime switching method provides weak evidence of speculative bubble behaviour in both the mortgage and hybrid REITs sectors even though traditional econometric <b>bubble</b> <b>tests</b> do not provide evidence of rational speculative bubbles in all REIT markets. Findings suggest that price movement in mortgage and hybrid REITs may be induced by bubble-like behaviour of investors. This behaviour may be traced to the real estate market bubble.

The spurious currents source term is expressed from the vorticity equation and used to discuss and compare the methods. Simulations of gas–liquid Taylor flow at low capillary number show that the flow structure and the bubble velocity can be significantly affected by spurious currents...|$|E
