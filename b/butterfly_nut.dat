2500|$|On the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{there is}} a variety of {{different}} lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal wing nut (<b>butterfly</b> <b>nut)</b> lifting a screw-threaded bar attached {{to the top of the}} paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a wooden plate which seals the culvert. These are known locally as [...] "jack cloughs". Bottom gate paddles are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a wooden plate sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift. Many of these idiosyncratic paddles have been [...] "modernised" [...] and they are becoming rare.|$|E
50|$|This was {{a concept}} vehicle commemorating 75th anniversary of BMW 328. It {{included}} {{exterior and interior}} parts made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP); leather, matt and high-gloss black polished aluminium {{as well as the}} CFRP interior; asymmetrically designed windscreen with a recess in the middle, four wide leather straps run across the bonnet, two-part light alloy wheels with black aluminium rim and black chrome <b>butterfly</b> <b>nut</b> bearing the BMW emblem.|$|E

40|$|Hand-related {{apparatus}} {{designs that}} fail to accommodate appropriate hand postures can cause hand-related musculoskeletal disorders. While there have been studies on the handling and design of various hand-related apparatus, little has been written on the ergonomics aspects of knob designs. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review various knob designs and their ergonomics aspects. The literature review suggests that gearshift knobs, door knobs, gas valve knobs, <b>butterfly</b> <b>nuts</b> and screw knobs are common knobs used for daily living activities. Other knobs like the convex, knurled, spherical, cone-shaped and ridged knob are often used for industrial-related applications. The ergonomics considerations identified in knobs include aesthetic attraction, position, torque requirement and shape-coding. This literature review can be used as groundwork for the development of ergonomics theory and hand-related studies. Engineers can use this literature review to identify certain ergonomics aspects in knobs to improve equipment designs, operating efficiency and working comfort...|$|R
5000|$|The late 20s {{and early}} 30s were {{an era of}} {{transition}} in relation to bicycle equipment and race conditions. Areas of controversy were the use of variable gears and two sprocket wheels, single tyres, the use of <b>butterfly</b> or wing <b>nuts</b> [...] {{and the provision of}} outside assistance. The Dunlop Grand Prix permitted variable gears but prohibited <b>butterfly</b> or wing <b>nuts</b> and singles. The riders were required to repair their own bikes during the stage, were not able to change bicycles unless it was bona fide damaged [...] and no spare parts or other assistance were permitted. Similarly the riders were not permitted to accept food or drink other than from officials at feeding stations or procured by rider from established store, hotel or refreshment room.|$|R
