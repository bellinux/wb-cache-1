40|$|Abstract — Under the {{enhanced}} single buyer model of electricity supply industry in Thailand, tariff regulation {{is needed to}} prevent unfair pricing for consumers. Retail electricity tariff, being separated into <b>base</b> <b>tariff</b> and automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, has been regulated by multiple regulatory bodies. Findings reveal that Thai electricity <b>base</b> <b>tariff</b> regulations tended to favor electric utilities rather than consumers, basing on rate of return regulatory approach. In addition, the automatic tariff adjustment mechanism attached greater importance to operators than to the consumers, enabling the former to fully pass the fuel and power purchase burdens through to the consumers. The results of adoption of current regulatory regime are excess capacity in electricity supply industry and excessive profits for electric utilities. This paper, thus, proposed tariff regulatory alternatives that could enhance efficiency of operators while simultaneously sharing these benefits with consumers...|$|E

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} effects a demand <b>based</b> <b>tariff</b> {{would have on}} private {{electricity}} consumers and how it could contribute to a sustainable electrical grid. The fuse tariff that is currently used charges customers for their electricity usage and does not fully reflect the electrical grid load and thereby not the cost for the distribution system operators. A demand <b>based</b> <b>tariff,</b> that charges customers for their power peaks and promotes a change of behaviour better reflects the grid load and {{could lead to a}} more even grid distribution and a sustainable development. In light of this issue, two demand <b>based</b> <b>tariffs</b> have been constructed for the energy company Upplands Energi’s private customers’ current electricity consumption. One of the tariffs consists of a higher fixed cost and a lower variable cost and the other consists of a lower fixed cost and a higher variable cost, both leading to the same revenue för Upplands Energi. The two different demand <b>based</b> <b>tariffs</b> have been simulated and analysed, where the one with the lowest fixed cost is recommended since it gives customers higher economic incentives to change their electricity usage behaviour.

Payment for environmental services (PES) is seen as a promising instrument to address the problem, for which one key information is the willingness to pay (WTP) of urban water users for water source pollution control. Using a contingent valuation survey data, we estimate the WTP of Fuzhou City residents for pollution control by the livestock farms located at the upstream Min River. When the protest responses are not distinguished, the mean WTP is estimated at CNY 0. 21 /m 3, or 10 % of the current <b>base</b> <b>tariff.</b> When the protestors are distinguished, the estimated mean WTP equals CNY 0. 51. The total annual WTPs of the two cases are CNY 22 Â million and CNY 53 Â million, respectively, which lead to potentially opposite conclusions about Fuzhou's participation in the provincial PES program, to which Fuzhou contributes CNY 30 Â million. The results highlight the importance of addressing protest responses in contingent valuation as well as in policymaking and implementation. We find that the WTP varies greatly with income, which calls for attention to the affordability and distribution issues of a water tariff reform.

40|$|The authors {{provide an}} {{overview}} of recent privatization experiences in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. They focus on both achievements and outstanding problems in the electricity sector. They pay special attention to the issue of whether regulators can enforce compliance and sustain the spirit of reform - bringing the forces of competition to the sector - despite the unavoidable adjustments and fine-tuning that effective regulation requires. Among the lessons: Competition, rather than privatization, is the key to transforming the sector. For competition to work, several conditions must be met: 1) The primary energy source must be competitive for competition in the wholesale market to work. (In Chile, {{the fact that most of}} the water rights have been allocated to the major generator company seriously limits efficiency in the sector.) 2) Monopolistic stages must be formally separate from other stages, with clear rules for third-party access. (Here, the structure adopted by Argentina seems superior to that adopted by Chile.) 3) New entry into the system is the ultimate test of competition. The main gain from competition in electricity generation comes from the decentralization of decisions about when, how much, and what type of generation has to be brought to the market, rather than from short-term gains from minimizing costs. Overall, vertical and horizontal separation in the sector increases rather than reduces the burden and complexity of regulation. In a disintegrated system, the issues that arose in a traditional monopoly situation (fair rate of return, asset <b>base,</b> <b>tariff</b> to final consumers, and so on) are significantly increased. New issues include third-party access, the promotion of competition, interconnection pricing, and consistency of regulations across stages of competitive development. Restructuring and privatization are still in their early stages so lessons drawn from experience must be considered tentative.

In this paper, frequency based technique has been applied for determination of unscheduled interchange revenue paid by such defaulter market participants. The frequency based technique has been applied to double auction modified IEEE- 30 bus test system. The whole transmission system has been divided into three sections; prevailing frequency in these regions can be assumed due to unscheduled interchange occurring in the system.

The WPS is one of the CEB's provinces in administrating the electricity distribution system. Different tariff structures were developed under two approaches. They are; one based on average incremental cost and the other based on average historical cost. In order to develop above tariff structures future load forecasts were made using the past rends and the planning period for the tariff study was taken as from 2002 to 2009. Theenergy, peak power and loses for the above period were established. Future costs including investments, system augmentation and rehabilitation costs, operation and maintenance costs were established for the planning period. Using above data, tariff structures were developed using AIC principals under four scenarios to see the effect of different parameters. Average historical cost <b>based</b> <b>tariff</b> was developed using 200 I data and it establishes a slightly lower tariff than the AIC <b>based</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Also, prices are differentiated only on voltage levels in the historical cost <b>based</b> <b>tariff</b> due to the non-availability of adequate data. Sensitivities of these tariffs were checked for the purchase price and for the discount rate. All these tariff structures were compared and most appropriate tariff was selected which differentiate prices on voltage levels, time of usage, and contribution to the peak. As the average generation costs of CEB has been continuously increased since 2000 due to the emergency and hired thermal power, a more realistic price at the grid sub level was established based on the thermal and hydro costs, and the generation mix It was found that this price is Rs. 5. 73 per kWh at grid substation level. With this purchase price: the proposed tariff was revalued to establish the final tariff structure. This final tariff generates an average selling price of Rs. 7. 35. This final tariff is then compared with the present. it charges higher price for Domestic, LECO and Street light consumers and charge a lower price for Industrial and Commercial consumers.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for rail travel in this country which is {{difficult}} to satisfy. The result is increased congestion on Britain’s railways. One feature of rail infrastructure congestion is a direct link between capacity utilisation and reactionary delay. The latter is the secondary delay that an already late train causes to a following train. This thesis re-examines the relationship between capacity utilisation and performance (as expressed by the level of reactionary delay). It compares {{the effectiveness of the}} standard measure of capacity utilisation in Britain (the Capacity Utilisation Index or CUI) with amongst others a measure developed in the Netherlands (the Heterogeneity measure or HET) which uses a radically different approach. The analysis presented in this thesis finds that HET which measures how capacity is used through the spacing of trains, is a more effective predictor of the levels of reactionary delay than CUI which simply measures how much capacity is used. In both cases though, an exponential relationship between capacity utilisation and reactionary delay is preferred, reinforcing the work of previous researchers. In 2002 a congestion charge, called The Capacity Charge, was introduced in Britain. The idea was to encourage the Infrastructure Owner (now known as Network Rail) to accommodate more traffic whilst working with train operators to optimise capacity utilisation on the network. The Capacity Charge is based on the relationship between CUI and reactionary delay. However, this thesis shows that HET <b>based</b> <b>tariffs</b> would charge more for congestion than CUI <b>based</b> <b>tariffs.</b> In addition there is a greater differential between peak and off-peak charges. One conclusion is that CUI undercharges for congestion due to its failure to account for the impact of train ‘bunching’. ...|$|R
