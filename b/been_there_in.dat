25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has never <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|Domesday Book {{does not}} mention any mill at Monks Risborough, but there was {{certainly}} a mill there by the 14th century. During the 14th and 15th centuries the millward was several times brought before the manor court accused of overcharging. In 1535 the valuation, made prior to the dissolutioon of the monasteries, showed Monks Risborough (part of {{the property of the}} Priory of Christchurch, Canterbury) as having two mills, which brought in for the Priory an income of £25.8s.11d a year. In the 17th century the then Lord of the Manor owned two mills at his death, a watermill and a windmill on 'Brokenhill' Excavations in 2002/06 found the site of a former windmill on the top of Whiteleaf Hill, thought to have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the 16th and 17th centuries.

2500|$|Under the Romans, {{for example}} {{in the time of}} Augustus, the Tungri civitas was at first {{considered}} {{to be a part of}} Gallia Belgica. Later, probably in the time of Diocletian, it split out, away from their Belgian neighbours to the west, the Menapii and Nervii, to join with the territories which lay along the militarized Rhine border and become part of Germania Inferior [...] "Lower Germania", and still later this was reorganized to become Germania Secunda. Many of the tribal groups which inhabited the west bank of the Rhine were dominated by immigrants from the east bank. To the north of the Tungri, in the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta in the modern Netherlands were the Batavians and Frisiavones and possibly still some of the Menapii who had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> Caesar's time. To the northeast, in the bend of the Rhine, were the Cugerni, who were probably descended from a division of the Sicambri, and probably the Baetasi also. To the east of the Tungri were the Sunici and on the Rhine the Ubii, whose city was Cologne, the provincial capital. The Tungri, along with many of the tribal states of Germania Inferior, participated in the Revolt of the Batavi.|$|E
