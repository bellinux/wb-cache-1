5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E

50|$|The Sally Lightfoot crab, the periwinkle, {{the common}} West Indian Chiton, the rock boring urchin, and <b>the</b> brown booby <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{affected}} (least resilient)species after the spill. The Sally Lightfoot crab <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected crustacean after the spill. This crustacean <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abundant of all crustaceans in the area. The sally lightfoot crab <b>is</b> prominent in <b>the</b> Caribbean {{as well as}} the West coast of the United States. The periwinkle and the common West Indian chiton <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected of <b>the</b> mollusks observed after the spill. Of all sea urchins observed after the spill, the rock-boring urchin fared the worst. Rock-boring urchins <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected organism compared to all observed species after the spill, as they accounted for 29% of all recorded affected species. Of all birds observed after the spill <b>the</b> brown booby <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected. <b>The</b> main reason that most of these species <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected after <b>the</b> spill <b>was</b> simply because they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abundant species located in the spill area. Only 63% of the sea turtles and birds that <b>were</b> treated after <b>the</b> spill survived.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Benign tumors of {{the parotid}} gland {{comprise}} the majority of salivary gland tumors. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical characteristics of parotid gland tumors submitted to surgical treatment by the same surgeon. METHODS: Retrospective study with 154 patients who had parotid gland tumors. Clinical and histological data, type of surgery, and complications were assessed and described. RESULTS: <b>The</b> main manifestation <b>was</b> a mass with a median evolution of 12 months for benign tumors and five months for malignant tumors. Ultrasonography <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent complementary exam. Pleomorphic adenoma <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common of <b>the</b> benign tumors, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent malignant tumor.
