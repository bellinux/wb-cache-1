2500|$|Winchester Football {{could be}} {{considered}} a cross between football and rugby, though this analogy shouldn't be taken too far since there are significant differences. For example, the ball can only be carried, like in rugby, if caught full toss. Furthermore, no football-type [...] "dribbling" [...] is allowed since the player may not touch the ball more than once at a time. Neither can the <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> passed to a team-mate, except by back-heeling to a teammate behind. Furthermore, a player who finds himself upfield must return to the point at which his teammate last kicked the ball before being able to join in the game again, unless in the interim an opposite player has touched the ball. The current form of the game can be played by teams of 6, 9, 10, 11, or 15. There are also rugby-type scrums known as [...] "hots", which feature 8 forwards in the 15-player version and 3 in the 6-player version of the game. The objective is to kick the ball over the opponent's goal line ("worms"). The field ("canvas") is 73m (240ft) long and 24.5m (60ft) wide. It is delimited lengthwise by canvas netting and by posts threaded with a heavy rope that run parallel 1 metre inside the netting, and 1 metre above the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{good example}} of seam bowling {{technique}} are the fast bowlers Courtney Walsh & Curtly Ambrose. [...] Close-up camera work of the following descriptions can be viewed for example at:. [...] Both Walsh & Ambrose used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand. [...] However, significantly, their choice of finger position causes the ball to exhibit precession (similar to a gyroscope), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o'clock & 7 o'clock position (if viewed {{from the bottom of}} the seam). [...] This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between outswing & inswing seam positions through the air). [...] Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate). [...] However, when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 5 o'clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batsman), when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 7 o'clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batsman). [...] It can be seen that only rarely would the <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> at the purely 6 o'clock position to continue completely straight after pitching. [...] This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the pitch surface.|$|E

Thus, if a ball which would not occasion a current in the air have a flame, whether large or small, formed on its surface, the current is produced with the greatest ease; but not the least difficulty can occur in comprehending the effective action of the flame in this case, if its relation, as part of the surrounding dielectric, to the electrified <b>ball,</b> <b>be</b> but for a moment considered (1375. 1380.).|$|E
6000|$|... 166. If {{the upper}} part of the {{revolving}} <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> considered as a wire moving from east to west, over the unmarked pole of the earth, the current of electricity in it should be from north to south (99. 114. 150.); if the under part be considered as a similar wire, moving from west to east over the same pole, the electric current should be from south to north; and the circulation of electricity should therefore be from north above to south, and below back to north, in a metal ball revolving from east above to west in these latitudes. Now these currents are exactly those required to give the directions of the needle in the experiments just described; so that the coincidence of the theory from which the experiments were deduced with the experiments themselves, is perfect.|$|E

If a small positive <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> throwing off brushes with ramifications ten inches long, how can the ball affect that part of a ramification which is five inches from it? Yet the portion beyond that place has the same character as that preceding it, and no doubt has that character impressed by the same general principle and law. Looking upon the action of the contiguous particles of a dielectric as fully proved, I see, in such a ramification, a propagation of discharge from particle to particle, each doing for the one next it what was done for it by the preceding particle, and what was done for the first particle by the charged metal against which it was situated.|$|E

Take next a drop {{of strong}} {{solution}} of muriate of lime; being electrified, a part will probably be dissipated, but a considerable portion, if the electricity be not too powerful, will remain, forming a conical drop (fig. 136.), accompanied by a strong current. If glow be produced, the drop will be smooth on the surface. If a short low brush is formed, a minute tremulous motion of the liquid will be visible; but both effects coincide with the principal one to be observed, namely, the regular and successive charge of air, {{the formation of a}} wind or current, and the form given by that current to the fluid drop, if a discharge <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> gradually brought toward the cone, sparks will at last pass, and these will be from the apex of the cone to the approached ball, indicating a considerable degree of conducting power in this fluid.|$|E
6000|$|... 1502. If, now, a small <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> made to give brushes or brushy sparks by a {{powerful}} machine, we can, in some measure, understand and relate the difference perceived when it is rendered positive or negative. It is known to give when positive a much larger and more powerful spark than when negative, and with greater facility (1482.): in fact, the spark, although it takes away so much more electricity at once, commences at a tension higher only in a small degree, if at all. On the other hand, if rendered negative, though discharge may commence at a lower degree, it continues but for a very short period, very little electricity passing away each time. These circumstances are directly related; for {{the extent to which}} the positive spark can reach, and the size and extent of the positive brush, are consequences of the capability which exists of much electricity passing off at one discharge from the positive surface (1468. 1501.).|$|E

If {{the mercury}} {{at the bottom}} of the fluid be {{connected}} with the electrical machine, whilst a rod is held in the hand terminating in a ball three quarters of an inch, less or more, in diameter, and the <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> dipped into the electrified fluid, very striking appearances ensue. When the ball is raised again so as to be at a level nearly out of the fluid, large portions of the latter will seem to cling to it (fig. 138.). If it be raised higher, a column of the oil of turpentine will still connect it with that in the basin below (fig. 139.). If the machine be excited into more powerful action, this will become more bulky, and may then also be raised higher, assuming the form (fig. 140); and all the time that these effects continue, currents and counter-currents, sometimes running very close together, may be observed in the raised column of fluid.|$|E

6000|$|... 1467. The effect varies {{exceedingly}} {{under different}} circumstances, but, as we must {{set out from}} some position, may perhaps be stated thus: if a metallic wire with a rounded termination in free air be used to produce the brushy discharge, then the brushes obtained when the wire is charged negatively are very poor and small, by comparison with those produced when the charge is positive. Or if a large metal ball connected with the electrical machine be charged positively, and a fine uninsulated point be gradually brought towards it, a star appears on the point when at a considerable distance, which, though it becomes brighter, does not change its form of a star until it is close up to the ball: whereas, if the <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> charged negatively, the point at a considerable distance has a star on it as before; but when brought nearer, (in my case to the distance of 1-1/2 inch,) a brush formed on it, extending to the negative ball; and when still nearer, (at 1/8 of an inch distance,) the brush ceased, and bright sparks passed. These variations, I believe, include the whole series of differences, {{and they seem to}} show at once, that the negative surface tends to retain its discharging character unchanged, whilst the positive surface, under similar circumstances, permits of great variation.|$|E
6000|$|... 1483. But {{previous}} to {{the description}} of further experiments, I will mention two words, for which with many others I am indebted to a friend, and which I {{think it would be}} expedient to introduce and use. It is important in ordinary inductive action, to distinguish at which charged surface the induction originates and is sustained: i.e. if two or more metallic balls, or other masses of matter, are in inductive relation, to express which are charged originally, and which are brought by them into the opposite electrical condition. I propose to call those bodies which are originally charged, inductric bodies; and those which assume the opposite state, in consequence of the induction, inducteous bodies. This distinction is not needful because there is any difference between the sums of the inductric and the inducteous forces; but principally because, when a ball A is inductric, it not merely brings a ball B, which is opposite to it, into an inducteous state, but also many other surrounding conductors, though some of them may be a considerable distance off, and the consequence is, that the balls do not bear the same precise relation to each other when, first one, and then the other, is made the inductric ball; though, in each case, the same <b>ball</b> <b>be</b> made to assume the same state.|$|E
