5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> bad for Marilyn, the {{siblings}} decide to dismember Ryan's body {{and give it}} to Mars and the neighbors' dogs as food. Finally, when Patrick admits that Ryan has basically always been a friend to him, Marilyn reveals her plan: She and Ryan just faked his death, and the body that Patrick has been {{trying to get rid of}} has been Marilyn's sex doll all the time. Ryan has assumed the role of his aunt.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is {{commonly}} misunderstood and often appalls cat owners <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like torture, is that cats often appear to [...] "play" [...] with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative {{to ensure that the}} prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat. This behavior is referred to in the idiom [...] "cat-and-mouse game" [...] or simply [...] "cat and mouse".|$|E

500|$|Cyclones are {{not unique}} to Earth. Cyclonic storms are common on Jovian planets, such as the Small Dark Spot on Neptune. It is about one third the {{diameter}} of the Great Dark Spot and received the nickname [...] "Wizard's Eye" [...] <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud {{in the middle of the}} Wizard's Eye. Mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms. Jovian storms like the Great Red Spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms. However, this is inaccurate, as the Great Red Spot is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an anticyclone.|$|E
500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine piece was considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked questions about the bill's provisions, {{though he did not}} object to its passage. When the Alabama bill came to the floor, Vestal yielded time for a statement in favor from Rainey, which began with a brief explanation of the bill followed by a much longer paean to the glorious history of his home state, and his conclusion drew applause. Gard then questioned Vestal, and learned that another coin, the Pilgrim one, was next on the House's agenda. [...] Gard expressed his concerns about commemorative coins, [...] "but {{for the life of me}} I can not see what advantage there is for a State celebration to gather up a lot of coins with a particular stamp on them. It seems to me rather to cheapen the national coin. <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like an old-fashioned medal at a county ...|$|E
500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm not going to {{look at it as a}} negative. This is a tribute for what the man has done, a day to celebrate." [...] Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the USA Today that he won't wear number 42 because [...] "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Novelty was the crowd’s {{favourite}} {{to win the}} Trials. This may be <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like a steam carriage (which people {{associated with}} speed and improvements in transport) or <b>it</b> may be <b>because</b> <b>it</b> did not <b>look</b> like a typical colliery engine of the time.

5000|$|The {{three-way}} {{comparison operator}} for numbers is spelled [...] in Perl, Ruby, Groovy, PHP and Ceylon, and {{is called the}} spaceship operator <b>because</b> <b>it</b> reminded Randal L. Schwartz of the spaceship in an HP BASIC Star Trek game.

2500|$|The Hamburger Morgenpost {{questioned}} whether RTL misquoted DSDS Top 10 candidate Anna-Carina Woitschack. In an interview, Anna-Carina {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "It was cut together all wrong. I never said that I hate Sarah – but on the contrary, I do not hate Sarah Engels. That is what I said.

2500|$|Much of {{the area}} of the former Soviet Union, and Russia in particular, is located at high latitudes. To {{broadcast}} to these latitudes from a geostationary orbit (above the Earth's equator) would require considerable power due to the low elevation angles. A satellite in a Molniya orbit is better suited to communications in these regions <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> directly down on them. In fact, in the period from apogee −3 hours to apogee +3 hours, the sub-satellite point of the spacecraft is north of latitude 55.5° N and the elevation of the spacecraft is over 10° from all points north of latitude 54.1° N and over 5° from all points north of latitude 49.2° N.|$|E

The user does get the option to not install the 'sponsor' program, however, even if slightly unorthodoxly.|$|R
50|$|Bari is {{mentioned}} in the 1995 film The Bridges of Madison County starring Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. In the film Francesca tells Robert that she comes from a town nobody ever heard of called Bari.

25|$|His sympathies, however, {{were all}} on their side, and he would do nothing to {{diminish}} their chances of success. He would not even oppose the doctrine of innate ideas, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> with a friendly eye upon piety and morality. He granted that it might, perhaps, {{be the case that}} ideas were both born with us and afterwards impressed upon us from without.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{ghost stories}} in the region combine these elements. For instance, they might involve a protagonist who fails to flee or take {{countermeasures}} when they run across a bhoot. Instead, they unwittingly accept the bhoot's companionship (e.g., makes the ghost a companion as he/she walks through a forest, picks up the ghost in his car <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like an attractive woman waiting by the roadside at night). They become progressively aware that their companion is dressed entirely in white and has a funnily nasal voice, before the horrifying realization dawns on them that their companion's feet are turned backwards, [...] or he/she is not casting a shadow in the moonlight, or is walking without actually touching the ground. Bhoots are said to seek out milk and immerse themselves in it. Consuming bhoot-contaminated milk is considered a typical route for bhoot-possession of humans, which {{has also been a}} frequent plot element in bhoot stories.|$|E

60|$|Oakes {{belonged to}} the magnifying-glass school of detection.

25|$|European adventurer Philipp Franz von Siebold transported Japanese {{knotweed}} from a Japanese volcano to Holland. By 1850 {{a specimen}} from this plant {{was added to}} the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. It was favoured by gardeners <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like bamboo and grew everywhere. Ann Conolly provided the first authoritative work on the history and distribution of the plant in the UK and Europe in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|At the Venezuelan {{parliamentary}} election, 1993, the Chamber saw {{the introduction}} of a mixed member proportional representation system, modelled on the German system, with some variations.

5000|$|Nogales, Arizona, was {{the filming}} {{location}} for the motion picture musical, Oklahoma!. Nogales was chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> more like turn-of-the-century Oklahoma (when the musical is set) than anywhere in Oklahoma did in 1955, when the film was made.
