40|$|Abstract The {{restricted}} partition method (RPM) {{provides a}} way to detect qualitative factors (e. g. genotypes, environmental exposures) associated with variation in quantitative or binary phenotypes, even if the contribution is predominantly an interaction displaying little or no signal in univariate analyses. The RPM provides a model (possibly non-linear) {{of the relationship between}} the predictor covariates and the phenotype as well as measures of statistical and clinical significance for the model. Blind to the generating model, we used the RPM to screen a data set consisting 1500 unrelated cases and 2000 unrelated controls from Replicate 1 of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problem 3 data for genetic and environmental factors contributing to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk. Both univariate and pair-wise analyses were performed using sex, smoking, parental DRB 1 HLA microsatellite alleles, and 9187 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes from across the genome. With this approach we correctly identified three genetic loci contributing directly to RA risk, and one quantitative trait locus for the endophenotype IgM level. We did not mistakenly identify any factors not in the generating model. All the factors we found were detectable with univariate RPM analyses. We failed to identify two genetic loci modifying the risk of RA. After <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind,</b> we examined the true modeling factors in the first 50 data replicates and found that we would not have identified the additional factors as important even had we combined all the data from the first 50 replicates in a single data set. </p...|$|E
40|$|Finite impulse {{response}} (FIR) filters {{are considered the}} least constrained option for the blind estimation of the hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, they {{have a tendency to}} yield unstable solutions in the case of short-events sequences. There are solutions based on regularization, e. g. smooth FIR (sFIR), but at the cost of a regularization penalty and prior knowledge, thus <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> principle. In this study, we show that spreading codes (scFIR) outperforms FIR and sFIR in short-events sequences, thus enabling the blind and dynamic estimation of the HRF without numerical instabilities and the regularization penalty. The scFIR approach was applied in short-events sequences of simulated and experimental functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In general terms, scFIR performed the best with both simulated and experimental data. While FIR was unable to compute the blind estimation of two simulated target HRFs for the shortest sequences (15 and 31 events) and sFIR yielded shapes barely correlated with the targets, scFIR achieved a normalized correlation coefficient above 0. 9. Furthermore, scFIR was able to estimate in a responsive way dynamic changes of the amplitude of a simulated target HRF more accurately than FIR and sFIR. With experimental fMRI data, the ability of scFIR to estimate the real HRF obtained from a training data set was superior in terms of correlation and mean-square error. The use of short-events sequences for the blind estimation of the HRF could benefit patients in terms of scanning time or intensity of magnetic field in clinical tests. Furthermore, short-events sequences could be used, for instance, on the online detection of rapid shifts of visual attention that, according to literature, entails rapid changes in the amplitude of the HRF...|$|E

40|$|Stereology is {{the science}} that uses {{geometric}} probability {{to extract the}} internal quantitative properties of a three dimensional object based on lower dimensional information. It is a valuable research tool in biological science and relies heavily on statistical principles. In this dissertation, we focus on studies that examine the number of neurons in a brain region of interest using stereological techniques in order to compare subjects in different diagnostic groups, e. g., subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects. A large number of counting frames are usually used to obtain a prespecified precision for an individual {{in these kinds of}} studies. Typically, researchers determine the number of counting frames for each individual by controlling the coefficient of error for the individual. However, the researchers from the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD) at University of Pittsburgh primarily focus on comparing biomarkers among different diagnosis groups rather than evaluating individuals. A design goal for such stereological studies is to keep study cost within budget and time constraints, while maintaining sufficient statistical power to address the research aims. Statistical power can be increased by either adding more subjects or more counting frames. And the cost of a study can be approximated by a linear combination of the number of subjects and number of counting frames. To address this need, we have developed new technologies that enable researchers to design a cost efficient study balancing the number of subjects with the number of counting frames for each subject. We also develop adaptive designs to conduct stereological studies. Adaptive designs allow the opportunity to look at the data at an interim stage, and to modify the design based on the information obtained from the first stage data. In our adaptive design, we estimate the stereological variance without <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> of the Stage I data, and re-design the second stage based on the stereological variance estimator obtained from the first stage. Based on our procedure, we show researchers can cost-effectively modify the design while maintaining the desired study power...|$|E
40|$|Sample size {{calculations}} {{in clinical}} trials depend on good estimates of the standard devotion. Due to the uncertainty in the planning phase, adaptive sample size designs {{have been used to}} re-estimate the standard deviation based on interim data and adjust the sample size as necessary. Our research concentrates on carrying out the sample size re-estimation without obtaining the treatment identities. Gould and Shih treated the data at the interim as coming from a mixture of two normal distributions with common standard deviation. In order to adjust the sample size, they used EM algorithm to obtain the MLE of the standard deviation while keeping treatment identities blinded. However, the approach has been criticized in the literature and our simulation studies show that Gould and Shih's EM algorithm sometimes obtains incorrect boundary modes as estimates of the standard deviation. In our research, we establish a new procedure to re-estimate sample size without <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> but using additional information concerning randomization structure at the interim. We enhance Gould and Shih's EM procedure by utilizing the conditional Bernoulli model to incorporate the available information that equal numbers of subjects are observed at the interim stage. Properties of the proposed enhanced EM estimator are investigated in detail. Furthermore, we use the full information of the blocked randomization schedule in the enhanced EM algorithm that the numbers of subjects are equal across treatment groups within each randomization block. With increased information that occurs with increasing block sizes, the accuracy of the estimation of the standard deviation improves. More specifically, the estimator has quite a small bias when the block size is small which is fairly common the case {{in clinical trials}}. Moreover, for the case of two treatment groups, the preservation of the actual type I error rate when using the standard t-test {{at the end of the}} trial is verified through a simulation study in many parameter scenarios. We also analytically computed and simulated the actual power and the expected sample size. Finally, we develop the details of sample size re-estimation for multi-center clinical trials, where we have the randomization schedule blocked within center...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntroduction The GSM- 1800 signal {{has been}} in use for several years in Europe and {{questions}} raised about its potential biological effects, {{in view of the}} fact that, with respect to GSM- 900, the increase in the carrier frequency corresponds to a more superficial absorption in the tissues. Consequently, the skin becomes an even more important target for the absorption of the radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted by mobile phones. Nevertheless, brain tissues remain a critical target. Cells In order to determine whether RFR at 1800 MHz could behave as a genotoxic agent, skin and brain cells were exposed to a 217 -Hz-modulated GSM- 1800 signal and assayed using the comet assay: (i) normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) which are cutaneous cells from epidermis and dermis respectively, and (ii) the SH -SY 5 Y and CHME- 5 human cell lines, which are neuroblastoma and microglial cells, respectively. Exposure The RFR exposure system that was used in these experiments was manufactured by IT'IS (Zurich, Switzerland). It consists in two shorted waveguides allowing to run exposed and sham conditions at the same time in the same culture incubator, at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2. It is controlled by a software, which provides blind conditions until completion of data analysis. The specific absorption rate (SAR) used was 2 W/kg, corresponding to the public exposure limit recommended by ICNIRP and the exposure duration was 48 hours. Comet assay At the end of the exposure, cells were removed from their Petri dish by trypsin/EDTA treatment, counted and 5 x 10 4 cells were used to detect DNA damage including single DNA breaks. Positive controls were performed using hydrogen peroxydase (1 %, 1 hour). The genotoxic effects were detected using the alkaline comet assay kit (TrevigenÒ slides) following the supplier procedure. Under these conditions, 6 independent experiments were performed for each cell type (2 Petri dishes by run). The analysis was done on at least 100 images from two comet slides (one per Petri dish) for each cellular model and exposure condition. Results The analysis of the slides is ongoing.

40|$|In {{fixed sample}} size designs, precise {{knowledge}} about {{the magnitude of the}} outcome variable's variance in the planning phase of a clinical trial is mandatory for an adequate sample size determination. Wittes and Brittain introduced the internal pilot study design that allows recalculation of the sample size during an ongoing trial using the estimated variance obtained from an interim analysis. However, this procedure requires the unblinding of the treatment code. Since unblinding of an ongoing trial should be avoided whenever possible, there should be some benefit of this design compared with blinded sample size recalculation procedures to justify the unveiling of the treatment code. In this paper, we compare several sample size recalculation procedures with and without unblinding. The simulation results indicate that the procedures behave similarly. In particular, <b>breaking</b> of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> is not required for an efficient sample size adjustment. We also compare these pure sample size adaptation procedures with study designs which additionally allow for early stopping. Evaluation of the cumulative distribution function of the resulting sample sizes shows that the option for early stopping may lead to lower expectation but generally to a higher variability. The procedures are illustrated by an example of a trial in the treatment of depression...|$|R

40|$|PosterInternational audienceObjective. Several {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} mobile phone signals (in the range of 900 to 2000 MHz) may induce DNA damage. For instance, DNA damage were found in human {{fibroblasts}} following continuous or intermittent exposure at 1. 2 to 2 W/kg SAR (Diem et al, 2005), and chromosomal damage in human lymphocytes at high SAR (more than 5 W/kg) following continuous exposure (Tice et al, 2002) whereas others researches concluded in the absence of genotoxic effects (Vijayalaxmi et al, 2000; Lagroye et al, 2004; Zeni et al, 2005). There is thus a need for further investigations in order to conclude about RF genotoxic effects. That is why we focused on potential genotoxic effect of GSM- 1800 and UMTS signals on nerve cells in vitro and rat brains in vivo. Methods. In vitro, the SH-SY 5 Y and CHME- 5 human nerve cell lines, which are neuroblastoma and microglial cells, respectively, were intermittently (5 min ON/ 10 min OFF) or continuously exposed to a 217 Hz modulated GSM- 1800 signal during 1 to 24 hours at the SAR 2 W/kg and assayed using the alkaline comet assay. The SXC 1800 exposure system was manufactured by ITIS (Zurich, Switzerland). It consists in two shorted waveguides allowing to run exposed and sham conditions {{at the same time in}} the same culture incubator at 37 Celsius degree 5 % CO 2. All experiments were performed under blind conditions. Under these conditions, 4 - 6 independent experiments were performed for each cellular type (minimum 2 Petri dishes by run). In vivo experiments were performed on Sprague-Dawley male rats. The exposure system consisted in a rocket inside which the animal was placed, the UMTS signal at 2000 MHz was applied to the rat heads by the mean of a loop antenna, at 0, 2, and 10 W/kg under acute conditions (2 hours). After the exposure, the animals were immediately sacrificed and the brain was prepared for the alkalin comet assay. Under these conditions, the different groups were constituted of 16 animals. Positive controls were performed using UVB or ethylmethylsulfonate (EMS) under in vitro and in vivo conditions, respectively. At the end of the exposures, cells were removed from their Petri dish by trypsin/EDTA treatment or were extracted from brain homogenate, counted and 5 x 104 cells were used to detect single DNA <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> genotoxic effects were detected using the alkaline comet assay kit (R&D system, Trevigen slides) following the supplier procedure.

40|$|Abstract. Antidepressants are {{supposed}} to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin in the brain. Indeed, their supposed effectiveness is the primary evidence for the chemical imbalance theory. But analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect. Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, {{due to the fact}} that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully <b>break</b> <b>blind.</b> <b>The</b> serotonin theory is as close as any theory in the history of science to having been proved wrong.

The main objective {{of this study is to}} test the hypothesis that the efficacy of antidepressants in panic disorder is mediated by the perception of adverse events. The present analysis is based on a systematic review of published and unpublished randomised trials comparing antidepressants with placebo for panic disorder. The Baron and Kenny approach was applied to investigate the mediational role of adverse events in the relationship between antidepressants treatment and efficacy. Fourteen placebo-controlled antidepressants trials were included in the analysis. We found that: (a) antidepressants treatment was significantly associated with better treatment response (ß = 0. 127, 95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 21, p = 0. 003); (b) antidepressants treatment was not associated with adverse events (ß = 0. 094, 95 % CI - 0. 05 to 0. 24, p = 0. 221); (c) adverse events were negatively associated with treatment response (ß = 0. 035, 95 % CI - 0. 06 to - 0. 05, p = 0. 022). Finally, after adjustment for adverse events, the relationship between antidepressants treatment and treatment response remained statistically significant (ß = 0. 122, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 23, p = 0. 039). These findings do not support the hypothesis that the perception of adverse events in placebo-controlled antidepressant clinical trials may lead to <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of <b>blind</b> and to an artificial inflation of the efficacy measures. Based on these results, we argue that the moderate therapeutic effect of antidepressants in individuals with panic disorder is not an artefact, therefore reflecting a genuine effect that doctors can expect to replicate under real-world conditions...|$|R
