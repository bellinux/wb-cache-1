40|$|Financial {{literature}} and financial industry use often zero coupon yield curves as input for testing hypotheses, pricing assets or managing risk. They assume this provided data as accurate. We analyse {{implications of the}} methodology and of the sample selection criteria used to estimate the zero coupon <b>bond</b> yield <b>term</b> structure <b>on</b> several financial purposes. As input we consider our own spot rates estimation from GovPX bond data and three popular interest rates data sets: from the Federal Reserve Board, from the US Department of the Treasury (H 15), and from Bloomberg. First, we obtain the volatility term structure using historical volatilities and Egarch volatilities. Second, we estimate correlation coefficients among forward rates. Third, we price a set of simple interest rate derivatives. We find strong evidence that the resulting zero coupon bond yield volatility estimates {{as well as the}} correlation coefficients among spot and forward rates depend significantly on the data set. We observe relevant differences in economic terms when volatilities are used to price derivatives. We also show the impacts of the yield curve choice for the results of classic term structure hypothesis tests...|$|R

The assets are Lucas trees; a collection of Lucas trees is a Lucas orchard. The dividend growth of each asset is i. i. d. over time. This framework allows for dividend growth correlations between assets and for jumps in dividends. The model replicates various features of the data. Assets with independent dividends ex-hibit comovement in returns. Jumps spread across assets. Assets with high price-dividend ratios have low risk premia. Small assets exhibit momentum. High yield spreads forecast high excess returns <b>on</b> long <b>term</b> <b>bonds</b> and <b>on</b> the market.

Perhaps surprisingly, financial deepening and falling home bias in industrialized countries explain {{a large share of}} external financing. The savings glut hypothesis (including difficult-to-track petrodollar recycling) and U. S. financial innovation are also important, in part as a cause of declining home bias in industrialized countries. The latter underscores the importance of not looking at these factors in isolation, but rather as a constellation of forces that can be self-reinforcing.

40|$|Based on {{individual}} expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we construct a realtime proxy for expected <b>term</b> premium changes <b>on</b> long-term bonds. We empirically investigate {{the relation of}} these <b>bond</b> <b>term</b> premium expectations with expectations about key macroeconomic variables as well as aggregate macroeconomic uncertainty {{at the level of}} individual forecasters. We find that expected term premia are (i) time-varying and reasonably persistent, (ii) strongly related to expectations about future output growth, and (iii) positively affected by uncertainty about future output growth and in ation rates. Expectations about real macroeconomic variables seem to matter more than expectations about nominal factors. Additional findings <b>on</b> <b>term</b> structure factors suggest that the level and slope factor capture information related to uncertainty about real and nominal macroeconomic prospects, and that curvature is related to subjective term premium expectations themselves. Finally, an aggregate measure of forecasters' term premium expectations has predictive power for bond excess returns over horizons of up to one year.
