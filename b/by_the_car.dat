The site is now {{occupied}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park of the Manchester Velodrome, with a plaque on a house wall on Bank Street indicating the presence of the former ground.

5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> as it went over the bridge.|$|E
5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

25|$|Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold {{hydrogen}} (20.3 K {{and slightly}} above) {{in order to}} reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.|$|E

25|$|Production {{of these}} engines {{originally}} {{took place at}} Rover's satellite factory (and ex-Bristol Hercules engine plant) at Acocks Green in Birmingham whilst vehicle assembly {{took place at the}} main Rover works at Solihull. After Land Rover was created as a distinct division with British Leyland in 1979 production of Rover cars at Solihull ceased in 1982. A new engine assembly line was built in the space vacated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> lines and engine production started at Solihull in 1983. The engine line at Solihull closed in 2007 when Land Rover began using Ford and Jaguar engines built at Dagenham (diesel engines) and Bridgend (petrol engines).|$|E
25|$|Six people, {{including}} the attacker, {{died as a}} result of the incident, and around 50 others were injured, some of them severely. Of the five people killed by the attacker, three were British nationals. Aysha Frade, a British teacher, believed to have been walking along the bridge to pick up her children from school, was struck by the attacker's car and killed. A tourist from the United States, Kurt Cochran, was also hit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and died. Cochran was visiting London from Utah to celebrate his 25th anniversary with his wife Melissa, who is among the injured. The police officer killed was PC Keith Palmer, 48, an unarmed police officer who was on duty with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection command. Palmer had 15 years of experience in the Metropolitan Police Service.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E

25|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was found}} at 22:50 by a volunteer group, who had walked along the estimated route of the aircraft. Five minutes later crew from Sylling Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps arrived at the site. At this time the operations centrals were alerted of the find and JRCC SN was alerted at 23:07. A helicopter was dispatched from Fornebu at 23:24 and landed at Solli at 23:41 {{to pick up a}} medical doctor. It continued to the crash site, guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> lights of the volunteer search crew. It picked up the badly wounded and used two trips to bring them to Solli, where they were sent by ambulance to hospital. Two more wounded were carried to ambulances which had driven to the site.

25|$|On lap 14, Morbidelli crashed, and Brundle crashed off {{shortly after}} {{at the same}} point whilst the marshalls were still dealing with Morbidelli's car. Although no-one was hit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> one marshall was hit by debris and {{suffered}} a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was just ahead on track but 6 seconds ahead on aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last {{to the end of the}} race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but got caught in traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds ahead on lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking wheel nut. This, coupled with Hill's heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.|$|E
