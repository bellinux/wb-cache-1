5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, failed to see the loss of direction. Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had to dig in near the Angle Point pillbox under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap, by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E

5|$|She {{arrived on}} 10 February and repairs began {{when she entered}} the Captain Cook Dock in the Garden Island Dockyard the next day, well before it was officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester, the Governor-General of Australia on 24 March. By this time the {{vibration}} problems with her centre propeller shaft, which had never been properly repaired after she was bombed at Malta, were so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> propeller was removed and the shaft locked in place, reducing her maximum speed to 24 knots. On 6 March she sailed to the BPF's advance base at Manus Island and, after her arrival a week later, Illustrious and her sisters Indomitable and Victorious, {{as well as the}} carrier Indefatigable, exercised together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there two days later, under the designation Task Force 57 (TF 57), to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg). The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, beginning on 26 March. Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs, 16 Avengers and two Supermarine Walrus flying boats for rescue work.|$|E

25|$|The 2001 {{event was}} hit by a heavy {{rainstorm}} {{in the middle of the}} race which made conditions very difficult. Conditions were so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello spun off almost simultaneously at the same corner. Remarkably, they both recovered to score a Ferrari 1–2, because for a long time they were nearly 5 seconds faster than anyone else on the field. Elsewhere, the race was even led by Jos Verstappen, surprisingly. However, as the track begun to dry, he fell back to seventh, but his efforts to keep positions were memorable.|$|E
25|$|Racist {{attitudes towards}} the Haitian {{people by the}} American {{occupation}} forces were blatant and widespread. Initially, there was intermingling of officers and the elites at social gatherings and clubs but when families of American forces began arriving, such gatherings were minimized. Relations degraded rapidly, however, upon departure of officers for World War I in Europe; this {{changed the nature of}} the relationship between the races the most. The Haitian elite found the American junior and non-commissioned officers to be ignorant and uneducated. There were numerous reports of remaining Marines drinking to excess, fighting and sexually assaulting women. The situation was so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Marine General John A. Lejeune based in Washington, D.C., banned the sale of alcohol to any military personnel.|$|E
25|$|Alerted to {{imminent}} danger, the British commander instantly {{ordered a}} retreat {{across the bridge}} at Arzobispo. For his part, Cuesta immediately led his army in retreat from Talavera to Oropesa, abandoning the British hospitals. With only about 40 wagons and carts available, 1,500 badly wounded men were left behind. The remainder were told {{to make their way}} as best they could. Eventually, 2,000 hobbled into the British lines. Another 500 either died en route or were captured by the French. The ones who were made prisoner by the French were well cared for. Cuesta could have crossed the Tagus at Talavera and retreated on the south bank. However, the roads on that side pass through the Sierra de Guadalupe and were so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spanish army would have had to abandon its artillery and wagon train. Instead, Cuesta took the risk of marching on the north bank, where the French were known to be at large.|$|E

2500|$|At the Baumettes {{prison and}} at [...] Gestapo {{headquarters}} in 425 Rue Paradis Marseille the Gestapo under agent Ernst Dunker tortured their three British captives by delivering very powerful electric shocks {{between the eyes}} {{and the results were}} so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> British were seen by French prisoners they were almost unrecognizable.|$|R
25|$|The 137th Brigade attack {{went wrong}} from the start; the smoke screen was so dense {{at first that}} men got lost and the advance was neither uniform nor simultaneous. After thirty minutes the smoke blew back and dispersed. The Germans were ready, mud around the British front line and in no man's land, slowed the advance; the Germans emerged from shelter when the British were only halfway across. The troops who got across found that the German wire was smashed about, uncut or had been repaired. The Germans were {{deployed}} nearly {{as soon as the}} British guns lifted and German barrage fire began on the British lines. The German shelling was so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> third wave was ordered up communication trenches instead of advancing in the open. Before the wave managed to leave the advanced trench, the German barrage began to fall on no man's land and increase in intensity. German machine-gun fire from The Z, a spur beyond the left flank of the attack was most effective, few of the rear British waves got across and parts of the first three waves either stayed in the British front line or sought cover in no man's land. The leading troops of the 1/6th South and the 1/6th North Staffordshire were caught by flanking fire from the south but got to the German wire and were shot down or killed with hand grenades. A few men broke into the front trench but unsupported, were forced out or destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Early in the force's history, {{the police}} lived in {{buildings}} that they termed [...] "forts", typically one-storey buildings {{constructed by the}} police themselves from logs, with sod roofs. In {{the first year of}} the force, the poorly constructed fort at Swan River drew particular condemnation from senior officers: Commissioner French complained to Ottawa about the [...] "exposure and hardship" [...] that the police detachment were enduring. Even once the force was properly established, living conditions remained very basic: the forts used wood- and coal-burning stoves for heating and cooking, and were lit by oil lamps and candles, while the constables slept on wooden boards using straw-filled mattresses. In the early 1880s, conditions grew so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> constables at Fort Macleod issued a manifesto to their officers demanding improvements to their living conditions.|$|E
500|$|The new Lexington Avenue route curved {{off of the}} old line at 41st Street and ran {{underneath}} {{private property}} to reach Lexington Avenue at 43rd Street with a new Grand Central station located in the diagonal segment. Since there was 400 feet between {{the eastern end of}} the original line's station and the new Lexington Avenue Line station, a new shuttle station was to be built near the Lexington Avenue Line station. The construction of the narrow island platform station required building two new trackways extending east under 42nd Street. The two-track layout was expected to provide ample capacity for the shuttle. On August 1, 1918, the Dual Contracts' [...] "H system" [...] was put into service, with through trains over the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, and only shuttle trains under 42nd Street. The station was not ready in time, and therefore wooden flooring was temporarily laid over sections of the trackways at Times Square and Grand Central. The shuttle was heavily used, and the crowding conditions were so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shuttle was ordered closed the next day by the Public Service Commission.|$|E

500|$|Merging the {{administrative}} machineries of each state and integrating them into one political and administrative entity was not easy, particularly {{as many of}} the merged states had a history of rivalry. In the former Central India Agency, whose princely states had initially been merged into a princely union called Vindhya Pradesh, the rivalry between two groups of states became so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government of India persuaded the rulers to sign a Merger Agreement abrogating the old Covenants of Merger, and took direct control of the state as a Chief Commissioner's State. As such, the mergers did not meet the expectations of the Government of India or the States Department. In December 1947, Menon suggested requiring the rulers of states to take [...] "practical steps towards the establishment of popular government". The States Department accepted his suggestion, and implemented it through a special covenant signed by the rajpramukhs of the merged princely unions, binding them to act as constitutional monarchs. This meant that their powers were de facto no {{different from those of the}} Governors of the former British provinces, thus giving the people of their territories the same measure of responsible government as the people of the rest of India.|$|E
500|$|In a war {{council on}} December 27, Washington learned {{that all of}} the British and Hessian forces had {{withdrawn}} as far north as Princeton, something Cadwalader had learned when his militia company crossed the river that morning. [...] In his letter Cadwalader proposed that the British could be driven entirely from the area, magnifying the victory. [...] After much debate, the council decided on action, and planned a third crossing for December 29. [...] On December 28 it snowed, but the weather cleared that night and it became bitter cold. [...] As this effort involved most of the army, eight crossing points were used. [...] At some of them the ice had frozen two to three inches (4 to 7cm) thick, and was capable of supporting soldiers, who crossed the ice on foot. [...] At other crossings the conditions were so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attempts were abandoned for the day. [...] It was New Years Eve before the army and all of its baggage was back in New Jersey. [...] This was somewhat fortunate, as the enlistment period of John Glover's regiment (along with a significant number of others) was expiring {{at the end of the}} year, and many of these men, including most of Glover's, wanted to go home, where a lucrative privateering trade awaited them. [...] Only by offering a bounty to be paid immediately from Congressional coffers in Philadelphia did a significant number of men agree to stay with the army another six weeks.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{downstream}} end of the Potteries was Trentham Hall, here pollution became so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> owner, the Duke of Sutherland, made a claim against the local Fenton council in 1902. He also took out an injunction against the council to prevent the ongoing contamination causing a [...] "most foul and offensive stench", the river not even being suitable to water grazing cattle on the estate.|$|E

The pirate translation was apparently so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> translator added messages, including [...] "Here comes something that I'm unable to translate, sorry," [...] and [...] "I'm sorry, I didn't understand what that meant" [...] in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.|$|E
2500|$|The depot, {{considered}} in 1872 as excellent at {{its time for}} utility and convenience, became extremely out of date in thirty years. The depot was noted as the [...] "Salamanca Windsplitter" [...] because of its position and as the [...] "Canvas Top Depot" [...] due to the leaky roof it contained. The corrugated steel roof had worn through and covered with an oiled canvas that was no improvement after it wore out. The roof was so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clerks had to protect their tickets with umbrellas and passengers looked for a new place to get shelter.|$|E
2500|$|Lashley {{has always}} been viewed as an {{objective}} scientist, but Nadine Weidman has tried to expose him as a racist and a genetic determinist. But Donald Dewsbury and others, have disputed the claim {{that he was a}} genetic determinist, citing research of Lashley's in which he found evidence of both genetic and environmental influences on organisms. Dewsbury does admit however, that Lashley was quite racist. He cites a line from a letter that Lashley wrote to a German colleague which reads: [...] "Too <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> beautiful tropical countries are all populated by negros. Heil Hitler and Apartheit!" [...] This line alone would leave little debate on this matter, but he cites others as well.|$|E
