5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis {{for the cause of}} this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike {{performed}} {{computer simulations}} {{of the structure}} of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani.

5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E

The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E

5|$|The Planet Nine {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the orbits of several detached objects can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gravitational influence of a large, unobserved planet between 200 AU and 1200 AU from the Sun and/or the influence of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes.

5|$|Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 181000km (2.54Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, though still small, are unusual for an inner satellite and can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like m:n).|$|E
40|$|This article {{applies the}} debate on the recent {{emergence}} of outsider candidates in Latin America to independent presidential candidate Marco Enríquez-Ominami (ME-O) in Chile in 2009. The authors test five competing hypotheses to explain his electoral success. First, his support <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> consolidation of democracy, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disposition of voters to disregard the authoritarian/democratic-aligned candidates. Second, his support <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decline of ideological identification, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disposition of voters to prefer nontraditional candidates. Third, his support <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> resurgence of <b>the</b> left, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disposition of voters to identify with anti-Washington Consensus candidates. Fourth, his support <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demand for quick government action, reflected in the predisposition of voters to consider candidates who will solve problems fast even if they do not ask voters for their opinions. Fifth, his support <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> declining support for established parties, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> predisposition of voters to favor antisystemic candidates. The authors use survey data to test these hypotheses. They find no evidence to support the claims that ME-O fits any of the explanations. Though he was widely referred to as an outsider, his success seems to respond to national affairs rather than to a regional pattern. " (author's abstract...|$|R

5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome.

Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the {{discovery}} of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae. The planet was discovered by measuring the star's radial velocity, which showed a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted-for by this planet, which could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gravitational influence of a more distant object.|$|E
