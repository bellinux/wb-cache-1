The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as gene ontology annotations or certain network topologies), have homologous interactions in other species.|$|E

25|$|There are {{few studies}} on the {{affordability}} of water and sewer bills in Latin America. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) analyzed multi-purpose household surveys conducted between 1995 and 1999 in 10 countries to assess the share of household income spent on water supply services. These data show that the expenditures on water vary between 0.4% of total expenditures in rural Panama to 3.0% in Kingston, Jamaica. For the households in the poorest income decile expenditures on water are higher, varying from 0.6% in rural Panama to 6.5% in Kingston, Jamaica. However, these figures have to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> <b>caution.</b> First, {{it is not clear}} how water expenditures were defined in the surveys. It seems that in some cases expenditures to buy bottled water and water from tankers were included, while in other cases they were excluded. Second, the sample includes both households with and without access to piped water systems. Therefore, especially in rural areas where coverage tends to be low, the shares are only a poor indication on the affordability of water bills. Third, it is not explicit if sewer bills are included in the analysis, although this is most likely the case, since sewer bills are always a surcharge on the water bill and are thus perceived by most households as part of their water expenditures.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established {{an association between}} air pollution and adult mortality. However, studies utilizing short-term fluctuations in pollution may detect mortality changes among the already ill or dying, while prospective cohort studies, which utilize geographic differences in long-run pollution levels, may suffer from severe omitted variables bias. This study utilizes the long-run reduction in total suspended particulates (TSPs) pollution induced by the Clean Air Act of 1970, which mandated aggressive regulation of local polluters in heavily polluted counties. We find that regulatory status is associated with large reductions in TSPs pollution but has little association with reductions in either adult or elderly mortality.

30|$|In {{the whole}} population, {{although}} {{a significant increase}} in ULC number was recorded after the dives, ULC number remained low. At the baseline examination, ULC number was lower than 5 in all volunteers. After the dives, few divers presented a ULC number greater than 5. According to the criteria chosen to define {{a significant increase in}} ULC number, only 8 divers out of 106 had ultrasonographic signs of increase in EVLW. This increase was recorded in 12 dives out of 263 investigated. Consequently, it can be concluded that an increase in EVLW rarely occurs after a well-controlled dive in healthy subjects. Given the infrequent occurrence of the increase in EVLW reported in our population of divers (104 men and only 2 women), our results should <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> <b>cautions.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{described}} how 25 subjects experienced time and mood during a waiting experience for relatives undergoing open heart surgery. Using the 40 Second Production Method to measure "time estimation", {{sixty percent of}} the total group "overestimated" waiting time. Significant differences found between groups were associated with education, gender and prior waiting experience in the setting. Using the Time Metaphor Test, 22 subjects perceived time passage as "static". No significant correlation was found between Time Metaphor scores and reading time. The mood for the group as a whole tended to be more negative as compared to normative samples. Subjects who perceived time as passing more swiftly, scored significantly higher on "confusion" and "fatigue", and lower on "vigor" compared to "static" subjects.

40|$|The {{stop signal}} task {{is used to}} {{investigate}} inhibition of an initiated response. Converging evidence suggests that right inferior prefrontal cortex is involved in this behavior, although other regions in the prefrontal cortex have also been implicated. One technique {{used to determine the}} contribution of specific cortical regions to behavior is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). In the present study, fourteen subjects performed the stop signal task before and after receiving a train of rTMS to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The effects of rTMS were determined using eventrelated potential (ERP) measures that have been associated with response inhibition in previous studies. Stimulation of left and right DLPFC did not affect ERP measures of response inhibition.

2500|$|The {{consensus}} in contemporary historical and political literature {{is that the}} results of the language census have to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> <b>caution.</b> The questions were alternatively on [...] "known" [...] languages or on the [...] "usual" [...] language, the most often spoken. Some considered this to refer to their mother tongue, while for others it referred to the prestigious and ubiquitous language that was French. Moreover, the censuses of 1920 and 1947 were performed in a post-war climate. Dutch, being closely related with German, was discredited due to collaborationism of certain wings of the Flemish Movement with the German occupation. French on the other hand enjoyed the status of the language of victory. Finally, given that the results had political consequences, inviting for manipulation in some cases, the census had more of a referendum on the language status of the municipality than of a sociological inquiry. In the 1947 census, more than 30% declared to speak French [...] "exclusively or most frequently" [...] in Wemmel, Kraainem, Drogenbos and Linkebeek, which meant that the French-speaking population of these municipalities received language facilities, whereby citizens can request to communicate with the municipal services in the language of their choice, while the official language remained the same.|$|E

Structured telephone interviews were conducted with 12 participants recruited from the region. Questions asked at baseline were reproduced from a triage tool developed in earlier research. Additional questions specific to pregnant women examined community characteristics, transportation, initial impact of pregnancy and transience.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of {{incentive}} pay on gender pay gaps in Finland, Norway and Sweden among professionals and managers within MNCs. Mercer 2009 Total Remuneration Survey data is utilised. Uniform job ladder, occupation, industry and wage definitions enable consistent cross-country comparisons. In addition to the between-country variation, the within-country variation of gender gap with respect to incentive pay is analysed. The results indicate that gender pay gaps differ among the Nordics and that occupation and industry controls have dissimilar effects across countries. Irrespective of wage element, Finland and Norway are characterised by higher gender gaps than Sweden. Incentives tend to accentuate gender pay gaps. In intention to alleviate the absence of job performance data, this study utilises a rudimentary, promotion-based measure for job performance. In Finland it does affect the gender gap. However, irrespective of gender, high-performers are penalised in Sweden but not in Finland or Norway. The Finnish data also allows the identification of low-performers. Low job performance is rewarded in Finland. Nonetheless, the job performance findings should <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>with</b> <b>cautions.</b> ...|$|R
