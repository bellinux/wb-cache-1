5|$|According to Allmusic the {{original}} track was 3:09, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> {{appeared on the}} 2006 compilation album Essential Nancy Sinatra, it was 3:11. The single was initially released through Reprise Records. In a non-exclusive licensing agreement, Reprise (part of Warner Music) gave RCA Records the rights to distribute the records {{of some of their}} artists including Sinatra and Dean Martin. In 1971, Sinatra and Reprise parted ways, so she signed a long-term contract with RCA Records.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Native (i.e., elemental) {{selenium}} {{is a rare}} mineral, {{which does}} not usually form good crystals, <b>but,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals.

5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage have shown that damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.|$|E
5|$|Transvaal and Kimberley {{remained}} the only sides {{to contest the}} Currie Cup in the following season, and in their 1891 match, Kimberley won by 58 runs in a timeless match. The tournament was not played in 1891–92, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> restarted the following year, a third team, Western Province joined, while Kimberley were renamed Griqualand West.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many {{high-end}} California Thoroughbred trainers, {{who usually}} are headquartered at Santa Anita Park, the Shermans kept horses at Hollywood Park, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> closed in December 2013, Los Alamitos Race Course {{picked up some}} of the Thoroughbred races and trainers who had stabled horses at Hollywood Park, including Sherman. The success of California Chrome, who was conditioned there over the track that had been recently expanded to accommodate longer races, created good publicity for Los Alamitos.|$|E

5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield {{returned}} to her NUGMW post.

She never {{returned to}} parliament; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely by war, she resigned her candidacy.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics.

Grant would be the Republican candidate, this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
5|$|C Squadron, {{leading a}} brigade group, {{advanced}} towards Gambut {{on the morning}} of 23 November. On the outskirts of Gambut, the line was stopped to allow the Matilda tanks to lead the column. C Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> became apparent that the Axis was retreating, they pursued until the New Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four Stuart tanks, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.|$|E
5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> came to light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E

Dwindling population forced {{the closure of the}} school in 1938, although the Church of St John the Evangelist is still in use. Most of the buildings were constructed from pine wood grown on the estate, but the three original concrete buildings remain: church, school and schoolhouse.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim was simply {{not going to work}} as a fighter. On several {{occasions}} the CH stations directed the fighters to a successful radar capture, only to have the target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|E
5|$|Michigan enjoyed high {{expectations}} {{from the national}} media as well during the preseason. Sporting News named them to the number 5 position in its preseason poll, while conference foes Indiana and Ohio State were ranked number 1 and 3, respectively. Michigan also earned the number 5 ranking in both the preseason Coaches' Poll and preseason Associated Press poll, but behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#4) in both. This was Michigan's highest preseason ranking since the 1992–93 team. Sports Illustrated ranked Michigan number 9 in its October preseason power rankings, again behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#6), <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> printed its November preseason poll listed Michigan at number 6 ahead of Ohio State (#7), but behind Indiana (#1). Prior to the first exhibition game on November 1, senior Josh Bartelstein was named team captain.|$|E

5|$|One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, {{was killed}} in the operation. Another twelve {{soldiers}} were injured, one seriously.

5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E
