5|$|A {{sequel to}} Adventure was first {{announced}} in early 1982. The planned sequel eventually {{evolved into the}} Swordquest series of games. In 2005, a sequel written by Curt Vendel was released by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 system. In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called Adventure II for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; its name is used with permission from Atari Interactive. Robinett himself took {{the idea of using}} items from Adventure into his next game, Rocky's Boots, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> the ability to combine them to form new items.|$|E
5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas <b>but</b> <b>added</b> the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{grew up in}} a Hindu and Jain {{religious}} {{atmosphere in}} his native Gujarat which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He, at age 57, declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism.|$|E

5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea {{was influenced by the}} Star Wars franchise, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|MEF {{commander}} Major General Richard Zilmer {{responded to}} press queries about {{the statement that}} Anbar Province was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces. He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear Strike is a helicopter-based game, with {{strategy}} elements {{added to}} the action gameplay. The plot concerns an elite special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine <b>but</b> <b>added</b> several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders' mentality {{to imitate}} the customs from their Western European homelands meant that {{there were very few}} {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade <b>but</b> <b>added</b> a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E
5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted buon fresco. Wherever they have not been painted buon fresco <b>but</b> <b>added</b> a secco, they have been removed by the restorers.|$|E
5|$|At first, Botaneiates lacked {{enough troops}} to oppose Bryennios, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had consolidated his control over his native Thrace, effectively isolating the capital from the remaining imperial territory in the Balkans. Botaneiates sent an embassy under the proedros Constantine Choirosphaktes, a veteran diplomat, to conduct negotiations with Bryennios. At {{the same time he}} appointed the young Alexios Komnenos as his Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), and sought aid from the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman, who sent 2,000 warriors and promised even more. In his message to Bryennios, the aged Botaneiates (76 years old at his accession) offered him the rank of Caesar and his nomination as heir to the throne. Bryennios agreed in principle, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> a few conditions of his own, and sent the ambassadors back to Constantinople for confirmation. Botaneiates, who likely had initiated negotiations only to gain time, rejected Bryennios's conditions, and ordered Alexios Komnenos to campaign against the rebel.|$|E

5|$|By 2011, Serbian diplomats {{made several}} {{requests}} to the EU, asking it to pressure Croatia {{to resolve the}} dispute before Croatia's accession to the union {{out of fear that}} it might follow the Slovene example and stall Serbian accession similar to the impasse between Croatia and Slovenia over their border disputes and the subsequent blockade of the Croatian EU accession negotiation process. The request was denied by the EU. Croatian President Ivo Josipović said that the dispute was the most contentious issue of Croatia–Serbia relations <b>but</b> <b>added</b> that it should not be difficult to resolve. In 2012, Josipović stated that Croatia should not block Serbia's EU accession over the issue and suggested that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, which is considered to be an acceptable solution by both countries. In 2014, the Croatian ambassador to Serbia reiterated Josipović's stance from 2012. On the other hand, Zoran Milanović, the Prime Minister of Croatia, said that the resolution of the border dispute would be Croatia's condition placed before Serbia in its EU accession negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E
5|$|Famous {{painters}} included Ni Zan and Dong Qichang, {{as well as}} the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying. They drew {{upon the}} techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8kg (100oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, while Miller and Colmesnil {{were busy}} with their {{entry in the}} {{competition}} to redesign San Francisco City Hall {{as well as with}} the design of many new hotels, apartments and private homes, Timothy L. Pflueger was given the opportunity to serve as chief architect on a rural church project funded by The Family, a club to which Miller belonged. Pflueger designed Our Lady of the Wayside Church with a main theme of Spanish Mission Revival based on his childhood familiarity with Mission San Francisco de Asís (locally known as Mission Dolores) <b>but</b> <b>added</b> his own personal statement: a striking Georgian main entrance topped by a scrolled pediment. After working with sub-contractor members of The Family on the project, Pflueger joined the club himself. The rural church was declared California Historical Landmark number 909 in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Tecmo began {{releasing}} low-priced episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for AT and Verizon {{mobile phones}} on both BREW and Java platforms. The official English Tecmo Games mobile website advertised {{it for a}} future release along with a mobile version of Tecmo Bowl. They planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 {{in a series of}} four installments – similar to what Upstart Games did when they ported the NES version of Castlevania to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack found on the NES version, and each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled Ninja Gaiden EpisodeI: Destiny, was released on , and it included only the first Act from the NES version <b>but</b> <b>added</b> two new levels. The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by GameSpot in September 2004, but it – along with the third and fourth installments – was never released.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Weksler {{and colleagues}} {{followed}} the 2001 definition by Sánchez {{and others for}} the restricted genus Oryzomys, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> O.antillarum from Jamaica as a species. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed Oryzomys from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of Oryzomys. They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus O.albiventer and O.peninsulae. Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the subfossil Oryzomys curasoae from Curaçao as an island population of O.gorgasi. The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 genes to assess relationships within Oryzomys. They recommended that the marsh rice rat be split into two species and that O.couesi be split into four species {{on the basis of}} the observed sequence divergence and other data.|$|E

5|$|In a {{fifth and}} final case, (not {{present in the}} {{original}} Game Boy Advance release, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> for the DS and subsequent releases) Phoenix, now running Fey's firm as Wright and Co., is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, {{the head of the}} prosecutor's office, in a case where the body of a detective, Bruce Goodman, was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E
5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until the November election, <b>but</b> <b>added</b> that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor {{condition}} it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal {{to raise money}} for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George Bernard Shaw contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, the Arts and Crafts movement master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work left in place and strengthened earlier structures where possible <b>but</b> <b>added</b> new aspects including a stone buttress and a kitchen range.|$|E
