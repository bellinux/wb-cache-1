40|$|The <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> {{properties}} of non-geostrophic atmospheric flow in a channel are investigated. The model is formulated {{so as to}} include the effects of latitudinal variations of the perturbations and the basic state parameters, which constitute an essential aspect of the non-geostrophic <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> problem. Spectral and finite-difference techniques are applied to obtain numerical solutions {{and the results are}} found in agreement. In order to allow for high horizontal resolution the present calculations are restricted to a particular two-layer model which appears to incorporate the major non-geostrophic aspects of the baroclinic instability problem. A purely non-geostrophic type of baroclinic instability is found which bears some resemblance to barotropic instability in spite of the absence of latitudinal shear in the zonal flow. This instability is introduced by the twisting term in the vorticity equation and the non-geostrophic advection of temperature in the thermodynamic equation. For low Richardson numbers and short cyclonic waves this instability at-tains the same order of magnitude as the quasi-geostrophic baroclinic instability. Th...|$|E
40|$|Along-stream {{variations}} in {{the dynamics of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) impact heat and tracer transport, regulate interbasin exchange, and influence closure of the overturning circulation. Topography is primarily responsible for generating deviations from zonal-mean properties, mainly through standing meanders associated with regions of high eddy kinetic energy. Here, an idealized channel model is used to explore the spatial distribution of energy exchange and its relationship to eddy geometry, as characterized by both eddy momentum and eddy buoyancy fluxes. Variations in energy exchange properties occur not only between standing meander and quasi-zonal jet regions, but throughout the meander itself. Both barotropic and <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> properties, as well as the magnitude of energy exchange terms, undergo abrupt changes along the path of the ACC. These transitions are captured by diagnosing eddy fluxes of energy and by adopting the eddy geometry framework. The latter, typically applied to barotropic stability properties, is applied here in the depth–along-stream plane to include information about both barotropic and <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> properties of the flow. These simulations reveal that eddy momentum fluxes, and thus barotropic instability, play {{a leading role in the}} energy budget within a standing meander. This result suggests that baroclinic instability alone cannot capture the dynamics of ACC standing meanders, a challenge for models where eddy fluxes are parameterized...|$|E

All of the modes, stable and unstable, belonging to this problem are identified. It is found that an unstable mode exists for only a certain range of values of the Burger number. The value of the Burger number at the upper limit of this range increases as the Ekman number decreases. Beyond this upper limit only a damped mode exists. It is also found that this transition in parameter space from the unstable to the stable mode occurs in a discontinuous manner...|$|E
40|$|A two-level, quasi-geostrophic, {{mid-latitude}} A-plane {{model with}} surface friction {{is used to}} examine the heat transport and energetics of winter stationary waves, which are forced by realistic topographic and diabatic heating fields. It is found that the heat transport of stt. ionary waves and its efficiency are underestimated. The energetics show that the surface conversion terms due to topography and friction are overestimated considerably, due to inadequate resolution of surface phenomena. The results suggest stationary forcing alone is not sufficient to account for the observed efficient heat transport of stationary waves. As a first step towards determining the effects of a basic state wave on the <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> problem, the stability of the baroclinic Rossby wave in a zonal shear flow is examined. Linearized theory is used with an adiabatic and frictionless version of the earlier model. Th...|$|E

Temperatures are lower on the inner than on the outer sphere, and decrease towards the pole. Using Navier-Stokes equations which assume symmetry about the polar axis, finite difference numerical models yield steady-state solutions to the equations. Hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic solutions are compared for cylindrical and spherical cases, and it {{is found in the}} case of the spherical shell that the differences between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic solutions are small and largely confined to the regions near the pole and equator.

40|$|The quasi-geostrophic, <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> {{problem is}} solved for an {{arbitrary}} zonal wind profile U = U(p) {{and for an}} adiabatic lapse rate. It is shown that the phase spced of the waves in this case depends on the vertical integrals of U and U 2. Duc to the assumption of an adiabatic stratification there is no short wave cutoff, but the effect of thc variation of the Coriolis parameter will in all cases give stability for sufficiently long waves. A numbcr of numerical examples show that the region of instability, in a coordinate system with wavelength as abscissa and wind shear as ordinate, is the largest when thc wind maximum is situated in {{the upper part of}} the atmosphere, and when the curvature of the zonal wind profile at the wind maximum has an intermediate value. 1...|$|E
40|$|A three-dimensional, spherical, {{primitive}} equation eigenvalue model {{is used to}} investigate the <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> properties {{of the wind and}} temperature fields in the Venus atmosphere as measured by Pioneer Venus. It is found that baroclinic instability occurs in the region of the middle cloud deck. The most unstable modes have growth times less than eight days and are vertically confined to the region near the middle cloud layer. The most unstable baroclinic mode at zonal wavenumber 2 has characteristics similar to those observed for the high latitude rotating dipole thermal feature. Certain planetary scale baroclinic modes can penetrate to relatively high altitudes under the right circumstances, and may therefore explain some of the wave features observed between 60 and 90 km. For example, thermal oscillations with periods between four and seven days occurring at middle latitudes have characteristics which appear to be consistent with computed properties of planetary scale baroclinic modes...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{maintenance}} of the quasistationary waves forced by topography using a truncated two-level quasigeostrophic spectral model in a zonal channel on a beta-plane is presented. The model's motion contains wavenumbers 0, n, and 2 n in the zonal direction, where n is the lowest eddy wavenumber and also the wavenumber of the topography. The study covered the two cases defined by n= 2 and n= 3; the spectral mode was integrated by initially perturbing the stationary solution of the equations governing the spectral coefficients, and a detailed energetics study was made of the quasiequilibrium state to study {{the maintenance of the}} quasistationary waves. The energy conversions required for maintaining these waves when n= 3 imply that they are generated mainly by <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> of the forced waves; this type of baroclinic wave tends to become stationary to draw efficiently on the available energy of the forced wave...|$|E
40|$|A <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> {{analysis}} is performed {{for a simple}} family of zonal shear profiles over a sphere, using a two-layer, quasi-geostrophic model. The stability properties {{and the structure of}} the most unstable waves are qualitatively similar to those on a beta-plane. However, the spherical geometry {{plays a major role in}} locating some of the important features of the most unstable waves. In particular, the locations of the maximum wave amplitude, maximum eddy heat fluxes, and maximum convergence of the eddy angular momentum flux are all well correlated with the location of the maximum excess of the vertical shear over the minimum value necessary for local instability on a sphere. Consequently the eddy momentum flux tends to generate a mid-latitude jet even if there is no preexisting mid-latitude jet in the basic state zonal flow. These findings suggest some of the elements needed for parameterizing the meridional variations of baroclinic eddy fluxes accurately...|$|E
40|$|The two-layer model <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> parameter, meridional surface {{temperature}} gradients, and monthly mean meridional stationary, transient and total eddy heat transports, computed as functions of latitude and long-itude for three individual Januaries, are described and discussed. Corre-lation analyses for all possible combinations are computed, and relation-ships between these quantities are discussed. The {{results indicate that}} no direct relationship exists between stationary eddy heat transports and baroclinically unstable conditions. However, a direct relationship is found between transient eddy heat tra [...] ports and baroclinically unstable conditions. For example, {{the correlation between the}} transient eddy flux and the two-layer instability parameter is. 52, which is statistically sig-nificant at the 99 % confidence level. However, the strength of the corre-lation suggests that the degree of baroclinic instability only accounts for some of the variation in the transient eddy heat transport.

40|$|National Meteorological Center {{data from}} {{midlatitudes}} for three Januaries {{is used in}} calculating time series of the zonal mean meridional eddy heat flux and the zonal mean <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability,</b> {{as measured by the}} difference between the zonal wind shear and the critical value of the shear in two-level models. Time-lagged correlations between the two series reveal a highly significant negative correlation for short time lags, peaking at approximately - 0. 4 when the stability parameter lags one half day behind the eddy flux. They also reveal that strongly unstable conditions are not followed by significant increases in the eddy flux. These results are seen as indicating that the synoptic variations of the zonal mean eddy flux are not closely related to the degree of baroclinic instability of the zonal mean flow. The autocorrelation of the eddy flux is then compared with those expected for autoregressive processes. A Bayesian information criterion suggests that the behavior is represented best by a damped oscillation, with a damping time of 0. 8 day and a period of five days...|$|E
40|$|The <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> {{characteristics}} of axisymmetric gravity currents in a rotating {{system with a}} sloping bottom are determined. Laboratory {{studies have shown that}} a relatively dense fluid released under an ambient fluid in a rotating system will quickly respond to Coriolis eects and settle to a state of geostrophic balance. Here we employ a subinertial two-layer model derived from the shallow-water equations to study the stability {{characteristics of}} such a current after the stage at which geostrophy is attained. In the model, the dynamics of the lower layer are geostrophic to leading order, but not quasi-geostrophic, since the height deflections of that layer are not small with respect to its scale height. The upper-layer dynamics are quasi-geostrophic, with the Eulerian velocity eld principally driven by baroclinic stretching and a background topographic vorticity gradient. Necessary conditions for instability, a semicircle-like theorem for unstable modes, bounds on the growth rate and phase velocity, and a sucient condition for the existence of a high-wavenumber cuto are presented.

40|$|Three new {{results of}} the Pioneer 10 and 11 mission are discussed. The first is that {{effective}} temperature is the same at the poles and equator {{in spite of the}} large differences in solar energy deposition. This is consistent with theories of convection which suggest that an extremely small equator-to-pole temperature difference at the level of infrared emission could suppress the internal heat flux at the equator relative to the pole by an amount sufficient to balance the difference in solar energy deposition. The second result is that the effective temperature of belts is 3 to 4 K greater than that of zones, which is almost exactly accounted for by the lower albedo of belts. This result cannot be interpreted uniquely, but is consistent with a model in which the internal heat flux is the same under belts and zones, and the horizontal atmospheric heat flux is zero. The third observation provides evidence of instability along the south edges of zones in the northern hemisphere. These are the latitudes of minimum prograde velocity, where instability is most likely to occur in a barotropic fluid, as pointed out by Ingersoll and Cuzzi (1969). A more realistic <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> analysis suggests instability at these same latitudes...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{progress}} was made in developing a six-component dry model of mid-latitude baroclinic wave evolution, and a ten-component moist model. These models include representations of airflow over mountians and non-adiabatic processes. As a first step, the properties of a reduced, three component, baroclinic system are studied. The classical <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> criteria emerge as the properties {{of one of the}} three equilibria admitted, with the remaining two equilibria forming the attractor region for the observed weather activity. Passive tracer evolution in a baroclinic wave was studied. A model in which only constituents trapped within low atmospheric levels are considered, has been extended to include the possibility for fluxes into the upper levels of the atmosphere. The reported results for the lower levels achieved previously are shown to be qualitatively similar to those obtained by these new calculations in which the vertical flux constraint is removed. An extensive study of an 8 -year record of global outgoing longwave radiation for the Northern Hemisphere reveals that blocking events exhibit only a weak signature of blocking highs, as measured by relatively low values of the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value of the observed long wave outgoing radiation. Though present in many cases, the signature is not a strongly distinctive feature of the blocking episodes...|$|E
40|$|As {{pointed out}} by Farrell, a normalmode {{analysis}} alone may be not enough for a convicing investigation of <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability.</b> In some models growth rates can be achieved large enough to enable nonlinear growth also in parameter ranges of neutral normalmodes. According to Farrell one has also to consider that structures, which achieve optimal growth for a given, fixed time interval (i. e. the singular vectors). Fischer (1998) investigated this problem for the classical Eady-model with q' = 0 - a case {{which can be treated}} analytically. In this paper we want to give a short overview of an investigation of singular vectors in Eady-models with β ≠ 0 and q' = 0. Our aim was to understand the influence of β ≠ 0 on optimal growth. Qualitative differences to Fischer’s results are only found at small wavenumbers below the longwave cutoff. The most remarkable difference beyond the longwave cutoff is the fact, that the singular vectors of the model with β ≠ 0 grow faster in the upper half of the fluid than in the lower half for the considered basic flows. The growth rates for parameter ranges of neutral normalmodes are too small to enable nonlinear growth effects in meteorologically relevant times. For long timescales we find, that the cutoffs must be understood more as a smooth transition to instability...|$|E
40|$|The <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> of Jupiter's {{zonal flow}} is {{investigated}} using a model {{consisting of two}} continuously stratified fluid layers. The upper layer, containing a zonal shear flow and representing the Jovian cloudy regions above p ∼ 5 bars, {{is the same as}} Eady's (1949) model for the Earth. The lower layer has a relatively large but finite depth with a quiescent basic state, representing the deep Jovian fluid bulk below p ∼ 5 bars. Due to the presence of the lower layer, the linearized non-dimensional growth rates are drastically reduced from the O(1) growth rates of the original Early model. Only very long wavelengths relative to the upper fluid's radius of deformation L_ 1 are unstable. Eddy transports of heat are also reduced relative to estimates based on scaling arguments alone. Since the hydrostatic approximation for the lower-layer perturbation breaks down at great depths, a second model is presented in which energy propagates downward in an infinitely deep lower fluid obeying the full linearized fluid equations. In this model, the growth rates are again very small, but now all wavelengths are unstable with maximum growth rates occurring for wavelengths O(1) relative to L_ 1. These results illustrate the importance for the upper-layer meteorology of the interface boundary condition with the lower fluid, which is radically different from the rigid lower boundary of the Earth's troposphere...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{transport}} of horizontal momentum due to baroclinic instabilities is investigated in a rotating stratified fluid. The experiments {{were carried out}} in the large rotating tank of the Coriolis-LEGI laboratory in Grenoble with flat bottom and linear density stratification. The mean flow was generated by increasing (spin up) or decreasing (spin down) the rotation rate of the platform. The velocity fields were measured by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technique. The dimensionless parameters that are important in determining the observed response are the Burger number and the Rossby number. Our experimental study reveals two very different behaviors. For O(1) Burger numbers, the bulk of the flow remains axisymmetric with a very slow decay. We have checked that the decay is well described by the usual vertical diffusion law, except in a region near the boundaries. The mismatch pertains to the presence of Ekman pumping/suction, but this mechanism is confined by stratification to a relatively shallow layer. For Burger numbers ≪ O(1), baroclinic instabilities are observed. The increased vertical momentum transport leads to a much faster spin than the previous case. Neither the diffusion nor the Ekman pumping/suction can be considered responsible for this enhanced {{transport of}} momentum and we interpret it as the effect of baroclinic instabilities. Eady’s theory is used to analyse the quasi-geostrophic <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> problem and a model is proposed to estimate the azimuthal velocity decay.

40|$|A hybrid coupled ocean-atmosphere {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} {{the stability of the}} thermohaline circulation (THC) to an increase in the surface freshwater forcing in the presence of interactive meridional transports in the atmosphere. The ocean component is the idealized global general circulation model used in Part I. The atmospheric model assumes fixed latitudinal structure of the heat and moisture transports, and the amplitudes are calculated separately for each hemisphere from the large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) and SST gradient, using parameterizations based on <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> theory. The ocean-atmosphere heat and freshwater exchanges are calculated as residuals of the steady-state atmospheric budgets. Owing to the ocean component's weak heat transport, the model has too strong a meridional SST gradient when driven with observed atmospheric meridional transports, When the latter are made interactive, the conveyor belt circulation collapses. A Bur adjustment is introduced in which the efficiency of the atmospheric transports is lowered to match the too low efficiency of the ocean component. The feedbacks between the THC and both the atmospheric heat and moisture transports are positive, whether atmospheric transports are interactive in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere, or both. However, the feedbacks operate differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, because the Pacific THC dominates in the Southern Hemisphere, and deep water formation in the two hemispheres is negatively correlated. The feedbacks in the two hemispheres do nor necessarily reinforce each other because they have opposite effects on low-latitude temperatures. The model is qualitatively similar in stability to one with conventional "additive" flux adjustment, but quantitatively more stable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a model of}} the general circulation of the earth’s atmosphere which has been developed and experimented with, since 1964, at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colo. A distinguishing feature of the NCAR model is that the vertical coordinate is height rather than pressure, though hydrostatic equilibrium is maintained in the system. In fact, the dynamical framework of the model is very similar to the one proposed by L. F. Richardson in 1922. Various physical processes in the atmosphere, such as energy transfer due to solar and terrestrial radiation, small-scale turbulence and convection, etc., are incorporated in the model. An explicit prediction of the moisture field is avoided. Instead, it is assumed that the atmosphere is completely saturated by water vapor. Thus, the release of latent heat of condensation can be computed. In addition to a description of the model, the equations for the zonal mean and eddy energy are presented. Finally, a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> analysis of the model is made in order to gain an insight into the finite-difference formulation of the present model. Long term (over 100 days) numerical integrations are being performed successfully with a two-layer version of the present model. Details of finite-difference schemes and the results of numerical calculations will be described in a separate article. “Perhaps some day in the dim future {{it will be possible to}} advance the computations faster than the weather advances and at a cost less than the saving to mankind due to the information gained.

40|$|The moist {{convection}} parameterization {{used in the}} GISS 3 -D GCM {{is adapted}} {{for use in a}} two-dimensional (2 -D) zonally averaged statistical-dynamical model. Experiments with different versions of the parameterization show that its impact on the general circulation in the 2 -D model does not parallel its impact in the 3 -D model unless the effect of zonal variations is parameterized in the moist convection calculations. A parameterization of the variations in moist static energy is introduced in which the temperature variations are calculated from <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> theory, and the relative humidity is assumed to be constant. Inclusion of the zonal variations of moist static energy in the 2 -D moist convection parameterization allows just a fraction of a latitude circle to be unstable and enhances the amount of deep convection. This leads to a 2 -D simulation of the general circulation very similar to that in the 3 -D model. The experiments show that the general circulation is sensitive to the parameterized amount of deep convection in the subsident branch of the Hadley cell. The more there is, the weaker are the Hadley cell circulations and the westerly jets. The experiments also confirm the effects of momentum mixing associated with moist convection found by earlier investigators and, in addition, show that the momentum mixing weakens the Ferrel cell. An experiment in which the moist convection was removed while the hydrological cycle was retained and the eddy forcing was held fixed shows that moist convection by itself stabilizes the tropics, reduces the Hadley circulation, and reduces the maximum speeds in the westerly jets...|$|E

The linear stability equations are solved exactly for the case where the gravity current initially corresponds to an annulus flow with parabolic height profile with two incroppings, i. e. a coupled front. The dispersion relation for such a current is solved numerically, and the characteristics of the unstable modes are described. A distinguishing feature of the spatial structure of the perturbations is that the perturbations to the downslope incropping are preferentially amplified compared to the upslope incropping. Predictions of the model are compared with recent laboratory data, and good agreement is seen in the parameter regime for which the model is valid. Direct numerical simulations of the full model are employed to investigate the nonlinear regime. In the initial stage, the numerical simulations agree closely with the linear stability characteristics. As the instability develops into the finite-amplitude regime, the perturbations to the downslope incropping continue to preferentially amplify and eventually evolve into downslope propagating plumes.

The barotropic and <b>baroclinic</b> <b>stability</b> of Jupiter's zonal jets is investigated using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model.

Since Jupiter's vertical structure associated with the zonal jets is unknown at these levels, this model attempts to include the effects of baroclinicity and deep lower layer inertia with as few free vertical-structure parameters as possible (i. e., the upper layer Rossby radius of deformation Lr and {{the ratio of the}} upper layer to lower layer thickness [ [...] . ]). Given that [ [...] . ] << 1 for Jupiter, the linearized dynamical equations can be expanded in powers of [ [...] . ] and also of [ [...] . ]. These expansions naturally categorize the possible disturbances into three types; barotropic (BTU) modes, almost entirely confined to the upper layer with potentially 0 (1) growth rates; baroclinic (BC) modes, which depend on interactions between the two layers and can only have 0 ([ [...] . ]) growth rates; and barotropic (BTL) modes of the lower fluid with 0 ([ [...] . ]) growth rates. Some results for the BC modes are presented and compared to results of a continuously stratified model developed in the appendix, but mostly the faster growing BTU modes are investigated for two analytically tractable velocity profiles [sech 2 (y) and tanh (y), following Lipps (e. g., J.
