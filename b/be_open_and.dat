5|$|Jacobs are {{typically}} hardy, low-maintenance animals with a naturally high resistance to parasites and hoof problems. Jacobs {{do not show}} much flocking behaviour. They can be skittish if not used to people, although with daily handling they will become tame and make good pets. They require shelter from extreme temperatures, but the shelter can <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> simple. They tend to thrive in extremes of heat and cold and have good or excellent foraging capabilities. They can secure adequate nutrition with minimal to no supplementation, even {{in the presence of}} suboptimal soil conditions.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E

500|$|Another main {{theme is}} {{regarding}} the [...] "yōkais choice". As {{agents of the}} city, the two karas represent different paths {{for the good of}} the city. The yōkai have to make a choice to support one of them. By following Eko, the humans are enslaved, and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them. By standing behind Otoha, the yōkai accept their lot and continue trying to live with the humans. Using the yōkai-human relationship as an analogy for human-human interaction, the team suggested people should <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> make the move, instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results. Ibira applied this to decision making, saying when faced with difficult choices, one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them.|$|E

When a colleague is stuck in an elevator with his feet dangling out of the doors, Ling asks, [...] "Does this mean I'm {{going to have to}} take the stairs?" [...] She is impatient in getting what she wants, for example snapping at a judge to [...] "hurry up" [...] as he read a verdict. [...] She frequently announces that she is uninterested in proceedings that don't affect her personally. As her co-counsel questions a witness in court, Ling objects to the judge, [...] "I'm bored! As an officer of the court, I have a duty to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> forthright. I think the witness is tedious and I'm concerned for the jury's attention span." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{stresses}} that coaches are essentially supposed to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> communicative {{with the players}} and management, who in turn will reciprocate the same attitude. By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's [...] "valuable {{when it comes to}} figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, just like I want to fight for him." [...] Fullback Tony Richardson, in an interview, stated Ryan [...] "loves his football team, loves his players" [...] and does as much as he possibly can to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to [...] " [...] it on himself" [...] so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process is an important one, {{particularly when it comes to}} providing a player information and building chemistry. However, there has to be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise [...] "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keller {{states that}} this new {{perspective}} on long poem and reexamination of forgotten long poems has revived the form as a realm of possibilities for upcoming female writers. Female writers are seeing the long poem as a genre that should not only <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> inclusive to them, {{but also as a}} genre that theoretically could benefit the female writer as much if not more than the male writers the form previously favored. Women writers are now able to combat the [...] "dominant traditions" [...] at play within the long poem genre to mold the genre into their own, creating what critic Susan Friedman terms a [...] "re-vision" [...] of the form.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Michael M. Crow {{became the}} university's 16th president.

Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into [...] "One university in many places"—a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its West and Polytechnic campuses. ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} No Man's Skys promotional aspects has {{affected}} other space simulation and open world games {{that are based}} on the premise of providing a vast ranging sandbox for players, as players have become wary of the broad claims that these games might make. Novaquark, the developers of the upcoming open-world Dual Universe, found themselves struggling to complete their Kickstarter funding in the months immediately after No Man's Skys release, but have recognised the need to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> transparent to potential funders on what the game will and will not have. Fenix Fire, the developers of the space exploration game , used the various question-and-answers that Sean Murray had to handle during the pre-release period as to gauge what players were looking for in such games and guide development of their own game. According to a report from Kotaku, BioWare had envisioned that [...] would use procedural generation for creating a universe to explore prior to No Man's Skys announcement, and further pushed for this following the excitement for No Man's Sky once it was announced, but could not get the procedural generation to work well with the Frostbite 3 game engine, and had to scrap these plans by 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{controversy}} {{soon came}} to a head when, in late January 2003, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, Charles Lewis, published a leaked draft copy of an Administration proposal titled the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003. The document was quickly dubbed [...] "PATRIOT II" [...] or [...] "Son of PATRIOT" [...] by the media and organisations such as the EFF. The draft, which was circulated to 10 divisions of the Department of Justice, proposed to make further modifications to extend the USA PATRIOT Act and would have made more changes to FISA, including extending the definition of a foreign power in relation to FISA and allowed the use of wiretaps 15 days after Congress authorized {{the use of military force}} (currently, the law allows this only after a declaration of war). Further, it would have allowed Federal agencies to acquire foreign government's spoken communications and would have expanded the use of pen registers under FISA to apply to U.S. citizens. It proposed that the FISA Court of Review be allowed to employ a lawyer with security clearance to defend the judgement of the FISC, and would have expanded the use of law enforcement investigative tools under FISA. Further gags were proposed in the draft and, had it been introduced into Congress, it would have prevented the disclosure of terrorism investigation detainee information, [...] "Worst Case Scenario" [...] information and information relating to Capitol buildings. The draft contained measures to further restrict what participants in Grand Jury terrorism hearings could disclose, while other proposed measures would have enhanced investigations into terrorism, including the establishment of a terrorism identification database. Changes were proposed to define terrorism as a crime and the legal framework with which to prosecute such crimes. Further modifications would have also changed immigration and border-security laws. Though the Department of Justice released a statement that it was only a draft, it caused an enormous amount of controversy, with many criticising it for impinging on privacy and civil liberties. In particular, Patrick Leahy complained that [...] "If there is going to be a sequel to the USA PATRIOT Act, the process of writing it should <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> accountable. It should not be shrouded in secrecy, steeped in unilateralism or tinged with partisanship. The early signals from the Administration about its intentions for this bill are ominous, and I hope Justice Department officials will change the way they are handling this." ...|$|E
