The blood sample is added and the tube is incubated at 37 °C for several minutes, to ensure that the allergens can bind to the IgE. By adding EDTA to the test tube, the degranulation process is stopped immediately. After degranulation a CD63 marker (labeld antibodies) is added to the test tube. Several minutes at room temperature gives the marker time to bind to the CD63 proteins on the cell membrane of the basophil. A lysing step is performed to lyse the red blood cells. Because they outnumber by far the leucocytes they need to be removed to do a FACS analysis of the Basophils.|$|E

40|$|THE {{periodic}} acid-Schiff (PAS) {{reaction in}} <b>basophiles</b> of the anterior pituitary {{is thought to}} indicate the presence of thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) since these are glycoproteins. This contention has been supported by histochemical solubility studies [2], by cellular fractionation studies [5], and by cytologic changes in <b>basophiles</b> in various functional states [4, 11, 121. Specific cellular localization similar to that accomplished for prolactin [3], growth hormone [6], and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) [7, IO], is lacking, however. The rationale for the present study, the immunofluorescent localization of LH, was suggested by the reported immunologic cross reaction between LH and HCG [Q, 131. We had previously localized HCG to syncytiotrophoblastic cells [7] with an antiserum demonstrated to be specific for HCG and capable of neutralizing its biological activity [81.

40|$|Abstract. This {{section of}} our review article deals with prevalence, genetic factors, and some immune {{mechanisms}} of chronic urticaria in children. In {{any form of}} chronic urticaria, the main pathogenetic role is ascribed to mast cells and <b>basophiles.</b> Increased production of cyto- and chemokines, e. g., CCL 2, CХCL 8, IL- 1, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 13, IL- 17, is observed during chronic inflammatory reactions typical to this disease. Activation of mast cells and <b>basophiles</b> proceeds via specific receptors on the target cell membranes. Autoimmune urticaria is of special importance. In this disorder, autoantibodies are directed against IgE or FCεRIα, thus causing histamine release, due to cross-linking of α-chains of high-affinity IgE receptor, or binding of IgE fixed on the mast cells. Degranulation of basophils is followed by occurrence of activation molecules (СD 203 с, CD 63). Some workers presumet that association between СD 203 с expression and positive autologous serum skin test {{may be a sign}} of autoimmune process. Increased expression of CD 40 L ligand on the surface of activated T cells suggests enhanced signaling for B cell activation and production of autoantibodies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Discrete bodies {{which may}} be {{designated}} cytochondria occupy {{the greater part of}} the cytoplasm of liver cells. A part, but not all, of these bodies have the characteristics of mitochondria. They consist of a rim which stains deeply and a central part which stains faintly or remains unstained. In liver cells about portal spaces, in foci of regeneration, and in tumor cells the rims of the cytochondria stain with basic dyes and contain ribonucleic acid or related substances. With increasing accumulation of <b>basophile</b> substances about cytochondria as the central veins are approached, these bodies aggregate to form clumps or orient themselves with palisade-like arrangment in two rows just within the margins of the liver cell columns. With aggregation of the cytochondria that are surrounded by <b>basophile</b> material, other cytochondria in the same cells are devoid of this material and wholly acidophile. With chromatolysis (disappearance of <b>basophile</b> substance) caused by dimethylaminoazobeiizene (butter yellow) cytochondria lose their peripheral basophilia and stain only with acid dyes. When ribonucleic acid is removed from fixed liver tissue by ribonuclease, cytochondria lose their affinity for basic stains and become acidophile. Of the cytochondria that are surrounded by ribonucleic acid or related substances part have the characteristics of mitochondria. Under the influence of butter yellow cytochondria may become greatly swollen and intensely acidophile in the center though they retain their <b>basophile</b> rim. These swollen bodies in part at least have the reactions of mitochondria. In tumor cells of hepatomas mitochondria are smaller and less abundant than in parenchymatous cells of the liver, and accompanying them are bodies of similar size which do not react as mitochondria. The cytochondria of hepatomas produced by butter yellow undergo acidophile degeneration similar to that of liver cells and form swollen spherical bodies with <b>basophile</b> rims. With partial or complete loss of <b>basophile</b> substance, these altered cytochondria may form conspicuous cell inclusions...|$|E

The concentration of glucose ranged from 3. 07 mmol/L on d 15 prepartum to 2. 71 mmol/L on d 15 postpartum. A high concentration of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the postpartum period is a consequence of changes in energy balance and more intensive process of lypolisis in fat tissue, due to energy disbalance at the beginning of lactation. Established activity of enzymes AST, ALT and GGT was approximately the same in studied time intervals and was within physiological limits.

40|$|The {{cytoplasm}} {{of cells}} of the liver and of the kidney is in large part occupied by bodies which respond to the water content of these cells and are modified by dissolved substances in the surrounding fluid or by physical change such as freezing. These bodies, in part mitochondria but designated more broadly cytochondria, constitute an osmotic system within the cytoplasm of cells. When the specific gravity of liver or kidney tissue is used as an index {{of changes in the}} water content of tissue, swelling of cytochondria in general follows the intake of water but this relation may be modified by a variety of conditions. When liver that has been frozen and thawed is immersed in water, cytochondria become swollen though the containing cells diminish in size. Solutions of sodium and of potassium chloride isotonic with blood plasma cause delayed swelling of cells and cytochondria, greater with the potassium salt; solutions of calcium chloride of equal molar concentration cause immediate swelling of cells and cytochondria. The <b>basophile</b> material of the cytoplasm (ribonucleic acid and related substances) and the material that gives to mitochondria their characteristic stain are removed by immersion in water but their disappearance is retarded by isotonic solutions of sodium or of potassium chloride and further delayed by hypertonic solutions. When the intensity of staining reactions is diminished by the partial loss of <b>basophile</b> substance or of the distinctive mitochondrial material, these are found at the surfaces of the cytoplasmic bodies, held perhaps by adsorption. When water, isotonic solutions of sodium chloride, or Ringer's solution comes into contact with immersed liver, they remove <b>basophile</b> and mitochondrial material from a superficial zone and substances with similar staining reactions appear in the cytoplasm of cells at a deeper level. Osmotic changes in the cytoplasmic bodies may be reversible.

Anemia was basically normocytic normochromic. This study provides the baseline data for further studies on this parasite...|$|E
40|$|The two {{preceding}} {{papers of}} this series {{have dealt with the}} consecutive observations on the erythrocytes and the hemoglobin content (1) and with the total white cells (2) of the peripheral blood of normal male rabbits in a series of experiments extending over long periods of time. In the present paper, the results pertaining to the neutrophile (pseudo-eosinophile), <b>basophile,</b> and eosinophile cells in the same five groups of animals are reported while in the succeeding paper (3), the lymphocytes and monocytes will be considered. Since this study was primarily undertaken for the purpose of obtaining information on the character of the general trends of cell levels over prolonged periods, the results are at present considered from the group rather than from the individual animal standpoint and the findings have been analyzed upon the basis of consecutive mean values obtained at weekly intervals. Materials and Methods These subjects have been fully discussed in connection with the erythrocyte and hemoglobin results (1) and need only be referred to here. The first four groups of rabbits comprised 10 animals each and the fifth group, 5 animals. The period of observation extended from October, 1927 to July, 1929 and the following numbers of weekly examinations were made: Group I, 35; Group II, 13; Group III, 8; Group IV, 29; Group V, 26. For the differential white cell counts, the supravital neutral red technic was used and 100 cells were counted in each specimen. RESULTS The results of these experiments dealing with the neutrophile, <b>basophile,</b> and eosinophile cell content of the peripheral blood of norma...|$|E
40|$|This study {{includes}} the normal values of haematological and biochemical parameters in 21 apparently healthy Hassawi cattle. The mean haematological values were as follow, the PCV was 35. 1 � 1. 1 %, RBC was 7. 2 � 1. 1 (XI 0 12 l - 1), Hb was 12. 0 � 1. 4 (g dl - 1) and WBC was 14. 6 � 2. 3 (X 10 9 l - 1), Neutrophiles were 58 � 2. 0 % and Lymphocytes were 30 � 1. 2 %. Few monocytes, eosinophiles and <b>basophiles</b> were observed. The serum levels of total protein, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, urea, creatinine, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (CL), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), Iron (Fe), Creatinine Kinase, Lactic dehydrogenase, Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Alkaline phosphatase, - Glutamic transaminase were also investigated. The haematological and biochemical values obtained were {{found within the}} normal ranges reported by other workers in other breed of cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{umbilical}} cord blood (UCB) {{is an important}} source of hematopoietic stem cells with great deal of interest in regenerative medicine. The UCB cells have been extensively studied {{as an alternative to the}} bone marrow transplants. The challenge is to define specific methods to purify and characterize these cells in different animal species. This study is aimed at morphological characterization of progenitor cells derived from UCB highlighting relevant differences with peripheral blood of adult in dog and cats. Therefore, blood was collected from 18 dogs and 5 cats' {{umbilical cord}}s from fetus in various developmental stages. The mononuclear cells were separated using the gradient of density Histopaque- 1077. Characterization of CD 34 + cells was performed by flow cytometric analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Granulocytes (ancestry of the <b>basophiles,</b> eosinophiles, and neutrophiles) and agranulocytes (represented by immature lymphocytes) were identified. We showed for the first time the ultrastructural features of cat UCB cells. Microsc. Res. Tech. 75 : 766770, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} January 2014 – March 2017 downer cow {{syndrome}} cases in farm cows of Prizren region, Kosovo, were studied. Clinical cases were grouped based on clinical diagnosis and blood samples from jugular vein {{were taken from}} those. Hematologic indicators were analysed from blood samples for the total of white blood cells (WBC), red cells (RBC), haemoglobin (HB), haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and also leucocyte formula was defined with neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and <b>basophiles</b> indicators. Obtained data were statistically analysed with ANOVA method and most visible deviations were defined in haematological indicators. Data showed that downer syndrome in cows dictate changes in haematological indicators. Most affected indicators are the total of white blood cells (WBC), number of neutrophils and basophils. Obtained data are statistically verified, (p< 0. 05). These indicators increase more in cases of severe infections and muscular damages in cows. Based on the obtained results we think that changes in haematological indicators {{can be used to}} check clinical status and prognosis for cows affected by the downer syndrome...|$|R
