5|$|Midazolam {{is known}} to cause {{respiratory}} depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> likely.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E

5|$|A young white-bellied sea eagle in {{its first}} year is {{predominantly}} brown, with pale cream-streaked plumage on their head, neck, nape and rump areas. The plumage <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult plumage by the fourth or fifth year. The species breeds from around six years of age onwards. The lifespan is thought to be around 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> likely.|$|E
5|$|Between 4% and 7% {{of people}} have heel pain {{at any given time}} and about 80% of these cases are due to plantar fasciitis.

50|$|As {{knowledge-based}} systems <b>became</b> <b>more</b> complex {{the techniques}} {{used to represent}} the knowledge base <b>became</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated. Rather than representing facts as assertions about data, the knowledge-base <b>became</b> <b>more</b> structured, representing information using similar techniques to object-oriented programming such as hierarchies of classes and subclasses, relations between classes, and behavior of objects. As the knowledge base <b>became</b> <b>more</b> structured reasoning could occur both by independent rules and by interactions within the knowledge base itself. For example, procedures stored as demons on objects could fire and could replicate the chaining behavior of rules.|$|R

5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E

5|$|The oceans {{may have}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> hospitable to life {{over the last}} 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen <b>became</b> <b>more</b> widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems <b>became</b> <b>more</b> diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|R
5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies motionless {{on the sea}} floor, {{buried under}} a layer of sediment with only its eyes showing. At night, it <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> active, and may sometimes be seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up to a hundred have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the fluke Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E
5|$|Gaze <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> complex {{with age}} and practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E

5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> resistant to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> symmetrical with the passage of time. Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
