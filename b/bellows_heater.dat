40|$|This work {{discusses}} the numerical analysis, {{the design and}} experimental test of the fuel-powered compact SMA actuator along with its capabilities and limitations. Convection heating and cooling using water actuate the SMA element of the actuator. The energy of fuels, having a high energy density, is used as the energy source for the SMA actuator {{in order to increase}} power and energy density of the system, and thus in order to obviate the need for electrical power supplies such as batteries. The system is composed of pump, valves, <b>bellows,</b> <b>heater</b> (burner), control unit and a displacement amplification device. The experimental test of the first designed SMA actuator system results in 150 M Pa stress (force: 1560 N) with 3 % strain and 0. 5 Hz actuation frequency. The actuation frequency is compared with the prediction obtained from numerical analysis. For the first designed fuel-powered SMA actuator system, the results of numerical analysis were utilized in determining design parameters and operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The External Tank {{forms the}} {{structural}} {{backbone of the}} Space Shuttle in the launch configuration. Because the tank flies to orbital velocity with the Space Shuttle Orbiter, minimization of weight is mandatory, to maximize payload performance. Choice of lightweight materials both for structure and thermal conditioning was necessary. The tank is large, and unique manufacturing facilities, tooling, handling, and transportation operations were required. Weld processes and tooling evolved with the design as it matured through several block changes, to reduce weight. Non Destructive Evaluation methods were used to assure integrity of welds and thermal protection system materials. The aluminum-lithium alloy was used {{near the end of}} the program and weld processes and weld repair techniques had to be refined. Development and implementation of friction stir welding was a substantial technology development incorporated during the Program. Automated thermal protection system application processes were developed for the majority of the tank surface. Material obsolescence was an issue throughout the 40 year program. The final configuration and tank weight enabled international space station assembly in a high inclination orbit allowing international cooperation with the Russian Federal Space Agency. Numerous process controls were implemented to assure product quality, and innovative proof testing was accomplished prior to delivery. Process controls were implemented to assure cleanliness in the production environment, to control contaminants, and to preclude corrosion. Each tank was accepted via rigorous inspections, including non-destructive evaluation techniques, proof testing, and all systems testing. In the post STS- 107 era, the project focused on ascent debris risk reduction. This was accomplished via stringent process controls, post flight assessment using substantially improved imagery, and selective redesigns. These efforts were supported with a number of test programs to simulate combined environments. Processing improvements included development and use of low spray guns for foam application, additional human factors considerations for production, use of high fidelity mockups during hardware processing with video review, improved tank access, extensive use of non destructive evaluation, and producibility enhancements. Design improvements included redesigned bipod fittings, a <b>bellows</b> <b>heater,</b> a feedline camera active during ascent flight, removal of the protuberance airload ramps, redesigned ice frost ramps, and titanium brackets replaced aluminum brackets on the liquid oxygen feedline. Post flight assessment improved due to significant addition of imagery assets, greatly improving situational awareness. The debris risk was reduced by two orders of magnitude. During this time a major natural disaster was overcome when Katrina damaged the manufacturing facility. Numerous lessons from these efforts are documented within the paper...|$|E
30|$|We {{designed}} and fabricated an actuator {{that can be}} utilized in a 300.0  °C high temperature environment. The actuator consists of a <b>bellow</b> body, spring, <b>heater</b> with a built-in temperature sensor, and TEG working fluid. The bellow was fabricated from Inconel super alloy, which is highly heat and corrosion resistant, and can generate displacements without friction. The TEG working fluid has a very low vapor pressure at ordinary temperature and a boiling point of 287.3  °C. Consequently, the proposed actuator is controllable in 300.0  °C temperature environments.|$|R
30|$|Gas/liquid phase changes produce {{large volume}} changes in working fluids. These volume changes {{are used as}} the driving power sources in {{actuators}} such as micro-pumps and valves. Most of these actuators are utilized in ordinary temperature environments. However, the temperature range in which the phase change actuator can operate depends {{on the characteristics of}} the working fluid. We hypothesized that proper selection of the working fluid and the structure of the actuator can enable such actuators to be applied not only in ordinary environments but also in high temperature environments. Consequently, in this paper, we discuss the design and fabrication of a new gas/liquid phase change actuator for use in high temperature environments. Our proposed actuator consists of a <b>bellow</b> body, spring, <b>heater,</b> and working fluid. We used the Inconel super alloy, which is highly heat and corrosion resistant, for the bellow and moving parts of the actuator. For the working fluid, we prepared triethylene glycol, which has a boiling point of 287.3  °C and very low vapor pressure at ordinary temperature. As a result, our proposed actuator can be utilized in high temperature environments up to 300.0  °C. The results of several experiments conducted confirm that our proposed actuator generates 1.67  mm maximum displacement in a 300.0  °C atmospheric environment. In addition, we confirmed that the operation of the actuator is stable in that environment. Our results confirm that a gas/liquid phase change actuator can be used in high temperature environments.|$|R
