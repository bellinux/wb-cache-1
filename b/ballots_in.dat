5|$|According to top Marine officials, the {{elections}} {{were designed to}} help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott. The simultaneous elections for the provincial council were won by the Iraqi Islamic Party, which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} some {{controversy}} about this move, London {{was the first}} city in Canada (in May 2017) to decide to move a ranked choice ballot for municipal elections starting in 2018. Voters will mark their <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> order of preference, ranking their top three favourite candidates. No single individual is required {{to get at least}} 50% of the vote in the balloting to be elected.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the fourth}} and last time that the victorious {{candidate}} wasn’t on the <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> all states. Alabama refused to let Johnson on the <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> this election and Truman in 1948.

5|$|The NBA began {{offering}} All-Star <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> three languages—English, Spanish and Chinese—for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Yao was voted to {{start for the}} West over O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards. Yao received nearly a quarter million more votes than O'Neal, and {{he became the first}} rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The home of John Magill {{was used}} as the polling place. The precinct only {{contained}} about 10 eligible voters (another source says 50), but the Cowboys gathered nonvoters like the children and Chinese and had them cast ballots. Not satisfied, they named all the dogs, burros, and poultry and cast <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> their names for Shibell. The election board met on November 14 and declared Shibell as the winner.|$|E
5|$|Three final candidates, {{selected}} by a three-member BBWAA committee, were named on July 14, 2009 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis {{in conjunction with}} All-Star Game activities: Bill Madden, national baseball columnist for the New York Daily News, Bob Elliott of the Toronto Sun and Joe Giuliotti, retired from the Boston Herald.

50|$|Attempts {{to legalize}} {{euthanasia}} and assisted suicide resulted <b>in</b> <b>ballot</b> initiatives and legislation bills within the United States {{in the last}} 20 years.

5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their <b>ballots.</b> <b>In</b> 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the other}} {{candidates}} had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> the hope that the anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By {{the end of the first}} day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the French {{lost the}} Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference {{was held to}} {{determine}} the future of Indochina. The Viet Minh were given control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the territory south of the 17th parallel. The Geneva agreements, which the State of Vietnam did not sign, called for reunification elections {{to be held in}} 1956. Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as his Prime Minister, hoping Diệm would be able to attract American aid as the French withdrew from Southeast Asia. Diệm returned to Vietnam in June 1954 and took up the post on July 7, 1954. After a series of disagreements, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum on October 23, 1955, and declared himself president of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later. Diệm received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War. He refused to hold national reunification elections scheduled in 1956, and asserted that Ho would rig the <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> the north, although he had done so himself in deposing Bảo Đại. In the meantime, Diệm continued to consolidate his rule and stabilize his new nation.|$|E
50|$|Electioneering was {{frustrating}} for council members because Kern County officials denied their request {{to allow a}} vote {{at the same time}} residents <b>balloted</b> <b>in</b> county elections. The council also tried putting a mail-in <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> the local newspaper.|$|R

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
5|$|Hayes had {{announced}} {{early in his}} presidency {{that he would not}} seek another term, which meant that the contest for the Republican nomination in 1880 was open to all challengers—including Blaine. Blaine was among the early favorites for the nomination, as were former President Grant, Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Although Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, his entry into the race re-energized the Stalwarts and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly polarized the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group. Blaine was nominated by James Frederick Joy of Michigan, but in contrast to Ingersoll’s exciting speech of 1876, Joy’s lengthy oration was remembered only for its maladroitness. After the other candidates were nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; no other candidate had more than Sherman’s 93, and none had the required majority of 379. Sherman’s delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, but he refused to release them through twenty-eight <b>ballots</b> <b>in</b> the hope that the anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. Eventually, they did desert Blaine, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield, and by the thirty-sixth ballot he had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E

25|$|Pliego Carrasco {{notes that}} both the {{absolute}} and relative numbers are very close for both candidates.
