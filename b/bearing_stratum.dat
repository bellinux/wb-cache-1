50|$|Ductile iron piles {{have been}} {{successfully}} used {{on a range of}} projects throughout the world. Designs in accordance with the EuroCode (EC) have proved to be competitive with drilled micropiles and various other types of end bearing piles. TRM piles have been designed in both friction and end bearing applications. The TRM pile system provided both financial, as well as operational benefits to completed projects. For example, mobilizing an excavator versus a pile driving rig provided substantial logistical and driving advantages. When soil conditions differ adding pile length proves to be an easy task. We believe that the TRM system will not only have great advantages on tight sites with deep depths to the end <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> we believe as well that the TRM system will be used very efficiently on projects where loads can be shed in friction at shallower depths. Both end bearing and friction TRM piles will prove to be cost-effective, adaptable to varied site grading conditions and the simplicity of mobilization. The virtually vibration free driving process allows the installation of piles immediately adjacent to existing structures.|$|E

In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element method has been presented to analyze the structure-pile-soils interaction. And further, 15 structures-pile-soils models are analyzed by this method. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The differential settlements of structures generally increase in process of time and later gradually decrease, except in the case where the <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> is violently undulated. 2) The <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> for H-type causes the significant differential settlements of structures in comparison with the <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> for S-type and that for E-type. 3) If it is difficult to ensure the end bearing capacity of piles, we may as well adopt the friction piles in order to reduce the differential settlements of structures...|$|E

The movement and accumulation of free gas related to mud diapirs are discussed in detail by an analysis of fluid potential which is based upon velocity data. It can be found that free gas moves from the higher fluid potential strata to the lower ones and the gas hydrate comes into being during free gas movement meeting the proper criteria of temperature and pressure. In fact, gas hydrates have been found in the upper layers above the mud diapirs and in host rocks exhibiting other geophysical characteristics. As the result of the formation of the gas hydrate, the free gas <b>bearing</b> <b>strata</b> are enclosed by the gas hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>strata.</b> Due to the high pressure anomalies of the free gas <b>bearing</b> <b>strata</b> the fluid potential increases noticeably.

40|$|The {{development}} of Negative skin friction (NSF) {{is regarded as}} a common problem in the design and construction of pile foundations in consolidating ground. Several authors have reported failure of pile foundations related to pile settlement (downdrag). To date most of the current design approaches consider mainly on ultimate limit state (dragload) and overestimate the effect of NSF on pile behaviour. With an aim to clarify aspects of pile behaviour subjected to NSF, four centrifuge tests have been conducted. The research includes investigations of NSF developed on single piles with different pile tip location with respect to the bearing layer as well as changes of dragload and downdrag of the centre pile inside the 3 x 3 pile group under the application of axial load. Moreover, shielding effects on dragload and downdrag in 3 x 3 pile groups at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing are investigated. The observed pile behaviour is to be compared with relevant previous studies and numerical back analysis. Combined with the findings from this study and other reported test results in literature, it suggests that the smaller of the distance of pile tip from the <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum,</b> the more significant the effect from the <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> on the {{development of}} dragload and the larger the magnitude of dragload and vice versa. In contrast to the variation of dragload with pile tip location, the magnitude of downdrag with pile tip located at 0. 5 D away from the <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> is about twelve times as large as the one with pile tip rest on <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum.</b> Regarding the combined effect of applied axial load and dragload on a pile where its pile tip is located at 0. 25 D from the <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum,</b> dragload developed on the centre pile is completely eliminated for the cases where pile spacing equal to 2. 5 D and 3 D when axial loads of 150 % and 175 % of the maximum dragload developed prior to the application of axial load (Pmax) is applied. The values of required axial load are comparatively close with published test result of floating pile but are about halve the value of end-bearing pile. (i. e., 3 Pmax). For the two 3 x 3 pile groups at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, the maximum dragload of the centre pile is 53 % and 36 % of the maximum dragload of the single isolated pile respectively. At the same time, the shielding effects on downdrag of the centre pile is about 40 % and 19 % of a single isolated pile in the case where the pile spacing equal to 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D respectively. Shielding effect on downdrag is smaller than shielding effect on dragload regardless of pile spacing and shielding effect on downdrag is largest for the centre pile as compared with other piles inside the group and the isolated pile...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite element parametric study of several variables {{that affect the}} stiffness efficiency of rigidly capped pile groups {{with a view to}} developing a solution for preliminary design purposes. Previous empirical solutions from linear elastic work had identified a significant dependence of stiffness efficiency on pile group size and group spacing, and in this study, the effect of the pile length-to-diameter ratio, the compressibility of a stiff <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> beneath the pile group and the depth below ground level to the stiff <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> are also considered. Pile groups in a soft clay/silt are modelled using PLAXIS 3 D Foundation in conjunction with a soil model that captures the stress dependency of soil stiffness. The trends from the soft soil study have been formulated into a set of equations which can be used to predict the stiffness efficiency of pile groups. This new approach captures more variables than previous simpler empirical prediction methods and performs better when applied to a database of 29 published pile group case histories.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that soil investigation conducted in construction projects is limited. The budget allocated for soil investigation is often minimized {{in order to}} reduce preliminary cost of project, rather than being allocated to characterize properly soil properties. The budget allocated for soil investigation ranges from 0. 1 % to 3 % of the construction budget. These inadequate site investigations remain one of the main factors in the failure of structural foundations, and leading to unforeseen additional construction or repair costs. At the other extreme, inadequate site investigations can result in over-design of the foundation, increasing the cost unnecessarily. This study investigated the effect of limited soil investigation to estimate <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> of pile foundation in the construction project. Case study was undertaken on the contruction project of Coal Unloading Jetty PT. Semen Tonasa in Pangkep, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. To characterize the soil properties of Coal Unloading Jetty with the area of 122 ?? 20 m 2, soil investigations were conducted with limited amount, consisting of 1 SPTs. The limited site investigations was found to increase waste length of pile foundation, accounted for 9. 19 % of the total pile foundation length. If the waste is not recognized and paid by the owner of construction project, the waste cost to be a risk to the contractor. Therefore, Geostatistical methods including Kriging and Inverse Distance were employed to estimate <b>bearing</b> <b>stratum</b> of pile foundation with limited site investigation.
