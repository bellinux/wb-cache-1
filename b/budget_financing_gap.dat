40|$|Diaspora bonds {{represent}} a debt instrument issued by a country – or potentially a private corporation – to raise financing from its overseas diaspora. They offer governments a flexible mechanism for raising large scale funding to support national <b>budgets</b> and fill <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> in development programs, including provision of quality education. However, {{there is limited}} awareness about this financing vehicle. While India and Israel {{have been at the}} forefront in issuing diaspora bonds, many other nations also have large diaspora communities in the world and could benefit by issuing such bonds. Given the interest of the global education community in innovative approaches to financing, diaspora bonds could be an important source of funding. The paper proposes a pilot program for funding via diaspora bonds a medical school in a developing country with a large and skilled diaspora abroad.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how a <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> for small firms might {{be addressed by}} means of government policy to support informal financing initiatives. A review of both the finance and the government policy literature provides the basis for discussing and conceptualising the financing difficulties faced by small firms, the role of informal financing in alleviating certain of these difficulties and the areas where public policy is currently usefully employed in addressing such financing problems. A questionnaire survey is undertaken to collect data concerning small business awareness and use of informal finance and to identify issues concerning difficulties encountered in gaining access to finance. The results suggest that a debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> may exist for a minority of firms, though an equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> may represent a more significant issue for small firms. Four categories of policy action emerge from the study towards the achievement {{of economic and social}} policy objectives. These are legislation/regulation, information provision, direct funding and network provision. MANAGERIAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS •	Over the decades, the presence and nature of a small firm <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> has been an important preoccupation of policy-makers, the finance industry and of course the small firm manager. This gap may be filled by means of quasi-commercial, or QCOM, finance. •	It appears that only a minority of small business managers encounter a debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap,</b> though a more serious problem is presented by the presence of a significant and widespread equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap.</b> •	There exists a range of policy prescriptions to address the debt and equity <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> experienced by small firms. Those initiatives aiming to address the former are aligned to the government’s more recent agenda concerning social inclusion and community development whilst those aiming to address the latter are aligned to existing government economic policy objectives, particularly the continued emphasis on ‘picking winners’. •	Policy action directed at addressing the small firm debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> might include legislation to enable the growth of business credit unions; better information provision regarding sources of debt and appropriate support services; direct funding of agencies such as the Princes Trust; and network support for collectivist financing initiatives such as mutual guarantee societies and credit unions. •	Policy action directed at addressing the equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> might include legislation and deregulation to further encourage private equity investment; information to promote informal venture capital opportunities; the establishment of government funds to extend informal equity investment; and enhanced support for new and existing venture capital networks...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{small and}} medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) represent {{the majority of}} the Egyptian firms, their value added is relatively low. According to previous research, SMEs face a <b>financing</b> <b>gap</b> that causes undercapitalization and represents an obstacle that hinders SMEs from growth. This paper analyzes the current situation of SMEs in Egypt and addresses the question whether the financing problem still exists. In addition, we discuss the role of venture capital as a possible source of financing. Based on data which has been gathered using questionnaires, it is investigated whether Egyptian SMEs do know and would accept venture capital financing for their businesses. Our results show that access to finance is still a significant bottleneck for Egyptian SMEs.

Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> with additional private capital.
