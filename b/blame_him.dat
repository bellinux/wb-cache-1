5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E

When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling.

5|$|They meet up {{with the}} rest of the family at a car museum. They steal a replica of the main villain's car from The Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does not <b>blame</b> <b>him,</b> arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine.|$|E
5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it is how {{she is going to}} die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E

Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid his father would <b>blame</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{his role}} in the {{creation}} of the Oslo Accords, Rabin was awarded the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres. The Accords greatly divided Israeli society, with some seeing Rabin as a hero for advancing the cause of peace and some seeing him as a traitor for giving away land they viewed as rightfully belonging to Israel. Many Israelis on the right wing often <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for Jewish deaths in terror attacks, attributing them to the Oslo agreements.|$|E

When Mu Sheng reached Chuxiong City, he was reprimanded by an imperial envoy for Fang Zheng's failure. Fearing that the emperor would <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for the loss at Kongni, Mu Sheng sent back 45,000 troops, but died soon after from an illness on 2 May 1439. Emboldened by the Ming failure to suppress him, Si Renfa continued his military expansion against his neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{decision}} was made not to allow the prosecution, Terry Lubbock, the father of Stuart Lubbock, met with Barrymore, when it was alleged that Terry Lubbock told Barrymore he did not <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for his son's death. Bennett, though, maintained that the private prosecution would proceed, but that he would reconsider if asked to drop the case by the Lubbock family. He added that evidence from the night of Stuart Lubbock's death, made available at the inquest, had not been seen by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).|$|E
25|$|Even before Noble {{had left}} office, {{many of his}} opponents began to <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for the state's {{financial}} situation. He argued that he had proposed tax increases to fund the project, {{and it was the}} fault of the General Assembly for not enacting them. Although the short term situation was devastating to the state and many of the projects were never completed, the groundwork laid by the projects led to rapid development after the financial situation was resolved. In the meantime, the debacle became apparent to the public during his successor's term and led to the gradual collapse of the state's Whig party, which never regained power in Indiana. In the immediate years thereafter the Democrats came to power and disposed of all the projects. The situation ultimately led to language in the 1851 constitution prohibiting the state from assuming debt.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourth}} year of Julian's stay in Gaul, the Sassanid Emperor, Shapur II, invaded Mesopotamia and took the city of Amida after a 73-day siege. In February 360, Constantius II ordered {{more than half of}} Julian's Gallic troops to join his eastern army, the order by-passing Julian and going {{directly}} to the military commanders. Although Julian at first attempted to expedite the order, it provoked an insurrection by troops of the Petulantes, who had no desire to leave Gaul. According to the historian Zosimus, the army officers were those responsible for distributing an anonymous tract expressing complaints against Constantius as well as fearing for Julian's ultimate fate. Notably absent at the time was the prefect Florentius, who was seldom far from Julian's side, though now he was kept busy organizing supplies in Vienne and away from any strife that the order could cause. Julian would later <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for the arrival of the order from Constantius. Ammianus Marcellinus even suggested that the fear of Julian gaining more popularity than himself caused Constantius to send the order on the urging of Florentius.|$|E
25|$|Alex {{is convicted}} of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day {{informed}} him that Georgie has {{been killed in a}} botched robbery). Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of aversion therapy, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, while {{awaiting}} {{the consequences of}} the police raid, Jagger, Richards and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: [...] "That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive me for that and I don't <b>blame</b> <b>him,</b> but hell, shit happens." [...] Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.|$|E

500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is {{introduced}} {{as the third}} and youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former Hand of the King, and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him. Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime {{is one of the}} Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly ("for all the world like a gargoyle"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them. While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a [...] "second class noble" [...] because of his stature. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for her death. While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels a sense of duty to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love. Lev Grossman of Time wrote in 2011: ...|$|E
500|$|The England {{selectors}} {{made several}} {{changes to the}} team for the second Test. Colin Blythe, a crucial bowler to the team, withdrew before the game. Other players were left out whom most commentators believed should have played, and the bowling attack was packed with medium-paced bowlers of a similar style. The report in Wisden suggested: [...] "Never {{in the history of}} Test Matches in England has there been such blundering in the selection of an England eleven". The selectors later implied the controversial choices were at the behest of MacLaren, although other evidence suggests that MacLaren did not get the team he requested. England lost the game; MacLaren's reputation suffered and commentators began to <b>blame</b> <b>him</b> for the defeat. He offered his resignation, but the selectors retained him as captain and restored some of the players omitted from the second Test. When England lost the third Test after the batsmen failed, not helped by MacLaren's poor form, critics questioned his place in the team. MacLaren tried to excuse his position, suggesting in the press that he knew the team would struggle and played [...] "in spite of my personal wishes". He also implied that the team's selection was out of his hands. When the fourth Test was rained off, England could not win the series and so Australia retained the Ashes.|$|E
