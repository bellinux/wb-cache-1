40|$|Modern {{automotive}} {{instrument panels}} are often equipped with numeric readout and digital <b>bargraph</b> <b>displays</b> instead of traditional analog displays. An informal survey of 1990 model cars revealed wide disparity in automotive displays. Three major classes of displays were in use: (1) traditional analog, (2) binary indicators, and (3) readout displays. The present work reports results from four experiments of display monitorability. Twelve computer-simulated displays {{were designed for}} evaluation by dual-task methodology. Subjects were required to maintain performance on a demanding tracking task while monitoring configurations of four-displays for "critical readings. " Subjects' latencies to respond to such readings and their tracking error scores were collected. Experiment 1 examined displays in homogeneous clusters. Orientation, configuration and class were studied. Experiment 2 compared displays in heterogeneous configurations. Experiment 3 studied the addition of color to the displays to facilitate the detection of a critical reading. Static color (i. e., a "red zone") {{was added to the}} analog displays while dynamic color was added to the <b>bargraph</b> <b>displays.</b> Finally, Experiment 4 examined the effect of check-readable layouts for analog and <b>bargraph</b> <b>displays.</b> Older subjects were slower to respond to all displays and exhibited poorer tracking performance. They also had more variability than younger subjects on both of these measures. This result was likely due to age-related slowing rather than changes in cognitive processes. No class of displays studied emerged as superior, but the binary indicator (a modified warning lamp) generated the fastest responses. Although no evidence was found for effects of orientation, configuration or check-readability, support was found for color facilitation. Male subjects tended to respond faster when static color was present, and age-related facilitation was found for dynamic color. The addition of dynamic color to displays monitored by subjects in the middle and older age groups approximately compensated for age-related RT decrements. It is likely that displays which incorporate dynamic color elements will be most useful for presenting rate information as well as calling attention to off-normal readings. Pending further study, it is recommended that designers use new display technology with caution...|$|R
5000|$|In about 1936 and 1937, German {{broadcasters}} {{developed a}} peak programme meter with a mirror galvanometer {{known as a}} [...] "Lichtzeigerinstrument" [...] (light pointer) for the display. The system consisted of a drive amplifier (e.g., ARD types U21 and U71) and a separate display unit (e.g., ARD types J47 and J48). A stereo version, known as a [...] "Doppel-Lichtzeigerinstrument" [...] contained two mirror galvanometer displays in a single housing. Such displays were still used until the 1970s, when solid-state <b>bargraph</b> <b>displays</b> became the norm.|$|R
5000|$|The Coupé and Coupé quattro models appear almost {{identical}} {{from the outside}} {{except for a few}} minor [...] "quattro" [...] specifics. While the GT had [...] "COUPE GT" [...] on the rear side windows, the CQ had the [...] "quattro" [...] decal as used on the Ur-Quattro. Similarly at the rear, the badging was [...] "GT" [...] and [...] "quattro" [...] respectively. The quattro versions also used the Ur-Quattro rear windscreen with [...] "quattro" [...] written into the heater elements (very obviously so on a cold and frosty morning), and the front grille was also adorned with the [...] "quattro" [...] badge from the Ur-Q. Inside, the cabin was identical except that the centre console received a differential lock switch, and LED <b>bargraph</b> <b>displays</b> in place of the GT's three analogue-style gauges. Some Coupé quattros were distinguished by a body-coloured rear spoiler.|$|R
50|$|IEC 60268-10 is {{concerned}} mainly with the highly specified Type I and Type II PPMs used in broadcasting. It does however also contain a brief section on PPMs for 'secondary and consumer' applications. The requirements include {{a minimum of}} a 12-segment <b>bargraph</b> type <b>display</b> covering a range of −42 dB to +6 dB relative to nominal maximum level, and the same integration and return times as a Type I PPM.|$|R
5|$|Jackson {{assisted}} Clair Brothers by teaming with Ron Borthwick {{to design}} a mixing console that folded up into its own road case, a proprietary model used by Clair Brothers for some 12 years of top tours. The console used novel plasma <b>bargraph</b> meters which <b>displayed</b> both average and peak sound levels, combining the characteristics of fast peak meters and slower VU meters. Clair Brothers built 10 of the consoles, the first live sound console to incorporate parametric equalisation.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the first {{application}} of the Steady State Probe Topography (SSPT) neuroimaging technique (Silberstein, 1992) {{to the design of}} configural displays for continuous monitoring tasks. Two studies replicated and extended the performance results of Buttigieg and Sanderson (1991) in which high-level system constraints that subjects had to monitor were either well-mapped or poorly mapped to visual emergent features of digital, <b>bargraph,</b> or shape <b>displays.</b> SSPT results for poorly-mapped displays all showed prefrontal excitation indicative of high mental workload and lateralization of excitation, regardless of the kind of display. However, SSPT results for well-mapped displays showed less prefrontal involvement the more directly the constraint being monitored was represented in the display. The display supporting best performance showed no prefrontal involvement at all, but instead involvement of areas associated with form perception and visual attention, indicating a low-workload perceptual strategy. We interpret these results in the context of recent work on ecological display design and indicate future directions for neuroimaging studies of human interaction with dynamic systems...|$|R
