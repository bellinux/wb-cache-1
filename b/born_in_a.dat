5|$|Gestation lasts {{eight to}} nine months, {{following}} which a single calf or twins (even triplets at times) are <b>born.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2004 {{study in the}} Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 {{percent of the total}} calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the first few weeks of their lives. This period of concealment can last as long as a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. Young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas.|$|E
