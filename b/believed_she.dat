5|$|Imelda {{knew that}} her husband Ferdinand Marcos had dreamed of {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever since he was a congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E

Others <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> died from {{complications}} of childbirth, shortly after delivering twin daughters. Still others <b>believe</b> that <b>she</b> had leprosy, leading to a difficult delivery, and ultimately to her death shortly {{after the birth of}} the twins. Thus both leprosy and childbirth are possible causes of death.|$|R
5|$|Interest in the Cottingley Fairies {{gradually}} declined after 1921. Both girls {{married and}} lived abroad {{for a time}} after they grew up, yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination.

Elsie left open the possibility that she <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.|$|E

Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|Hayes courted {{his future}} wife, Lucy Webb, {{during his time}} there. His mother had {{encouraged}} him {{to get to know}} Lucy years earlier, but Hayes had <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> was too young and focused his attention on other women. Four years later, Hayes began {{to spend more time with}} Lucy. They became engaged in 1851 and married on December 30, 1852, at the house of Lucy's mother. Over the next five years, Lucy gave birth to three sons: Birchard Austin (1853), Webb Cook (1856), and Rutherford Platt (1858). Lucy, a Methodist, was a teetotaler and abolitionist. She influenced her husband's views on those issues, although he never formally joined her church.|$|E

She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as the Doctor has never kissed her before she deduces that this will be her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E

5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.|$|E
5|$|The Farrar {{children}} were all engaged in activities outside the home. Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some felt she was a supportive mother, while others <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> drove her children too hard and put down their efforts too often.|$|E
5|$|When {{only the}} four {{alliance}} members remained, the vote initially {{ended in a}} draw; close allies Richard and Rudy voted for Susan, and Susan and Kelly voted for Richard. On the revote, Kelly decided to switch her vote and Susan was eliminated. After winning the final immunity challenge, Kelly decided to eliminate Rudy because she <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> had a better chance against Richard. At the final Tribal Council, Susan lambasted Kelly for switching her vote and proclaimed her support for Richard. Richard's strategic prowess and leadership were valued over Kelly's impressive challenge performances, and the jury awarded him the title of Sole Survivor in a vote of 4-3.|$|E

5|$|Catherine <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> had showed Spain {{that the}} French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, {{remained}} a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
5|$|France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French officially {{declared}} Madagascar to {{be their}} colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year. The queen and much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister {{would need to be}} selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a husband on the queen and would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{independent}} Hollywood producer Robert Lippert {{acquired the}} rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch {{did not intend to}} write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the document was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Louise Arbour {{began her}} job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was {{unexpectedly}} selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's tactic of publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire, Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milošević, a head of state, indicted and arrested.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{produced}} and directed {{her own work}} called Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival, but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, {{many of whom were}} Jewish. Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic and cast out. She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto. According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who <b>believed</b> <b>she</b> epitomized the perfect German female. He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting.|$|E

For example, a person may <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> is receiving stolen goods, but the goods are in fact not stolen.|$|R
