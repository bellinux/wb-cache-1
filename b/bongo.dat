5|$|Bongo: Originates {{from the}} African people and {{language}} {{and is also}} used for place names in several African countries, also alluding to Adriano Celentanos film Bingo <b>Bongo</b> {{and a kind of}} forest antelope. The novel presents <b>Bongo</b> as a clownish, male juvenile who teases {{the other members of the}} band but is protected from backlashes by his youth and humor.|$|E
5|$|Numerous Simpson-related {{comic books}} have been {{released}} over the years. So far, nine comic book series have been published by <b>Bongo</b> Comics since 1993. The first comic strips based on The Simpsons appeared in 1991 in the magazine Simpsons Illustrated, which was a companion magazine to the show. The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled Simpsons Comics and Stories, containing four different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. The book was a success and due to this, the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison, Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company <b>Bongo</b> Comics. Issues of Simpsons Comics, Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror and Bart Simpson have been collected and reprinted in trade paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon is {{a member}} of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie. Its foreign policy closely follows that of its main ally, France (one of its former colonial rulers). Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence, {{although}} military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government. Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar <b>Bongo,</b> over personal rivalries.|$|E
5|$|The album earned Combs five {{nominations}} at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, {{winning the}} Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. On September 7, 2000, {{the album was}} certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 7 million copies. In 1997, Combs was sued for landlord neglect by Inge <b>Bongo.</b> Combs denied the charges. By the late 1990s, he was being criticized for watering down and overly commercializing hip hop, and for using too many guest appearances, samples, and interpolations of past hits in his new songs.|$|E
5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar <b>Bongo,</b> allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville.|$|E
50|$|Fields' {{most famous}} album is Bagels & <b>Bongos</b> (1959), {{recorded}} for Decca Records with his trio, which sold two million copies. The {{next year he}} released the sequel More Bagels & <b>Bongos,</b> which was reissued on CD in 2009 by Roman Midnight Music under the direct creative advisement of 94-year-old Fields, the only reissue commissioned directly by Irving. Fields claimed to have recorded nearly 100 albums featuring trios, quartets, orchestras and solo. His most known work is the 1960s output that directly followed Bagels & <b>Bongos</b> and fused international music with Latin, including: Bikinis and <b>Bongos,</b> featuring Hawaiian music, Pizza and <b>Bongos</b> featuring Italian music and Champagne and <b>Bongos</b> featuring French music. He also did an album of songs done in a Twist style called Twistin!. Fields' sister was Peppy Fields, often called the Sophie Tucker of Miami, who hosted celebrity radio and TV shows for 35 years.|$|R
50|$|Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong {{are hanging}} out at the beach one day when they come across some mysterious objects that {{resemble}} barrels. Fearing they {{had something to do with}} King K. Rool, they take them to Cranky Kong. Cranky explains that they are <b>bongos,</b> so Donkey tries playing them. Diddy tries to do so as well. Then, when Donkey claps, the <b>bongos</b> start glowing. Cranky explains that the <b>bongos</b> have some kind of power inside them. Donkey and Diddy continue to play the <b>bongos,</b> but they both play terribly. Cranky advises them to practice. At first they are against this, but then they realize if they can become successful in playing the <b>bongos,</b> they could afford as many bananas as they wish, so they start practicing.|$|R

The first time <b>Bongo's</b> Bash was published was in 1985 by inCider Magazine on their Hot Cider disk product. The game listing {{was used in}} advertisements by Cauzin Softstrip to demonstrate what kind of software can be quickly scanned into an Apple II. <b>Bongo's</b> Bash was then sold to UpTime (disk magazine) in 1987 and published on Volume 12, Number 4.|$|R
5|$|In 1958, Miller played Brunet in Maclean Rogers' drama Mark of the Phoenix {{alongside}} Julia Arnall, Sheldon Lawrence and Anton Diffring. He appeared {{twice as}} Nat Danziger in ITV Play of the Week in 1955 and 1958, and in three episodes of the BBC's Sunday Night Theatreone in 1956 {{and two in}} 1959. He again played a rabbi in a 1956 episode of ITV Television Playhouse entitled Skipper Next to God, and made two further appearances in the series later in the decade. In 1959, Miller had an uncredited role as Kakky in Expresso <b>Bongo</b> directed by Val Guest. He played a doctor in the television film Henry IV and appeared as Dr. Schrott in Anthony Asquith's film Libel, starring alongside Olivia de Havilland and Dirk Bogarde.|$|E
5|$|Intent on {{propagating}} Islam, in 1973 Gaddafi {{founded the}} Islamic Call Society, which had opened 132 centres across Africa within a decade. In 1973 he converted Gabonese President Omar <b>Bongo,</b> an action which he repeated {{three years later}} with Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic. Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500 million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the country to aid trade and development. Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973. A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga, and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, <b>bongo</b> and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E

5|$|Feynman {{spent several}} weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949, {{and brought back}} a woman called Clotilde from Copacabana who lived with him in Ithaca for a time. As well as the cold weather, {{there was also the}} Cold War. The Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb in 1949, {{generating}} anti-communist hysteria. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950, and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty. Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950, and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. A girlfriend told Feynman that he should consider moving to South America. He had a sabbatical coming for 1951–52, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas. In Brazil, Feynman was particularly impressed with the Samba music, and learned to play a metal percussion instrument, the frigideira. He was an enthusiastic amateur player of <b>bongo</b> drums and often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio with his good friend Bohm, but Bohm could not convince Feynman to take up investigating Bohm's ideas on physics.|$|E
25|$|Bongo's second {{marriage}} was to Marie Josephine Kama, later known as Josephine <b>Bongo.</b> He divorced her in 1986, after which {{she went on}} to launch a music career under a new name, Patience Dabany. They had a son, Alain Bernard <b>Bongo,</b> and a daughter, Albertine Amissa <b>Bongo.</b> Born at Brazzaville in 1959, Alain Bernard <b>Bongo</b> (later known as Ali-Ben <b>Bongo)</b> served as Foreign Minister from 1989 to 1991, then as Defence Minister from 1999 to 2009, and was then elected President in August 2009 to replace his father.|$|E
25|$|Bongos {{are further}} {{classified}} into two subspecies: T. e. eurycerus, the lowland or western <b>bongo,</b> {{and the far}} rarer T. e. isaaci, the mountain or eastern <b>bongo,</b> restricted to the mountains of Kenya only. The eastern <b>bongo</b> is larger and heavier than the western <b>bongo.</b> Two other subspecies are described from West and Central Africa, but taxonomic clarification is required.

25|$|After Gabon's {{independence}} in 1960, Albert-Bernard <b>Bongo</b> began his political career, gradually rising through {{a succession of}} positions under President Léon M'ba. <b>Bongo</b> campaigned for M.

In 1964, during the only coup attempt in Gabon's history, M'ba was kidnapped and <b>Bongo</b> was held in a military camp in Libreville, though M'ba was restored to power two days later.|$|E

25|$|Bongos require salt {{in their}} diets, and {{are known to}} {{regularly}} visit natural salt licks. Examination of <b>bongo</b> feces revealed that charcoal from trees burnt by lightning is consumed. This behavior {{is believed to be}} a means of getting salts and minerals into their diets. This behavior has also been reported in the okapi. Another similarity to the okapi, though the <b>bongo</b> is unrelated, is that the <b>bongo</b> has a long prehensile tongue which it uses to grasp grasses and leaves.|$|E
