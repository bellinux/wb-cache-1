40|$|Abstract. In today’s era {{automation}} in {{the production}} is a key parameter of interest. Rise in the productivity is the main aim of every industry. To sustain in the global era many companies are switching their assembly line from manual to automatic. Consequently, assembly systems should be more flexible and efficient. Even which process needs the automation should be justified to make it automatic. The amount of automation and payback period plays an important role. On that basis authors identify the <b>back</b> <b>plug</b> process needs to be automate. So an attempt is made to design an Automatic <b>Back</b> <b>Plug</b> Press Fitting Process. The paper describes the design, modeling and manufacturing aspects of this process. In automation decisions, {{it is necessary to}} consider human resources, as well as mechanical technology and information flow. The paper also includes rise in the productivity along with payback period...|$|E

5000|$|Typically, the ADC, TDC, {{and other}} digital {{electronics}} are large circuit boards with connectors {{at the front}} edge that provide input and output for digital signals, and a connector at the <b>back</b> that <b>plugs</b> into a backplane. A group of boards is plugged into a chassis, or [...] "crate", that provides physical support, power, and cooling for the boards and backplane. This arrangement allows electronics capable of digitizing many hundreds of channels to be compressed into a single chassis.|$|R
25|$|NEMA {{non-locking}} connectors all use {{blades of}} various flat and folded shapes (except for the round pins used on grounding connectors). The plugs can be {{detached from the}} receptacles by pulling <b>back</b> on the <b>plug</b> body. These connector families have been designed so that connectors of differing types cannot be accidentally intermated.|$|R

50|$|Plugs {{often include}} a pilot light LED {{indicator}} {{to indicate that}} electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal fuse for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, {{the tip of the}} plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a newer blade-type fuse inserted into the side or <b>back</b> of the <b>plug.</b>|$|R

These closely resemble standard 631A connectors but the keying slots on the <b>back</b> of the <b>plug</b> have a different size and position. The Sinclair QL also used the left handed variant of this connector (the 630W) for its joystick ports.|$|R
50|$|It took Lone Star {{a little}} over a year and a half to reach 31,441 feet (9,583 m), a depth of almost six miles. During drilling, the well {{encountered}} enormous pressure - almost 25,000 psi (172,369 kPa). No commercial hydrocarbons were found before drilling hit a molten sulfur deposit (which melted the drill bit). The well was <b>plugged</b> <b>back</b> and completed in the Granite Wash from 11,000 to 13.200 feet as a natural gas producer.|$|R

By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth.|$|R

50|$|Distinct {{from the}} General Hardware Failure is a similar-looking, but much less serious, error warning where four red lights appear, {{in which case}} the console does not detect an AV cable is plugged in; however, this error code is not {{generated}} on models equipped with the HDMI connection. The four lights can sometimes also be seen when power surges or very brief power outages occur while the console is running, in which the console needs to be unplugged and <b>plugged</b> <b>back</b> in again to reset the error. Two red lights appear when the system is overheated.|$|R
50|$|In addition, jia xie is {{a method}} for dyeing {{textiles}} (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the <b>back,</b> fitted with <b>plugs.</b> The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2014, Argyle succumbed to a small flood due to heavy {{rainfall}} overnight. The flash flood, 100 millimeters in 24 hours, caused families to evacuate their homes. They traced the source <b>back</b> to a <b>plug</b> {{in one of the}} many creeks in the area, which then found another path to flow down {{which turned out to be}} Kilmer (where flooding was the worst) and then Fromme. The extent of the damage on the school was the inundation of nine classrooms and the drama department's prop room. The following morning school was canceled as professionals and families alike attempted to reduce the damage to the school.|$|R

She is determined to get answers from Anders and reconnects him to talk to him.

30|$|The general {{strategy}} then is {{to break}} down the decision process into two sequential search decisions. In the first, using the WCS data, I extract the probability of entry into the transfer market by teacher type, which will be parametrized by the individual expected utilities of matching with the different types of schools (as well as failing to match and remaining in the current school). This will ‘predict’ the number of teachers who decide to search, which can be plugged into the probability of matching, which can then be plugged into the probability of searching in a particular market, conditional on deciding to search. Finally, these probabilities can be <b>plugged</b> <b>back</b> into the entry decision to generate the predicted number of searchers again.|$|R

In order {{to get back on}} the road one of the brothers drove a quarter or half dollar into the hole. From this they developed the Welch plug, some with the help of my great grandfather Martin Hubbard. They then patented the plug and the M.D. Hubbard Spring Company became the sole manufacturer of the Welch plug for the life of the patent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Behavioral {{economist}} Daniel Goldstein {{describes how}} commitment devices established in [...] "cold states" [...] help an agent guard against impulsive decisions in later, emotional, stimulated, [...] "hot states". Goldstein says that, despite their usefulness, commitment devices nevertheless have drawbacks. Namely, they still rely on some self-control. Goldstein says that, for one, a commitment device can promote learned helplessness in the agent. If the agent enters {{a situation where}} the device does not incentivize commitment, the agent may lack sufficient will or ability to control themselves. (Goldstein uses the example of a cake falling into the grey area of a diet, so it is eaten excessively.) Second, commitment devices can usually be reversed.

The team {{had made some}} minor repairs by welding before the race and it was thought the primary ignition control box had been damaged. During attempts to diagnose and repair the problem, the team switched to the backup box and replaced much of the ignition system, to no avail. When the team returned home after the race, engine builder Waddell Wilson checked and determined that the crewman who had switched to the backup box by unplugging the primary ignition box and plugging into the backup box had in fact, during the chaos, <b>plugged</b> <b>back</b> into the defective primary box. When Wilson switched to the backup ignition box, the car fired in perfect condition.|$|R

50|$|The {{first edition}} of Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book is a small softback book {{containing}} 36 photocopied plug wiring diagrams, mostly in colour using different coloured toners in monochrome photocopiers; 3 full colour photocopies have been tipped in as well.

The 'de-luxe' version sold for £3.00, twice the asking price of the stapled version. The cover is a grainy photocopy of the <b>back</b> of a <b>plug</b> diagram with three holes cut into it (where the pins would go). There is a brief essay at the end by Pawson discussing his collection of plugs, and their essential Britishness. The last page lists credits of 'contributing electricians'.|$|R

It is found that there are two regions of d/D where the characteristics of streamwise local heat transfer coefficients vary differently. For small d/D, the heat transfer mechanism depends on the flow field with a high turbulence intensity caused by the violent shear layer flow separated {{from the edge of the}} bluff plug.
