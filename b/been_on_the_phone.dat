50|$|Jones, who {{was driving}} a Hyundai Santa Fe, had car trouble, had first called his brother, C.J. Jones, who offered to come help him. Jones was due in church {{the next morning and}} needed his car, so he told his brother not to come pick him up. Jones' bandmate, Huntsberger, came to help, {{bringing}} oil, but they were not able to get the car running. Jones called for a tow truck and with that assurance, Huntsberger left. Jones had been returning home to Boynton Beach, Florida, after playing a show in Jupiter, Florida, at Johnny Mangos Tiki Bar & Grill. He had been playing with his band, the Future Prezidents. It was reported that Jones had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with AT&T roadside assistance when he was approached by the police officer. He had also called FHP, Florida Highway Patrol's line for assistance, and AT&T #HELP multiple times trying to get help.

5000|$|On March 20, 2012, Martin family {{attorney}} Benjamin Crump {{revealed that}} Martin had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> {{with a friend}} moments before he was shot. This friend later identified Zimmerman as the aggressor in the deadly confrontation. At Zimmerman's trial, this friend testified {{that she did not}} know whether Zimmerman or Martin started the fight. During an ABC News exclusive report, Crump allowed portions of his recorded interview with Martin's friend to be aired. She said that Martin told her that a man was watching him from his vehicle while talking on the phone before the man started following Martin. Martin told his friend at one point that he had lost the man but the man suddenly appeared again. The friend, originally known only as [...] "Witness 8" [...] (now known as Rachel Jeantel), said that she told Martin to run to the townhouse where he was staying with his father and his father's fianc√©e. She then heard Martin say, [...] "What are you following me for?" [...] followed by a man's voice responding, [...] "What are you doing around here?" [...] She testified that she then heard what sounded like Martin's phone earpiece dropping into wet grass, and she heard the sound of Martin's voice saying [...] "Get off! Get off!" [...] The phone then went dead, she said: [...] "I was trying to say, 'Trayvon, Trayvon, what's going on'", Jeantel testified, [...] "I started hearing a little of Trayvon saying 'Get off, get off', when the phone went silent". She immediately attempted to call him back, but was unable to reach him. Crump stated that he would turn the information over to the Justice Department because [...] "the family does not trust the Sanford Police Department {{to have anything to do}} with the investigation." [...] Martin's friend was subsequently interviewed by state prosecutors on April 2, 2012. During her interview with the prosecutor, Martin's friend recounted her last phone call with Martin and added that Martin had described the man as [...] "crazy and creepy", watching him from a vehicle while the man was talking on the phone. She also testified that Martin referred to Zimmerman as a [...] "creepy ass cracker" [...] and [...] "nigga" [...] during their telephone conversation. On March 6, 2013, prosecutors admitted that she had lied under oath, when she falsely testified that she had been in the hospital on the day of Martin's funeral. She later admitted being embarrassed about lying and that she felt guilty about Martin's death and not doing more to help. Crump had refused to disclose the identity of Witness 8, stating that she was only 16, a minor at the time of the shooting, and asked the media to respect her privacy. It was subsequently revealed that she was actually 18 at the time when she said she was on the phone with Martin. According to the defense, her actual age had been edited out of previously released disclosures. Crump has denied intentionally giving any misleading statements about her age. Witness 8 was subsequently identified as Rachel Jeantel, a friend with whom Martin had attended elementary school and high school.|$|E
40|$|An event-related brain {{potentials}} {{experiment was}} carried out to examine the interplay of referential and structural factors during sentence processing in discourse. Subjects read (Dutch) sentences beginning like ‚ÄúDavid told the girl that ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù in short story contexts that had introduced either one or two referents for a critical singular noun phrase (‚Äúthe girl‚Äù). The waveforms showed that within 280 ms after onset of the critical noun the reader had already determined whether the noun phrase had a unique referent in earlier discourse. Furthermore, this referential information was immediately used in parsing {{the rest of the}} sentence, which was briefly ambiguous between a complement clause (‚Äú ‚Ä¶ that there would be some visitors‚Äù) and a relative clause (‚Äú ‚Ä¶ that had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to hang up‚Äù). A consistent pattern of P 600 /SPS effects elicited by various subsequent disambiguations revealed that a two-referent discourse context had led the parser to initially pursue the relative-clause alternative to a larger extent than a one-referent context. Together, the results suggest that during the processing of sentences in discourse, structural and referential sources of information interact on a word-by-word basis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many people {{report that}} they know in advance who <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> when <b>the</b> {{telephone}} is ringing. Sheldrake and Smart [1, 2] conducted experiments where participants had to determine which one of four possible callers <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while <b>the</b> telephone was still ringing. They report highly significant hit rates that cannot be explained by conven-tional theories. We attempted to replicate these findings {{in a series of}} three experiments. In study one, 21 participants were asked to iden-tify the callers of 20 phone calls each. Overall 26. 7 % were identified correctly (mean chance expectation 25 %, ns). In a second study a pre-selection test was introduced in a different experimental setting. Eight participants identified 30 % of the calls correctly (p =. 15). However one of the participants recognized 10 out of 20 calls correctly (p =. 014). We conducted a third study with only this participant. In an additional 60 trials she could identify 24 callers correctly (p =. 007). We conclude that we could not find any anomalous cognition effect in self-selected samples. But our data also strongly suggest that there are a few participants who are able to score reliably and repeatedly above chance.
