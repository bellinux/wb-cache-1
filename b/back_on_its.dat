5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, {{but it can}} use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it to cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when it was cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect to Ridge Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned slightly in the early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, moving it off CR148 and NY96 and onto a new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E

25|$|Around 1999 through 2001, as MTV aired fewer {{music videos}} {{throughout}} the day, it regularly aired compilation specials from its then 20-year history to look <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> roots. An all-encompassing special, MTV Uncensored, premiered in 1999 {{and was later}} released as a book.|$|E

50|$|The Yachats Ocean Road State Natural Site is a {{state park}} in {{southern}} Lincoln County, Oregon, {{in the town of}} Yachats. It is administered by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. It is located on the Pacific Ocean coast, adjacent to the Oregon Coast Highway and the mouth of the Yachats River. The park is open for day use only, and offers scenic driving on a 1 mi loop, and wildlife and surf viewing, but is <b>backed</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> landward side by low-intensity urban development.|$|R
5000|$|Teasdale Corrie (...) is a cirque about 2,000 ft east-west and 1,500 ft north-south, {{situated}} about 1,600 ft north-northeast of Cinder Spur. It is <b>backed</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> north flank by {{the high}} rocky crags of Dunikowski Ridge. The cirque, erroneously {{believed to be a}} volcanic vent, was exposed by recent glacial retreat. It contains a series of small lakes near the south margin, which are fed by seasonal meltwater. Named for Andrew Teasdale (b. 1966), British Antarctic Survey Field Assistant to Dr. J.L. Smellie {{for the duration of the}} January to April 1996 field season.|$|R
25|$|By March 1937, public {{exposure}} of the Remington Rand company's anti-union efforts had led to a significant deterioration in the firm's public support. The company did not cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> efforts, and rumor-mongering about plant closures and to demoralize workers was still effective. But public opinion and media opinion proved much harder to manipulate, and many elected officials were quietly withdrawing support for the company.|$|E

25|$|By early 1986 {{while the}} ABA was slowly getting <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> feet financially the USBA was {{starting}} to sink under the financial weight of poorly attended nationals {{and the loss of}} the core of their original management. Still, Mr. Hall approached the ABA with a plan to buy the ABA from the new owners Anderson and Vargas. This was quite strange since as mentioned the USBA was in worse shape financially than the ABA. On several occasions Mr. Hall approached Mr. Vargas and Mr. Anderson with buyout proposals. The talks came to naught.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} slowdown {{was triggered by}} weaker international commodities markets, coupled with the perverse effects of economic policies designed to fuel consumption. For instance, Petrobrás artificially depressed petrol prices to control inflation between 2011 and 2014, {{under the influence of}} the government, its major stockholder. This in turn depressed ethanol prices, making ethanol uneconomic to produce. The ethanol industry was forced to close plants and cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> investment in research. Petrobrás’ low pricing policy ended up eating into its own revenue, forcing it to cut back its own investment in oil and gas exploration.|$|E
25|$|The Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway {{had long}} been proposed, and it was finally opened on 2 November 1877, leaving the Charlestown line at Charlestown Junction. It had been {{conceived}} as an alternative route for ferry passengers crossing the Forth at Queensferry. It was promoted independently, and the North British Railway had promised financial support, but as it became increasingly likely that a Forth Bridge would soon be built, the NBR lost interest, and the little company had to fall <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> own resources. It used a Comely Park passenger station in Dunfermline (later renamed Dunfermline Lower in 1890) and Townhill Junction at Dunfermline faced eastwards.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1930s, NY40 {{began to}} be reduced in size. In the early 1940s, NY22 was realigned between Truthville and Whitehall to serve Comstock by way of NY40 and US4. As a result, NY40 was {{truncated}} south to its junction with NY149 in Hartford. The portion of NY40's routing between Hartford and West Granville was a sub-par road at the time (deemed as a second and third-class highway by map cartographer General Drafting), which led the state to place {{the end of the}} route in Hartford instead. In the late 1950s, NY40 was cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> southern end to begin at what had been the northern terminus of its overlap with US4 in North Greenbush.|$|E

25|$|Haemaphysalis leporispalustris has a {{complete}} lifecycle where it completes {{the stages of}} egg, larva, nymph, and adult. After emerging from the egg, the rabbit tick finds a host and takes a blood meal during each life stage. Once the tick feeds, it drops to the ground to molt and then climbs <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> host and takes another meal. The rabbit tick may change hosts throughout this process, especially if the host is not a hare or rabbit. This life cycle can {{take as long as}} a year, especially in climates that are cold. The population of H. leporispalustris peaks during the summer and declines during the winter. Development of the rabbit ticks often occur at quicker rates at higher temperatures than in colder temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The game {{continues}} {{in this manner}} until all the reds are potted and only the six colours are left on the table. At this point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valuable ball– that is, yellow first (two points), then green (three points), brown (four points), blue (five points), pink (six points) and finally black (seven points), with the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins. If the scores are equal when all the balls have been potted, the black is placed <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> spot as a tiebreaker. A player may also concede a frame while on strike {{if he or she}} thinks there are not enough points available on the table to beat the opponent's score. In professional snooker this is a common occurrence.|$|E

After the military government of Zia-ul-Haq went <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> promise to hold general elections in the country, leading political parties got together {{under the banner of}} the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD) for the purpose of holding general elections, restoration of fundamental rights of the citizens, removal of restrictions placed on the free functioning of the press and the establishment of an independent judiciary. He was arrested on numerous occasions for taking part in a movement launched by the political parties in February 1981 for the achievement of the above objectives.|$|E
