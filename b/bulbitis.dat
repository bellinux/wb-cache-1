40|$|We {{have studied}} the morphologic aspects of the {{duodenal}} bulb in relation to Helicobacter pylori infection in {{a large group of}} patients with endoscopically assessed duodenitis {{to learn more about the}} pathogenesis of nonspecific duodenitis (<b>bulbitis)</b> and to clarify the specific role of H. pylori. Eight duodenal biopsy specimens in the four quadrants of the first part of the bulb and four gastric antral biopsy specimens were taken in 208 patients. Specimens were fixed in formalin, or in glutaraldehyde, then slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Alcian-Giemsa, and with toluidine blue for semithin sections. Duodenal histology revealed inflammation in 155 (74. 5 %) and H. pylori-like bacterial bodies in 153 (73. 5 %) of the patients; H. pylori infection in the gastric antrum was diagnosed in 173 (83. 1 %) of the patients. Distinguishing histologic aspects appeared to be related to the presence of H. pylori infection. We believe that the present histologic grading of duodenitis correlates better with the natural history of H. pylori infection in the duodenal bulb, and better fits the requirements of a modern classification than the classification commonly used in duodenitis. We conclude that the term H. pylori-linked <b>bulbitis</b> should be adopted as the proper term to identify the particular kind of duodenitis predisposing to peptic ulcer...|$|E
40|$|The study {{involved}} 60 children with chronic gastroduodenal pathology and 30 apparently healthy children. The clinical manifestations of asthenovegetative syndrome, {{as well as}} functional parameters of the vegetative nervous system have been examined in all patients. It is found that children with chronic gastroduodenal pathology are characterized by marked disorders of autonomic regulation. These violations of vegetative homeostasis {{can be seen as}} one of the causes of progression of the pathological process in the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum. There has been proposed a method of correction of autonomic dysfunction in children with chronic gastroduodenal pathology after successful eradication of H. pylori infection by the use of physical therapy treatment — halotherapy in conjunction with the taking of herbal and vitamin sedative complex valerin cardio. We established a long positive effect in eliminating asthenovegetative syndrome and normalization of the functional state of the autonomic nervous system from the use of the proposed comprehensive course for correction of autonomic dysfunction in children with erosive <b>bulbitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background Diarrhea is a {{frequently}} occurring {{adverse event}} during treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} inhibitors (VEGFR TKIs) and is mostly accompanied by abdominal cramps, flatulence and pyrosis. These complaints impair {{quality of life and}} lead to dose reductions and treatment interruptions. It is hypothesized that the diarrhea might be due to ischemia in bowel mucosa or inflammation, but the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the diarrhea is still unknown. We aimed at exploring the mechanism for diarrhea in these patients by thorough endoscopic and histological assessment. Materials and methods Endoscopies of the upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 10 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who developed diarrhea during treatment with VEGFR TKIs were performed. Results Ten patients were included. The results showed endoscopically normal mucosa in the lower GI tract in seven patients without signs of ischemic colitis or inflammation. Gastroduodenoscopy revealed gastro-esophageal reflux disease, <b>bulbitis</b> and/or duodenitis with ulcers in eight patients. In three selected patients with bulbitis/duodenitis additional video capsule endoscopy was performed but revealed no additional intestinal abnormalities. Conclusion We observed frequent mucosal abnormalities in the upper GI tract in VEGFR TKI-treated mRCC patients with diarrhea. Although these abnormalities provide insufficient explanation for the occurrence of diarrhea, we suggest to perform routine upper GI endoscopy in VEGFR TKI-treated patients with GI complaints...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{systemic}} nature of Whipple's disease {{the clinical presentation}} may be highly variable. The diagnosis may therefore be unduly delayed. If untreated, Whipple's disease is still potentially lethal. In contrast, the endoscopic findings as they are observed in the postbulbar small intestine and the light microscopic picture of small intestinal biopsies are almost pathognomonic. Out {{of a group of}} 18 patients (14 male, 4 female, mean age = 45 yrs), 12 patients were diagnosed using upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy, while six patients were diagnosed only by a small intestinal capsule biopsy. The clinical history prior to diagnosis lasted from 1 m to 22 yrs (mean = 3 yrs 6 m) in the first group and from 4 yrs to 21 yrs (mean = 12 yrs 6 m) in the second group. The endoscopic findings at the time of diagnosis were: oesophagitis (1 / 12), erosive gastritis (4 / 12), atrophic gastritis (2 / 12), severe erosive <b>bulbitis</b> (3 / 10), pathognomonic post-bulbar duodenal lesions (9 / 12). In 20 % of the patients the endoscopic lesions had disappeared 6 m after antibiotics while the lesions had disappeared in all cases 9 m after therapy, despite the fact that PAS positive macrophages remained present in the endoscopic biopsies for years. All patients were treated with antibiotics (8 tetracycline alone, 4 tetracycline, streptomycin and penicillin, 6 trimethoprim). Five patients (27 %- 4 of the tetracycline group) relapsed within 2 to 20 yrs after the initial diagnosis. Three of these patients (3 / 5) had typical duodenal lesions on endoscopy at that time. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{the present}} study, we aimed to {{determine}} the etiologic and risk factors, treatment modalities and mortality rate of Non-Variceal Gastrointestinal System Bleeding (NVUGISB) cases. Material and Methods: 364 cases with NVUGISB who were referred to the Adana Numune Training Hospital, Emergency Department, between January 01 2010 and January 01 2011 and examined by endoscopy in the Gastroenterolgy Department were assessed retrospectively. Demographical characteristics, etiology, risk factors, treatment modalities and mortality were determined. Results: The {{mean age of the}} 364 patients was 60. 3 ± 18. 6) (18 - 96) years, of whom 237 (65. 1 %) were male and 127 (%) female. Of the patients, 136 (37. 3 %) were smokers, 18 (4. 9 %) drank alcohol, 96 (26. 3 %) had used acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), 63 (17. 3 %) had used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and 20 (5. 5 %) had used anticoagulant agents (17 patients were using NSAID at the same time). When the co-morbid diseases had been evaluated; hypertension (121 patients, 33. 2 %), coronary artery disease (87 patients, 23. 8 %), daibetes mellitus (52 patients, 14. 2 %), cerebrovascular accident history (33 patients, 9 %), and chronic obsturictive lung disease (14 patients, 3. 8 %) were determined. The first three most common causes of bleeding detected by endoscopy were duodenal ulcer 120 (33 %), gastric ulcer 90 (24. 7 %) and erosive <b>bulbitis</b> 37 (10. 2 %). Of all patients, 337 (92. 6 %) responded to medical therapy whereas 7 (1. 9 %) cases required surgical intervention. Twenty (5. 4 %) patients died. Conclusion: Duodenal ulcer was found as {{the most common cause of}} NVUGISB in this study. Bleeding is seen in the elderly more commonly and advanced age, co-morbid diseases and recurrent bleeding increase the mortality...|$|E
