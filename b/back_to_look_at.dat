25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{he had been}} {{planning}} to direct an epic movie named Megalopolis, {{a story about the}} aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, but after the city was hit by the real life disaster of September 11, the project was suddenly seen as being too sensitive. In 2007 he stated that [...] "I have abandoned that as of now. I plan to begin a process of making one personal movie after another and if something leads me <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that, which I'm sure it might, I'll see what makes sense to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|The old gentleman {{twisted his}} neck round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> [...] "Hughenden." [...] Then he came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kipps, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his mean, little {{garments}} with apoplectic intensity and blew at him {{by way of}} reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, drawing out her needle {{to the full}} length of her thread before she let her hand drop nervelessly at her side, and she fell <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> fixedly <b>at</b> Mrs. Saunders. [...] "If that's the way you feel!" ...|$|R
60|$|Angela {{stood with}} her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fire, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him; her hands were locked behind her.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} Indian {{pretended not to}} hear, then he turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, but without {{stopping}} his pony.|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless me, sir! Who'd ha' {{thought of}} seem' you at Friar's Oak? Why, Sir Charles, it brings old {{memories}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your face again." ...|$|E

60|$|With a shock {{she seemed}} to absorb his meaning. With another shock she raised her face--leaned <b>back</b> a little <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|While {{serving on}} the Governor’s staff, Smith was the Governor’s liaison to the Executive Branch Department Heads as well as New Hampshire’s Executive Council, where Smith {{assisted}} with appointments to Executive Branch Boards, Commissions, and Departments. Smith also served on the Interagency Commission to End Homelessness during {{his time in the}} Governor’s Office although he has said that he considers it a tragedy when [...] "government steps in the role of charitable organizations, of faith-based organizations, of community organizations that do such a great job of helping out people in the community. They've basically outsourced all of the roles that churches and charities used to do to the government and that's a real shame. We need <b>to</b> get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> our community organizations as a first line of defense and not the government.".|$|R

Both have pigtails and wear traditional Chinese clothing. Several banners written in Chinese hang {{on the wall behind}} them. A hearth is visible to the right. There is a rug on the floor...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, {{she must}} be a real fairy to do all that, mustn't she?" [...] said Johnny, leaning <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dear door behind which lay such {{happiness}} for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty wench you make, I {{swear by}} St. Valentine," [...] cried she, falling <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, and then coming forward to pin up {{something}} about my coif, with her white fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you suppose," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, bending {{forward to}} look at the ground, and then {{throwing}} his head <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling,--"what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bounderby {{was obliged}} to get up from table, and stand with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fire, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her; she was such an {{enhancement}} of his position.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{shoes are}} caked with chalk,' {{she said as}} they walked {{downwards}} again; and she drew <b>back</b> her dress <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. 'How can I get some of it cleared off?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll do," [...] he said. [...] "Give it <b>to</b> Smith. Come <b>back</b> <b>at</b> eight <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your proofs after I've {{done with}} them. Good interview! Good sketch! You'll do, Miss Wendermott." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} boy did run away," [...] said Snap {{as he and}} his friends turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the rest of the performance. [...] "I don't see why such a nice looking lad should travel with such a crowd as this." ...|$|E
60|$|Aghast at {{the light}} manner of her {{throwing}} her head <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it critically, Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing his own head back, and does so. Though he no more sees the portrait than if it were in China.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt her}} tears upon his cheek, her lips pressed to his. He held her there, but {{although}} {{his heart was}} beating with renewed hope, he said nothing for a time. When she stepped <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his face, however, the change was already there.|$|E
60|$|The {{family name}} again! How strangely she persisted in coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that! Horace <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her without answering, trying vainly to fathom what was passing in her mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I can't {{get into}} the Department without it, I'll go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> shinin' boots. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Sam Barney! He's always doin' that, an' what does he 'mount to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't told me anything." [...] And {{she turned}} her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>looking</b> away <b>at</b> the splendid view. [...] "I do love the scenery," [...] she added in a moment.|$|R
60|$|Her {{father said}} {{something}} about getting a cab, {{and trying to find}} a decent hotel in which to have luncheon. But she scarcely heard. She had just seen Luke disappearing through the crowd in company with Mr. Dobson, and he had not even glanced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} reloaded their pistols with all rapidity, {{and this was}} {{scarcely}} accomplished when they heard Cujo calling to them. Soon the native put in an appearance. When told {{of what had happened}} he would not believe the tale until he had gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dead snake.|$|E
60|$|NORA [with {{a sudden}} bitter flush]. I suppose that's all that brings him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> us, {{just to see}} how much WE'VE changed. Well, he can wait and see me be candlelight: I didn't come out to meet him: I'm going to walk to the Round Tower [going west across the hill].|$|E
60|$|Shefford's anticipation, however, was {{not soon}} realized. The fugitives {{traveled}} miles farther down Nonnezoshe Boco, {{and the only}} changes were that {{the walls of the}} lower gorge heightened and merged into those above and that these upper ones towered ever loftier. Shefford had to throw his head straight <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up <b>at</b> the rims, and the narrow strip of sky was now indeed a flowing stream of blue.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I suppose not," [...] I {{answered}} thoughtfully, [...] "but {{the more}} I think it over, the more I'm {{convinced that he}} took it. You know, we all went <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> field <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Jerseys, and all that time the coat was hanging there in the hall, and not a soul in the house. And {{it was just after}} we came back that I saw Ned scuttling down the lane so fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I got up {{and looked}} round. I could not see for certain, but it did look like a yacht, and I {{thought that it was}} {{about the size of the}} Osprey. Those two men were {{standing}} with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> us <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it through their glasses, and Carthew happened to turn round and saw me standing up, and at once said: 'You must go below. I believe that is a pirate chasing us.' ...|$|R
60|$|L. Neith did {{not wait}} {{to hear what he}} would say. When I turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, she was gone; and I only saw the level white cloud form itself again, close to the arch of the sun as it sank. And as the last edge of the sun disappeared, the form of Pthah faded into a mighty shadow, and so passed away.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{that is true}} too, mine honest friend," [...] sighed Dalgetty; [...] "yet if {{you knew}} but the value of Gustavus, and the things we two have done and {{suffered}} together--See, he turns <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me!--Be kind to him, my good breechless friend, and I will requite you well." [...] So saying, and withal sniffling a little to swallow his grief, he turned from the heart-rending spectacle in order to follow his guide.|$|E
60|$|He let go the bridle-rein, and {{the young}} lady rode on, after expressing her thanks to this {{singular}} being, {{as well as her}} surprise at the extraordinary nature of his address would permit, often turning <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Dwarf, who still remained at the door of his habitation, and watched her progress over the moor towards her father's castle of Ellieslaw, until the brow of the hill hid the party from his sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!--It is not {{probable}} thou ever wilt {{meet him}} at the table of the king, and, as for the field, as he is wont to go first, {{there will not be}} much temptation for him <b>to</b> turn <b>back</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> thee." ...|$|R
60|$|At Hiram's bidding black Dinah {{presently}} {{set some}} food before Sally {{and she fell}} to eating ravenously, almost ferociously. Meantime, while she ate, Hiram stood with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fire, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her face--that face once so round and rosy, now thin, pinched, haggard.|$|R
