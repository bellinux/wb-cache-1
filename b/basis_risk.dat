25|$|<b>Basis</b> <b>risk</b> {{is a major}} {{disadvantage}} of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. <b>Basis</b> <b>risk</b> {{is a direct result}} of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the <b>basis</b> <b>risk.</b> It is obvious that high <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize <b>basis</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Basis</b> <b>risk</b> {{in finance}} {{is the risk}} {{associated}} with imperfect hedging. It arises because {{of the difference between}} the price of the asset to be hedged and the price of the asset serving as the hedge, or because of a mismatch between the expiration date of the hedge asset and the actual selling date of the asset (calendar <b>basis</b> <b>risk),</b> or—as in energy—due to the difference in the location of the asset to be hedged and the asset serving as the hedge (locational <b>basis</b> <b>risk).</b>|$|E

40|$|The optimal crop revenue {{insurance}} contract is designed from {{recent developments in}} the theory of insurance economics under incomplete markets. The message is two-fold. Firstly, when the indemnity schedule is contingent on individual price and individual yield, the optimal contract depends only on the individual gross revenue. Secondly, this policy is shown to fail if the indemnity function is based on aggregate price and/or aggregate yield. A closed-form solution, in which <b>basis</b> <b>risks</b> are ignored, is proposed. It differs from actual revenue insurance programs proposed to the U. S. farmers. When insurance and capital markets are unbiased, it can be replicated with existing crop yield and revenue insurance policies and hedging contracts if the decision variables are not constrained. The impact of yield and price <b>basis</b> <b>risks</b> on the form of the optimal crop revenue {{insurance contract}} is examined and a closed-form solution is derived.

40|$|Although {{apparently}} {{preferred by}} farmers to direct hedging as a forward pricing mechanism, forward contracting has received little {{attention in the}} literature dealing with optimal forward pricing levels.

40|$|Weather {{derivatives}} enable policy-holders {{to safeguard}} themselves against extreme weather conditions. The effectiveness and {{the efficiency of}} the risk transfer is determined by the spatial <b>risk</b> <b>basis,</b> which is the stochastic dependency of the local weather outcome being insured and the outcome of the weather underlying the insurance instrument. The lower this <b>risk</b> <b>basis</b> the higher the effectiveness and {{the efficiency of the}} risk transfer. To study the spatial <b>risk</b> <b>basis</b> component in relation to the design and evaluation of a weather derivative contract to insure for heating degree-days (HDD), the historical temperature records were analyzed for five sites across the Netherlands. Sensitivity and specificity of the insurance instrument were used to quantify the potential spatial <b>risk</b> <b>basis.</b> Setting indemnification beyond a half standard deviation above the mean meant that between 60 % and 76 % of the indemnable HDD were classified correctly, while 82 % to 99 % of the non-indemnable HDD were classified correctly. These results indicate that the spatial <b>risk</b> <b>basis</b> is a major concern and that successful weather derivatives require the utilization of carefully selected weather data obtained from meteorological stations in close proximity to the area being insured...|$|R

50|$|Shape risk {{in finance}} {{is a type}} of <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> when hedging a load profile with {{standard}} hedging products having a lower granularity. In other words a commodity supplier wants to pre-purchase supplies for expected demand, but can only buy in fixed amounts that are bigger than the demand forecasted. This means it has to either over order or under order and make up the difference at the time of delivery at the spot price which might be much higher. Shape risk is also related to commodity risk.|$|E
50|$|Parametric Index: Many {{firms are}} uncomfortable with pure {{parametric}} bonds {{due to the lack}} of correlation with actual loss. For instance, a bond may pay out based on the wind speed at 50 of the 150 stations mentioned above, but the insurer loses very little money because a majority of their exposure is concentrated in other locations. Models can give an approximation of loss as a function of the speed at differing locations, which are then used to give a payout function for the bond. These function as hybrid Parametric / Modeled loss bonds, and have lowered <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> as well as more transparency.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{types of}} hedge funds {{make use of}} a {{modified}} form of arbitrage to profit. Rather than exploiting price differences between identical assets, they will purchase and sell securities, assets and derivatives with similar characteristics, and hedge any {{significant differences between the}} two assets. Any difference between the hedged positions represents any remaining risk (such as <b>basis</b> <b>risk)</b> plus profit; the belief is that there remains some difference which, even after hedging most risk, represents pure profit. For example, a fund may see that there is a substantial difference between U.S. dollar debt and local currency debt of another country, and enter into a series of matching trades (including currency swaps) to arbitrage the difference, while simultaneously entering into credit default swaps to protect against country risk and other types of specific risk.|$|E

Liability Side: These trades are aimed at corporate clients, such as midsize companies and banks {{looking for ways to}} service their loans. A typical trade involves the corporate client paying Fixed - Leverage*Index Performance and receiving Libor + Spread to service their loan. More recent trades entail the client paying a fixed rate below the fair interest rate swap and receiving an index designed to replicate the Libor (e.g. MMI by Deutsche Bank) - such a saving for the client (interest rate swap - fixed rate) is due to the lower forwards implied by the index (by construction) and the client bearing any potential <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> (difference between index and Libor).|$|E
50|$|Second, {{managers}} construct leveraged portfolios of AAA- or AA-rated tax-exempt {{municipal bonds}} with the duration risk hedged by shorting the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds. These corporate equivalents are typically {{interest rate swaps}} referencing Libor or SIFMAhttp://www.investinginbonds.com/story.asp?id=351 http://www.bondmarkets.com/story.asp?id=1157. The arbitrage manifests itself {{in the form of}} a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond. The steeper slope of the municipal yield curve allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense. Positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits. The bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instruments—municipal bonds and interest rate swaps—will correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in the same currency. Credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy. However, <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility. The end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates. Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.|$|E

In addition, {{the degree to which}} geographic <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> impedes effective hedging diminishes as the level of spatial aggregation increases. In fact, geographic <b>basis</b> <b>risk</b> is actually negative in the case most representative of a reinsurance hedge, and the reduction in risk from employing straightforward temperature derivatives is significant. Finally, precipitation hedges are found to introduce additional product <b>basis</b> <b>risk.</b> The findings may be of interest to decision makers considering using exchange traded weather derivatives to hedge agricultural production and insurance risk.
