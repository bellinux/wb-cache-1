50|$|In {{small-scale}} tests, cyclorotors {{achieved a}} higher power loading than comparable scale traditional rotors at the same disk loading. This is attributed to utilizing unsteady lift and consistent blade aerodynamic conditions. The rotational component of velocity on propellers increases from root to tip and requires blade chord, twist, airfoil, etc., to be varied along the blade. Since the cyclorotor blade span {{is parallel to the}} axis of rotation, each spanwise <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> operates at similar velocities and the entire blade can be optimized.|$|E
50|$|Cavitation {{can be used}} as an {{advantage}} in design of very high performance propellers, in form of the supercavitating propeller. In this case, the <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> is designed such that the pressure side stays wetted while the suction side is completely covered by cavitation vapor. Because the suction side is covered with vapor instead of water it encounters very low viscous friction, making the supercavitating (SC) propeller comparably efficient at high speed. The shaping of SC blade sections however, make it inefficient at low speeds, when the suction side of the blade is wetted. (See also fluid dynamics).|$|E

An irregular material or angled cut {{is also likely to}} apply much more torque to hollow-ground blades due to the [...] "lip" [...] formed {{on either side of the}} edge. More blade material can be included directly behind the cutting edge to reinforce it, but during sharpening some proportion of this material must be removed to reshape the edge, making the process more time-consuming. Also, any object being cut must be moved aside to make way for this wider <b>blade</b> <b>section,</b> and any force distributed to the grind surface reduces the pressure applied at the edge.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and modelling {{analysis of the}} unsteady aerody-namics, including dynamic stall, on sections of the NREL phase VI parked blade. The analysis is reduced to integrated normal force and moment coefficients. Considering that the NREL phase VI blade uses exclusively the S 809 aerofoil on its sections, experimen-tal sinusoidal oscillating tests of the 2 D S 809 profile {{have been used as}} baseline. First, the unsteady cases of the 2 D aerofoil are compared with the unsteady results of the 3 D parked <b>blade</b> <b>sections,</b> both experimental data undergoing the same pitching oscillations. Following, the unsteady cases of the parked <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> are presented together with the computations of CENER’s Beddoes-Leishman implementation. This method relies on the aerodynamic steady data: force and moment coefficients, as input to predict the unsteady cases. Thus, two approximations have been carried out for the computations, firstly using the steady data of the 2 D S 809 aerofoil as input, and secondly using the steady data of the corresponding NREL <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> to nourish the calculations. The encouraging results obtained with the last approximation show that the three-dimensionality of the dynamic stall on the parked blade is strongly managed by the steady behaviour of the <b>blade</b> <b>sections.</b> Nomenclature 2 D bi-dimensional 3 D three-dimensional AOA Angle of Attack, de...|$|R
40|$|Force {{measurements}} giving total thrust and torque, and {{propeller slip}} stream surveys giving differential thrust and torque were simultaneously made {{on each of}} six full-scale propellers in the 20 -foot propeller-research tunnel of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. They were adjustable-pitch metal propellers 9. 5 feet in diameter; three had modified Clark Y <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> and three had modified RAF- 6 <b>blade</b> <b>sections.</b> This report gives the differential thrust and torque and the variation caused by changing the propeller tip speed and the pitch setting. The total thrust and torque obtained from integration of the thrust and torque distribution curves are compared with those obtained by direct force measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The two {{effects are}} evidently {{correlated}} {{with a general}} increase of the thrust produced. If compared to a helicopter or any other propeller, {{it is evident that}} the same <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in a rotocycloid produces much more thrust at the same Reynolds number. This effect can be explained by considering the traditional behavior of a propeller.At low Reynolds numbers turbulence and laminar flow conditions can ever been reached. Considering a traditional wing profile it is evident that those conditions minimizes the speed differences between upper and lower face of the wing. It is then evident that both lift and stall speed are reduced. A consequence is a reduction of angle of attach at which stall conditions are reached. In this regime, conventional propellers and rotors must use larger blade area and rotate faster to achieve the same propulsive forces and lose more energy to blade drag. It is then evident that a cyclorotor is much more energy efficient than any other propeller. Actual cyclorotors bypass this problem by quickly increasing and then decreasing blade angle of attack, which temporarily delays stall and achieves a high lift coefficient. This unsteady lift makes cyclorotors more efficient at small scales, low velocities, and high altitudes than traditional propellers. It is otherwise evident that many living beings are still much more efficient, because they can change non only the pitch but also the shape of their wings, such as birds [...] and some insects or they can change the property of the boundary layer such as sharkskin.Some research tries to acquire the same level of efficiency of the natural examples of wings or surfaces. One direction is to introduce morphing wing concepts,. Another relates to the introduction of boundary layer control mechanisms, such as dielecric barrier discharge,.|$|E

40|$|Kuiper and Jessup (1993)) {{developed}} a design method for propellers in a wake. This method {{is based on}} the use of the Eppler foil design method. The optimized section is transformed into the three-dimensional propeller flow using the approach of the effective blade sections. Effective blade sections are two-dimensional sections in two-dimensional flow which have the same chordwise loading distribution as the three-dimensional blade sections of a propeller. However, the design procedure is laborious in two aspects: finding an optimum <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> using the Eppler program requires much skill of the designer, and transforming the two-dimensional <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> into a propeller <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in three-dimensional flow is complex.

40|$|A {{morphing}} {{trailing edge}} flap system for wind turbine blades The development of a morphing trailing edge system for wind turbines, also called a flap system, is presented. The functionality is simple as the flap deflection is controlled by pressurized air or a fluid {{in a number of}} voids in the flap made of an elastic material. It is thus a robust system as no mechanical or metal parts are used. The prototypes tested in the laboratory and on a <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in a wind tunnel in the period from 2007 - 2010 demonstrated the functionality and the aerodynamic performance of the flap concept. In a recent research and development project INDUFLAP from 2011 - 2014 the flap system has been further developed in corporation with the industrial partners Hydratech Industries (DK) and Rehau (DE). A new {{trailing edge flap}} design with spanwise voids (channels) and with a chord of 15 cm suitable for a 1 m chord <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> was developed. It was then manufactured by extrusion and glued together with a load carrying part with a connector part that allows an easy attachment on the <b>blade</b> <b>section.</b> After tests in the laboratory the flap was mounted on a 2 m long <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> mounted on a newly developed test rig.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} bend–twist {{coupling}} on the aeroelastic modal properties and stability limits of a two-dimensional <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in attached flow are investigated. Bend–twist coupling is {{introduced in the}} stiffness matrix of the structural <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> model. The structural model is coupled with an unsteady aerodynamic model in a linearised state–space formulation. A numerical study is performed using structural and aerodynamic parameters representative for wind turbine blades. It is shown that damping of the edgewise mode is primarily influenced {{by the work of}} the lift which is close to antiphase, making the stability of the mode sensitive to changes in the stiffness matrix. The aerodynamic forces increase the stiffness of the flapwise mode for flap–twist coupling to feather for downwind deflections. The stiffness reduces and damping increases for flap–twist to stall. Edge–twist coupling is prone to an edgetwist flutter instability at much lower inflow speeds than the uncoupled <b>blade</b> <b>section.</b> Flap–twist coupling results in a moderate reduction of the flutter speed for twist to feather and divergence for twist to stall...|$|E
