5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from spider <b>bites</b> in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider <b>bites</b> may represent incorrect diagnoses, {{which would make}} it more difficult to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine <b>bites.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapid}} rate of human {{expansion}} throughout the range of this species, <b>bites</b> are relatively common. Domestic animals and livestock are frequent victims. In Great Britain, most instances occur in March–October. In Sweden, there are about 1,300 <b>bites</b> a year, with an estimated 12% that require hospitalisation. At least eight different antivenoms are available against <b>bites</b> from this species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bites</b> {{from the}} cottonmouth are {{relatively}} frequent {{in the lower}} Mississippi River Valley and {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico, although fatalities are rare. Allen and Swindell (1948) compiled a record of A. piscivorus <b>bites</b> in Florida from newspaper accounts and data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics: 1934, eight <b>bites</b> and three fatalities (no further fatalities were recorded after this year); 1935, 10; 1936, 16; 1937, 7; 1938, 6; 1939, 5; 1940, 3; 1941, 6; 1942, 3; 1943, 1; 1944, 3; 1998, 1. Wright and Wright (1957) report having encountered these snakes on countless occasions, often almost stepping on them, but never being bitten. In addition, they heard of no reports of any <b>bites</b> among 400 cypress cutters in the Okefenokee Swamp during the entire summer of 1921. These accounts suggest that the species is not particularly aggressive.|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{applying}} map and filter functions on consecutive sublists {{instead of on}} individual list elements is discussed and developed in this paper. A non-empty, consecutive sublist is called a <b>bite.</b> Both map and filter functions accept a function parameter- a <b>bite</b> function- {{which is responsible for}} returning a prefix <b>bite</b> of a list. We develop families of <b>bite</b> functions via a collection of higher-order <b>bite</b> generators. On top of the <b>bite</b> generators, a number of <b>bite</b> mapping and <b>bite</b> filtering functions are introduced.

5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat <b>bites</b> can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the <b>bites</b> of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
5|$|In humans, <b>bites</b> {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, <b>bites</b> {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious <b>bites</b> cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of <b>bites</b> occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider <b>bites</b> a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, <b>bites</b> {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

50|$|They are {{aggressive}} when {{threatened and}} often turn to face what is threatening them {{instead of running}} away. They <b>bite</b> as a last resort. The <b>bite</b> is non lethal. The area around the <b>bite</b> will immediately turn red and swell up. The initial <b>bite</b> itself is painful though its relatively brief. There will be two red dots where the <b>bite</b> is and they can draw blood. The area can be itchy long after the <b>bite</b> and touching it can bring a dull pain. After 72 hours all signs of the <b>bite</b> have usually gone.|$|R
5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite {{marks on the}} face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the <b>bites</b> were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial <b>bites</b> are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the <b>bites</b> are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. <b>Bites</b> are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; <b>bites</b> are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. <b>Bites</b> have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Although rare, {{infection}} of humans by rabies from vampire bat <b>bites</b> has been documented; {{for example in}} 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat <b>bites.</b> Only 0.5% of bats carry rabies, {{and those that do}} may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly.|$|E

5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea <b>bites</b> cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The <b>bites</b> often appear in clusters or lines of two <b>bites,</b> and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} the peak isometric {{strength of the}} cervical flexors in deep <b>bite</b> temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) patients while <b>biting</b> in four <b>bite</b> positions: habitual occlusion, edge-to-edge, lateral shift and retruded. These values were then compared {{to those of the}} same subjects' <b>bite</b> positions elevated to a functional criterion (maximum isometric strength of the deltoid muscles). The mean height increase was 2. 4 mm with a range of 1. 5 - 3. 8 mm. Fifteen of eighteen deep <b>bite</b> subjects met an indusionary criterion, at least 13. 3 Newtons (N) stronger cervical muscle strength with mandible relaxed open than habitual <b>bite.</b> Peak strength <b>biting</b> edge-to-edge was significantly greater than <b>biting</b> in habitual occlusion. Strength was found to increase significantly when <b>biting</b> in each of four mandibular positions when the <b>bite</b> was elevated to the functional criterion. The greatest strength was obtained from elevated habitual and edge-to-edge positions. The findings are of clinical significance, suggesting that cervical muscle isometric strength is affected by <b>bite</b> position and vertical dimension of occlusion. The results suggest that when <b>biting,</b> individuals with deep <b>bite</b> may be functioning at about 60 % of their potential cervical flexor, isometric strength. The interaction between occlusal position, vertical dimension and cervical muscle function suggests a craniomandibular-cervical masticatory system...|$|R

5|$|One {{particularly}} infamous oceanic whitetip was {{implicated in}} several <b>bites</b> on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2010. This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark {{taken out of}} its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it bit the divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions {{in the hope of}} obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh <b>bites</b> resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the <b>bites</b> took place.|$|E

5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins, calcicludine, and fasciculins. The average venom yield per bite is 80mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981), while Minton (1974) gives it a range of 60–95mg (dry weight). The subcutaneous LD50 is 1.3mg/kg. The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0.45mg/kg. Like all other mamba species, the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba <b>bites.</b> However, patients bitten by the eastern green mamba develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild haemostatic disturbances (Warrell DA; MacKay et al. 1966). The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from <b>bites</b> on the fingers {{or the use of}} a tight tourniquet. This species has caused <b>bites</b> to humans and many of the <b>bites</b> attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities. The mortality rate of untreated <b>bites</b> is unknown but is thought to be quite high. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness, and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat, convulsions, rapid progression to respiratory paralysis. <b>Bites</b> that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal. Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes, in as little as 30 minutes, have been recorded for this species.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of whole-organism {{performance}} traits {{have been}} useful {{in studies of}} adaptation and phenotype– environment correlations. <b>Bite</b> force capacities may be tightly linked to both the type and magnitude of the ecological challenges of food acquisition, mate acquisition, and antipredation in vertebrates. In the present study, we present technical details on <b>bite</b> meters and on measuring <b>bite</b> forces. The ability to take reliable measurements depends on specific features of the measuring device and on where in the mouth the <b>bite</b> is applied. Using both previously available and original data, we demonstrate several ecologically and evolutionarily relevant features of <b>bite</b> force measurements. First, maximal <b>bite</b> forces are repeatable among individuals across all vertebrates studied to date. Second, in ectotherms such as lizards, maximal <b>bite</b> forces are affected by body temperature and motivational states. Third, <b>bite</b> forces are strongly correlated with head size and shape. Fourth, <b>bite</b> forces correlate with features of prey of vertebrates. Finally, <b>bite</b> forces are linked to male dominance and correlated with social-display structures. Thus, <b>bite</b> force performance measures {{can be used as}} ‘traits’, and thus be used in integrative studies at multiple levels of organismal biology. Accordingly, <b>bite</b> force data will help our understanding of the functions, capacities, and evolution of jaw–cranial musculoskeletal systems. Moreover, a plethora of opportunities exist for the use of <b>bite</b> force measurements, and if methods are carefully applied, several levels of organismal and ecological organization can be integrated to aid our understanding of the ecology and evolutio...|$|R
