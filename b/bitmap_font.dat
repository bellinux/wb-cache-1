25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the logo was {{simplified}} by removing computer ınc. from the logo. Motter Tektura {{was also used}} for the Apple II logo. This typeface has sometimes been mislabeled Cupertino, a similar <b>bitmap</b> <b>font</b> probably created to mimic Motter Tektura.|$|E
25|$|Espy Sans {{was later}} {{used as the}} font for Apple's eWorld online service in 1994. (eWorld also used the larger bold {{condensed}} <b>bitmap</b> <b>font</b> eWorld Tight for headlines. The metrics of eWorld Tight were based on Helvetica Ultra Compressed.) The iPod mini, released in 2004, also used Espy Sans.|$|E
25|$|The Macintosh, {{introduced}} in 1984, used a <b>bitmap</b> <b>font,</b> Chicago, designed by Susan Kare. In Mac OS 8, {{introduced in}} 1997, the system font of Mac OS {{was changed to}} Charcoal. Charcoal {{was designed to be}} easier to read than Chicago, while retaining similar metrics for backward compatibility with existing application software.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of outline fonts is that, unlike <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts,</b> {{they are a}} set of lines and curves instead of pixels; they can be scaled without causing pixellation. Therefore, outline font characters can be scaled to any size and otherwise transformed with more attractive results than <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts,</b> but require considerably more processing and may yield undesirable rendering, depending on the font, rendering software, and output size. Even so, outline fonts can be transformed into <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> beforehand if necessary. The converse transformation is considerably harder, since <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> requires heuristic algorithm to guess and approximate the corresponding curves if the pixels do not make a straight line.|$|R
50|$|Some older {{versions}} of dvips with embedded <b>bitmapped</b> <b>fonts,</b> which represented letters and symbols as pictures {{at a fixed}} resolution (for instance, at 300 dpi). When such files are printed on newer devices (some with resolution of 1200 dpi), {{the letters of the}} files that have <b>bitmapped</b> <b>fonts</b> display a remarkably low quality, with jagged lines on curves and diagonals. One solution to this problem is to substitute the <b>bitmapped</b> <b>fonts</b> with scalable fonts (known among PostScript users as Type 1 fonts).|$|R
50|$|<b>Bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> {{are used}} in the Linux console, the Windows {{recovery}} console, and embedded systems. Older dot matrix printers used bitmap fonts; often stored in the memory of the printer and addressed by the computer's print driver. <b>Bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> may be used in cross-stitch.|$|R
25|$|Digital type {{became the}} {{dominant}} form of {{type in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s. Digital fonts store the image of each character either as a bitmap in a <b>bitmap</b> <b>font,</b> or by mathematical description of lines and curves in an outline font, also called a vector font. Bitmap fonts were more commonly used in the earlier stages of digital type, and are rarely used today.|$|E
25|$|Apple's {{earliest}} computers, {{along with}} other personal computers of the period, had extremely limited graphical capabilities and could originally display only uppercase ASCII using a set <b>bitmap</b> <b>font.</b> The IIc and Enhanced Apple IIe expanded on this, supporting 40 or 80 columns of text and an extended character set called MouseText. It was used to simulate simple graphical user interfaces, similar {{to the use of}} ANSI X3.64.|$|E
25|$|In systems {{prior to}} PowerPC G3-based systems, {{significant}} {{parts of the}} system are stored in physical ROM on the motherboard. The initial purpose {{of this is to}} avoid using up the limited storage of floppy disks on system support, given that the early Macs have no hard disk (only one model of Mac was ever actually bootable using the ROM alone, the 1991 Mac Classic model). This architecture also allows for a completely graphical OS interface at the lowest level without the need for a text-only console or command-line mode: boot time errors, such as finding no functioning disk drives, are communicated to the user graphically, usually with an icon or the distinctive Chicago <b>bitmap</b> <b>font</b> and a Chime of Death or a series of beeps. This is in contrast to MS-DOS and CP/M computers of the time, which display such messages in a mono-spaced font on a black background, and require the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse, for input. To provide such niceties at a low level, early Mac OS depends on core system software in ROM on the motherboard, which also ensure that only Apple computers or licensed clones (with the copyright-protected ROMs from Apple) can run Mac OS.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> look best {{at their}} native pixel size. Some systems using <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> can create some font {{variants}} algorithmically. For example, the original Apple Macintosh computer could produce bold by widening vertical strokes and oblique by shearing the image. At non-native sizes, many text rendering systems perform nearest-neighbor resampling, introducing rough jagged edges. More advanced systems perform anti-aliasing on <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts</b> whose size {{does not match}} the size that the application requests. This technique works well for making the font smaller but not as well for increasing the size, as it tends to blur the edges. Some graphics systems that use <b>bitmap</b> <b>fonts,</b> especially those of emulators, apply curve-sensitive nonlinear resampling algorithms such as 2xSaI or hq3x on <b>fonts</b> and other <b>bitmaps,</b> which avoids blurring the font while introducing little objectionable distortion at moderate increases in size.|$|R

50|$|In December 1984, James R. Von Ehr II {{founded the}} Altsys Corporation to develop {{graphics}} applications for personal computers. The first foray by Altsys into commercial font editing software was a <b>bitmap</b> <b>font</b> editor called Fontastic, {{released in the}} mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh. The program, developed by Altsys founder Von Ehr, was able to edit the native <b>bitmap</b> <b>font</b> format of the Mac.
