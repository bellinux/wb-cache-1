5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, <b>but</b> <b>took</b> no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E

5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, <b>but</b> <b>took</b> seven hours to subdue the prisoners, {{with the last}} of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, <b>but</b> <b>took</b> the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final match. However, he was not {{prominent}} in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among the frontline bowlers who played in four or more Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. Johnson had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, <b>but</b> <b>took</b> five catches in the slips.|$|E

Bosanquet's record earned him selection for the Gentlemen against the Players; in this prestigious match he took only one wicket but scored 61 runs.

5|$|By 1972, Pink Floyd had {{recorded}} the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On {{the back of}} Mores success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived. The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, The Dark Side of the Moon, including some basic recording and live performances, <b>but</b> <b>took</b> two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, {{either side of a}} Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was then mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of the war, Johnson's {{squadron}} flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson's squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, <b>but</b> <b>took</b> evasive action and retreated back to German held territory but Johnson's pilots shot it down. On another occasion, Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson's unit escorted them to an RAF airfield.|$|E
