50|$|In addition, NuBus was {{agnostic}} {{about the}} processor itself. Most buses {{up to this}} point conformed to the signalling and data standards of the machine they were plugged into (being <b>big</b> or little <b>endian</b> for instance). NuBus made no such assumptions, which meant that any NuBus card could be plugged into any NuBus machine, as long as there was an appropriate device driver.|$|R

50|$|The serial links support 1 Mbyte/s bit-serial {{communication}} that allows coordinated register-register communication between processors. Each processor {{has its own}} local memory, implemented in DRAM. No internal memory is included on the processors. Microcoded instruction decode is used.The 32 PEs on a chip are clustered into two groups sharing a common memory interface, or M-machine, for access. A global scoreboard keeps track of memory and register usage. The path to memory is 16 bits wide. Both <b>big</b> and little <b>endian</b> formats are supported.

5000|$|An {{architecture}} may use [...] "big" [...] or [...] "little" [...] endianness, or both, or be configurable to use either. Little endian processors order bytes {{in memory}} {{with the least}} significant byte of a multi-byte value in the lowest-numbered memory location. <b>Big</b> <b>endian</b> architectures instead order them with the most significant byte at the lowest-numbered address. The x86 architecture {{as well as several}} 8-bit architectures are little endian. Most RISC architectures (SPARC, Power, PowerPC, MIPS) were originally <b>big</b> <b>endian</b> (ARM was little endian), but many (including ARM) are now configurable.|$|E
50|$|Addresses {{refer to}} bytes with <b>big</b> <b>endian</b> {{ordering}} convention. The TMS9900 {{is a classic}} 16 bit machine with an address space of 216 bytes (65,536 bytes or 32,768 words).|$|E

5000|$|Since the byte {{order for}} data {{protocols}} {{in the context}} of the internet was generally defined as <b>big</b> <b>endian</b> and called simply network byte order, as stated (among others) by the deprecated RFC 1700, the deprecated RFC 1890 did not explicitly define the endianness of the predecessor of G.726, G.721, in RTP either. Instead of that, in the deprecated RFC 1890, the use of <b>big</b> <b>endian</b> by the term network byte order was generally stated for all mentioned codecs again: [...] "For multi-octet encodings, octets are transmitted in network byte order (i.e., most significant octet first)."

5000|$|All packets {{sent over}} OSCAR are {{encapsulated}} {{in the same}} manner. All 16-bit integers sent over the network are unsigned, and <b>big</b> <b>endian</b> (see Endianness.) This {{is the same for}} 32-bit integers, and 8-bit integers (or bytes.) ...|$|E

50|$|Numeric {{values in}} VOS are always <b>big</b> <b>endian,</b> {{regardless}} of the endianness of the underlying hardware platform. On little endian servers with x86 processors, the compilers do a byte swap before reading or writing values to memory to transform the data to or from the native little endian format.|$|E
5000|$|A TFM file {{is broken}} down {{into a series of}} four-byte words, which can contain data fields of various lengths.

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the real-time control systems used in aeronautics employ [...] "big endian" [...] processor architectures.

50|$|Numeric {{fields are}} stored in <b>big</b> <b>endian</b> byte order, the native byte order of the PA-RISC, with most being 32-bit wide. Character strings are {{generally}} encoded in 8-bit ASCII and both prefixed with a 32-bit length indicator {{as well as being}} null-terminated, like C strings. Most records are word-aligned (start at even-byte offsets) with padding introduced as necessary.|$|E
50|$|It {{provides}} a means for transforming data between different architectures and protocols, such as <b>Big</b> <b>Endian</b> to Little Endian, or EBCDIC to ASCII.
