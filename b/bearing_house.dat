50|$|Initially, {{the area}} was sparsely populated, but after the second siege of Vienna (1683), it was more densely settled, {{primarily}} along Alser Straße. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, the population of Slovenes, Croats and Slovaks previously residing in Spittelberg were forcibly moved to the so-called Krowotendörfl (literally: 'village of Croats') north of Alser Straße. In 1753, the Alser Kaserne barracks were erected (demolished in 1912). Traditionally, many poorhouses and hospitals were located in Alservorstadt, and their high mortality rate required many cemeteries, such as the Neuer Schottenfriedhof cemetery (documented up to 1784). 1784 also saw the inauguration of the Vienna General Hospital, a then public hospital regarded as modern with respect to contemporary standards. The same period also saw the establishment of the Findelhaus, a <b>bearing</b> <b>house,</b> and the k.k. Gewehrfabrik which became a substantial rifle supplier for the Austrian Army.From 1821 to 1862, the municipality of Alservorstadt maintained a town hall in a two-storey, baroque building located at 8., Laudongasse 5. In 1850, Alservorstadt was officially integrated into the city of Vienna as part of the Alsergrund district. In 1861, the southern part was transferred to the smaller district of Josefstadt.|$|E

Increase in mechanical vibration values depending on the value of nominal thickness of splinter was observed during changing technological parameters of the drilling process as a consequence of rotation speed of the motor. The vibration acceleration amplitude course changes depending on the frequencies are evaluated together for 400, 800 and 1200 motor r/min. A piezoelectric sensor of the type 4507 B- 004 from the Brüel & Kjaer Company was used for monitoring the frequency analysis of the vibration, which was attached to the <b>bearing</b> <b>house</b> of the lathe TOS SV 18 RB. The vibration signal measured during the processing and during the time period is transformed through the means of a quick Fourier transformation to the frequency spectrum in the range of 3. 0 – 10. 0 [*]kHz. Measured values of vibration acceleration amplitude were processed and evaluated by the SignalExpress software. Graphical abstract Unwanted vibration in machine tools like lathe {{is one of the main}} problems as it affects the quality of the machined parts and tool life and creates noise during machining operation. Bearings are of paramount importance to almost all forms of rotating machinery and are the most common among machine elements.

Especially, the MEMS accelerometer can be mounted directly on a rotating shaft, which has the potential to capture the dynamics of the shaft more accurately and hence to achieve high monitoring performance. In this paper a systematic comparison of shaft misalignment detection is conducted, based on a bearing test rig, between the wireless sensor measurement scheme and other three common sensors: a laser vibrometer, an accelerometer and a shaft encoder. These four sensors are used to measure simultaneously the dynamic responses: Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) from the encoder, <b>bearing</b> <b>house</b> acceleration from the accelerometer, shaft displacements from the laser vibrometer and angular acceleration from the wireless sensor.

To analyze gear box efficiency, a back-to-back test-rig with mechanically closed energy loop was developed according to the FZG principle. An electrical motor with adjustable flange coupling was integrated in the loop. The efficiency of the gears can be determined very accurately by measuring the motor power {{that is needed to}} drive the closed loop as a function of speed, locked in torque, type of oil and oil immersion depth. The second test-rig consists of a driven shaft with adjustable motor position and excited <b>bearing</b> <b>house.</b> This enables the analysis of vibrations resulting from bearing defects and shaft misalignment. Bearings with three fault patterns (ball, inner ring or outer ring defect) are analyzed under radial loading conditions and broad speed range (10 - 3000 rpm). Moreover, single and double cardanic joints and torsionally flexible jaw type couplings are tested under radial and angular shaft misalignment. The third test rig is a closed electromechanical loop used for fault diagnosis of gear mesh defects under constant or variable torque loading.

40|$|The variational {{inequality}} principle {{originated from}} {{a class of}} elliptic obstacle problem applied {{to the prediction of}} cavitation in the fluid film bearing and squeeze film damper, and the finite element method has been used to discretize the resulting elliptic variational inequality. Based on the Taylor series, the Jacobian matrix of film force with respect to location and velocity of journal and <b>bearing</b> <b>house</b> has been constructed, and it can be obtained from resolving a set of partial differential equations. An iteration algorithm based on the complementary property of the elliptic variational inequality has been also constructed to determine the rupture boundary, namely, free boundary. On the basis of the fixed-interface eigen-mode and quasi-static modes, a method is constructed to condense the system. Furthermore, the Poincare map is introduced to discretize the continuous flow, and the fixed point in the Poincare section is the periodic solution and a method for calculating the Floquet multipliers is also constructed by resolving two sets of secondary ordinary differential equations in the form of matrix. The long-term dynamic behaviors and bifurcation of imbalance response of a rotor dynamic system, amounted in finite length fluid film bearings with squeeze film dampers in series, has been investigated based on the computation method mentioned above. In addition to the above, the influence of the truncation of mode series on the accuracy of solution in nonlinear dynamic system has been investigated tentatively by the comparison between mode series truncations, and the result obtained from the condensation method has been compared with the result obtained from the direct integration.

40|$|Since {{middle of}} 1990 ´s pod {{propulsion}} in marine application have become common. There are mainly two constructors on the pod market. ABB {{is the biggest}} producer and have two types of pods, Azipod (5 - 30 MW) and Compact (0. 4 - 5 MW). Rolls-Royce (RR) is the second biggest company on the market, producing a pod called Mermaid (5 - 25 MW). The electrical system in pod propulsion normally consists of a transformer, a frequency converter and an electric motor. The transformer is used to divide the system into several parts {{in order to obtain}} different voltage levels but also for phase shifting. The purpose of the frequency converter is to control the speed and torque of the motor by changing constant frequency into variable frequency. The electric motor is used for conversion from electrical to mechanical power. In all applications with electric motors, current that travel from the shaft trough the bearings is a phenomena. There are two categories of causes of bearing current, a classical problem where low frequency current and a newer high frequency current problem that occur when using high switching control. To mitigate currents in bearings grounding of the shaft and insulation of the bearings is used. Azipod has a synchronous motor controlled by a cyclo converter and dry-type transformer. The non-drive end bearing is insulated and the shaft is grounded to earth in drive end and to the <b>bearing</b> <b>house</b> in non-drive end. Mermaid has a dry type transformer and a synchronous motor controlled of a load commutated inverter (LCI). Both bearings are insulated and the shaft is grounded in drive-end.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 It {{should be}} an {{objective}} to predict <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> vibrations by means of finite element methods and avoid them in the design phase rather than to go in for corrective actions on the test bed or in the field. Bearing housing vibrations due to an excitation by the impeller vanes occur, {{if there is a}} natural frequency of the pump. The finite element method is a useful tool to determine natural frequencies but it is still necessary to compare them with real tested structures. Especially the connecting stiffness between different parts in a structure and the boundary conditions has often to be estimated. Within this paper the determination of <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> frequencies has been undertaken systematically from a simple test device to a complete barrel pump. With the test device several influences onto the natural frequencies were studied, such as internal pressure, bolting, seals, and foundation stiffness. It is demonstrated that with appropriate modeling and assumptions the measured frequencies can be accurately met by means of finite elements. The rules observed were applied to full 3 -D model of a barrel pump. The natural frequencies were determined by means of this finite element model. An experimental modal analysis was carried out on the real structure of this pump assembly. At several locations of the surface transducers were placed and the response due to the hammer test was identified in terms of frequencies and modal shapes. This result was correlated with the finite element results to update the finite element model and obtain better congruence between experiment and analysis. The results were promising, especially for the most important <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> natural frequency, where the differences between analysis and test were very low.
