40|$|Abstract. Software systems must adapt their {{behavior}} {{in response to}} changes in the environment or in the requirements they are supposed to meet. Despite <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> could be modeled with great detail at design time, anticipating all possible adaptations is not always feasible. To address this problem the requirements model of the system, which also includes the <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities,</b> is conceived as a runtime entity. This way, it is possible to trace requirements/adaptation changes and propagate them onto the application instances. This paper leverages the FLAGS [1] methodology, which provides a goal model to represent adaptations and a runtime infrastructure to manage requirements@runtime.

We demonstrate that partial decision-making is not only attainable, but also introduces advantages with respect to a system in which these conversion modules are not capable of providing additional decisions. This means that transferring decisions from the multi-step multimedia adaptation planner to the pluggable conversion modules increases the flexibility of the adaptation. Moreover, by allowing conversion modules to be only partially described, the range of problems that these modules can address increases, while significantly decreasing both the description length of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> and the planning decision time.

40|$|Abstract—Worldwide collaborations {{involving}} huge {{data transfer}} over optical networks are forming at increasing pace. Such worldwide connections may traverse through multiple domains that are managed by different network administrators. Due {{to the absence}} of optical network equipment standardization between network administrators, technology incompatibilities may prevent direct communication between domains. However, domains with technology <b>adaptation</b> <b>capability</b> can lift the technology continuity restriction in establishing paths between incompatible domains. Within this context, we address two problems, namely: (1) how to model the technology incompatibilities of multidomain networks, and (2) how to route traffic optimally in the multi-domain network model. We include the information of the supported technologies and <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> of each domain and inter-domain link in our model. We subsequently propose technology-aware routing algorithms for finding shortest feasible paths in a multi-domain network.

Computer grids {{typically}} combine computational {{resources of}} diverse types, such as storage, processing and scientific instruments, spread across different administrative domains.

With {{the aim of}} dynamically generating adaptive ecourses, we have developed the TANGOW system which, starting from the course components and their <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> (specified independently {{and out of the}} adaptation engine), generates different courses for students with different profiles, supporting several adaptation strategies. An integral part of any adaptive hypermedia system is the set of authoring tools to specify the course components and their <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Without adequate tool support, authors may feel that it is “not worth the effort ” to add adaptation to their courses. However, the development of this type of tools is not an easy task. The main goal of our authoring and visualization tools is to provide a simple interface to create such courses. This demo would demonstrate i) the dynamic generation of tailored e-courses that include individual and collaborative activities and ii) the use of authoring tools for the creation of such courses. 1 The Delivery Syste...|$|R

However, the application of this method to the zerosequence component of four-wire three-phase converters is not straight forward. As {{there is only one}} signal in the zerosequence component, a quadrature signal is always created in order to have the two components of a space vector, similarly to the three-phase case using Park s Transformation. This paper presents an alternative control method based on multiple reference frames for tracking or rejecting periodic signals applied to the control of the zero-sequence current of a four-wire shunt active power filter. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach can be used without creating the quadrature signal of the error, whilst maintaining an intrinsic <b>adaptation</b> <b>capability</b> to grid-frequency variations. The main contributions of this paper are validated using a laboratory prototype. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Research and educational networks typically are state-of-the-art networks that facilitate such high-speed user-created network connections, possibly spanning multiple domains.

40|$|Resource {{allocation}} for high-performance real-time applications {{is challenging}} {{due to the}} applications' data-dependent nature, dynamic changes in their external environment, and limited resource availability in their target embedded system platforms.

By taking advantage of an application's <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities,</b> ARA eliminates the need for over-sizing real-time systems to meet worst-case application needs. This paper proposes a model for describing an application's <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> and the runtime variation of its resource needs.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{investigate}} how the quality of family environment {{is related to the}} child&# 39;s <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Child&# 39;s <b>adaptation</b> was evaluated with a special assessment called SPP- 3 (Systematic Psychological Assessment of a 3 -year Old Child), that screens the population of 3 -year olds to look for inadequate adaptation patterns. I assumed that in families where parents have higher education and where the environment is more stimulating children will show more effective and adaptive behaviour. Seventy-five children and parents who attended the psychological assessment in their regional hospitals first concluded the psychological examination (SPP- 3) and then filled-in two questionnaires: The Family Environment Questionnaire (Zupančič, Podlesek, & Kavčič, 2004) and The Home Literacy Environment Questionnaire (Marjanovič Umek, Podlesek, & Fekonja, 2005). The results showed that quality of family environment does effect the child&# 39;s adaptive capabilities and is associated with parental level of education. Of special importance for the child&# 39;s socialization is the parents&# 39; ability to use effective control (to have consistent and clear demands). Hypothesis that the level of parental education affects the child&# 39;s <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> was not confirmed. Perhaps the parents&# 39; relations with the child are of greater importance, and these are probably not related to parents&# 39; education. The results show that child&# 39;s <b>adaptation</b> <b>capabilities</b> are associated with parenting methods, so preventive psychological counselling may also be used to help parents choose more effective methods in order to allow the child to develop effective adaptive behaviour...|$|R
