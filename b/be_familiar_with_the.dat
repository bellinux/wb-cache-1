5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter {{wanted to}} tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film.

5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E

Recreational divers are expected to <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> standard set of hand signals used by their certification agency, and these have to a large extent been standardized internationally and are taught on entry level diving courses. A few additional specialised hand signals are commonly used by technical divers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{children}} are initially misdiagnosed as having ataxic cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of A-T {{may not be}} made until the preschool years when the neurologic symptoms of impaired gait, hand coordination, speech and eye movement appear or worsen, and the telangiectasia first appear. Because A-T is so rare, doctors may not <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symptoms, or methods of making a diagnosis. The late appearance of telangiectasia may be a barrier to the diagnosis. It may take some time before doctors consider A-T as a possibility because of the early stability of symptoms and signs.|$|E

25|$|In the {{political}} life of Spain, the king would already <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> various {{political leaders in}} a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a General Election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, {{the political}} leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreements before their meeting with the king. Once appointed, the President of the Government forms an administration whose ministers are appointed and removed by the king on the president's advice. No minister may take up his appointment until after they give their oath of office to obey the constitution with loyalty to the king.|$|E

25|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen. There are significant differences in {{the detection}} of ANA by immunofluorescence and different ELISA kits and there is only a marginal agreement between these. A clinician must <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
