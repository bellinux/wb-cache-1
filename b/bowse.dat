6000|$|So {{the captain}} now {{appeared}} to think, too, for {{no sooner had}} he delivered himself of the important monosyllable, than he left the widow's side, and began to pace the deck, {{as it might be}} to moderate his own ardour. As for Rose, she blushed, if her more practised aunt did not; while Harry Mulford laughed heartily, taking good care, however, not to be heard. The man at the wheel turned the tobacco again, gave his trousers another hitch, and wondered anew whither the skipper was bound. But the drollest manifestation of surprise came from Josh, the steward, who was passing along the lee-side of the quarter-deck, with a tea-pot in his hand, when the energetic manner of the captain sent the words [...] "friendship is n't love" [...] to his ears. This induced him to stop for a single instant, and to cast a wondering glance behind him; after which he moved on toward the galley, mumbling as he went--"Lub! what he want of lub, or what lub want of him! Well, I do t'ink Captain Spike <b>bowse</b> his jib out pretty 'arly dis mornin'." ...|$|E

Bishop Hamilton appointed Rev. J. A. Tancock as rector in February 1888 and the first service in the newly formed parish was held in July 1888 in the newly dedicated church. The service was held in what was known as Moorlandâ€™s Hall on the south east corner of Bank Street and Fourth Avenue on January 13, 1888 and attended by 15 persons: Mrs. Clara M. Clarke & Miss E.L. Hammon, Mrs. J. P. Enston, Mrs. C. X. <b>Bowse,</b> Miss Emma Coyles, Master George Coyles and Mrs. H. X. Marshall and Mrs. Joseph Roy. The first hymn sung was [...] "The Church's One Foundation". Miss E.L. Hammon was on the organ and the singing was by Mrs. Clara M. Clarke.

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 9 - 10). Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, from a recirculation aquaculture {{venture in}} the Northeastern United States {{were presented to}} Cornell's Fish Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. The chief complaint was of chronic, low-level tilapia mortalities. Histopathological diagnosis of renal tissue revealed moderate to severe kidney disease due to the precipitation of calcium salts from the short-term use of calcium carbonate to maintain alkalinity in the production system water. Calcium carbonate had been substituted for sodium bicarbonate (the normal industry practice) due to economic considerations. A recommendation was made {{to return to the}} use of sodium bicarbonate for water quality maintenance. This change was instituted and levels of nephrocalcinosis in the aquaculture facility's Nile tilapia dropped significantly. Advisor: Dr. Paul <b>Bowse...</b>|$|E
6000|$|When {{the men had}} dined, Spike brought one of his {{purchases}} to the windlass, and {{the other}} to the capstan, though not until each was <b>bowsed</b> taut by hand; a few minutes having brought the strain so far on everything, as to enable a seaman, like Spike, to form some judgment of the likelihood that his preventers and purchases would stand. Some changes were found necessary to equalize the strain, but, on the whole, the captain was satisfied with his work, and the crew were soon ordered to [...] "heave-away; the windlass best." ...|$|R

"That's just it, Admiral Blue," [...] {{returned}} the steward, in passing good-humour, though still sober enough {{to maintain the}} decencies, after his own fashion; [...] "that's just it, your honour. They've passed the word below to let the lights stand for further orders, and have turned the hands up for a frolic. Such ale as they has, stowed in the lower hold of this house, like leaguers in the ground-tier, it does a body's heart good to conter'plate. All hands is <b>bowsing</b> out their jibs on it, sir, and the old Hall will soon be carrying as much sail as she can stagger under. It's nothing but loose-away and sheet-home." ...|$|R

There's for'ard and back-stays, and shrouds, all's one as aboard here; the only {{difference}} is that the lanyards are a little looser, so as to give a man more play for his head, than it might be safe to give to a mast. When a fellow makes a bow, why he only comes up a little aft, and <b>bowses</b> on the fore-stay, and now and then you falls in with a chap that is stayed altogether too far for'ard, or who's got a list perhaps from having the shrouds set up too taut to port or to starboard." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{only time}} when our men could work at even their awning, were two hours {{early in the}} morning, and as many after the sun had got very low, or had {{absolutely}} set. Eight holes had to be drilled into the lava, {{to a depth of}} two feet each. Gunpowder, in very small quantities, was used, or these holes could not have been made in a twelvemonth. But by drilling with a crowbar a foot or two into the rock, and charging the cavity with a very small portion of powder, the lava was cracked, when the stones rather easily were raised by means of the picks and crows. Some idea may be formed of the amount of labour that was expended on this, {{the first step in the}} new task, by the circumstance that a month was passed in setting those eight awning-posts alone. When up, however, they perfectly answered the purpose, everything having been done in a thorough, seaman-like manner. At the top of each post, itself a portion of solid spar, a watch-tackle was lashed, by means of which the sail was <b>bowsed</b> up to its place. To prevent the bagging unavoidable, in an awning of that size, several uprights were set in the centre, on end, answering their purpose sufficiently without boring into the rocks.|$|R

6000|$|That {{afternoon}} it cleared off, and {{we found}} a pilot lying a little outside of us. About sunset a man-of-war's cutter came alongside, and Mr. Irish was ordered to muster the crew. The English lieutenant, who was tolerably <b>bowsed</b> up, took his seat behind the cabin table, while the men came down, {{and stood in the}} companion-way passage, to be overhauled. Most of the foreigners had gone in the boat, but two of the Americans that remained were uncommonly fine-looking men, and were both prime seamen. One, whose name was Thomas Cook, was a six-footer, and had the air of a thorough sea-dog. He filled the lieutenant's eye mightily, and Cook was very coolly told to gather his dunnage, as he was wanted. Cook pointed to his protection, but the lieutenant answered--"Oh! these things are nothing--anybody can have one for two dollars, in New York. You are an Englishman, and the King has need of your services." [...] Cook now took out of his pocket a certificate, that was signed by Sir John Beresford, stating that Thomas Cook had been discharged from His Maj. Ship Cambrian, after a pretty long service in her, because he had satisfactorily proved that he was a native-born American. The lieutenant could not very well dishonour this document, and he reluctantly let Cook go, keeping his protection, however. He next selected Isaac Gaines, a native New Yorker, a man whose father and friends were known to the captain. But Gaines had no discharge like that of Cook's, and the poor fellow was obliged to rowse up his chest and get into the cutter. This he did with tears in his eyes, and to the regret of all on board, he being one of the best men in the ship. We asked the boat's crew to what vessel they belonged, and they gave us the name of a sixty-four in the offing, but we observed, as they pulled away from us, that they took the direction of another ship. This was the last I ever saw, or heard, of Isaac Gaines. Cook went on with us, and one day, while in London, he went with Cooper to Somerset House to get an order for some prize-money, to which he was entitled for his service in the Cambrian, as was shown by his discharge. The clerk asked him to leave the certificate, and call a day or two later, when he would have searched out the amount. This was done, and Cook, being now without certificate or protection, was pressed {{on his way back to}} the ship. We never heard of him, either. Such was often the fate of sailors, in that day, who were with you one day, and lost for ever the next.|$|R
6000|$|I was so well {{pleased at}} finding these remembrances of Chaucer and his poem, that I ordered my {{dinner in the}} little parlour of the Talbot. Whilst it was preparing, I sat at the window musing and gazing into the court-yard, and conjuring up {{recollections}} of the scenes depicted in such lovely colours by the poet, until, by degrees, boxes, bales and hampers, boys, wagoners and dogs, faded from sight, and my fancy peopled the place with the motley throng of Canterbury pilgrims. The galleries once more swarmed with idle gazers, in the rich dresses of Chaucer's time, and the whole cavalcade seemed to pass before me. There was the stately knight on sober steed, who had ridden in Christendom and heathenesse, and had [...] "foughten for our faith at Tramissene;"--and his son, the young squire, a lover, and a lusty bachelor, with curled locks and gay embroidery; a bold rider, a dancer, and a writer of verses, singing and fluting all day long, and [...] "fresh as the month of May;"--and his [...] "knot-headed" [...] yeoman; a bold forester, in green, with horn, and baudrick, and dagger, a mighty bow in hand, and a sheaf of peacock arrows shining beneath his belt;--and the coy, smiling, simple nun, with her gray eyes, her small red mouth, and fair forehead, her dainty person clad in featly cloak and [...] "'ypinched wimple," [...] her choral beads about her arm, her golden brooch with a love motto, and her pretty oath by Saint Eloy;--and the merchant, solemn in speech and high on horse, with forked beard and [...] "Flaundrish bever hat;"--and the lusty monk, [...] "full fat and in good point," [...] with berry brown palfrey, his hood fastened with gold pin. wrought with a love-knot, his bald head shining like glass, and his face glistening {{as though it had}} been anointed; and the lean, logical, sententious clerk of Oxenforde, upon his half-starved, scholar-like horse;--and the <b>bowsing</b> sompnour, with fiery cherub face, all knobbed with pimples, an eater of garlic and onions, and drinker of [...] "strong wine, red as blood," [...] that carried a cake for a buckler, and babbled Latin in his cups; of whose brimstone visage [...] "children were sore aferd;"--and the buxom wife of Bath, the widow of five husbands, upon her ambling nag, with her hat broad as a buckler, her red stockings and sharp spurs;--and the slender, choleric reeve of Norfolk, bestriding his good gray stot; with close-shaven beard, his hair cropped round his ears, long, lean, calfless legs, and a rusty blade by his side;--and the jolly Limitour, with lisping tongue and twinkling eye, well-beloved franklins and housewives, a great promoter of marriages among young women, known at the taverns in every town, and by every [...] "hosteler and gay tapstere." [...] In short, before I was roused from my reverie by the less poetical but more substantial apparition of a smoking beef-steak, I had seen the whole cavalcade issue forth from the hostel-gate, with the brawny, double-jointed, red-haired miller, playing the bagpipes before them, and the ancient host of the Tabbard giving them his farewell God-send to Canterbury.|$|R
