40|$|This study {{simulated}} Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (pSOFC) – Micro Gas Turbine (MGT) {{hybrid system}} on three different configuration. The first configuration use bypass hot gas from combustor going to fuel heater without pass the turbine first. The second configuration use bypass hot gas out of turbine going to fuel heater. The third configuration is combined bypass out of combustor and also bypass out of turbine. The performance of these system are analyzed by using variation of operating pressure, fuel utilization (Uf), steam to carbon ratio (S/C), and bypass valve. Moreover, {{the impact of}} different <b>bypass</b> <b>position</b> were also evaluated. The result shows that the efficiency of using a double bypass hot gas flow after combustor and turbine is about 67 %. This configuration became the best one among of another two configuration which proposed in this research. The utilization of heat by using a double bypass hot flow gas after turbine and combustor has proven more effective to increase the system efficiency. Means that it can reduce the heat losses of the system...|$|E
40|$|Aim: to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical remodeling of polymer grafts modified with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after implantation into rat abdominal aorta. Materials and methods. Vascular grafts of 2 mmdiameter were fabricated by electrospinning from polycaprolactone (PCL) and a mixture of poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) and PCL. The grafts were modified with VEGF by biphasic electrospinning. Morphology of the grafts was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Physico-mechanical properties of PCL and PHBV/PCL grafts were estimated using uniaxial tensile test and physiological circulating system equipped with state-of-theart ultrasound vascular wall tracking system. Physico-mechanical testing of PCL/VEGF and PHBV/PCL/VEGF was performed before and after implantation into rat abdominal aorta for 6 months. The modeling of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed by finite element analysis for modified grafts. Results. Durability of PCL and PHBV/PCL grafts {{did not differ from}} that of human internal mammary artery; however, elasticity and stiffness of these grafts were higher compared to internal mammary artery. Viscoelastic properties of the grafts were comparable to those of native blood vessels. Modification of the grafts with VEGF reduced material stiffness. Six months postimplantation, PCL/VEGF and PHBV/PCL/VEGF were integrated with aortic tissue that induced changes in the physico-mechanical properties of the grafts similar to the native vessel. Biomechanical modeling confirmed the functioning of modified grafts in <b>bypass</b> <b>position</b> for CABG. Conclusion. PCL/VEGF and PHBV/PCL/VEGF grafts have satisfactory physico-mechanical properties and can be potentially used in the reconstruction of blood vessels.  </p...|$|E
25|$|On D-Day, 6 June 1944, it was {{assigned}} to KING and LOVE sectors of Gold Beach, through which two brigades of the 50th Infantry Division would come ashore. On the morning of 6 June 1944 the battalion landed in the fourth wave and was involved in fighting throughout the day. That night the it cleared <b>bypassed</b> <b>positions</b> in the hamlet of Vaux that had been harassing movement on the beach, the assault being supported {{by one of the}} group’s Bofors guns. In the following days the battalion assisted the Royal Engineers in clearing land mines and moving supplies off the beach. Despite Harper’s hope that it would be redeployed as infantry upon the completion of this task, it was disbanded on 17 August and the soldiers dispatched in replacement drafts to other units. A memorial to the regiment stands near the point at which they landed.|$|R

50|$|The {{first task}} {{was to find a}} {{suitable}} location for a new airfield. Such a location was found on August 19, between Ruhama and Shoval, and over the next three days, an open space of 1,122 m (3,680 ft.) in length and 35 m (115 ft.) in width was cleared. The supplies for transport where meanwhile transported to the Ekron Airbase. During the following days, much of the Yiftach Brigade covertly {{made their way to the}} Negev by land, just west of Kawkaba and Huleikat, <b>bypassing</b> Egyptian <b>positions.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{column of}} French cavalry under La Hire left the town, and <b>bypassed</b> the <b>position</b> of the English vanguard {{to launch a}} {{surprise}} attack on the English, as they were marching {{along the road to}} Gournay. The French cavalry came arrived undetected in a place called Les Epinettes, near Laudecourt, a hamlet near Gournay, and then attacked the English main force. At the same time the rest of the garrison (the foot soldiers and archers) was under the command of Xaintrailles. This, in isolation {{from the rest of the}} troops took shelter behind a pile dwelling nearby.|$|R
50|$|Major Mutius {{advanced}} {{with the}} vanguard of the 2nd Division of the 1st Army Corps.

50|$|With about 3hrs of {{daylight}} remaining and three companies of North Nova Scotias riding on their tanks, the SFR {{passed through the}} assault battalions’ forward lines and fought their way southward toward their preplanned DDay objectives. The North Nova Scotia's reached Villons-les-Buissons by dusk and ran into more German resistance. When {{it was evident that}} their objectives were still about four miles beyond near Carpiquet, they formed all-around defences around La Mare for the night.

5000|$|... 4 Rajput under Lt. Col. B. Avasthi {{was in the}} Sela-Bomdila {{area and}} it too had to face heavy odds. There was {{conflicting}} views among the senior commanders. The brigade commander wanted to hold Sela, but the divisional commander wanted to fall back. The divisional commander and the corps commander both agreed to withdraw. This led to total chaos during the retreat as the Chinese had <b>bypassed</b> many <b>positions</b> and ambushed parties of the soldiers withdrawing {{in a number of}} places. The battalion broke up into a number of parties, one led by Lt. Col. Avasti was ambushed and he was killed along with 300 men.|$|R
50|$|On November 21, 1944, Seitz {{ordered the}} 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment {{to pass through}} the 3rd Battalion and to attack toward the {{northeast}} with the objectives of taking the town of Jüngersdorf and, later, the town of Merode. After two days of heavy fighting in cold rain and mud, the battalion had progressed only a few hundred yards while sustaining heavy losses in attacks against enemy strongpoints with little, if any, tank support. After clearing <b>bypassed</b> enemy <b>positions</b> on November 24 through 26, on November 27, the 2nd Battalion occupied Jüngersdorf. Huebner then directed Seitz to proceed to the next objective, Merode, which was beyond {{the edge of the forest}} and downhill, just 2 mi southeast of Langerwehe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem with}} the Danevirke line was that perhaps it was {{relatively}} strong against a frontal assault but leaned on bodies of water or marshes at both ends. In early 1864, these waters and marshes froze solid in a hard winter and let the Germans bypass the Danevirke. The first attempt to <b>bypass</b> the <b>position</b> failed near Missunde, but eventually the Germans appeared in force in the Danevirke's rear, compelling the Danish high command to order the line abandoned. As this decision was taken in violation of direct orders from the Danish government and in opposition to public opinion in Denmark, general de Meza was relieved of his command and replaced by the more loyal general Gerlach.|$|R
50|$|The engine intakes had {{variable}} ramps and <b>bypass</b> flaps with <b>positions</b> controlled automatically to {{suit the}} engine airflow. They were very long to help prevent surging. However they were {{twice as long as}} those on Concorde. Jean Rech (Sud Aviation) states the need for excessive length was based on the misconception that length was required to attenuate inlet distortion. The intakes were to be shortened by 10 feet on the projected Tu-144M.|$|R
25|$|Ewell {{assumed that}} Milroy might attempt a retreat {{during the night}} and ordered Johnson to prevent his escape by marching north and cutting off escape to the {{east-north-east}} via the Charles Town Road, a potential escape route that could possibly <b>bypass</b> the <b>position</b> of Rodes' Division in the north. Therefore, about 9 p.m., Johnson (with Steuart's and Williams's brigades and 8 guns) commenced a night march north to Berryville Pike and west to Jordan Springs Road, where he turned north toward Stephenson's Depot, a train stop on the Winchester and Potomac Railroad near {{the intersection of the}} Martinsburg Pike and the Charles Town Road. About midnight, the Stonewall Brigade disengaged and joined the rear of the column, leaving one brigade (Jones) astride the Berryville Pike east of town.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, the outpost on {{the left}} around the Isurava {{ridgeline}} held on throughout 27 August, but as the Japanese began <b>bypassing</b> the <b>position,</b> the order was given to withdraw across the ridgeline to the west. After this, frontal attacks against the dug-in defenders in the main defensive position began, representing the start {{of what would be}} four days of violent attacks. The attack was supported by a mountain gun and mortars that had been manhandled up the track. As the first wave fell on the position, the Australians sought to conceal their positions as best they could, firing as late as possible. Humidity and physical exertion sapped the strength of the attacking Japanese and the initial assault was held. That night, as heavy rain fell, the assault on the 39th around Isurava resumed, with a force penetrating the Australian positions around the abandoned garden.|$|R
