This is achieved by proposing vocabularies for the trading of Cloud resources and algorithms for a Cloud marketplace. A multi-attribute combinatorial marketplace is proposed as a solution for situations where Cloud resources need to be traded in combination (bundles).

40|$|Simulation and gaming {{can support}} {{decision}} making through {{all phases of}} incident management including prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. A number of gaming and simulation tools {{have been developed for}} the purpose but they generally utilize proprietary or unique data interfaces and their own view of partitioning the application and solution space. This creates a large obstacle for wide use, and in particular, prevents the use of these tools in an integrated manner to address the application space. This paper explores the groundwork needed to <b>build</b> <b>standards</b> for integrated gaming and simulation tools for incident management. An architecture has been proposed to identify the required groups of simulation and gaming modules for incident management and define their scope in the solution space. A conceptual model is proposed for the data required for such simulations. Available data exchange standards are mapped to the conceptual data model. A concept prototype has been developed based on the architecture to demonstrate the value of integrated modeling and simulation and the architecture itself. A number of simulation and gaming modules have been utilized to model the major aspects of a hypothetical scenario. Current work is focused on developing a functional and data requirements specification document for incident management training. An overview and an example section of the document is provided. The document will serve as a checklist for identifying requirements for future simulation modules in incident management training systems. 1...|$|E

40|$|New engines {{experience}} durability problems {{after entering}} service. The most prevalent and costly is the hot section, particularly the high-pressure turbine. The origin of durability {{problems can be}} traced back to: 1) the basic aero-mechanical design systems, assumptions, and design margins used by the engine designers, 2) the available materials systems, and 3) to a large extent, aggressive marketing in a highly competitive environment that pushes engine components beyond the demonstrated capability of the basic technology available for the hardware designs. Unfortunately the user must operate the engine in the service environment in order to learn the actual thrust loading and the time at max effort take-off conditions used in service are needed to determine the hot section life. Several hundred thousand hours of operational service will be required before the demonstrated reliability of a fleet of engines or the design deficiencies of the engine hot section parts can be determined. Also, it may take three to four engine shop visits for heavy maintenance on the gas path hardware to establish cost effective <b>build</b> <b>standards.</b> Spare parts drive the oerator's engine maintenance costs but spare parts also makes lots of money for the engine manufacturer during the service life of an engine. Unless competition prevails for follow-on engine buys, there is really no motivation for an OEM to spend internal money to improve parts durability and reduce earnings derived from a lucrative spare parts business. If the hot section life is below design goals or promised values, the OEM migh argue that the engine is being operated beyond its basic design intent. On the other hand, the airframer and the operator will continue to remind the OEM that his engine was selected based on a lot of promises to deliver spec thrust with little impact on engine service life if higher thrust is used intermittently. In the end, a standoff prevails and nothing gets fixed. This briefing will propose ways to hold competing engine manufacturers more accountable for engine hot section design margins during the entire Engine Development process as well as provide tools to assess the design temperature margins in the hot section parts of Service Engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{mission of}} the Centre for Environmental Archival (CEDA) is to deliver long term {{curation}} of scientifically important environmental data {{at the same time}} as facilitating the use of data by the environmental science community. CEDA was established by the amalgamation of the activities of two of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) designated data centres: the British Atmospheric Data Centre, and the NERC Earth Observation Data Centre. The process began with administrative functions (in 2005) and has proceeded steadily since, as new activities have and continue to be accreted into CEDA. Until 2008, the constituent parts of CEDA reported independently to NERC, but in 2009 we produced the first public report for CEDA. We are pleased to present here our third annual report, covering activities for the “ 2010 ” year (actually from April 2010 to the end of March 2011). The report itself is in two sections, the first broadly providing a summary of activities and some statistics with some short descriptions of some significant activities, and new this year, a second section introducing some of the staff, and what they do from day-to-day. (Note that although the UK solar system data centre joined CEDA in this year, we have yet to include significant reporting from that activity.) CEDA staff are involved in nearly all the major atmospheric science programmes under way in the UK, in many earth observation programmes, and in a wide range of informatics activities. The CEDA involvement in informatics is main targeted at achieving three main objectives: (1) Providing suitable tools to document and manage both high volume and highly heterogeneous data both in CEDA and the community; (2) Delivering tooling and services to enable the community to exploit CEDA data holdings, and; (3) Improving the ability of fundamental standards both to improve the likelihood that others can <b>build</b> <b>standards</b> compliant software we can deploy, and to support interdisciplinary science. While all of these activities are of course aimed squarely at supporting the UK community, of necessity, and like the science programmes in which we work, we could not complete our objectives without both building on and contributing to other activities – both in the UK and abroad. In particular we rely on partnerships we have built with other organisations so that we can leverage the informatics investments elsewhere to deliver solutions to the three objectives above. One of our closest partnerships is with the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ), but we have strong connections with a range of other institutions, particularly those within the Global Organisation for Earth System Science Portals (GOESSP, see [URL] Other important relationships include with the Met Office, our sister data centres in the Natural Environment Research Council community, and the European space data community (in particular the European Space Agency). In the report that follows it will be seen that many of our activities involve partners from the list above delivering solutions in support of our two main scientific communities: the UK atmospheric and earth observation communities. In 2010 these communities delivered two especially major challenges to CEDA, challenges which are likely to be with us for some years: firstly, how to acquire, document, distribute, and support the massive amounts of data being produced by international model intercomparison projects (and in particular, CMIP 5); and secondly, how to develop a strong engagement with the new International Space Innovation Centre sharing our site at Harwell. Clearly ISIC provides us with a vehicle which could greatly strengthen our ability for the data collected by the UK academic community to make greater commercial and scientific impacts. Our highlights section indicates some of the activities we have begun in support of these two challenges, and we might expect to see much more on these in future years. I trust that whatever your background, you can find something of interest in the material presented here. Bryan Lawrence, Directo...|$|E
40|$|The {{mission of}} the Centre for Environmental Archival (CEDA) is to deliver long term {{curation}} of scientifically important environmental data {{at the same time}} as facilitating the use of data by the environmental science community. CEDA was formed to host two of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) designated data centres: the British Atmospheric Data Centre and the NERC Earth Observation Data Centre, as well as the UK arm of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre. In 2011, the UK Solar System Data Centre joined CEDA. Here we present the fourth annual report, covering joint activities from April 2011 to March 2012 (previously the constituent centres reported independently). The report itself is in two sections, the first broadly providing a summary of activities and some statistics, and the second a selection of short reports on some specific activities beginning, under way, or completed. This section is intended to provide a taster for the range of activities that CEDA undertakes, rather than a complete report of activities, since CEDA staff are involved in a huge range of scientific and informatics projects, not all of which are appropriate for reporting here. CEDA continues to engage in informatics projects to help improve the provision of: (1) suitable tools to document and manage both high volume and highly heterogeneous data; (2) tooling and services to enable the community to exploit CEDA data holdings, and; (3) fundamental standards. The latter, both to improve the likelihood that others can <b>build</b> <b>standards</b> compliant software we can deploy, and to support interdisciplinary science. As in the previous year, the 2011 / 2012 year was dominated by the two major challenges of dealing with CMIP 5 (e. g. see page 36) and the establishment of new services under the banner of the International Space Innovation Centre (discussed in the articles on CEMS on pages 27 and 28). However, while those were high profile external activities, issues of scale became dominant internally; the funding report on page 14 summarises some of the issues: of the order of 108 files – o(108) – using o(petabytes) of disk, on o(300) different computers, split into o(600) datasets on o(100) disk partitions – without a consistent metadata standard or file format across the archive. Despite a decade of effort on metadata systems, and what had been a very efficient computing environment, CEDA was beginning to creak at the seams – with disk failures, insufficient documentation, and complex network issues becoming more and more prevalent. Ongoing growth using the same technical environment would have been a problem. Fortunately, in late 2011, CEDA received significant capital investment, culminating in the delivery in March 2012 of a new computing system – JASMIN/CEMS – consisting of storage and compute funded both by NERC and UKSA and delivered by CEDA in what was then the e-Science department in STFC (now part of the Scientific Computing Department). JASMIN is discussed on page 26 and CEMS on pages 27 and 28. JASMIN/CEMS are not just about supporting the traditional archival services of CEDA though – they are intended to additionally provide support for high performance analysis of high volume data by the greater NERC scientific community. The physical delivery of these systems is of course just part of the story, in next year’s annual report we will be discussing the difficulty of migrating data to the new environment, and some of the new services which their advent has engendered. While we expect the physical system issues to be resolved with the new hardware, issues of documentation still exist – both in terms of the content, and how it is organised. CEDA continues to invest, with both core and project funding, in new metadata developments, aiming to address both issues. Work on data publication and citation is intended both to improve the integrity of the scholarly record, and to provide incentives for the production of good documentation, and work on metadata standards to ensure that we have the information organised fit for automating our environment and scientific use!

40|$|The {{issue of}} whether to {{demolish}} or refurbish older housing has been debated for over a century. It has been an active policy area since the late 1880 s, when the Government first authorised the statutory demolition of insanitary slums. In the 1960 s, revulsion at the scale of 'demolition blight' and new building caused a rethink, leading to a major reinvestment in inner city neighbourhoods of older housing. In the past 5 years, debate on demolition and new building has been intensified by the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan of 2003, with its proposals for large-scale clearance and building. Environmental arguments about renovating the existing stock have gained increasing prominence as people have sought to defend their communities from demolition. The evidence on whether demolition would {{reduce the amount of}} greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is unclear and disputed. This paper summarises the evidence and arguments, and attempts to clarify the most realistic, achievable route to major reductions in energy use in homes. The arguments that apply to housing also apply to most other buildings and therefore to the overall built environment, which accounts for half of all carbon emissions. Three main sources of evidence have helped in the development of this paper, but there are many other studies we draw on in the discussion. Firstly, the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University has argued that around three million demolitions are necessary by 2050 if we are to reach the stringent energy reduction targets that will be required in our housing stock [Boardman et al., 2005. 40 % House. Environmental Change Institute, Oxford]. Its demolition figure is based on complex modelling that with small modifications can produce very different numbers. Its assessment does not take account of the embodied carbon costs such as volume of new materials, energy use in producing concrete, steel and other structural and infrastructural elements, and other factors affecting the environment such as land use, infrastructure and area blighting. We discuss these issues in order to clarify the scale of the challenge and the relative value of demolition or renovation. Secondly, the Sustainable Development Commission [SDC, 2006. 'Stock Take': Delivering improvements in existing housing. Sustainable Development Commission, London] argues the urgent need to upgrade the existing stock on the grounds that 70 % of all homes that will exist in 2050, even with the ambitious new building programme now announced, are already built. The maximum feasible demolition of two million existing homes by 2050, based on experience to date, suggests that under 10 % of the current stock will have been demolished by then. We argue that upgrading this stock to high environmental standards can actually be achieved more cheaply than demolishing it, and with as significant a carbon reduction. Thirdly, the German Federal Housing, Urban and Transport Ministry has announced an ambitious energy reduction programme that will upgrade all pre- 1984 homes in Germany by 2020, an estimated 30 million units. 1 This is based on evidence from several CO 2 reduction programmes since 1996, showing the feasibility of upgrading. An 80 % cut in energy use has been achieved, making the performance of the renovated homes at least as good as Germany's current exacting new <b>build</b> <b>standards.</b> The evidence from Germany is more grounded than any that has so far been produced in the UK, as it is based on several thousand examples. The paper also discusses the social and political problems of demolition. There is widespread opposition to large-scale demolition of older stock, mainly pre- 1919 terraced homes, which is currently the most 'leaky'. This older property is a prime target for demolition in the Environmental Change Institute's proposals and the Government's plans. The environmental benefits of refurbishment are shown, based on work by the Empty Homes Agency, evidence from English Heritage, the Building Research Establishment and the Prince's Foundation. Work on refurbishment shows that existing homes, often in brick-built terraces, are relatively easy to upgrade and, with careful reinvestment in the existing buildings, can achieve as high environmental efficiency standards as current new build. We consider major social, economic and environmental benefits of refurbishment compared with demolition, including: a reduction in the transport costs, reduced landfill disposal, greater reuse of materials, reuse of infill sites and existing infrastructure, reduced new building on flood plains, local economic development, retention of community infrastructure, neighbourhood renewal and management. We weigh these benefits against the full costs of demolition and rebuilding, involving much higher capital costs, higher material wastage, greater embodied carbon inputs, the polluting impact of particulates, greater use of lorry transport for materials and waste, greater use of aggregates, more noise and disruption. On the social issues of housing need and fuel poverty, we argue that refurbishment and infill building are socially more acceptable, cheaper and create far lower environmental impact, while reducing fuel poverty. The incentive problems associated with renovation and the barriers to delivering it are also discussed. The evidence we have uncovered counters the suggestion that large-scale and accelerated demolition would either help us meet our energy and climate change targets or respond to our social needs. Many arguments remain unclear, but the overall balance of evidence suggests that refurbishment most often makes sense on the basis of time, cost, community impact, prevention of sprawl, reuse of existing infrastructure and protection of existing communities. It can also lead to reduced energy use in buildings in both the short and long term. Many factors will influence what happens in practice, but it seems unlikely under any scenario that the rate of demolition will accelerate far above current levels. Upgrading the existing stock is likely to gain in significance for environmental, social and economic reasons. Adopting policies that aid the retention and upgrading of the existing stock will help develop the necessary skills and technologies, save materials and land, and enhance the integration of existing communities in need of regeneration.
