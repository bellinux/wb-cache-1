40|$|International audienceGlutathione transferases (GSTs) {{constitute}} a superfamily of enzymes with essential roles in cellular detoxification and secondary metabolism in plants {{as in other}} organisms. Several plant GSTs, {{including those of the}} Phi class (GSTFs), require a conserved catalytic serine residue to perform glutathione (GSH) -conjugation reactions. Genomic analyses revealed that terrestrial plants have around ten GSTFs, eight in the Populus trichocarpa genome, but their physiological functions and substrates are mostly unknown. Transcript expression analyses showed a predominant expression of all genes both in reproductive (female flowers, fruits, floral buds) and vegetative organs (leaves, petioles). Here, we show that the recombinant poplar GSTF 1 (PttGSTF 1) possesses peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide and GSH-conjugation activity toward model substrates such as 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene, <b>benzyl</b> and phenetyl <b>isothiocyanate,</b> 4 -nitrophenyl butyrate and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal but interestingly not on previously identified GSTF-class substrates. In accordance with analytical gel filtration data, crystal structure of PttGSTF 1 showed a canonical dimeric organization with bound GSH or 2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid molecules. The structure of these protein-substrate complexes allowed delineating the residues contributing to both the G and H sites that form the active site cavity. In sum, the presence of GSTF 1 transcripts and proteins in most poplar organs especially those rich in secondary metabolites such as flowers and fruits, together with its GSH-conjugation activity and its documented stress-responsive expression suggest that its function is associated with the catalytic transformation of metabolites and/or peroxide removal rather than with ligandin properties as previously reported for other GSTFs...|$|R

Biologically active compounds of different Brassicaceae species with antitumor potential are isothiocyanates, present {{in the form of}} their precursors - glucosinolates. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the selectivity of antiproliferative action of dietary isothiocyanates for malignant versus normal cells. Methods. Antiproliferative activity of three isothiocyanates abundant in human diet: sulforaphane, <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (BITC) and phenylethyl isothiocyanate, on human cervix carcinoma cell line - HeLa, melanoma cell line - Fem-x, and colon cancer cell line - LS 174, and on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with or without mitogen, were determined by MTT colorimetric assay 72 h after their continuous action. Results. All investigated isothiocyanates inhibited the proliferation of HeLa, Fem-x and LS 174 cells. On all cell lines treated, BITC was the most potent inhibitor of cell proliferation with half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 5. 04 mmoL m- 3 on HeLa cells, 2. 76 mmol m- 3 on Fem-x, and 14. 30 mmol m- 3 on LS 174 cells. Antiproliferative effects on human PBMC were with higher IC 50 than on malignant cells. Indexes of selectivity, calculated as a ratio between IC 50 values obtained on PBMC and malignant cells, were between 1. 12 and 16. 57, with the highest values obtained for the action of BITC on melanoma Fem-x cells. Conclusion. Based on its antiproliferative effects on malignant cells, as well as the selectivity of the action to malignant vs normal cells, <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> can be considered as a promising candidate in cancer chemoprevention.

40|$|Cancer {{prevention}} by dietary phytochemicals {{has been}} shown to involve decreased cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms involved. Previously, we have shown that a common effect of phytochemicals investigated is to oxidize the intracellular glutathione (GSH) pool. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether changes in the glutathione redox potential in response to dietary phytochemicals was related to their induction of cell cycle arrest. Human colon carcinoma (HT 29) cells were treated with <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (BIT) (BIT), diallyl disulfide (DADS), dimethyl fumarate (DMF), lycopene (LYC) (LYC), sodium butyrate (NaB) or buthione sulfoxamine (BSO, a GSH synthesis inhibitor) at concentrations shown to cause oxidation of the GSH: glutathione disulfide pool. A decrease in cell proliferation, as measured by [3 H]-thymidine incorporation, was observed that could be reversed by pretreatment with the GSH precursor and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Cell cycle analysis on cells isolated 16 h after treatment indicated an increase in the percentage (ranging from 75 – 30 % for <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> and lycopene, respectively) of cells at G 2 /M arrest compared to control treatments (dimethylsulfoxide) in response to phytochemical concentrations that oxidized the GSH pool. Pretreatment for 6 h with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) resulted in a partial reversal of the G 2 /M arrest. As expected, the GSH oxidation from these phytochemical treatments was reversible by NAC. That both cell proliferation and G 2 /M arrest were also reversed by NAC leads to the conclusion that these phytochemical effects are also mediated, in part, by intracellular oxidation. Thus, one potential mechanism for cancer prevention by dietary phytochemicals is inhibition of the growth of cancer cells through modulation of their intracellular redox environment...|$|E

The standard inducer tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), the electrophile <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (BITC), and the antioxidant flavonoid quercetin were found to induce luciferase expression, thereby validating these newly developed reporter cell lines. For tBHQ and BITC, but not for quercetin, higher maximum luciferase induction was found under control of the mGST-Ya EpRE {{as compared to the}} hNQO 1 EpRE, pointing at different induction mechanisms. Furthermore, we investigated the structure-activity relationship for induction of luciferase expression by flavonoids in EpRE(mGST-Ya) -LUX cells, and also the relation between luciferase induction and flavonoid antioxidant potency. Five different flavonoids with a planar molecular structure were found to induce various levels of luciferase activity, whereas taxifolin, a non-planar flavonoid, did not induce luciferase activity. This suggests that a stereospecific molecular interaction may be important for EpRE-mediated gene activation, possibly with Keap 1, a regulator of EpRE-controlled transcription, or with another effector or receptor protein. No consistent relation between luciferase induction level and flavonoid antioxidant potential was observed. Altogether, these results point to differences in induction mechanism between the various chemoprotective compounds tested. The newly developed stably transfected reporter cell lines provide a validated tool for future screening and mechanistic studies of EpRE-mediated gene transcription. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|Moringa oleifera seeds {{have served}} as {{effective}} primary coagulants in water treatment by rural communities over the years (Dalen et al. 2009). The rural communities in India, Sudan, Malawi, Myanmar and Indonesia used the dried, powdered seeds of M. oleifera as a low-cost coagulant for reducing bacterial and viral contamination and also to remove turbidity from drinking water (Roloff et al. 2009). These seeds contain proteins which possess active coagulation properties (Olayemi and Alabi 1994; Sotheeswaran et al. 2011). The presence of <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> and benzyl glucosinolate in the seeds acts as prominent antibiotics and provides effective antimicrobial activity (Eilert et al. 1981). The seed protein is a natural polypeptide which helps in the sedimentation process and found to be non-toxic (Madsen et al. 1987). The polyelectrolyte (1  %) present in the seed possesses the capability to neutralize the formed charged colloid (Sapana et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|International audiencePentadiplandra brazzeana Baillon (Pentadiplandraceae) {{is known}} to contain benzyl-, 3 -methoxybenzyl-, 4 methoxybenzyl-, 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl-, and indole-type glucosinolates, and the {{essential}} oil obtained from its roots is mainly constituted of <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> and benzyl cyanide. In a previous study by the authors, it was surmised that partial hydrolytic degradation of 4 -methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate, one major expected compound, occurred during the hydrodistillation process of essential oil preparation. To probe this hypothesis, a selection of diversely substituted benzylic-type isothiocyanates was submitted to standard hydrodistillation-mimicking conditions. After extraction with dichloromethane, the reaction mixtures were analyzed using GC-MS. The aqueous phases resulting from liquid−liquid extraction were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. 2 Methoxybenzyl, 4 -methoxybenzyl, 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl, and 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzyl isothiocyanates underwent conversion into 2 -methoxybenzyl, 4 -methoxybenzyl, 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl, and 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzyl alcohols, respectively, whereas benzyl, 3 methoxybenzyl, and 4 -chlorobenzyl isothiocyanates were converted into the corresponding benzylamines...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic {{adenocarcinoma}} is {{an aggressive}} cancer {{with a greater}} than 95 % mortality rate and short survival after diagnosis. Chemotherapeutic resistance hinders successful treatment. This resistance is associated with mutations within codon 12 of the K-Ras gene (K-Ras 12), which is present in over 90 % of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Codon 12 mutations maintain Ras in a constitutively active state leading to continuous cellular proliferation. Our study determined if TRAIL resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-Ras 12 mutations could be overcome by first sensitizing the cells with <b>Benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (BITC). BITC is a component of cruciferous vegetable extracts and a cell cycle inhibitor. BxPC 3, MiaPaCa 2, and Panc- 1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were examined for TRAIL resistance. Our studies show BITC-induced TRAIL sensitization by the activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3 {{as well as their}} respective substrates Bid, XIAP, and PARP. Cell Death ELISA confirmed TRAIL sensitization by BITC...|$|E
40|$|Administration of {{ineffective}} anticancer {{therapy is}} associated with unnecessary toxicity and development of resistant clones. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) resist chemotherapy, thereby causing relapse of the disease. Thus, development of a test that identifies the most effective chemotherapy management offers great promise for individualized anticancer treatments. We have developed an ex vivo chemotherapy sensitivity assay (ChemoID), which measures the sensitivity of CSLCs {{as well as the}} bulk of tumor cells to a variety of chemotherapy agents. Two patients, a 21 -year old male (patient 1) and a 5 -month female (patient 2), affected by anaplastic WHO grade-III ependymoma were screened using the ChemoID assay. Patient 1 was found sensitive to the combination of irinotecan and bevacizumab, which resulted in a prolonged disease progression free period of 18 months. Following recurrence, the combination of various chemotherapy drugs was tested again with the ChemoID assay. We found that <b>benzyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (BITC) greatly increased the chemosensitivity of the ependymom...|$|E
