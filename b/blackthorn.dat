5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 <b>Blackthorn</b> Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E

40|$|Symptoms of sharka disease {{were first}} {{observed}} on plums in Chrudim district, Central Bohemia, in former Czechoslovakia {{in the forties}} of the last century. Plum pox virus (PPV) was first detected in the Bohemian part of Czechoslovakia in 1952 (SMOLÁK, NOVÁK 1956). An investigation into the diversity and distribution of natural sources of PPV in the Czech Republic began in 1995. Partial results were published by POLÁK (1997) and POLÁK and PÍVALOVÁ (2001) for the years 1999 – 2001. The results of distribution of PPV in naturally growing plum trees, myrobalans and <b>blackthorns</b> were presented completely in 2002 (POLÁK 2002). A small percentage of isolates of the PPV-M serotype in the Czech Republic was found by NAVRÁTIL et al. (1997). They identified it from different, not in greater detail characterised hosts, genetic resources, and experi-mental plants of institutions. The occurrence of PPV-M strain was investigated in our laboratory from 1999 to 2001 at various localities in naturally growing plums, myrobalans and <b>blackthorns.</b> 78 plum and damson trees, 32 myrobalans, and 8 <b>blackthorns</b> were investigated. By means of Mabs, PPV-M was detected only in two plum trees and one damson tree (POLÁK 2002). Furthermore, the presence of PPV-M strain was investigated in se-lected peach and apricot orchards. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material The incidence and distribution of PPV-M strain were investigated in two selected intensive orchards of ap-ricots and peaches in Southern Moravia and Central Bohemia. Large orchards (more than 20 hectares) were fifteen to twenty years old. The first orchard of apri-cots, Velké Pavlovice locality, was planted with tree...|$|R

40|$|Relationship between total mercury {{as well as}} cadmium {{contents}} and total anthocyanins content in wild forest fruit berries collected in environemtally burden region of Stredny Spis in the Slovakia was investigated in this study. From the sampling points of different localities of this region small berries were sampled: blackberries (6 localities), <b>blackthorns</b> (5 localities), rosehips (6 localities), hawthorn fruits. Metal determinations were performed in a Varian AA 240 Z (Varian, Australia) atomic absorption spectrometer with Zeeman background correction. Total anthocyanin content (TA) in fruits was determined spectrophotometrically using the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS – 1240, Japan). With exception of three samples in all other fruit samples the hygienic limit for Cd (30 μg/kg) given for foodstuffs by Slovak Republic Food Codex was exceeded. Only in one fruit sample the determined Hg content was higher than hygienic limit (30 μg/kg). Total anthocyanin content expressed as mg cyanidin equivalents/kg of fresh matter (mg CE/kg FM) was in range 370 – 830 in blackberries (Rubus Fruticosus), 2500 – 3000 in rosehips (Rosa rubiginosa), 213 in raspberries (Prunus spinosa) and 317 mg CE/kg FM in hawthorn berries (Crataegus laevigata). The strong statistical dependences between investigated parameters: Hg – TA in <b>blackthorns,,</b> Cd – TA in raspberries, Hg – TA in raspberries, Cd – TA in hawthorn and Hg – TA in hawthorn were confirmed based on the values of correlation coefficients (R= 0. 6958, R= 0. 9633, R= 0. 9163, R= 0. 8587 and R= 0. 8938, respectively) ...|$|R
50|$|Lira {{is a heavy}} {{forested area}} in Galicia, but the {{majority}} of Lira's plantations, usually growing eucalyptus or pine, lack any formal management, except a sound management of the forest local community. Wood figures significantly in Lira's economy. Apart from tree plantations, Lira is also notable for the surface occupied by vineyards, meadows and cornfields.A few Old-growth forests (known locally as fragas) remain, particularly in the lower parts dominated by the English oak (Quercus robur L.), mixed with other tress like: alders, birches, ashes, hazels, <b>blackthorns,</b> maples, willows, wild cherry trees, wild pear trees, etc. Hills are covered mainly by maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster). As exotic species are blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudacacia) and recently the invasive heaven tree (Ailanthus altissima). It is also frequent the American northern red oak (Quercus rubra) in new forest plantations. Shrubs (holly, hawthorn, blackberry, ivy, dog rose, elder, laurel bay, Scotch broom, gum rockrose or gorse) and herbaceous are also important. Lira also has a good range of heathers, ferns and mosses species.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} 932 {{samples of}} wood from the prehistoric pile-dwelling site Stare gmajne at Ljubljansko barje. With {{the help of}} dendrochronology, radiocarbon dating and wiggle matching method we established that the dwelling was settled in two periods from approximately 3350 until 3330, and from 3160 until 3110 cal. BC. We introduced an archaeobotanical method which is widely used in other European laboratories and identified macrobotanical remains (seeds and fruits) from both settlement periods. Most important cultural plants were: einkorn, emmer, barley, opium poppy, flax and peas. Most frequent gathered plants were: apples, pears, strawberries, blackberries, bladder cherries, cornelian cherries, hawthorns, <b>blackthorns,</b> grapes, dog-rose berries and nuts (acorn, hazel nut and water chestnut). While a widely accepted method was used, we identified {{for the first time}} flax and einkorn / emmer wheat on the basis of chaff remains at a Slovenian prehistoric site. We compared plant economy habits between Stare gmajne and some contemporaneous lake dwellings around the Alps; the most important cultivated wheats at Stare gmajne were emmer and einkorn, while at the sites north of the Alps naked wheat was often found. Corenlian cherry, water chestnut, and grape vine were frequent at Stare gmajne, but they were rare or were not found on the sites north of the Alps...|$|R
25|$|Common {{species of}} tree include oak, ash, sycamore, alder, <b>blackthorn,</b> hawthorn, beech and birch. Less common (but plentiful) are wild cherry and Scots pine (also called red deal). Elm is now far less common, {{due to the}} devastating effects of Dutch elm disease. Gorse (or furze) is very common. A {{priority}} habitat in Wexford is the grey dune, on which many native wild flora grow, including bee orchid and pyramidal orchid. Despite the designation of much of this habitat as a Special Area of Conservation, it remains threatened by destruction for agricultural intensification. There is very little natural forest in the county. Most natural trees and vegetation grow on hedgerows.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of Ötzi's {{intestinal}} contents showed two meals (the {{last one}} consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, {{the other of}} red deer and herb bread. Both were eaten with grain as well as roots and fruits. The grain from both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran, quite possibly eaten {{in the form of}} bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plumlike fruits of the <b>blackthorn</b> tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild. Hair analysis was used to examine his diet from several months before.|$|E
