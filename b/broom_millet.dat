40|$|Grass weeds such as Panicum miliaceum L. (<b>broom</b> corn <b>millet)</b> are a {{persistent}} problem for agriculture, causing significant crop losses. A weedy biotype of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> {{is already a}} troublesome weed on North American arable farms, and has recently emerged {{as a threat to}} New Zealand corn and maize crops. This thesis describes aspects of the biology of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> under New Zealand conditions. Experiments were designed to understand under what conditions <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> is mostly likely to affect crop growth. Experiments were conducted in a glass house and a laboratory to observe the effect of temperature on germination and early growth of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet.</b> The pot-based glasshouse experiment compared germination and growth between a range of controlled substrate temperatures. The response of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> to temperature was typical of that expected for a C₄ plant. At 10 °C seeds germinated later and in lower proportions compared to 15 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C. Growth and above ground dry biomass accumulation also increased with increasing substrate temperature, with the highest dry biomass accumulated at 25 °C, primarily because of increases in germination rate. In a laboratory experiment conducted at temperatures ranging from 5 °C and 34 °C, temperatures {{greater than or equal to}} 20 °C were more favourable for germination of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> seeds. The optimum temperatures for germination were 27 °C to 34 °C. The threshold germination temperature for the seed lot used was 7. 4 °C. <b>Broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> seeds were tested for their ability to germinate and emerge from a range of planting depths when planted in pots containing 16 soil types from around New Zealand. Seedlings emerged from 120 mm depth in all soil types. In six soil types seeds of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> were able to emerge from the greatest depth tested of 170 mm, very deep compared to most herbaceous weeds. In general, seedling emergence reduced with increasing depth, whereas suicidal germination increased. Step-wise binomial regression of emergence against various soil physical properties did not reveal any significant relationship between soil physical properties and seedling emergence. To observe the affect of competition on both the weed (<b>broom</b> corn <b>millet)</b> and the crop (sweet corn), plants of both species were grown together in pots at a range of planting ratios. Plants were also grown in monoculture to observe growth without competition. In the competition trial <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> emerged after sweet corn and affected sweet corn above ground biomass during the first four weeks. However, this effect did not persist as sweet corn biomass increased irrespective of the level of competition from <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> plants. The monoculture experiment indicated that sweet corn grew better without competition whereas growth of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> was stimulated while growing in competition. The poor competition by <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> plants was assumed to be the result of unseasonal low temperatures during the period immediately after sewing and demonstrated that <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> plants emerging after the crop may not affect crop growth. The likely persistence of New Zealand <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> seeds in soil is unknown. A laboratory based Controlled Ageing Test (CAT) was therefore evaluated for its ability to predict the persistence of seeds. The test was conducted using seeds of nodding thistle (Carduus nutans), for which real time persistence data is available. In two additional experiments, the CAT was used to estimate the potential persistence of New Zealand sourced <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> seeds. The CAT derived half life time (P₅₀) of nodding thistle seeds did not compare well with the field derived P₅₀ for nodding thistle seeds, with the CAT results suggesting less persistence compared to actual persistence. Examination of the CAT results for <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> showed a decline in seed viability from 30 to 50 days, followed by a sharp decline at 75 days. The midpoint of the initial decline (40 days) was taken as the P 50 for <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet.</b> This value is similar to existing information for <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> in North America, and indicates that <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> will form a moderately persistent seed bank in New Zealand. In conclusion, results suggest that higher temperatures favour the growth of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet.</b> Planting of crops earlier in the season may reduce competition by this weed. However, increasing temperatures as a result of global climate change will enhance conditions for <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> and may increase future crop losses caused by this weed. The ability of <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet’s</b> relatively large seeds to germinate and emerge from depth will limit the efficiency of conventional weed control practices, such as ploughing and stale seed beds. The ability to form a moderately persistent seed bank suggests that once introduced, <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> will be challenging to eradicate because of its prolific seed production. Significant changes in weed control practices will therefore be required to manage <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} {{physiological}} impact on crops are important area of ecological impacts on CO 2 leakage on CCS. Physiological effects of CO 2 to C 4 Crops were simulated with CO 2 artificial climate chamber in this paper. The main conclusions are as follows:(1) When CO 2 concentration {{was less than}} 20000 μmol/mol, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of four C 4 crops were increased with the increasing of CO 2 concentration. When CO 2 concentration was higher than 20000 μmol/mol, the three indicators were decreased with the increasing of CO 2 concentration. The indicators of the four C 4 crops were reached the maximum values at 20000 μmol/mol of CO 2 concentration and the minimum values at 80000 μmol/mol respectively. The impacts of CO 2 to corn and sorghum were {{greater than that of}} <b>millet</b> and <b>broom</b> corn <b>millet.</b> (2) Intercellular CO 2 concentrations of the four C 4 crops were increased with increasing of CO 2 concentration, but their growth rates were decreased gradually. (3) With the increase of CO 2 concentration, the leaf temperature of four C 4 crops showed the opposite rule with net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance...|$|R
