40|$|Background: Nonprobability Web surveys using {{volunteer}} panels {{can provide}} a relatively cheap and quick alternative to traditional health and epidemiological surveys. However, concerns have been raised about their representativeness. Objective: The aim was to compare results from different Web panels with a population-based probability sample survey (n= 8969 aged 18 - 44 years) that used computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) for sensitive behaviors, the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal- 3). Methods: Natsal- 3 questions were included on 4 nonprobability Web panel surveys (n= 2000 to 2099), 2 using <b>basic</b> <b>quotas</b> based on age and sex, and 2 using modified quotas based on additional variables related to key estimates. Results for sociodemographic characteristics were compared with external benchmarks and for sexual behaviors and opinions with Natsal- 3. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to express differences between the benchmark data and each survey for each variable of interest. A summary measure of survey performance was the average absolute OR across variables. Another summary measure {{was the number of}} key estimates for which the survey differed significantly (at the 5...|$|R
40|$|Individual quotas are a {{dominant}} instrument {{in the management}} of common pool renewable resources like fisheries. However, there is concern about the <b>basic</b> effectiveness of <b>quota</b> regulation due to widespread non-compliance. In this paper we develop a model of enforcement in a quota regulated renewable resource industry and consider a case with significant non-compliance, and with exogenous constraints on fines and enforcement budget. We propose a reform of the enforcement system by introducing self reporting of excess extraction and (explicit) differentiation of inspection rates based on compliance history. We show that the proposed reform increases the effectiveness of quota management and allows the regulator to implement a wider range of aggregate extraction targets than under the traditional enforcement system. This is shown without violating the inspection budget constraint or the fine constraint, and while ensuring an efficient allocation of aggregate catch...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{account for}} the {{scarcity}} of cis peptide bonds in proteins, especially in nonproline (or secondary amide) cases, a steric-clash argument is often put forward, in a scheme where the R lateral chains are facing parallel one another, and the backbone is kept in an "all-trans"-like arrangement. Although such a steric conflict can be partly relieved through proper adjustment of the backbone dihedral angles, one can try to estimate its associated energy cost. To this end, quantum-chemistry approaches using a differential-torsion protocol and bond-separation-energy analyses are applied to N-ethyl propionamide CH 3 −CH 2 −CO−NH−CH 2 −CH 3, regarded as a model capable of exhibiting Cβ***Cβ interaction as in alanine succession. The calculations provide an increment of 9 kcal/mol, quite close to that obtained in the nearly isostere (gsg) rotamer of n-hexane (10 kcal/mol), suggesting the local effects induced by methyl−methyl contact are similar in both cases. Analogous treatments on larger radicals as encountered in leucine or phenylalanine dimers do not change this increment much, which therefore defines the <b>basic</b> reference per-plaque <b>quota</b> to be overcome along all-cis chains. Explicit modeling indicated it can be reduced by up to a factor of 4...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{of return}} to {{ownership}} of California dairy quota is about 27 % per year—well above that of typical financial assets, but in line with other measured returns to agricultural quotas. Ownership of dairy quota does not contribute positively to total variation of typical portfolios, including those of dairy farm assets, and so contributes little or no portfolio risk. A plausible alternative hypothesis for the high {{rate of return}} is that quota owners see significant risk of policy change that would reduce future quota values. That is, they face default risk in quota ownership. The capitalization of farm program benefits and the effects of policy on the rateof return to investments in farm assets have long been important to agricul-tural policy analysis. The issues arise {{in the context of the}} influence of policy on prices of farmland, other physical assets, and policy-created assets such as farm program <b>quota.</b> <b>Basic</b> economic principles tell us that the benefits of government programs will affect returns to and prices of resources connected to a program. The incidence of flow benefits depends, in part, on the elasticities of supply of these resources, with the prices of inelastic resources affected most. The capital prices of assets do not depend directly on past returns, but on expectations about future returns. Of course, in many practical cases, the history of past returns is a crucial source of information used to form expectations. Johnson assessed the literature on returns to farm quota, stating, “Roughly speaking, the discount rate used to value future earnings from [farm-program created] quotas is approximately 25 %.

50|$|In the United States, Tobacco quotas (poundage quotas, and in {{some cases}} acreage allotments) were a supply control feature of federal price support for tobacco. Burley tobacco was subject to {{marketing}} quotas and flue-cured tobacco was subject to marketing quotas and acreage allotments. Tobacco quota owners (owners of farmland to which quota is assigned) voted every three years on whether or not to continue with price support (through no-net-cost loans) and marketing quotas. Producers of several minor tobaccos (including Maryland (type 32), Pennsylvania cigar-filler (type 41), and Connecticut Valley cigar-binder (types51-52)) had disapproved federal support. The national marketing quota (<b>basic</b> <b>quota)</b> was calculated according to a formula specified by law that included consideration of intended purchases by domestic manufacturers, average exports over the preceding three years, and reserve stock requirements. The effective quota was the <b>basic</b> <b>quota</b> plus and minus temporary adjustments for allowable previous year under and over marketings. The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357, Title VI) ended tobacco quotas for 2005 crop and subsequent years.|$|E

40|$|The {{short time}} left until the EU {{accession}} date, {{has become a}} strong pressure factor for the speeding up of the necessary restructuring processes of the agrifood sector and rural areas. This is a challenge without precedent for the decision makers in the following period in order to prepare the sector from both institutional and legislative point and of views to implement the Common Agricultural Policy and {{for the management of}} the funds related to it. In the same time the sector also has to be to be “morally” prepared for the exigencies and potential shocks {{due to the lack of}} competitiveness after entering the Single Market and this activity has to be also a priority. The absorption of community funds proposed for Romania in 2004, will depend especially of the wish for restructuring and "the abilities" of the decision makers in chasing the right pattern of agricultural policy for the next period, and after accession. The cost/benefits estimations in this document are based on a very simplistic approach. The scenario proposed starts from the optimistic hypothesis that, until 2007 Romania will be fully prepared from institutional point of view, as well as from point of view of the requirements regarding food security, animal welfare, the environment's state etc., and it will be able to produce at the level established by negotiations, fulfilling 100 % the eligibility conditions, and Romania will enter on the Single Market with the negotiated elements (<b>quotas,</b> <b>basic</b> areas, reference productions, etc.).

40|$|We compare quota-based salesforce {{compensation}} {{plans with}} the BLSS plan, i. e., the optimal curvilinear agency-theory-based compensation plans proposed in Basu, Lal, Srinivasan and Staelin (Basu, A. K., R. Lal, V. Srinivasan, R. Staelin. 1985. Salesforce compensation plans: An agency theoretic perspective. Marketing Sci. 4 (Fall) 267 [...] 291.). A quota plan pays a fixed salary which is supplemented by commission income {{that is a}} prespecified fraction of the dollar sales that exceed the quota. For a salesforce comprised of multiple salespersons/territories, we consider a <b>basic</b> <b>quota</b> plan where the commission rate and salary remain the same across salespersons; however, quotas vary across salespersons/territories. Compared to the BLSS plan that is individually tailored to each salesperson/territory, the <b>basic</b> <b>quota</b> plan's total nonoptimality in profit has two components: (i) a shapeinduced nonoptimality arising {{from the fact that}} the quota-based plan does not have the same optimal shape as the curvilinear BLSS plan, and (ii) a heterogeneity-induced nonoptimality arising {{from the fact that the}} salary and commission rate in the <b>basic</b> <b>quota</b> plan are constrained to be the same across the salesforce. Our numerical experiments indicate that the total nonoptimality is merely about 1 % for the parametric scenarios studied. The <b>basic</b> <b>quota</b> plan is simpler to implement than the BLSS plan. Furthermore, changes in business conditions in a territory, or the transfer of a salesperson from one territory to another, can be accommodated by changing only the quota, without having to change the salary and the commission rate structure. Such advantages, together with our result that the nonoptimality is slight, suggest that quota-based plans offer considerable potential as a salesforce compensation scheme. salesforce compensation, agency theory, sales quotas, salesforce management...|$|E
