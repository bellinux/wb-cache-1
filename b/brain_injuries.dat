5|$|TBI is a {{major cause}} of death and {{disability}} worldwide, especially in children and young adults. Males sustain traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> more frequently than do females. The 20thcentury saw developments in diagnosis and treatment that decreased death rates and improved outcome.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term <b>brain</b> <b>injuries.</b> A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sleep {{disorders}} are common are common following traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> METHODS: In {{this article we}} review the spectrum and proposed mechanisms of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> associated sleep disorders and discuss the clinical approach to diagnosis and management of these disorders. RESULT: Disordered sleep and wakefulness after traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> is common. Sleep disruption contributes to morbidity, such as the development of neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, and prolongs the recovery phase after injury. Early recognition and correction of these problems may limit the secondary effects of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> and improve patient outcomes.

5000|$|Primary and {{secondary}} <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> {{are ways to}} classify the injury processes that occur in <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> In traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (TBI), primary <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> occurs during the initial insult, and results from displacement of the physical structures of the <b>brain.</b> Secondary <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> occurs gradually and may involve an array of cellular processes. Secondary injury, which is not caused by mechanical damage, can result from the primary injury or be independent of it. [...] The fact that people sometimes deteriorate after <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> was originally taken to mean that secondary injury was occurring. It is not well understood {{how much of a}} contribution primary {{and secondary}} injuries respectively have to the clinical manifestations of TBI.|$|R
25|$|One {{recent study}} of neuroplasticity {{involves}} work done {{by a team of}} doctors and researchers at Emory University, specifically Dr. Donald Stein and Dr. David Wright. This is the first treatment in 40 years that has significant results in treating traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> while also incurring no known side effects and being cheap to administer. Dr. Stein noticed that female mice seemed to recover from <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> better than male mice, and that at certain points in the estrus cycle, females recovered even better. This difference may be attributed to different levels of progesterone, with higher levels of progesterone leading to the faster recovery from brain injury in mice. However, clinical trials showed progesterone offers no significant benefit for traumatic brain injury human patients.|$|E

40|$|Axonal {{degeneration}} is a critical, early {{event in}} many acute and chronic neurological disorders. It {{has been consistently}} observed after traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury,</b> but whether axon degeneration is a driver of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> remains unclear. Molecular pathways underlying the pathology of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> have not been defined, {{and there is no}} efficacious treatment for traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> Here we show that mice lacking the mouse Toll receptor adaptorSarm 1 (sterile alpha/Armadillo/Toll-Interleukin receptor homology domain protein) gene, a key mediator of Wallerian degeneration, demonstrate multiple improved traumatic brain injury-associated phenotypes after injury in a closed-head mild traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> model. Sarm 1 (-/-) mice developed fewer beta-amyloid precursor protein aggregates in axons of the corpus callosum after traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> as compared toSarm 1 (+/+) mice. Furthermore, mice lackingSarm 1 had reduced plasma concentrations of the phophorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H, indicating that axonal integrity is maintained after traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> Strikingly, whereas wild-type mice exibited a number of behavioural deficits after traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury,</b> we observed a strong, early preservation of neurological function inSarm 1 (-/-) animals. Finally, usingin vivoproton magnetic resonance spectroscopy we found tissue signatures consistent with substantially preserved neuronal energy metabolism inSarm 1 (-/-) mice compared to controls immediately following traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> Our results indicate that the SARM 1 -mediated prodegenerative pathway promotes pathogenesis in traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> and suggest that anti-SARM 1 therapeutics are a viable approach for preserving neurological function after traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury...</b>|$|R
