In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept control of their own work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.

25|$|For example, Church {{teaching}} {{heavily influenced}} the legal concept of marriage. During the Gregorian Reform, the Church developed and codified {{a view of}} marriage as a sacrament. In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed and established a minimum age for marriage. The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union a <b>binding</b> <b>contract,</b> with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities. Although the Church abandoned tradition to allow women {{the same rights as}} men to dissolve a marriage, in practice, when an accusation of infidelity was made, men were granted dissolutions more frequently than women.|$|E
25|$|A legally <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> {{occurs when}} one party makes an offer and {{receives}} an acceptance {{from the other}} party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration {{is concerned with the}} bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a promisor and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A valuable consideration, {{in the sense of the}} law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".|$|E

25|$|Louisa Hamer, (Plaintiff), brought {{suit against}} Franklin Sidway, the {{executor}} {{of the estate}} of William E. Story I, (Defendant), for the sum of $5,000. On March 20, 1869, William E. Story had promised his nephew, William E. Story II, $5,000 if his nephew would abstain from drinking alcohol, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until the nephew reached 21 years of age. Story II accepted the promise of his uncle and did refrain from the prohibited acts until he turned the agreed-upon age of 21. After celebrating his 21st birthday on January 31, 1875, Story II wrote to his uncle and requested the promised $5,000. The uncle responded to his nephew in a letter dated February 6, 1875 in which he told his nephew that he would fulfill his promise. Story I also stated that he would prefer to wait until his nephew was older before actually handing over the (then) extremely large sum of money (according to an online inflation calculator, $5000 in 1890 would be worth approximately $130,000 in 2017). The elder Story also declared in his letter that the money owed to his nephew would accrue interest while he held it on his nephew's behalf. The younger Story consented to his uncle's wishes and agreed that the money would remain with his uncle until Story II became older. William E. Story I died on January 29, 1887 without having transferred any of the money owed to his nephew. Story II had meanwhile transferred the $5,000 financial interest to his wife; Story II's wife had later transferred this financial interest to Louisa Hamer on assignment. The elder Story's estate refused to grant Hamer the money, believing there was no <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> {{due to a lack}} of consideration. As a result, Hamer sued the estate's executor, Franklin Sidway.|$|E
