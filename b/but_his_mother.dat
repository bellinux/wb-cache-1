5|$|Sigismund's {{father and}} uncle were Roman Catholic, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> was Calvinist.

His mother mocked him for his piety, saying that he only wanted to secure his uncle's goodwill. Sigismund was especially hostile towards the Anti-Trinitarians in his youth. His mother died in early 1581.|$|E

5|$|Parts of Greece were {{occupied}} by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> narrowly saved Princess Katherine by carrying her through the woods {{for more than two}} kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.|$|E
5|$|He emigrated {{with his}} family to Bolzano in Italy to escape Nazi {{persecution}} but was eventually forced to move back to Germany, though as a former war comrade of Hitler's he was granted protection and some privileges for a while. However, his privileges were removed in 1941 and he {{spent the rest of the}} war as a forced labourer; his sister died in Auschwitz <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> managed to escape to Switzerland in 1945. Following the war he began a new career in railway management and was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his services to the Deutsche Bundesbahn.|$|E
5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} {{by the sound of}} a drummer and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E
5000|$|According to Canduci, Alexander {{is remembered}} as an emperor who was [...] "level headed, well meaning, and conscientious," [...] <b>but</b> <b>his</b> fatal flaw was his {{domination}} by <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> and grandmother. Not only did this undermine <b>his</b> authority, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> influence {{was the cause}} of Alexander's least popular actions (convincing him not to take part in battle and trying to buy off the warring Germanic barbarians).|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} the village of Ashington was based entirely around coal mining, and though his family had a strong footballing pedigree, {{his father was a}} miner. The eldest of four {{brothers}} – Bobby, Gordon and Tommy – the tight finances of the family meant that all four siblings shared the same bed. His father, Bob, had no interest in football, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> Cissie, played football with her children and later coached the local schools team. As a teenager she took them to watch Ashington and Newcastle United play, and Charlton remained a lifelong Newcastle supporter.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had hoped}} {{to pursue a career}} in the British Army, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> vetoed an active {{military}} career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of Prince Christian of Denmark and his wife Louise. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at Speyer on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858. Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at Strelitz in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} on 24 June 1662, {{probably}} at Eccles near Manchester, where his father (a relative of Robert Warton Hall) was buried. <b>His</b> <b>mother</b> was early left a widow with three children.

He entered the Rathmell Academy of Richard Frankland, then at Natland, on 2 March 1681, and was Frankland's most distinguished student.|$|R
5|$|Tonelli was {{effectively}} an only child; his half-sister {{was not born}} until he was 14. A decade later, he discovered two half-sisters from his biological father's remarriage. His family moved around frequently due to his stepfather's work, before settling permanently in Brisbane. Tonelli's family had no history of athletic success, and had little knowledge of swimming, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport to ease his asthma. In his first year, Tonelli came third in his age group at Western Districts Club, prompting his mother to send him at age nine to John Keatinga swimming coach who had guided several swimmers to national selectionat the Centenary Pool in the hope that he could improve to Olympic standards. Tonelli said the reality was that he could hardly swim at all. By the age of 10, Tonelli was regularly winning at school carnivals and at 11, came seventh in the 100m freestyle in his division at the Queensland Championships, before winning the event the following year. Tonelli rates his win over Stephen Holland, the future 1500m freestyle world champion and world record holder, in a 200m freestyle race at a schoolboys' carnival as his favourite race. Holland was to break his first world record just a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was {{the next}} ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', {{although}} he appears {{not to have been}} a direct descendent of his predecessor. He took the throne in June763 and may have been only 9years old. He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city's architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> was a noblewoman from distant Palenque in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD773. Around AD776, he completed the final version of Temple16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous AltarQ, which shows each of the 16rulers of the city from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty. By the latter 8thcentury, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king. At the same time, local satellites were displaying their own local power, as demonstrated by the ruler of Los Higos erecting his own stela in AD781. Towards the end of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's reign, the city of Copán was struggling with overpopulation and a lack of local resources, with a distinct fall in living standards among the populace. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was able to celebrate his second K'atun in AD802 with his own monument, but the king's participation in the K'atun ending ceremony of AD810 was marked at Quiriguá, not at Copán. By this time the city's population was over 20,000 and it had long needed to import basic necessities from outside.|$|E
