25|$|Propagating <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> is high {{in energy}} and dangerous. Occurs when an {{insulating}} surface of up to 8mm thick (e.g. a teflon or glass lining of a grounded metal pipe or a reactor) is subjected to a large charge buildup between the opposite surfaces, acting as a large-area capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Cone discharge, {{also called}} bulking <b>brush</b> <b>discharge,</b> occurs over {{surfaces}} of charged powders with resistivity above 1010 ohms, or also deep through the powder mass. Cone discharges aren't usually observed in dust volumes below 1 m3. The energy involved {{depends on the}} grain size of the powder and the charge magnitude, and can reach up to 20 mJ. Larger dust volumes produce higher energies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>discharge</b> occurs from a {{nonconductive}} charged {{surface or}} highly charged nonconductive liquids. The energy {{is limited to}} roughly 4 millijoules. To be hazardous, the voltage involved must be above about 20 kilovolts, the surface polarity must be negative, a flammable atmosphere must be present {{at the point of}} discharge, and the discharge energy must be sufficient for ignition. Further, because surfaces have a maximum charge density, an area of at least 100cm2 has to be involved. This is not considered to be a hazard for dust clouds.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{electric}} arcs, <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> produce ozone gas, {{which can}} be noxious to nearby people in an enclosed space and over time can cause embrittlement of some plastics. The ability of an electrical discharge to cause an explosion in flammable atmospheres {{is measured by the}} effective energy of the discharge. The effective energy of <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> is 10-20 mJ, much larger than that of corona discharges 0.1 mJ. Therefore, <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> are considered an explosion hazard, while corona discharges are not.|$|R

So also, {{when the}} {{conductor}} n was connected {{only with the}} muriatic acid gas apparatus, {{it was found that}} the discharge was more facile when the small ball s was negative than when positive; for in the latter case, much of the electricity passed off as <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> through the air from the connecting wire p but in the former case, it all seemed to go through the muriatic acid.|$|E
6000|$|... 1479. Before I proceed {{further in}} tracing the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} difference between the positive and negative <b>brush</b> <b>discharge,</b> I wish to know the results of a few experiments which are in course of preparation: and thinking this Series of Researches long enough, I shall here close it with the expectation of being able in a few weeks to renew the inquiry, and entirely redeem my pledge (1306.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1440. <b>Brush</b> <b>discharge</b> {{does not}} {{essentially}} require any current {{of the medium}} in which the brush appears: the current almost always occurs, but {{is a consequence of}} the brush, and will be considered hereafter (1562-1610.). On holding a blunt point positively charged towards uninsulated water, a star or glow appeared on the point, a current of air passed from it, and {{the surface of the water}} was depressed; but on bringing the point so near that sonorous brushes passed, then the current of air instantly ceased, and the surface of the water became level.|$|E
40|$|New {{techniques}} {{for evaluating the}} incendiary behavior of insulators is presented. The onset of incendive <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> in air is evaluated using standard spark probe {{techniques for}} the case simulating approaches of an electrically grounded sphere to a charged insulator {{in the presence of}} a flammable atmosphere. However, this standard technique is unsuitable for the case of <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> that may occur during the charging-separation process for two insulator materials. We present experimental techniques to evaluate this hazard {{in the presence of a}} flammable atmosphere which is ideally suited to measure the incendiary nature of micro-discharges upon separation, a measurement never before performed. Other measurement techniques unique to this study include; surface potential measurements of insulators before, during and after contact and separation, as well as methods to verify fieldmeter calibrations using a charge insulator surface opposed to standard high voltage plates.

5000|$|Corona and <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> are {{sometimes}} called one-electrode discharges because they {{occur in the}} vicinity of a single electrode, and don't extend as far as the other electrode, as in an electric arc (a two-electrode discharge).|$|R
50|$|On 26 August 1883, the British warship Charles Ball sailing the Sunda Strait {{en route}} to Hong Kong came within 20 km of the {{exploding}} Krakatau volcano and witnessed {{a great deal of}} static electricity in the atmosphere, generated by the movement of tiny particles of rocks and droplets of water from the volcano's steam, which caused spectacular <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> taking place from the masts and rigging of the ship.|$|R
6000|$|... 1465. I {{have avoided}} {{speaking}} of this well-known phenomenon {{more than was}} quite necessary, that I might bring together here what I have {{to say on the}} subject. When the <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> is observed in air at the positive and negative surfaces, there is a very remarkable difference, the true and full comprehension of which would, no doubt, be of the utmost importance to the physics of electricity; it would throw great light on our present subject, i.e. the molecular action of dielectrics under induction, and its consequences; and seems very open to, and accessible by, experimental inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... 1437. I {{consider}} <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> as {{probably a}} successive effect in this way. Discharge {{begins at the}} root (1426. 1553.), and, extending itself in succession to {{all parts of the}} single brush, continues to go on at the root and the previously formed parts until the whole brush is complete; then, by the fall in intensity and power at the conductor, it ceases at once in all parts, to be renewed, when that power has risen again to a sufficient degree. But in a spark, the particles in the line of discharge being, from the circumstances, nearly alike in their intensity of polarization, suffer discharge so nearly at the same moment as to make the time quite insensible to us.|$|E
6000|$|... 1584. With {{a drop of}} water, {{the effects}} were of the same kind, and were best {{obtained}} when a portion of gum water or of syrup hung from a ball (fig. 137.). When the machine was worked slowly, a fine large quiet conical drop, with concave lateral outline, and a small rounded end, was produced, on which the glow appeared, whilst a steady wind issued, in a direction {{from the point of}} the cone, of sufficient force to depress the surface of uninsulated water held opposite to the termination. When the machine was worked more rapidly some of the water was driven off; the smaller pointed portion left was roughish on the surface, and the sound of successive brush discharges was heard. With still more electricity, more water was dispersed; that which remained was elongated and contracted, with an alternating motion; a stronger <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> was heard, and the vibrations of the water and the successive discharges of the individual brushes were simultaneous. When water from beneath was brought towards the drop, it did not indicate the same regular strong contracted current of air as before; and when the distance was such that sparks passed, the water beneath was attracted rather than driven away, and the current of air ceased.|$|E
40|$|ODC {{solvents}} {{are used}} to clean many critical substrates during solid rocket motor production operations. Electrostatic charge generation incidental to these cleaning operations can pose a major safety issue. Therefore, while determining the acceptability of various ODC replacement cleaners, {{one aspect of the}} selection criteria included determining the extent of electric charge generation during a typical solvent cleaning operation. A total of six candidate replacement cleaners, sixteen critical substrates, and two types of cleaning swatch materials were studied in simulated cleaning operations. Charge generation and accumulation effects were investigated by measuring the peak voltage and <b>brush</b> <b>discharging</b> effects associated with each cleaning process combination. In some cases, charge generation was found to be very severe. Using the conductivity information for each cleaner, the peak voltage data could in some cases, be qualitatively predicted. Test results indicated that severe charging effects could result in <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> that could potentially result in flash fire hazards when occurring in close proximity to flammable vapor/air mixtures. Process controls to effectively mitigate these hazards are discussed...|$|R

Some of the devices {{look as though they}} are instruments of torture even without the application of electricity. The case enclosing the plates should not be opened except for repairs. The machine is operated by turning the crank counterclockwise as one looks at the front. A rotary switch at the center connects or disconnects the Leyden jars to the terminals.|$|R
40|$|High vacuum triboelectric {{testing of}} space {{materials}} {{was required to}} identify possible Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) concerns for the astronauts in space during electronics board replacement on the Hubble Space Telescope. Testing under high vacuum conditions with common materials resulted in some interesting results. Many materials were able to charge to high levels which did not dissipate quickly even when grounded. Certain materials were able to charge up in contact with grounded metals while others were not. An interesting result was that like materials did not exchange electrostatic charge under high vacuum conditions. The most surprising experimental result {{is the lack of}} <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> from charged insulators under high vacuum conditions...|$|R
6000|$|... 1687. I do not {{consider}} the powers when developed by the polarization as limited to two distinct points or spots {{on the surface of}} each particle to be considered as the poles of an axis, but as resident on large portions of that surface, as they are upon the surface of a conductor of sensible size when it is thrown into a polar state. But it is very probable, notwithstanding, that the particles of different bodies may present specific differences in this respect, the powers not being equally diffused though equal in quantity; other circumstances also, as form and quality, giving to each a peculiar polar relation. It is perhaps to the existence of some such differences as these that we may attribute the specific actions of the different dielectrics in relation to discharge(1394. 1508.). Thus with respect to oxygen and nitrogen singular contrasts were presented when spark and <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> were made to take place in these gases, as may be seen by reference to the Table in paragraph 1518 of the Thirteenth Series; for with nitrogen, when the small, negative or the large positive ball was rendered inductric, the effects corresponded with those which in oxygen were produced when the small positive or the large negative ball was rendered inductric.|$|E
60|$|There is {{a curious}} form of {{electrical}} discharge, somewhat similar to the fire-ball but on a smaller scale, which may {{be regarded as the}} exact opposite of the thunderbolt, inasmuch as it is always quite harmless. This is St. Elmo's fire, a brush of lambent light, which plays around the masts of ships and the tops of trees, when clouds are low and tension great. It is, in fact, the equivalent in nature of the <b>brush</b> <b>discharge</b> from an electric machine. The Greeks and Romans looked upon this lambent display {{as a sign of the}} presence of Castor and Pollux, 'fratres Helenæ, lucida sidera,' and held that its appearance was an omen of safety, as everybody who has read the 'Lays of Ancient Rome' must surely remember. The modern name, St. Elmo's fire, is itself a curiously twisted and perversely Christianised reminiscence of the great twin brethren; for St. Elmo is merely a corruption of Helena, made masculine and canonised by the grateful sailors. It was as Helen's brothers that they best knew the Dioscuri in the good old days of the upper empire; and when the new religion forbade them any longer to worship those vain heathen deities, they managed to hand over the flames at the masthead to an imaginary St. Elmo, whose protection stood them in just as good stead as that of the original alternate immortals.|$|E

5000|$|Both <b>brush</b> and corona <b>discharges</b> {{represent}} regions next to conductors {{where the}} air has ionized and become conductive, allowing current to leak into the air. They occur when the electric field at the conductor exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, the [...] "disruptive potential gradient", roughly 30 kilovolts per centimeter. At that voltage, electrons in the air are accelerated by the electric field to a high enough velocity that they knock other electrons off gas atoms when they hit them, creating ions and additional electrons, which go on to ionize additional atoms in a chain reaction. The electric field is highest at sharp points on the conductor, so discharges tend to form at these points. Because the electric field decreases as {{the distance from the}} conductor increases, it eventually drops below the value needed for ionization, so corona and <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> have a limited extent and are localized near the conductor.|$|R
5000|$|An Oudin coil, {{also called}} an Oudin {{oscillator}} or Oudin resonator, is a resonant transformer circuit that generates very high voltage, high frequency alternating current (AC) electricity at low current levels, [...] {{used in the}} obsolete medical field of electrotherapy {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. [...] It is very similar to a Tesla coil, with the difference being that the Oudin coil was connected as an autotransformer. [...] It was invented in 1893 by French physician Paul Marie Oudin as a modification of physician Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval's electrotherapy equipment and used in quack medicine until perhaps 1930. The high voltage output terminal of the coil was connected to an insulated handheld electrode which produced luminous <b>brush</b> <b>discharges,</b> which were applied to the patient's body to treat various medical conditions in electrotherapy.|$|R
5000|$|It {{might seem}} that the output voltage could be {{increased}} indefinitely by reducing [...] and [...] However, as the output voltage increases, it reaches {{the point where the}} air next to the high voltage terminal ionizes and air discharges; coronas, <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> and streamer arcs, break out from the terminal. This happens when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, about 30 kV per centimeter, and occurs first at sharp points and edges on the high voltage terminal. The resulting energy loss damps the oscillation, so the above lossless model is no longer accurate, and the voltage does not reach the theoretical maximum above.

50|$|Paul Marie Oudin (1851 - 1923) was a French {{physician}} and medical researcher. He was born, and later died, in Épinal. He conducted {{research in the}} Victorian era medical field of high frequency electrotherapy, the application of radio frequency electric currents to the body, and collaborated with {{the founder of the}} field, pioneering physiologist and biophysicist Dr. Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval. In 1893 he modified d'Arsonval's electrotherapy equipment by the addition of a wire coil resonator to produce higher potentials, inventing the Oudin coil. This device, very similar to a Tesla coil, could produce very high voltages from several hundred thousand to a million volts. In use, the <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> from a pointed electrode attached to the high voltage terminal of the coil would be played over various parts of the body to treat a variety of medical conditions.

5000|$|Many {{specialized}} {{types of}} electrodes {{were used to}} apply the current to {{various parts of the}} patient's body. These generally fell into two types. To apply <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> (called [...] "effluves") to the outside of the patient's body, electrodes consisting of one or more metal points on an insulating handle were used. Care had to be taken to keep these far enough from the body to prevent an arc to the skin, which could cause painful RF burns. To apply current directly to the body surface, as well as to tissues inside the patient's body through the mouth, rectum, or vagina, a vacuum tube [...] "condensing" [...] electrode was used. This consisted of a partially evacuated glass tube of various shapes, with an electrode sealed inside, attached to the high voltage wire. This produced a dramatic violet glow when energized. The glass envelope of the tube formed a capacitor with the patient's body through which the current had to pass, limiting it to safe values.|$|R

A metal rod, 0.3 of an inch in diameter, with a rounded end projecting into the air, was charged negatively, and gave a short noisy brush (fig. 122.). It was ascertained both by sight (1427. 1433.) and sound (1431.), that the successive discharges were very rapid in their recurrence, being seven or eight times more numerous in the same period, than those produced when the rod was charged positively to an equal degree. When the rod was positive, it was easy, by working the machine a little quicker, to replace the brush by a glow (1405. 1463.), but when it was negative no efforts could produce this change. Even by bringing the hand opposite the wire, the only effect was {{to increase the number of}} <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> in a given period, raising at the same time the sound to a higher pitch.|$|R

The radio frequency AC electric currents {{produced by a}} Tesla coil did not behave like the DC or low frequency AC current scientists of the time were familiar with. In lectures at Columbia College May 20, 1891, scientific societies in Britain and France during an 1892 European speaking tour, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia in February 1893, and the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis in March 1893, he impressed audiences with spectacular <b>brush</b> <b>discharges</b> and streamers, heated iron by induction heating, showed RF current could pass through insulators and be conducted by a single wire without a return path, and powered light bulbs and motors without wires. He demonstrated that high frequency currents often did not cause the sensation of electric shock, applying {{hundreds of thousands of}} volts to his own body, causing his body to light up with a glowing corona discharge in the darkened room.
