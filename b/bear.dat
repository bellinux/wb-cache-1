5|$|The {{subfamily}} Ursinae {{experienced a}} dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first {{members of the}} genus Ursus appeared around this time. The sloth <b>bear</b> is a modern survivor {{of one of the}} earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black <b>bear.</b> It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth <b>bear.</b> Two lineages evolved from U. minimus: the black bears (including the sun <b>bear,</b> the Asian black <b>bear,</b> and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar <b>bear).</b> Modern brown bears evolved from U. minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave <b>bear.</b> Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar <b>bear</b> is the most recently evolved species and descended from the brown <b>bear</b> around 400,000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|White Kermode <b>bears</b> are not albinos. Rather, a single, non-synonymous {{nucleotide}} substitution in the MC1R gene causes melanin {{to not be}} produced. This mutant gene is recessive, so Kermode <b>bears</b> {{with two}} copies of this mutant, nonfunctional gene appear white, while <b>bears</b> with one copy or no copies appear black. It is possible for two black <b>bears</b> to mate and produce a white cub if both of these black <b>bears</b> are heterozygous, carrying one copy of the mutant MC1R gene, and both mutant genes are inherited by the cub. Additional genetic studies found that white Kermode <b>bears</b> breed more with white Kermode <b>bears,</b> and black Kermode <b>bears</b> breed more with black Kermode <b>bears,</b> in a phenomenon known as positive assortative mating. One hypothesis is that this happens because young <b>bears</b> imprint on their mother's fur color.|$|R

The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar <b>bear</b> is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar <b>bear</b> kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar <b>bear</b> predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar <b>bear</b> predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} <b>bear</b> performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the <b>bear</b> will {{be less likely to}} continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
25|$|Kermode <b>bears</b> are {{omnivorous}} {{for most}} of the year, subsisting mainly on herbage and berries except during autumn salmon migrations, when they become obligate predators. During the day, white <b>bears</b> are 35% more successful than black <b>bears</b> in capturing salmon. Scientists have also found that salmon evade large, black models about twice as frequently as they evade large white models, giving white <b>bears</b> an advantage in salmon hunting. On some islands, white Kermode <b>bears</b> have more marine derived nutrients in their fur, indicating that white Kermode <b>bears</b> eat more salmon than the black Kermode <b>bears.</b>|$|R

40|$|Plasma lipids of polar <b>bears</b> are {{significant}} because these <b>bears</b> prefer to consume high quantities of fat; furthermore one population fasts {{each year for}} over four months.

In lipoproteins, the HDL (High Density Lipoproteins) triglyceride was very low as in human subjects in both fed and fasted animals. The other two, LDL (Low Density Lipoproteins) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoproteins) were consistently higher in fasted <b>bears</b> than in fed <b>bears,</b> and these fasted <b>bears</b> had much higher cholesterol and triglycerides than the fed <b>bears.</b> Since the fed <b>bears</b> seem to be protected against hyperlipidemia, the fatty acid composition of serum lipids was analyzed.
