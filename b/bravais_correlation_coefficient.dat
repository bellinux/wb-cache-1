In the first article, entitled ``On {{the relation between the}} phi-coefficient and the tetrachoric correlation coefficient'', we show that under given marginal probabilities there exists a continuous bijection between the two measures of association. Furthermore, we show that the bijection has a fixed point at zero for all marginal probabilities. Consequently, the choice of which of these measures of association to use is for all practical purposes a matter of preference only. In the second article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the tetrachoric correlation coefficient'', we generalize the tetrachoric <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> so that a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions can be assumed as underlying distributions. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the generalized tetrachoric <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> to be well defined for a given parametric family of bivariate distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects on the polychoric <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of different distributional assumptions. In the third article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the polychoric correlation coefficient'', we generalize the polychoric <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> to a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions, and show that the generalized and the conventional polychoric <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> agree on the family of bivariate normal distributions.
