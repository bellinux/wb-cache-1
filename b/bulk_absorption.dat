50|$|If a food {{containing}} {{even small}} but perceivable amount of sugar (simple sugars or disaccharides {{that can be}} tasted sweet, or starch that is at least minimally hydrolyzed by salivary amylase, or even some non-sugar sweeteners) is eaten in this state, {{there may be a}} period of time after it enters stomach and before <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> occurs, when continuous exercise becomes very hard, and easily triggers rhabdomyolysis. It probably happens because the digestive system senses and signals forthcoming delivery of sugars, inhibiting fatty acid release and oxidation, and starving glycogen-less muscle cells of the sole available source of energy. Even simple continuous exercise, like walking or washing dishes by hand right after the meal, may trigger rhabdomyolysis in the exercising muscles. This rhabdomyolysis is probably not of exertional, but of hypoglycemic nature, as loaded glycogen-less muscles can rapidly remove glucose from blood, and the normal mechanism of glucose homeostasis lacks the required responsiveness or capacity to prevent hypoglycemia. The broken down myocytes probably do not yield much glucose. Unlike the case with exertional rhabdomyolisys, there is no warning. At rest, however, the liver will effortlessly cover the whole body energy needs until absorption of carbohydrates occurs.|$|E
50|$|When a carbohydrate-rich {{food has}} been eaten before AMP has been {{eliminated}} from muscle cells, when <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> starts, plenty of glucose becomes {{available in the}} blood, is taken up by muscle cells, {{is added to the}} glycogen store, but then immediately becomes liberated by the still up-regulated myophosphorylase. The resulting excess of glucose is metabolized down to lactic acid (the body cannot increase aerobic metabolism in an instant), recharging all AMP to ATP. The lactate is dumped back into blood and urine. The higher the glycemic index of the food is, the greater proportion of carbohydrates (and calories) is wasted into urine. If the person is at rest at this moment, and pays attention, a sudden increase in the breathing frequency due to lactate dumping is readily observable. If the rise in the blood lactate is particularly sharp, and the person happened to be breathing slowly, a heart palpitation may sometimes be observable. The lactic acidosis with palpitation may also occur during sleep, if stomach emptying has been delayed e.g. due to digestion requirements of the food or its high volume, and the person went to sleep before absorption has started. In this case the person will be awaken in a state of distress, with rapid breathing. The person may recall seeing a nightmare. Delayed stomach emptying creates especially favorable conditions for the shock lactic acidosis, because the digestive system may meanwhile still inhibit fatty acid release and oxidation, helping more muscles to run out of glycogen in those persons, who are otherwise still able to maintain its stores between meals. It has been experimentally demonstrated, that delayed gastric emptying prolongs the duration of the GLP-1 signal.|$|E

Understanding the optical properties of "dirty" sea ice is important for analyzing remote sensing data and calculating energy balances. We designed a hyperspectral radiation instrument to observe the optical properties of sea ice. The results show that albedo peaks ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 85 and that the peaks shifted to a longer wavelength for high PM and CDOM concentrations. The absorption and scattering coefficients for sea ice were obtained. The <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient shows that <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> is primarily determined by PM and CDOM at shorter wavelengths, while pure ice and brine pockets become more important at longer wavelengths. Scattering coefficients for sea ice ranged from 197 to 1072 m(- 1), and showed consistent variations with gas bubble and brine pocket concentrations. The effects of PM and CDOM on the <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient of sea ice were studied. At 440 nm, particulates accounted for 55 - 98 % and CDOM accounted for 2 - 37 % of the <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption.</b> Ratios between particulate absorption and <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> for sea ice were almost constant from 400 to 550 nm, and began to decrease sharply for wavelengths > 550 nm.

For the quantitative analysis of absorbing-only (i. e., nonscattering) species present in a matrix that contains a particulate species that absorbs and scatters light, a method to eliminate particle effects completely is proposed here, which utilizes the particle size information contained in the bulk scattering coefficient extracted by using the Mie theory to carry out an additional correction step to remove particle effects from <b>bulk</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra. This should result in spectra that are equivalent to spectra collected with only the liquid species in the mixture.

40|$|In {{the marine}} fish {{intestine}} luminal, HCO 3 - can remove divalent ions (calcium and magnesium) by precipitation {{in the form}} of carbonate aggregates. The process of epithelial HCO 3 - secretion is under endocrine control, therefore, in this study we aimed to characterize the involvement of transmembrane (tmACs) and soluble (sACs) adenylyl cyclases on the regulation of bicarbonate secretion (BCS) and water absorption in the intestine of the sea bream (Sparus aurata). We observed that all sections of sea bream intestine are able to secrete bicarbonate as measured by pH–Stat in Ussing chambers. In addition, gut sac preparations reveal net water absorption in all segments of the intestine, with significantly higher absorption rates in the anterior intestine that in the rectum. BCS and water absorption are positively correlated in all regions of the sea bream intestinal tract. Furthermore, stimulation of tmACs (10 lM FK? 500 lM IBMX) causes a significant decrease in BCS, <b>bulk</b> water <b>absorption</b> and short circuit current (Isc) in a region dependent manner. In turn, stimulation of sACs with elevated HCO 3 - results in a significant increase in BCS, and <b>bulk</b> water <b>absorption</b> in the anterior intestine, an action completely reversed by the sAC inhibitor KH 7 (200 lM). Overall, the results reveal a functional relationship between BCS and water absorption in marine fish intestine and modulation by tmACs and sAC.
