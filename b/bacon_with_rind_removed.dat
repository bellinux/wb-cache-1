In response to increasing consumer diet-consciousness, some supermarkets also offer the loin section only. This is sold as 'short cut bacon' and is usually priced slightly higher than middle bacon.

25|$|Casu marzu {{is created}} by leaving whole {{pecorino}} cheeses outside with part of the <b>rind</b> <b>removed</b> to allow the eggs of the cheese fly Piophila casei to be laid in the cheese. A female P. casei can lay more than 500 eggs at one time. The eggs hatch and the larvae begin to eat through the cheese. The acid from the maggots' digestive system breaks down the cheese's fats, making {{the texture of the}} cheese very soft; by the time it is ready for consumption, a typical casu marzu will contain thousands of these maggots.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of ripening process on Trapist cheeseabatement, taken into account on cheese yield calculation, was investigated. Three different ripening processes were investigated: ripening process <b>with</b> <b>rind</b> washing and without protecting coating application, ripening process with protecting coating application and cheese ripening in plastic shrinkable pouch. The highest abatement {{was found in the}} case of cheese ripening on traditional way i. e. without protecting coating applied and <b>with</b> <b>rind</b> washing during ripening period. Slightly lower abatement value showed cheeses with protecting coating applied, while the negligible abatement was noticed in cheese packaged into a pouch. The highest abatement values were noticed during the first 10 days of cheese ripening process with and without protective coating applied. After that time the steady state of abatement value was reached. In this case slightly higher values were obtained in the case of cheeses with protective coating. It is evident that the highest influence on abatement value is during the first phase of Trapist cheese ripening process...|$|R
