5|$|Kepler-11 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 14.2, and thus cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.9; in other words, {{as seen from}} Earth, Kepler-8 is an extremely dim star. It cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|The star's {{apparent}} magnitude is 13.4, {{meaning that it}} cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|The star's {{apparent}} magnitude, or how bright {{it appears}} from Earth's perspective, is 4.09. Therefore, Upsilon Andromedae can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the naked eye.|$|E
50|$|Some eclipses {{are longer}} when the Earth is {{slightly}} closer (on Earth, the Moon <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> its apparent diameter {{is larger than}} the sun's), some eclipses are shorter when the Earth is slightly further (on Earth, the Moon <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> its apparent diameter is smaller than the sun's).|$|R

5|$|GJ 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years) {{away from the}} Earth, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the unaided eye. The star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies {{at a distance of}} 14.7 parsecs (47.95 light years).|$|E
5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades through a telescope. He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.|$|E
5|$|IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is {{a binary}} star {{system in the}} {{constellation}} Pegasus. It is just luminous enough to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the unaided eye, {{at a distance of}} about 150 light years from the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-40 lies 2700 parsecs (8,806.4 light years) {{away from}} Earth, further than any star (with a known distance) with an {{exoplanet}} previously discovered by Kepler. With an apparent magnitude of 14.58, {{it was also}} dimmer than any star previously recognized by Kepler. Because of its low apparent magnitude, Kepler-40 cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>with</b> the naked eye.|$|E
