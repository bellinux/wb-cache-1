The Project called for the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to determine whether <b>Brown</b> <b>had</b> violated House Rule 10. One of the complaints was that Brown's adult daughter, Shantrel <b>Brown,</b> <b>had</b> received a luxury automobile as a gift from an agent of a Gambian millionaire named Foutanga Sissoko. Sissoko, a friend of Congresswoman <b>Brown,</b> <b>had</b> been imprisoned in Miami after pleading guilty to charges of bribing a customs officer. <b>Brown</b> <b>had</b> worked to secure his release, pressuring U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to deport Sissoko back to his homeland {{as an alternative to}} continued incarceration.
