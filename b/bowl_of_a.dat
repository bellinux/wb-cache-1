[...] Later in the episode, Lois sees him as a desperate, jittery addict, seated in a {{bathroom}} stall of the rehab center trying to make a cookie by holding raw dough in the <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spoon over a lighter flame as if it were heroin. In another episode, Lois sees Stewie dialing a real phone and mistakes it for a Sesame Street phone.|$|E
2500|$|Spoon bits {{consist of}} a grooved shank with a point shaped {{somewhat}} like the <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spoon, with the cutting edge on the end. The more common type is like a gouge bit that ends in a slight point. This is helpful for starting the hole, as it has a center that will not wander or walk. [...] These bits are used by chair-makers for boring or reaming holes in the seats and arms of chairs. Their design is ancient, going back to Roman times. Spoon bits have even been found in Viking excavations. Modern spoon bits are made of hand-forged carbon steel, carefully heat-treated and then hand ground to a fine edge.|$|E

60|$|But our brief {{hour was}} drawing to an end. We were now passing little groups of country people and {{children}} in the quiet evening. We ourselves talked no more. The old pony plodded up yet another hill; we went clattering down its deep descent; and there, in the green <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meadow sloping down from its woody fringes above, lay scattered the bellying booths, the gaudy wagons and cages of the circus. All but hidden in the trees above them, a crooked, tarnished weather-cock glinted in the sunset afterglow. Lights twinkled against the dying daylight. The bright-painted merry-go-round with its staring, motionless, galloping horses was bathed in the shine of its flares, a thin plume of steam softly ascending from its brass-rimmed funnel.|$|E
60|$|It {{is quite}} beside the {{question}} to ask which is the better. Neither is. They are different things: that's all.

The American paper is for reading by a man hanging on the straps of a clattering subway express, by a man eating at a lunch counter, by a man standing on one leg, by a man getting a two-minute shave, or by a man about to have his teeth drawn by a dentist.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to orthodox cricket rules, an extra ball is not awarded following a wide or no-ball, {{in order to}} save time. Instead, two runs are added to the score instead of the usual one run.

60|$|There was a {{very small}} grate, made of {{cast-iron}} in one piece and painted buff, and a still smaller misfit of a cast-iron fender that confessed the gray stone of the hearth. No fire was laid, only a few scraps of torn paper and the <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> broken corn-cob pipe were visible behind the bars, and {{in the corner and}} rather thrust away was an angular japanned coal-box with a damaged hinge. It was the custom in those days to warm every room separately from a separate fireplace, more prolific of dirt than heat, and the rickety sash window, the small chimney, and the loose-fitting door were expected to organize the ventilation of the room among themselves without any further direction.|$|E
60|$|Not {{a little}} {{relieved}} by the discovery, our adventurer paused, more particularly to survey so deceptive an object, {{which seemed to}} have been constructed on the most efficient principles; probably by some broken down wax figure costumer. It comprised the complete wardrobe of a scarecrow, namely: a cocked hat, bunged; tattered coat; old velveteen breeches; and long worsted stockings, full of holes; all stuffed very nicely with straw, and skeletoned by a frame-work of poles. There was a great flapped pocket to the coat--which {{seemed to have been}} some laborer's--standing invitingly opened. Putting his hands in, Israel drew out the lid of an old tobacco-box, the broken <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pipe, two rusty nails, and a few kernels of wheat. This reminded him of the Squire's pockets. Trying them, he produced a handsome handkerchief, a spectacle-case, with a purse containing some silver and gold, amounting to a little more than five pounds. Such is the difference between the contents of the pockets of scarecrows and the pockets of well-to-do squires. Ere donning his present habiliments, Israel had not omitted to withdraw his own money from his own coat, {{and put it in the}} pocket of his own waistcoat, which he had not exchanged.|$|E
60|$|The {{second of}} Chanticleer's two wives, ever since Phoebe's arrival, {{had been in}} a state of heavy despondency, caused, as it {{afterwards}} appeared, by her inability to lay an egg. One day, however, by her self-important gait, the sideways turn of her head, and the cock of her eye, as she pried into one and another nook of the garden,--croaking to herself, all the while, with inexpressible complacency,--it was made evident that this identical hen, much as mankind undervalued her, carried something about her person the worth of which was not to be estimated either in gold or precious stones. Shortly after, there was a prodigious cackling and gratulation of Chanticleer and all his family, including the wizened chicken, who appeared to understand the matter quite as well as did his sire, his mother, or his aunt. That afternoon Phoebe found a diminutive egg,--not in the regular nest, it was far too precious to be trusted there,--but cunningly hidden under the currant-bushes, on some dry stalks of last year's grass. Hepzibah, on learning the fact, took possession of the egg and appropriated it to Clifford's breakfast, on account of a certain delicacy of flavor, for which, as she affirmed, these eggs had always been famous. Thus unscrupulously did the old gentlewoman sacrifice the continuance, perhaps, of an ancient feathered race, with no better end than to supply her brother with a dainty that hardly filled the <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tea-spoon! It must have been in reference to this outrage that Chanticleer, the next day, accompanied by the bereaved mother of the egg, took his post in front of Phoebe and Clifford, and delivered himself of a harangue that might have proved as long as his own pedigree, but for a fit of merriment on Phoebe's part. Hereupon, the offended fowl stalked away on his long stilts, and utterly withdrew his notice from Phoebe and the rest of human nature, until she made her peace with an offering of spice-cake, which, next to snails, was the delicacy most in favor with his aristocratic taste.|$|E
