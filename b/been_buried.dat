5|$|The Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties saw an {{increase}} in the number of burials (both here and in the Valley of the Queens), with Ramesses II and later Ramesses III constructing a massive tomb that was used for the burial of their sons (KV5 and KV3 respectively). There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located: Thutmose II may have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in Dra' Abu el-Naga' (although his mummy was in the Deir el-Bahri tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and Ramesses VIII seems to have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> without a left leg.|$|E
5|$|Home Army {{arms and}} {{equipment}} came mostly from four sources: arms that had <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 invasion of Poland; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the monks}} <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in the cloisters' crypt. The Cistercian monks <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> {{directly}} in the ground (without a coffin) and face down. The abbots <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in the chapter house.|$|R

5|$|In 1929 {{a section}} of the LNC's land at Brookwood was set aside as Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial, the sole burial ground in Britain for US {{military}} casualties of the First World War. As most US casualties had occurred in continental Europe and <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> there the number interred at Brookwood was small, with a total of 468 servicemen buried in the cemetery. After the entry of the United States into the Second World War the American cemetery was enlarged, with burials of US servicemen beginning in April 1942. With large numbers of American personnel based in the west of England, a dedicated rail service for the transport of bodies operated from Devonport to Brookwood. By August 1944 over 3,600 bodies had <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in the American Military Cemetery. At this time burials were discontinued, and US casualties were from then on buried at Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a {{magnificent}} ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although Rædwald is usually {{considered to have}} <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> with the ship (or commemorated by it), another possibility is Eorpwald. Alternatively, he might also have had his own ship-burial nearby.|$|E
5|$|Menkauhor Kaiu built {{a pyramid}} in North-Saqqara, thereby abandoning the royal {{necropolis}} of Abusir, where kings of the Fifth Dynasty had <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> since {{the reign of}} Sahure, some 80 years earlier. The reason for this choice {{may be that the}} Abusir plateau had become overcrowded by the beginning of Menkauhor's reign.|$|E

5|$|Some of Wallace's friends {{suggested}} that he be buried in Westminster Abbey, but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at Broadstone, Dorset.

5|$|The {{fragment}} {{was found}} by itself in the topsoil near Roskilde.

5|$|The helmet {{was found}} {{along with some}} 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30–50, the largest {{assemblage}} of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain. They had <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> at what {{appears to have been}} a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were from pigs. Many appear to have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade, with a possible processional way leading up to it. In Roman times it would have been located in the territory of the Corieltauvi, who inhabited an area of the East Midlands stretching from Northamptonshire to Lincolnshire.|$|E

5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|According to the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims, he {{was buried}} in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in the Franciscan church {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis of Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.|$|E

5|$|Excavations of Iron Age {{sites have}} {{recovered}} horse bones from ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, {{including one of}} a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack. The majority of Iron Age chariot burials in Britain {{are associated with the}} Arras culture, and in most cases the chariots were dismantled before burial. Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{demolition}} of the tomb's chamber, some of the sarsens around the monument had <b>been</b> <b>buried,</b> while others had been left visible. Various buildings in Addington are partly made out of sarsen stone, {{some of which may}} have been removed from the long barrow. Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.|$|E
5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which had had to be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.|$|E
