50|$|A <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> {{manifold}} {{with one}} block valve and one bleed valve {{is also known}} as an isolation valve or <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> valve; a <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> manifold with multiple valves {{is also known as}} an isolation manifold. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> {{manifold}} is {{a hydraulic}} manifold that combines {{one or more}} block/isolate valves, usually ball valves, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or needle valves, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, gauges, switches, etc.) of a hydraulic (fluid) system. The purpose of the <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components {{of the system that}} are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold. For example, a <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component’s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) causes fibrinogen proteo-lysis when a 2 -antiplasmin levels fall, {{and this}} may contribute to t-PA-induced hemorrhage. Because clot-bound plasmin is pro-tected from a 2 -antiplasmin inhibition, we tested {{the possibility that a}} 2 -antiplasmin supplementation would <b>block</b> t-PA-in-duced fibrinogenolysis <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> without affecting thrombol-ysis. When added to human or rabbit plasma, a 2 -antiplasmin inhibits t-PA-induced fibrinogenolysis, but has little effect on the lysis of 1251 -fibrin clots. To examine its effect in vivo, rab-bits with preformed 125 I-labeled-jugular vein thrombi were ran-domized to receive t-PA, t-PA and a 2 -antiplasmin, or saline. a 2 -Antiplasmin infusion produced a modest decrease in t-PA-induced thrombolysis (from 40. 2 % to 30. 1 %, P = 0. 12), but reduced fibrinogen consumption from 87 % to 27 % (P = 0. 0001), and decreased blood loss from standardized ear in-cisions from 5, 594 to 656,ul (P < 0. 0001). We hypothesize that a 2 -antiplasmin limits t-PA-induced hemorrhage by inhibit-ing fibrinogenolysis and subsequent fragment X formation be-cause (a) SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis indicate less fragment X formation in a 2 -antiplasmin treated animals, and (b) when added to a solution of fibrinogen and plasminogen clotted with thrombin in the presence of t-PA, fragment X shortens the lysis time in a concentration-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that fragment X incorporation into he-mostatic plugs contributes to t-PA-induced bleeding. By block-ing t-PA-mediated fibrinogenolysis, a 2 -antiplasmin supple-mentation may improve the safety of fibrin-specific plasmino...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} in using a Double <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> Valve. Significantly, {{because all the}} valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.|$|E
50|$|Considering the {{operations}} and procedures executed before an operator can intervene, the Double <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> manifold offers further advantages over the traditional hook up. Due to {{the volume of}} the cavity between the two balls being so small, the operator is afforded the opportunity to evacuate this space efficiently thereby quickly establishing a safe working environment.|$|E
50|$|This design {{also has}} {{operational}} advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the double <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> {{section of the}} pipeline. Because the valves are full bore with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems.|$|E

50|$|This type of Double <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> Valves (DBB Valves) {{feature the}} {{traditional}} style of flange-by-flange type valve {{and is available}} with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system {{it is to be}} installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required.|$|E
50|$|This type of Double <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> Valves have a {{patented}} design which incorporates two {{ball valves}} and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration {{is that the}} valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline {{without the need for}} any pipeline re-working.|$|E
50|$|These valves replace {{existing}} traditional techniques {{employed by}} pipeline engineers {{to generate a}} double <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation. DBB valves {{do the work of}} three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight.|$|E

40|$|On October 23, 2007, the {{operations}} team began a procedure {{to sample the}} Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) storage vessels ("tanks"), and associated transfer system. This procedure was being performed to determine the conditions within the system, and if necessary, to purge the system of any excess Gaseous Hydrogen (GH 2) in preparation for reactivation of the system. The system had not been used since 2003. The LH 2 storage system contains two (2) spherical pressure vessels of 225, 000 gallons in volume, with a maximum working pressure (MAWP) of 50 psig. Eight inch transfer piping connects them to the usage point. Operations began with activation of the burnstack for the LH 2 storage area. Pneumatic (GN 2) systems in the storage area were then activated and checked. Pressurization of storage tank number 1 with gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) was initiated, with a target pressure of 10 psig, at which point samples were planned to be taken. At 5 psig, a loud noise was heard in the upper area of tank number 2. Smoke was seen exiting the burnstack and from the insulation on vent lines for both tanks. At this time tank number 1 was vented and the pressurization system was secured. The mishap resulted in physical damage to both storage tanks, {{as well as to}} some of the piping for both tanks. Corrective action included repair of the damaged hardware by a qualified contractor. Preventive action included documented organizational policy and procedures for establishing standby and mothball conditions for facilities and equipment, including provisions as detailed in the investigation report recommendations: Recommendation 1 : The using organization should define necessary activities in order to place hydrogen systems in long term periods of inactivity. The defined activities should address requirements for rendering inert, isolation (i. e., physical disconnect, double <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed,</b> etc.) and periodic monitoring. Recommendation 2 : The using organization should develop a process to periodically monitor hazardous systems for proper configuration (i. e., a daily/weekly/monthly check sheet to verify critical purges are active) ...|$|E

It was found that the feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates applied in the different cultures could be divided into two regions based on the viable-cell density and cell-cycle distribution. The cultures in the first region, low feed rates (0. 5 and 1. 0 d 1) combined with low bleed rates (0. 05 and 0. 10 d 1), were nutrient-limited, as an increase in the feed rate resulted in an increase in the viable-cell density.
