50|$|The {{first use}} of {{chemical}} castration occurred in 1944, when diethylstilbestrol was used {{with the purpose of}} lowering men's testosterone. The antipsychotic agent <b>benperidol</b> is sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who display inappropriate sexual behavior, and can likewise be given by depot injection. But <b>benperidol</b> does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.Chemical castration is often seen as an easier alternative to life imprisonment or the death penalty because it allows the release of sex offenders while reducing or eliminating the chance that they reoffend.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{investigation}} {{showed that}} intracerebral radioactivity concentrations can reliably be quantified in vivo with a smallanimal PET device. The {{purpose of the}} current study was to investigate the binding characteristics of the D 2 receptor radioligand 18 F-(3 -N-methyl) <b>benperidol</b> (18 FMB) in rat striatum by determining receptor density (B max) and affinity (K d) in vivo. For validation, K d and B max additionally were determined in vitro using storage phosphor autoradiography. Methods: Striatal radioactivity was measured with PET in 8 Sprague–Dawley rats after injection of 18 FMB in increasing specific activities. Free radioligand concentrations were estimated from cortical radioactivity concentrations and were subtracted from striatal radioactivity concentrations to obtain specific binding. In vitro saturation experiments were performed on 7 further rats according to the isotopic dilution method. Specific binding was determine...|$|E

For this, the radiotracer concentrations obtained in the same animals with PET and with autoradiography were quantified, and the correspondence between both methods was assessed by means of correlation analysis. Methods: Striatal radioactivity was measured in 10 Sprague–Dawley rats after injection of 60 � 10 MBq of the dopamine D 2 receptor ligand 18 F-(N-methyl) <b>benperidol</b> in 6 time frames of 6 min each.

40|$|A {{range of}} neuroleptics, non-neuroleptic phenothiazines and {{antidepressants}} were tested {{for their ability}} to inhibit purified rabbit lung indoleamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) and to modify the metabolism of [3 H]bufotenin administered intraventricularly. <b>Benperidol</b> and droperidol proved to be the most potent inhibitors of INMT among the compounds tested. On the other hand trifluperidol and haloperidol showed no inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 2. 5 mM, while chlorpromazine, thioridazine, pericyazine and perphenazine were effective only at 250 μM or 2. 5 mM. Oxidative deamination was shown to be an important pathway in normal rat brain for the metabolism of bufotenin. Of the drugs tested only chlorpromazine elevated the brain [3 H]bufotenin/[3 H]- 5 -HIAA ratio whereas pimozide and thiothixene caused a decrease. These findings suggest that neuroleptic drugs in general do not exert their anti-psychotic effects by inhibiting the synthesis or accelerating the oxidative deamination of N,N-dimethylated indoleamines.

40|$|Animal {{research}} {{finds that}} insulin regulates dopamine signaling and reward behavior, but similar research in humans is lacking. We investigated whether {{individual differences in}} body mass index, percent body fat, pancreatic β-cell function, and dopamine D 2 receptor binding were related to reward discounting in obese and non-obese adult men and women. Obese (n = 27; body mass index> 30) and non-obese (n = 20; body mass index< 30) adults were assessed for percent body fat with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and for β-cell function using disposition index. Choice of larger, but delayed or less certain, monetary rewards rela-tive to immediate, certain smaller monetary rewards was measured using delayed and proba-bilistic reward discounting tasks. Positron emission tomography using a non-displaceable D 2 -specific radioligand, [11 C](N-methyl) <b>benperidol</b> quantified striatal D 2 receptor binding. Groups differed in bodymass index, percent body fat, and disposition index, but not in striatal D 2 receptor specific binding or reward discounting.

40|$|Separate {{groups of}} rats {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} the narcotic agonist-antagonist, cyclazocine (1. 25 mg/kg), from saline or the pure narcotic agonist, morphine (10 mg/kg), from saline. In the cyclazocine discriminating animals, the interoceptive stimuli produced by cyclazocine {{were found to be}} dose related and largely based on central opiate systems in that these effects were reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The discriminative stimulus produced by cyclazocine was found to be completely generalized to nalorphine, ethylketocyclazocine, pentazocine and morphine while a lesser degree of generalization was seen to the experimental compounds, U- 49, 274 A and U- 50, 788 E. The cyclazocine discriminative stimulus did not generalize to apomorphine, d-amphetamine, haloperidol, d-butaclamol, 1 -butaclamol, clonidine, desipramine, amitriptyline, aceperone and butorphanol. Cyclazocine generalization to morphine was completely antagonized by naloxone at a dose one-twentieth that required to antagonize the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus itself. At no dose tested did naloxone completely antagonize cyclazocine generalization to nalorphine. A possible dopaminergic component of the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by attenuation of stimulus strength with the neuroleptics haloperidol, <b>benperidol</b> and d-butaclamol. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine was also found to be a dose related effect based upon central opiate mechanisms as demonstrated by naloxone reversibility. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine only partially generalized to cyclazocine and ethylketocyclazocine. Naloxone antagonized the generalization of morphine to cyclazocine but at a dose four times that required to antagonize the morphine discriminative stimulus itself. A possible dopaminergic component of the morphine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by haloperidol attenuation of stimulus strength. Cyclazocine analgesia, demonstrated using the mouse tail flick procedure, was found to be maximal approximately five minutes following cyclazocine administration. Some analgesic potency was also ~easurable 35 minutes post cyclazocine. The analgesic effects of cyclazocine were found to be reversed by naloxone. Pretreatment with the neuroleptics oxiperomide, clozapine and dexclamol before cyclazocine was found to enhance the analgesic potency of cyclazocine...|$|E
40|$|Narcotic {{dependence}} {{was established}} by continuous intravenous infusion of gradually increasing doses of morphine. Several days at the terminal concentration of morphine (100 mg/kg/day) was allowed prior to withdrawal. Morphine withdrawal body shakes were reliably observed upon the termination of continuous morphine infusion. The administration of morphine, methadone or _fentanyl, potent narcotic drugs, reliably abolished the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes 8 hours after the termination of morphine infusion. The narcotic antagonist naloxone or pentazocine had no {{significant effect on the}} rate of occurrence of withdrawal body shakes; however, there was a slight trend towards an increase in the frequency of this withdrawal index. A wide variety of neuroleptics were investigated for their ability to reduce withdrawal. The order of potency for reduction of withdrawal body shakes on a mg/kg basis for those neuroleptics tested was spiperone, <b>benperidol,</b> butaclarriol, loxapine, oxiperomide, haloperidol, spiramide, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, pimozide and pipamperone. The dopaminergic agonists amphetamine, apomorphine and L-IX 3 ̆ePA were also found to dose dependently reduce withdrawal• body shakes. Azaperone, a butyrophenone possessing high alpha noradrenergic blocking potency, reduces withdrawal body shakes in a dose related manner, while the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine and the beta adrenergic blocker propronalol failed to reduce withdrawal shakes to any significant extent. Dose dependent decreases in morphine withdrawal body shakes were produced by clonidine and desmethylimipramine, adrenergic agonists. Reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine also reduced withdrawal shakes, but the effect was dose dependent for only reserpine. The serotoninergic agents fluoxetine, 5 -HTP and methysergide were without effect on the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes at the doses tested. A slight but non-significant increase in the rate of withdrawal shakes was observed after the administration of the anticholinergic drugs atropine, benztropine, dexetimide and scopolamine. Conversely, the cholinergic agonists physostigmine and pilocarpine, reduced withdrawal body shakes in a dose related fashion. Modification of gabaminergic system by the administration of bicuculline, depakene and picrotoxin had no significant effect. Chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital, sedativehypnotic agents, did not produce dose dependent effects on the occurrence of withdrawal shakes. However, the highest dose of each sedative hypnotic employed did reduce withdrawal body shakes. The exact mechanism by which neuroleptics reduce withdrawal is not known. Manipulation of each of the transmitters effect by neuroleptics indicates that dopamine and acetylcholine are involved in mediating the reduction in withdrawal body shakes. The fact that the antiwithdrawal activity of certain neuroleptics is reversed by the narcotic antagonist naloxone implicates opiate receptor mechanisms. However, not all neuroleptics were antagonized by naloxone, suggesting that neuroleptics may be working at more than one site to reduce withdrawal. Thus neuroleptics may be reducing withdrawal body shakes by several different mechanisms. The data gathered from these studies suggest a role for cholinergic, dopaminergic and narcotic mechanisms in the antiwithdrawal activity of neuroleptic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or <b>benperidol</b> or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
