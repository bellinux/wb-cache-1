5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{to the brain}} or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why {{this might be the}} case.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Systemic {{hemodynamics}} {{and regional}} myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were determined in 18 miniswine {{during the development}} of pressure-overload hypertrophy induced by supravalvular aortic constriction. Nine miniswine served as control animals. Regional myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were measured at rest and during exercise stress with radioactive microspheres after 2 days and 1 month of aortic constriction. Exercise stress, causing the heart rate to increase to 85 % of its maximum, was imposed twice weekly for 5 minutes on 13 pressure-overloaded animals to elicit differences between the control and experimental groups that might not occur at rest. At rest, regional myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> of pressure-overloaded animals {{were similar to those}} of control animals. When exercise stress was imposed after 2 days and 1 month of pressure overload, endocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> decreased 45 % below control exercise levels, although epicardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were unchanged. During the first 2 weeks of pressure overload epicardial and endocardial electrocardiograms showed S-T segment elevation with exercise stress but not at rest. Postmortem examinations after 1 month of pressure overload showed significant histologic evidence of myocardial injury, namely, fibrosis, which was subendocardially located. These findings indicate that the pressure-overloaded heart is at risk for ischemic injury, particularly during the early, uncompensated stage...|$|R
5|$|The {{flavonoids}} {{found in}} the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also {{have a positive effect}} on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after drinking a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
40|$|Experimentally acute {{exposure}} to whole-body vibration resulted in changes in myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> {{in the in}} vivo dog. Regional myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> measured by a hydrogen gas clearance method were increased at a vibration frequency of 120 Hz and decreased at 50 Hz. No appreciable changes were found in presence of a beta-adrenergic blocker. The values of plasma cyclic nucleotides were increased at both frequencies of vibration, more at 50 Hz than at 120 Hz. No significant changes were observed in heart rates and arterial pressure during and after vibration load. These findings suggest that increased myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> in response to vibration may be related more to the frequency of vibration than to beta-adrenergic actions...|$|R

5|$|The lungs {{of birds}} contain {{millions}} of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. Small sacs called atria radiate {{from the walls}} of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. The <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on the right).|$|E
5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
