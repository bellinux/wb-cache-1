5|$|In {{the last}} 16 of the competition, Luton faced Ipswich Town of the Second Division. Without several senior players because of ineligibility and injury, Luton scored early through Brian Stein's strike, and then {{produced}} a solid defensive performance, reliant on goalkeeper Les Sealey {{to earn a}} place in the quarter-finals. The result marked Ipswich's first defeat of the season, having earlier recorded 10 wins and two draws at Portman Road. Luton hosted Bradford City in the fifth round of the competition on 19 January 1988. A mistake by Bradford goalkeeper Paul Tomlinson handed Luton the lead four minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> when he gave away a free kick for handling the ball in his area. A shot from Danny Wilson in the 65th minute resulted in Luton's second goal; though his effort was saved by Tomlinson, the goalkeeper could not fend off the advancing Harford's header.|$|E

5|$|Radamel Falcao {{replaced}} Rémy {{after the}} break and his long-range shot in the 48th minute was blocked. Although Chelsea started the half well, it was Arsenal who fashioned the notable chances <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark. In the 50th minute Santi Cazorla attempted to thread the ball through Chelsea's defence for Walcott to reach but his pass was cleared. Two minutes later Coquelin over-hit his pass which was directed to Özil, who roamed freely. Chelsea made another change, this time Oscar in place of Ramires in the 53rd minute. Seven minutes later Chelsea came close to scoring when Eden Hazard managed to evade his markers, but through on goal failed to get his shot on target, hitting over. Azpilicueta was shown the game's first yellow card for pulling Oxlade-Chamberlain back; Mourinho {{made the decision to}} substitute him with Kurt Zouma in the 69th minute. Giroud came on for Walcott moments before, and immediately was involved in the action, shooting high and then from long range.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Peter Kingdom, {{a small-town}} {{solicitor}} whose work revolves around cases {{brought by the}} eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed suicide. Each week there are further indications {{that he did not}} die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.|$|E
25|$|For {{the fifth}} round, Arsenal was drawn against Liverpool at home. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring {{within the first}} 15 minutes, before Podolski doubled their lead. Steven Gerrard scored a penalty just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, making the final score 2–1.|$|E

Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.|$|E
25|$|Bolton {{visited the}} Riverside {{still in the}} relegation battle, while the home side {{had the chance to}} make {{themselves}} mathematically safe with a victory. Gary O'Neil, suspended anyway for this match and the next, was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with an injury and was replaced by Tuncay. Ross Turnbull was given a chance in goal after Mark Schwarzer was ruled out with a back problem. Boro dominated the opening minutes of first half, but went in for half time level. Bolton performed much better in the second half, and Boro much worse. Though the home side were denied a penalty shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> the visitors took the 1–0 lead shortly after through Gavin McCann.|$|E
25|$|On Holy Saturday, Parma {{travelled}} to Udinese to face ex-employee Francesco Guidolin's charges. Udinese {{started the}} game well, {{but the first}} half was an even affair. Udinese {{might have had a}} man sent off when Giovinco was fouled when through on goal, but Roberto Pereyra was only booked. Udinese took the lead on the stroke of half-time with a calm finish from Kwadwo Asamoah. Antonio Di Natale doubled the lead just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, but it was Parma who continued to press. The away side's reward eventually came from a corner and captain Alessandro Lucarelli's calm finish from close range. As Parma looked for an equaliser, Udinese broke and Asamoah sealed victory with his second goal of the afternoon. Unlikely victories for Lecce against Roma and Fiorentina against Milan meant Parma were dragged back into the relegation fight.|$|E

25|$|The final was {{a repeat}} of the opening game of the tournament and Portugal were hoping to avenge their opening day loss. Portugal furiously {{attacked}} and dominated the possession but once again, sturdy defending and goalkeeping from Greece kept the Portuguese hosts off the scoreboard. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, Greece earned a corner kick from which Angelos Charisteas scored. Portugal continued to press after the goal but even with five minutes of injury time they could not find an equaliser. Greece won the match 1–0 and were crowned European champions, a title that they were given a 150–1 chance of winning before the tournament. All of Greece's wins in the knockout stage came in an identical manner: a 1–0 win, with the goal being a header off a cross from the right wing. Portugal became the first host nation to lose in a European Championship final.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Fire of 1405, {{the tower}} was {{completely}} burned out. The structural damage {{would not be}} completely repaired until 1983. The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was installed above the gate. This clock, together with a bell cast in 1405, gave the tower the name of Zytglogge. In the late fifteenth century the tower was decorated with four decorative corner towerlets and heraldic symbols. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state in 1527–1530. In addition to the astronomical clock, the Zytglogge features a group of mechanical figures. At three minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> the figures which include a rooster, a fool, a knight, a piper, a lion and bears, put on a show. The animals chase each other around, the fool rings his bells and the rooster caws. During the day {{it is common to}} see small crowds gathered around the foot of the Zytglogge waiting for the show to start.|$|E
25|$|With {{the club}} in 11th place in the league table, Southampton hosted West Ham United just a {{position}} below them on equal points on 13 April. The game was a largely scrappy affair in difficult weather conditions, and both the home side and the away side enjoyed early chances – a shot by Rickie Lambert from a corner was deflected onto the post by United goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen, and winger Ricardo Vaz Tê was denied by the crossbar. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, however, the Saints finally broke the deadlock when Gastón Ramírez found himself free of the West Ham defence and, on the second attempt, slotted {{the ball into the}} visitors' net. The lead was sacrificed just seven minutes later, as a Jos Hooiveld-conceded free kick was scored scrappily by Andy Carroll to put the Hammers in with a chance of points. Jay Rodriguez and Jason Puncheon were introduced later in the match, which helped the home side, but it was not enough to overcome a resilient West Ham side and obtain all three points.|$|E

25|$|On 18 December, Parma hosted Lecce in a {{match that}} was set {{to be the last}} before Christmas break, but the re-organised Matchday 1 game was now to be played during the week that followed. Jonathan Biabiany's 18th minute run into the box was halted unfairly by the Lecce defence, leading to a chance from the spot for Sergio Floccari who duly {{converted}} to bag his first goal for the club. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, David Di Michele scored from short range to level the scores, before scoring a magnificent second with a spectacular bicycle kick {{from the edge of the}} penalty area three minutes later. Juan Cuadrado then scored Lecce's third with 13 minutes left in the game with a fine left-footed effort blasted past Antonio Mirante, who was making his 200th professional appearance, as Parma looked down the barrel at another game without a win. A goalkeeping error three minutes from full-time allowed Graziano Pellè to reduce the deficit, his first goal for the club. Deep into injury time, the ball fell to Daniele Galloppa following a poorly cleared corner and he rifled it him to salvage a third consecutive draw for the Ducali.|$|E
25|$|Portugal and the Netherlands {{faced each}} other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark Maniche made it 2–0 for Portugal with a {{spectacular}} goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope. Portugal came close to scoring a third goal that was only stopped by Wilfred Bouma's blocking attempt. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts, after their opening day failure, were through to the final of their European Championship. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favorites to take the trophy, having won all four games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless, until the dying moments {{of the first half of}} extra-time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech has {{a number}} of legends and {{tradition}}s, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters [...] "TECH" [...] hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.

500|$|The 2004 {{edition of}} the FA Community Shield, was contested between Manchester United and Arsenal at the Millennium Stadium on 8 August. Cesc Fàbregas started {{alongside}} Gilberto Silva in midfield for Arsenal as Vieira was absent, while Thierry Henry partnered Dennis Bergkamp up front. After a goalless first half, Arsenal took the lead when Gilberto scored in the 50th minute. Manchester United equalised through Alan Smith five minutes after, but José Antonio Reyes restored Arsenal's advantage two minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark. Mikaël Silvestre scored an own goal 11 minutes before the end to give Arsenal a 3–1 victory. Wenger praised Fàbregas's performance after the match, describing the midfielder as a [...] "complete player" [...] and reiterated his desire to keep Vieira.|$|E
