5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> in real-time, 85% of which ensure the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is operating safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{cells of}} the <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are tested, spot-welded in series and tested again as a <b>pack.</b> The <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are {{discarded}} after use.|$|R

25|$|The company {{claims that}} the <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> have an {{expected}} lifespan of 1500 hours and cost US$7000 each, with the aircraft carrying 3-5 <b>battery</b> <b>packs,</b> giving two to two and half hours endurance. The batteries can be recharged in 3–4 hours from a 220v outlet. The company projects {{that by the time}} the first customers require replacement <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> that improved and less expensive ones will be available.|$|R
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} (drive) {{system is}} powered by two lithium ION <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b> The vehicle can operate on either one or two <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b> These <b>batteries</b> are housed in user-replaceable cartridges that can be charged in an off-line charger.|$|R

5000|$|Because oceanographers spend {{considerable}} {{time and money}} in long term deployments, then wait to see the results, oceanographers invest extraordinary efforts prior to deployments to ensure {{the success of their}} experiments. One of their concerns is battery failure. Doppler Ltd's Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) batteries [...] provide an example of lithium <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> that an oceanographer can test prior to deployment. These <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are commonly used in RD Instruments Workhorse Sentinel and Long Ranger and in Nortek's AWAC. These lithium packs, based on Tadiran's PulsesPlus technology are designed considerably differently from typical alkaline <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b>|$|R
5|$|While driving, {{after the}} Volt battery {{has dropped to}} a {{predetermined}} threshold from full charge, a small naturally aspirated 1.4 L 4-cylinder gasoline fueled internal combustion engine (Opel's Family 0) with approximately , powers a 55kW generator to extend the Volt's range. The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E
5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E

5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} crash-related fire was {{reported}} in China in May 2012, after a high-speed car crashed into a BYD e6 taxi in Shenzhen. The second reported incident occurred in the United States on October 1, 2013, when a Tesla Model S caught fire after the electric car hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington state, and the debris punctured one of 16 modules within the <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> A second reported fire occurred on October 18, 2013 in Merida, Mexico. In this case the vehicle was being driven at high speed through a roundabout and crashed through a wall and into a tree. On November 6, 2013, a Tesla Model S being driven on Interstate 24 near Murfreesboro, Tennessee caught fire after it struck a tow hitch on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Flex-fuel hybrid {{electric}} and flex-fuel plug-in hybrid {{are two types}} of hybrid vehicles built with a combustion engine capable of running on gasoline, E-85, or E-100 to help drive the wheels in conjunction with the electric engine or to recharge the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> that powers the electric engine. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, which runs on gasoline or E85. GM announced that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the U.S. in late 2010, would be the first commercially available flex-fuel plug-in capable of adapting the propulsion to several world markets such as the U.S., Brazil or Sweden, as the combustion engine can be adapted to run on E85, E100 or diesel respectively. The Volt was initially expected to be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. Lotus Engineering unveiled the Lotus CityCar at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The CityCar is a plug-in hybrid concept car designed for flex-fuel operation on ethanol, or methanol as well as regular gasoline.|$|E
