5|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{there were no}} Indians, but only a single British officer, John Money of the 9th regiment, Burgoyne's deputy quartermaster. He had been leading a group of Indians, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> seemed {{reluctant}} to fight the Americans, Money became impatient and ran ahead of them; it was his war cries that brought {{an end to the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Most of the time, goalkeepers do low-intensity work (treading water {{without too}} much effort) <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> do work (for example, {{when they have a}} man down or are in the ready position) it is very intense.|$|E
5|$|Sasha {{has gone}} back to the forest to raise her three kits, Hawk, Moth, and Tadpole. While hunting for her kits, she is caught by a ShadowClan patrol. Afraid that they will take her kits, she lies and says they died from the cold. Afterwards, she lets her kits play outside, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> go back in, she tells them about Ken.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|A new {{character}} called Kip Berenger (Joseph Cohen-Cole) is introduced, {{a computer}} games expert who followed the uprising {{and is a}} fan of Lioba. While on a dating website in Planet B, he comes into contact with Lioba and offers his help. She is at first reluctant, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are both attacked by Cerberus they flee together. Kip later reveals that like Lioba he is dead in the real world.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
5|$|Mine owners {{still holding}} out for the 10-hour day soon {{attempted}} to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners not {{to interfere with the}} operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially attempted to persuade these men to join the union and strike, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded in driving non-union miners out of the district.|$|E

5|$|Stone and Judy {{convinced}} {{the managers of}} two bars in Seattle, Washington, to set up Donkey Kong machines. The managers initially showed reluctance, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> saw sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a week straight, they requested more units. In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about gutting 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong motherboards and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981. Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television commercials for Colecovision's hand-held Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Junior video games.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet was duly {{assembled}} {{in the spring of}} 499 BC, and sailed to Ionia. Artaphernes put his (and Darius's) cousin Megabates in charge of the expedition, and dispatched him to Miletus with the Persian army. They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces, and then embarked and set sail. In order to avoid warning the Naxians, the fleet initially sailed north, towards the Hellespont, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived at Chios they doubled back and headed south for Naxos.|$|E
5|$|The sullen {{determination}} of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown most forcibly {{by the fact that}} despite the powerful protection now here for those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none of the miners have returned to work, and the mine pumps are still worked by the bosses and clerks in the employ of the companies... They will be peaceable while the soldiers are here, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> go away, they will have many a grievance to redress from their standpoint.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses at {{the scene}} {{described}} several intermittent shots fired from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so. A few of the militiamen believed at first that the regulars were only firing powder with no ball, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> realized the truth, few {{if any of the}} militia managed to load and return fire. The rest ran for their lives.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

5|$|After {{destroying}} the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind {{to oppose the}} Didact. Infinity executive officer Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are unsuccessful they follow the Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant attack. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station, composing every individual except the Chief.|$|E
5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
40|$|Adults readily detect {{changes in}} face {{patterns}} {{brought about by}} the inversion of eyes and mouth when the faces are viewed upright <b>but</b> not <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are viewed upside down. Research suggests that this illusion (the Thatcher illusion) is caused by the interfering effects of face inversion on the processing of second-order relational information (fine spatial information such as the distance between the eyes). In the current study, 6 -month-olds discriminated ‘thatcherized’ faces <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were viewed upright <b>but</b> not <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were viewed upside down. These results are consistent with the notion that 6 -month-olds are sensitive to second-order relational information while processing faces...|$|R
