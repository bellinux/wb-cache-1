40|$|The article {{argues that}} despite its {{historical}} relevance, after 1989 the (Western) Balkans has {{since the end}} of the Cold War been politically instrumentally excluded from the Mediterranean regional policies not only by the hegemonic influence of the European Union (EU) but also by the (Western) Balkans states themselves. After identifying a very recent turnaround of this trend now including <b>Balkan</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> states in Mediterranean regional politics, the article offers reasoning for the emergence of this change by exposing mutual reinforcement of three processes; namely critique of the unsuccessful EU-lead Mediterranean regional framework, upcoming completion of the state-formation in the Balkans and the effects of continuous non-governmental regional initiatives in the Mediterranean. The finding that Balkan NGOs have been participating in the Mediterranean regional affairs ever {{since the end of}} the Cold War whereby the (Western) <b>Balkan</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> states have done so only since the 2008 inclusion within the Union for the Mediterranean shows an important possibility to compensate this imbalance, but only if the “shift to the Mediterranean” is not an instrumental foreign policy strategy as was the 1990 s “away from the Balkans”...|$|E

40|$|The {{burden of}} disease due to chronic viral {{hepatitis}} constitutes a global threat. In many <b>Balkan</b> and <b>Mediterranean</b> countries, the disease burden due to viral hepatitis remains largely unrecognized, including in high-risk groups and migrants, {{because of a lack}} of reliable epidemiological data, suggesting the need for better and targeted surveillance for public health gains. In many countries, the burden of chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B and C is increasing due to ageing of unvaccinated populations and migration, and a probable increase in drug injecting. Targeted vaccination strategies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) among risk groups and harm reduction interventions at adequate scale and coverage for injecting drug users are needed. Transmission of HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in healthcare settings and a higher prevalence of HBV and HCV among recipients of blood and blood products in the Balkan and North African countries highlight the need to implement and monitor universal precautions in these settings and use voluntary, nonremunerated, repeat donors. Progress in drug discovery has improved outcomes of treatment for both HBV and HCV, although access is limited by the high costs of these drugs and resources available for health care. Egypt, with the highest burden of hepatitis C in the world, provides treatment through its National Control Strategy. Addressing the burden of viral hepatitis in the <b>Balkan</b> and <b>Mediterranean</b> regions will require national commitments in the form of strategic plans, financial and human resources, normative guidance and technical support from regional agencies and research. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

Out of twelve enzyme loci analyzed for genetic variability, only four to six were polymorphic in the studied populations. For those loci, the observed and expected values of genotype frequencies were compared with chi-square goodness-of-fit tests. Analysis of deviations of phenotypic classes from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium revealed significant differences at polymorphic loci of all populations except in CVKOP. This implied possible important influence of evolutionary mechanisms such as low migration rates, population substructuring and natural selection in creation and maintenance of genetic variability...|$|R

The regime also sought to establish protective patron-client relationships with Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, which all lay on the outside edges of its European sphere of influence. Although it was not among his publicly proclaimed aims, Mussolini wished to challenge the supremacy of Britain and France in the Mediterranean Sea, which was considered strategically vital, since the Mediterranean was Italy's only conduit to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.|$|R
