40|$|Cyclopropanation {{of various}} {{electron}} rich and electron deficient olefins via Simmons-Smith and Michael-initiated ring closure reactions was studied in our research. Cinnamyl alcohol 18 was succesfully cyclopropanated {{in a good}} to excellent yield using Simmons-Smith reactions. Methyl and <b>benzyl</b> <b>crotonate</b> 14 and 16 were labile in MIRC reaction condition indicated by the detection of starting material degradation in the NMR spectra of the crude reactions, and allowed a low to moderate product yield. The other starting materials, i. e., cinnamaldehyde 19, methyl cinnamate 20, mono- and di-protected cross-coupled product (4 R, 5 R,E) -methyl 5 -(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy) - 4 -hydroxyhepta- 2, 6 -dienoate 25 and (4 R, 5 R,E) -methyl 5 -(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy) - 4 -(methoxymethoxy) hepta- 2, 6 -dienoate 26, were apparently incompatible to the reaction condition set in our study...|$|E
