5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, the Americans {{spotted a}} large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be {{stationed}} there, they aimed {{at it and}} quickly destroyed it. Cornwallis sank {{more than a dozen}} of his ships in the harbor. The French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British HMS Charon, which caught fire, and in turn set two or three other ships on fire. Cornwallis received word from Clinton that the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis responded by saying that he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out for long.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, {{so that they would}} not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was forced}} to regroup at Cheonan and oppose the North Korean forces again, and it suffered heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw after the Battle of Cheonan. The 24th Infantry Division would continue to fight in delaying actions {{such as this one}} for two more weeks until it was overwhelmed at the Battle of Taejon, however by that time the Pusan Perimeter would be in place, and other US divisions would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the line for several more months during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter until the Inchon Landings, when American forces would finally defeat the North Korean Army, ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} on 31 August, the Japanese forces ashore had reported {{the situation to}} their headquarters at Rabaul. In response, plans were made to send the Aoba Detachment, which comprised the Army's 4th Infantry Regiment and an artillery company, to Rabi to complete the capture of the airfield. However, they were not scheduled to arrive until 11 September {{and so it was}} planned in the meantime to reinforce Yano's men with 130 men from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF. An abortive attempt was made to land these troops on 2 September and then again on 4 September. By that time, however, as further reports were received by the Japanese headquarters, it became apparent that Yano's troops would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out until the Aoba Detachment could arrive. As a result, on 5 September, the Japanese high command ordered a withdrawal. This was carried out from the sea that evening.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve their {{persistent}} shortage of oil, the Wehrmacht had launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), a massive offensive aimed against the Caucasian oilfields, {{in the summer of}} 1942. After German air attacks, the 6th Army, led by Friedrich Paulus, was tasked with capturing Stalingrad, a key city on the River Volga. His troops, supported by 4th Panzer Army, entered the city on 12 September. Hand-to-hand combat and street fighting ensued. The Red Army launched a huge counteroffensive on 19 November, codenamed Operation Uranus, which was designed to encircle the German armies and trap them in the city; this goal was accomplished on 23 November. Hitler, aware that if Stalingrad were lost it would likely never be retaken, appointed Manstein as commander of the newly created Army Group Don (Heeresgruppe Don), tasked with mounting a relief operation named Unternehmen Wintergewitter (Operation Winter Storm), to reinforce the German hold on the city. Manstein's initial assessment on 24 November was that the 6th Army, given adequate air support, would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on.|$|E

5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} had both served as the multazim (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became {{the head of the}} family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that {{in the event of a}} default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.|$|E

25|$|A few battles were {{fought in}} the latter stages of the war. The last {{of them was the}} Battle of Ilomantsi, a Finnish victory, from 26 July to 13 August 1944. The {{struggle}} to contain the Soviet offensive was exhausting Finnish resources. The German support under the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement had prevented a disaster, but it was believed the country would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> another major attack. The Soviet advances against German Army Groups Center and North further complicated matters for Finland.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{assumed that}} Polish forces would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{for several months}} but due to German {{numerical}} and technical superiority would be pushed back (it was estimated Germans would have two to threefold advantage), until pressure from Western Allies (France and United Kingdom) who were obliged (through the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and Polish-British Common Defence Pact) to launch an offensive from the West would draw enough German forces away from the Polish front to allow Polish forces to launch a counteroffensive.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the types}} of prey Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica forage are almost the same, that of Vespula germanica are {{generally}} 2–3.5 times bigger and heavier than that of Vespula vulgaris. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the Vespula germanica foragers are bigger in morphology than those of Vespula vulgaris, and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> larger prey.|$|E

25|$|Gott, the XIII Corps commander, {{appointed}} Major-General Klopper of the 2nd South African Division {{commander of}} the Tobruk garrison. In addition to the two South African brigades, he had the 201st Guards (Motorised) Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Tobruk had withstood a siege of nine months, before being relieved by Operation Crusader in December 1941. Allied leaders expected it to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out for two months with the supplies in the fortress. Auchinleck viewed the defence of Tobruk as non-essential and had already told Neil Ritchie {{that he did not}} intend to hold it at all costs.|$|E
25|$|Results {{have been}} mixed as the lack of {{mechanical}} grip {{has resulted in the}} more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip– pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|E
