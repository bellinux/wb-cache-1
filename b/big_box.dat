Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a {{revolution}} in the island's retail sector since the opening of the Confederation Bridge. Before 1997, <b>big</b> <b>box</b> stores were rare and mostly found in larger centres in the Maritimes such as Halifax, Moncton, or Saint John. Prince Edward Island had a larger number of smaller, family-owned retail stores than other provinces, with few shopping malls and less selection of consumer goods. The opening of the Confederation Bridge was viewed with concern by government and the retail sector alike, as many thought Islanders would use the quicker transportation connection to drive to Moncton for many large-item purchases. While there was a small {{increase in the number of}} off-Island shoppers, the provincial government established a program of encouraging <b>big</b> <b>box</b> retailers to establish in the province. This included the elimination of provincial sales tax on clothing and footwear, resulting in a plethora of chains such as Walmart, Sears, Future Shop, Staples, and The Home Depot building stores on the Island. However, many smaller locally owned stores have gone out of business. This is one of the more visible impacts since the opening of the Confederation Bridge.|$|E
