50|$|A {{syntax error}} may also occur when an invalid {{equation}} is {{entered into a}} calculator. This can be caused, for instance, by <b>opening</b> <b>brackets</b> without closing them, or less commonly, entering several decimal points in one number.|$|R
5000|$|Brackets {{are used}} in many {{computer}} programming languages, especially those derived or inspired by the C language, to indicate array indexing operators. In this context, the <b>opening</b> <b>bracket</b> is often pronounced as [...] "sub", indicating a subscript.|$|R
50|$|An {{asterisk}} {{before a}} parenthesis {{indicates that the}} lack of the word or phrase inside is ungrammatical, while an asterisk after the <b>opening</b> <b>bracket</b> of the parenthesis indicates that the existence of the word or phrase inside is ungrammatical.|$|R
5000|$|Minutiae of {{printing}} have been maintained: no <b>opening</b> <b>bracket</b> before vierundzwanstigster in volume twenty-four; an unascribed [...] "I."

50|$|In the {{consolation}} <b>bracket</b> for <b>opening</b> round losers, Cape Verde finally {{showed the}} form that won them the bronze medal at the FIBA Africa Championship 2007 in destroying Congo and Mozambique by 37 and 33 points, respectively. Against Congo, Cape Verde star Jeff Xavier scored a tournament-high 38 points. Mozambique slipped by South Africa 69-67 to grab its only win of the tournament {{en route to a}} 14th-place finish. In the 15th-place game, South Africa claimed its only victory of the tournament and sent the over-matched Congo team home winless.|$|R

50|$|The former American Peace Society House {{stands on}} the west side of Jackson Place, the street {{flanking}} Lafayette Square's west side. It is one of a series of row houses, built of brick with sandstone trim. It is three stories in height, with a two-bay front facade. The entrance is in the right bay, and the left bay has a two-story polygonal projecting bay. Windows are framed by bracketed hoods that are segmental arches on the first floor, and shallow gables on the upper levels. The entrance is set under a <b>bracketed</b> segmented-arch <b>opening</b> with flanking paneled pilasters.|$|R

50|$|The seven {{buildings}} at 127-139 Providence Street are nearly identical in their construction. These Colonial Revival structures have hipped roofs and full three-level porches {{topped by a}} gable with a diamond light window. The porches have square columns, and each level has a slightly different styling: the first level has an arched opening, the second a peaked one, and the third a <b>bracketed</b> square <b>opening.</b> Railings on the upper levels have narrow spindled balusters. Most of these seven buildings have wood clapboard siding on the first level and wood shingles on the upper levels; those at 131 and 133 Providence have clapboards on all levels, with bands of shingles between the floors. The three {{buildings at}} 141-145 Providence are all Craftsman in their styling.|$|R
50|$|The main {{elevation}} (facing west) {{of the church}} is symmetrical in form with the entry porch projecting out from the main gabled structure. A timber-framed bellcote crowns the ridge of the main roof above the entry porch and is clad to match the main roof. Bracing fixed between the roofs' bargeboards form decorative ends to each of the projecting gable roofs. The entry porch is accessed via steps from the south and by a recent timber-framed ramp from the north. Decorative post <b>brackets</b> form arched <b>openings</b> on the porch which is enclosed to handrail height with weatherboards.|$|R
50|$|The building, {{over the}} central section and north eastern wing, has a hipped slate roof, and spaced {{regularly}} along the roof {{line of the}} north-east and south-east facades are decorative Anglo-Dutch gables. Roof vents line the ridge. The central section and north-eastern wing are surrounded by two storeys of verandahs, on the lower and first floors of the building. Supporting the corrugated iron verandah awning are cast iron columns, occasionally paired. The verandah features cast iron balustrading with the intertwined letters AHC within the pattern, cast iron frieze panels and column <b>brackets.</b> The window <b>openings</b> which line the principal facade have fixed louvre timber shutters.|$|R
50|$|The Edward Street facade {{is longer}} but also symmetrical. The central window bays are flanked by rusticated bands of {{stonework}} {{in the central}} portion of the building. On each side are two other bays and a banded rusticated corner bay. At the ground floor level the entry is emphasised only by a portico of pilasters over these three bays. At the first floor level on both facades {{the windows in the}} flush bays are surmounted by pediments supported on <b>brackets.</b> The middle <b>opening</b> on this level of the Edward Street facade has a curved pediment, while the middle opening on the Queen Street facade has an archway with the emblematic statuary situated in front of it. The whole building is set on a polished grey granite plinth which incorporates stairs leading up to each entry.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{the number}} of regions was doubled to 16, from which the 16 {{regional}} champions continued to be divided into the two brackets: 8 in the United States Bracket and 8 in the International Bracket. From 2001 to 2009, however, each team was then {{randomly assigned to one}} of two [...] "pools" [...] in their respective <b>bracket.</b> In the <b>opening</b> days of the tournament, the teams competed round-robin within their own pool. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the semifinal of their bracket, where the first place team from one pool competed against the second place team from the other. The respective winners advanced to play in either the United States or International Final. The U.S. champion and the International champion advanced to compete in the Little League World Series Championship Game.|$|R
5000|$|In {{parallel}} with that Steve Hardy at Sussex University implemented {{a subset of}} POP-2, which he called POP-11 which ran on a DEC PDP-11/40 computer. It was originally designed to run on the DEC operating system RSX-11D, in time-shared mode for teaching, but that caused so many problems that {{an early version of}} Unix was installed and used instead. That version was written in Unix assembler, and code was incrementally compiled to an intermediate byte code which was interpreted. That port was completed around 1976 and as a result Pop-11 was used in several places for teaching. In order to support its teaching function many of the syntactic features of POP-2 were modified, e.g. replacing function ... end with define ... enddefine and adding a wider variety of looping constructs with closing brackets to match their <b>opening</b> <b>brackets</b> instead of the use of close for all loops in POP-2. Pop-11 also introduced a pattern matcher for list structures, making it much easier to teach AI programming.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "anchor" [...] for the Carville Historic District is the Indian Camp Plantation House, {{the antebellum}} main {{house of a}} sugar {{plantation}} {{which is the only}} surviving building from the plantation. It wasdesigned and built by New Orleans architect Henry Howard (and perhaps his partner Albert Diettel) in 1859 for sugar planter Robert C. Camp. It is a raised stucco over brick transitional Greek Revival Italianate mansion featuring a central mass with a hexastyle double gallery and flanking two story wings. Fluted Corinthian columns over heavily rusticated pillars support the gallery. Column capitals are correctly fashioned from double rows of acanthus leaf carvings with volutess or scrolls springingfrom the centers. Rather thin, molded and decorated abacus blocks supply the transition from columns to architrave. / The facade is well detailed with Italianate features, including rows of <b>brackets,</b> segmental <b>openings,</b> and panels. Above the gallery is a busy entablature with a bracketed, dentiled frieze under a projecting cornice and a segmented, paneled parapet. The bracket and dentil motif of the principal frieze continues around the returning entablature to terminate at the juncture of the house and gallery, only to reappear in a modified form of elongated brackets spaced across the wings, down the sides, and onto the rear. Meanwhile, the square, post and lintel fenestration of the central block contrasts with segmental openings in the wings. These features, together with the deep rustication of the central pillars and the heavy cast-iron gallery railings, impart a heavy sculptural quality to the facade. From every angle, front and rear, a certain dynamism emerges from broken up surfaces and contrasting motifs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIf D 1 is the Dycklanguage {{with one}} type of bracket then {{the level of a}} bracket in a word w ∈ D 1 is defined as the number of {{preceding}} <b>opening</b> <b>brackets</b> minus the number of preceding closing brackets. The depth of a Dyckword w is the maximum level of a bracket appearing in w. In this paper we derive an explicit expression for the average depth of a prefix of length n of the Dycklanguage D 1 and show that the average depth is given for all ε> 0 by (ln 2) 2 πn− 32 + 182 πn[4 ln 2 −(− 1) n(2 ln 2 − 1) ]+O(ln nn 1. 5 − ϵ.

50|$|Rua fought {{three more}} times in Pride, {{defeating}} newcomer Murad Chunkaiev before dropping a lacklustre decision against top ranked Paulo Filho. Nevertheless, Rua was selected {{as part of the}} Pride welterweight (185 pound) Grand Prix. In the <b>opening</b> <b>bracket,</b> however, he was knocked out by Denis Kang. Rua then left Pride for a tenure with British MMA promotion Cage Rage in order to strengthen the tie between the two promotions. His first bout, against English UFC veteran Mark Weir, resulted in a victory by submission after a rough and tumble affair. He also defeated Alex Reid via doctor stoppage before the newly created EliteXC organization purchased Cage Rage, therefore he fought for the vacant Elite XC middleweight at Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Baroni against Greg Jackson trained Joey Villasenor and recorded a second round TKO, stopping Villasenor with strikes. After three months as the champion, his first title defense came to ICON sport middleweight champion Robbie Lawler. Despite narrowly winning the first two rounds, an exhausted Ninja was defeated via a third round TKO at EliteXC: Uprising. He rebounded with a victory over Muay Thai fighter and Cage Rage contender Xavier Foupa-Pokam at Cage Rage 24: Feel the pain.|$|R
40|$|We {{assume that}} the program to be {{analyzed}} and refactored is represented as an abstract syntax tree (ASTs). An AST node (or just node for short) is characterized both by its content, i. e., a piece of program text represented by the node, and {{its position in the}} syntax tree for the entire program. For convenience, we will sometimes elide the distinction between a node and its content. The following node types are used in this specification: Identifier reference An identifier used as an expression [1, § 11. 1. 2]. Its name is the IdentifierName with Unicode escape sequences of the form normalized to their CVs [1, § 7. 8. 4]. The set of all identifier reference nodes in the program is denoted as IdRef. Fixed-property expression A property accessor using dot notation [1, § 11. 2. 1]. Its base expression is the expression {{to the left of the}} dot, its name the (normalized) identifier to the right. The set of fixed-property expressions is denoted as FixedPropExp. Dynamic property expression A property accessor using bracket notation [1, § 11. 2. 1]. Its base expression is the expression to the left of the <b>opening</b> <b>bracket.</b> The set of dynamic property expressions is denoted as DynamicPropExp. Property initializer A property assignment in an object literal [1, § 11. 1. 5]. Its name is the property name to the left of the colon, resp. after the get or set annotation. The set of fixed-property initializers is denoted as PropInit. In expression An expression whose top-level operator is the binary in operator. Its base expression is the expression to the right of the in operator. The set of in expressions is denoted as InExp. 1 Variable declaration A variable declaration [1, § 12. 2]. Its name is the (normalized) identifier. The set of variable declarations is denoted as VarDecl. Function definition A function expression or declaration [1, § 13]. The set of function definitions is denoted as FunDef. For every node n, enclosingFun(n) denotes the innermost function definition lexically enclosing n, not counting n itself, if there is one. Formal parameter An identifier occurring in the formal parameter list of a function definition [1, § 13] or in a catch clause [1, § 12. 14]. Its name is the (normalized) identifier itself.
