25|$|EcM {{communities}} {{continue to}} exhibit rare EcM fungal constituents {{that have not}} been excluded, despite intense competition. Thus, mechanisms must exist that maintain diverse levels of EcM fungi. This coexistence can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> four non-mutually exclusive possibilities illustrated by Bruns: niche partitioning, disturbance-related patch dynamics, density-dependent mortality and competitive networks.|$|E
25|$|Mr. T.M. Carnegie's {{abilities}} {{were too}} numerous and complex to <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a sentence. He {{was a man}} of sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience.|$|E
25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> three words: [...] "work, discipline, and feeding". Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, {{that is to say}} punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.|$|E
500|$|In the US, James Sandoe, {{writing in}} the New York Herald Tribune thought that For Your Eyes Only had [...] "urban savagery and mighty smooth tale-spinning". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—described what his main issue with Fleming's work was: [...] "his basic {{weakness}} as a storyteller, which can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> two words: 'no story.'" [...] In the short story form, however, Boucher finds that Bond's tales [...] "are proportionate" [...] and that Fleming's [...] "prose... is eminently smooth and readable" [...] even if [...] "Bond's triumphs are too simple and lack... intricate suspense".|$|E

500|$|Ramachandran regards egotism {{as one of}} {{the central}} themes in Mullum Malarum, with Kali, the community's alpha male, {{surrounded}} by sycophants who compliment him. He plays God in allowing the villagers to ride the winch (saving them the exertion of walking), and is jolted when the supervising engineer Kumaran arrives. As a subordinate, Kali cannot oppose Kumaran; his frustration threatens to erupt several times before it finally does and he is suspended. His feelings can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the line, [...] "Raman aandalum, Ravanan aandalum, enakku oru kavalai illai, naan thaan da en manasukku raaja" [...] (...) , in resistance to Kumaran's authoritarian yoke. J. Ramki, author of the book Rajni: Sapthama? Sagaapthama?, noted that Rajinikanth had displayed resentment at the AIADMK since this film, with those lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} in 1941 when Ted Williams of the Red Sox batted [...]406, {{becoming the}} last player to bat over [...]400 in a season. Despite his accomplishment, Williams lost the AL MVP {{race to the}} Yankees' Joe DiMaggio, who holds the record for a hitting streak, with 56 straight games {{in which he had}} a hit. DiMaggio's unprecedented streak started on May 15, 1941 in a game where the Yankees lost 13–1 to the Chicago White Sox. Williams later reminisced about his rivalry with DiMaggio saying [...] "(Joe) DiMaggio was the greatest all-around player I ever saw. His career cannot <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> numbers and awards. It might sound corny, but he had a profound and lasting impact on the country." [...] Both teams almost swapped the two players. In 1947, Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail were rumored to have verbally agreed to trade DiMaggio for Williams, but MacPhail refused to include Yogi Berra and the deal fell through. Joe DiMaggio's younger brother Dom would play for the Red Sox his entire career during the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E

500|$|For her, {{social justice}} is the {{essential}} element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. [...] "In God's eyes," [...] she writes, [...] "all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally." [...] Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian Lewis Mumford's observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues. Mumford goes on {{to argue that the}} [...] "moral change that took place under capitalism can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase money and power and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power." [...] Franklin extends Mumford's argument by pointing to new global realities such as militarized economies dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. [...] "Any modern theology of peace," [...] she writes, [...] "must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards 'techno-fascism,' the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world." ...|$|E

From the first notes she is clearly in a vocal zone." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the song bears {{similarities}} to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo" [...] (2009), but found the song [...] "more bombastic, more overblown and, well, just plain better". A writer for The Insider stated {{that it was one of}} the songs on the album that proved why she won the sixth season of American Idol. Ruth Harrison of Female First magazine called the song [...] "incredible", writing, [...] "From the build-up of the verses to the epic chorus that is just made to be sung in arena's all over the world; the greatness of this song can really not <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> words." [...] Adam Knott of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "a massive, epic pop song", that is Sparks' best single release to date. Gavin Martin of Daily Mirror called [...] "Battlefield" [...] one of the most [...] "epic metaphoric ballads" [...] ever made by Tedder. Shereen Low of The Belfast Telegraph described it as a [...] "radio-friendly song", while Ryan Brockington of New York Post called the song [...] "simply pure pop magic".|$|E
