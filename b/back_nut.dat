After StarStruck, Iwamoto appeared on SOP Gigsters, Love to Love: Young At Heart and Nuts Entertainment. During her stint in Nuts Entertainment, Iwamoto was suspended for 6 weeks along with Jackie Rice. After the suspension, Iwamoto came <b>back</b> to <b>Nuts</b> Entertainment, joined the cast of Bakekang, her first primetime show where she played Jenny, the best friend of Kristal, played by Lovi Poe, and also on the last season of Love to Love which is Jazz Got Lucky. Iwamoto also portrayed her life story on Magpakailanman. In 2007, Iwamoto appeared in Super Twins, wherein she portrayed the character Moshi Moshi Manika, her first antagonist role. After that, Iwamoto portrayed Rita on Sine Novelas third installment Kung Mahawi Man Ang Ulap, wherein she got a favorable response from the viewers of the show.|$|R
5000|$|The Book of the Heavenly Cow, or The Book of the Cow of Heaven, is an Ancient Egyptian text {{thought to}} have {{originated}} during the Amarna Period and, in part, describes {{the reasons for the}} imperfect state of {{the world in terms of}} humankind's rebellion against the supreme sun god Ra. Divine punishment was inflicted through the goddess Hathor with the survivors suffering through separation from Ra who now resided in the sky on the <b>back</b> of <b>Nut</b> the heavenly cow. With this [...] "fall", suffering and death came into the world along with a fracture in the original unity of creation. The supreme god now changes into many heavenly bodies, creates the [...] "Fields of Paradise" [...] for the blessed dead, perhaps appoints Geb as his heir, hands over the rule of humankind to Osiris (Thoth ruling the night sky as his deputy) with Shu and the Heh gods now supporting the sky goddess Nut. Though the text is recorded in the New Kingdom period it is written in Middle Egyptian and may have been written during the Middle Kingdom period.|$|R

When they came <b>back</b> up, apples, <b>nuts</b> and coins were thrown among the spectators which were also splashed with water. The Metzgersprung might have been a kind of baptism, since the apprentices were then free from their sins of youth (the youthful sins).|$|R

An {{important aspect of the}} custom is to let the girl know about [...] "taking betel nuts" [...] ("Gwaye kayegu"), the freedom and power she possesses in society. She has freedom to choose whom to marry. Accepting betel nut (Gwaye kayegu) means she accepts a boy for marriage. She can simply leave the marriage by giving the betel <b>nuts</b> <b>back.</b> Traditionally, the girl puts betel nuts below her husband's pillow when he is sleeping and is free to leave him and choose another person at her will.|$|R
50|$|Drexel's legacy as an {{advisor to}} both startup {{companies}} and fallen angels remains an industry model today. While Michael Milken (a holdover {{from the old}} Drexel) got most of the credit by almost single-handedly creating a junk bond market, another key architect in this strategy was Fred Joseph. Shortly after buying the old Drexel, Burnham found out that Joseph, {{chief operating officer of}} Shearson Hamill, wanted to get <b>back</b> into the <b>nuts</b> and bolts of investment banking and hired him as co-head of corporate finance. Joseph, the son of a Boston taxicab driver, was a good fit for the firm's culture. He promised Burnham that in 10 years, he would make Drexel Burnham as powerful as Goldman Sachs.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} retroduction, {{adapted from the}} {{doctoral}} thesis of Dr. A. Croce, relies on a process of dialectic questioning that begins with the information sought, proceeds to Given items (either {{in the form of}} dimensions or limits of research). and to Known mathematical forms of analysis in design or to principles of study in research. Finally, analysis and synthesis are used to abstract the dielectic questions and to arrive at the information desired. This method is used to solve the engineering design problem of a beam and to determine why bolts and nuts vibrate apart. Both mathematical analysis and dialectic logical analysis are utilized. Results are provided of tests conducted to check the retroductive study of why and how <b>nuts</b> <b>back</b> off...|$|R

40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} an almond end-row nut sweeper. The sweeper attached to the three-point hitch of a John Deere orchard tractor using a Category 2 hitch and was used to sweep <b>nuts</b> <b>back</b> into the orchard after they had been swept into windrows. This system worked by utilizing the tractor hydraulics to power an 18 inch diameter cylinder brush. Proper field testing of the implement could not be done during the academic year in which this project was constructed since this implement {{was designed to be}} used as part of the California almond harvest, which occurs from late August to early September. However, preliminary tests were conducted at the Cal Poly Feed Mill by staging a mock almond windrow using almond hulls, and sweeping them along the concrete floor with the implement. These tests indicated that with some minor modifications, the implement should perform as intended...|$|R
50|$|Poncet Platforms do have design limitations. They {{are usually}} {{designed}} to track for 1 hour (15° of tilt) since longer tracking could cause the instrument {{on top of}} it to topple off. After that hour the mount has to be pivoted back to the east to reset the clock drive mechanism. Since the Poncet platform has no roller bearing surfaces that can be driven, the clock drive mechanism itself has posed some design difficulty for telescope makers. Straight line drives such as threaded nut/bolt drives change drive rate when converted to a circular motion. It is also time consuming to reset via spinning the <b>nut</b> <b>back</b> to the starting point. Amateurs have tackled this by employing curved bolt designs and even using specially shaped cams to convert the straight line motion to a variable speed motion. High mechanical loadings from heavy telescopes or using them at low geographic latitudes can cause the mount to bind up, requiring more complicated improved bearing surfaces to overcome this. This has led to equatorial platform variations based on the Poncet design include Alan Gee's platform mount using a more complicated cylindrical bearing surface in place of the inclined plane, and Georges D'Autume's platform design which uses a sophisticated conical bearing system.|$|R
50|$|The Cru {{made a great}} charge {{toward the}} end of the season going on a 15-game winning streak, and {{finished}} 3rd in the North Division behind Drayton Valley and St. Albert. Head coach Dan Auchenberg won Coach of the Year honours, and the Crusaders were heading into the playoffs with some doubts, after seeing goaltender Chris Denman go down with an illness, all eyes were on Gerry Festa, who certainly rose to the occasion and was named Crusaders playoff MVP. They took the first round series vs. Lloydminster 3 games to 0 and headed to Drayton Valley for the second round. The Cru lost both games and came back to the Sherwood Park Arena needing 2 wins to get back into the series. Game 3 was a very physical battle that headed into double overtime. After a near goal from the Thunder, the Cru headed up ice and put away the winner to cut the series lead down to one game. After a tough loss, the Thunder were back and pounding away at the Crusaders defense in the early going. After going down early, the Cru battled back and once again went to double overtime. With a great crowd of over 1000, they pulled it out once again to make the fans go <b>nuts.</b> <b>Back</b> to Drayton Valley for game 5, nothing was going right for the Cru and they went down 3 games to 2. Back to a rocking Sherwood Park Arena in front of another great crowd, the score was tied up at 2 going into the 3rd period. 2 quick goals ended the threat from the Cru, as the game got slightly out of hand as did the score. Drayton Valley won the series 4 games to 2, and went on to win the AJHL Championship before losing to the Chillawack Chiefs in the Doyle Cup. One thing was for certain though, and that was the Crusaders were going to be a force to come.|$|R
