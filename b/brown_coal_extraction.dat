50|$|It {{is largely}} unknown why the {{construction}} of this facility was not finished ultimately. Local historians assume the reason to be the technological immaturity of the project, which had never been industrially proven before, and therefore the Bertzit-Tower remained an investment ruin. <b>Brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>extraction</b> in Kahla was stopped in 1929 due to its unprofitability and the last underground mine {{in the district of}} Liebenwerda, the mine Ada, was shut down the following year. By then brown coal was already being extracted from open-cast mines in Lauchhammer, to which the mine Ada belonged. In 1942 the mining director Friedrich von Delius had the world's first overburden conveyor bridge built. The bridge was built according to the director's own plans and was set in the mine Agnes in Plessa, near the mine Ada. It revolutionized the mining process, making it much easier.|$|E

The indices of coal and <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>extraction</b> in Ukraine and Russia for 2010 - 2016 are analyzed. Among the problems that exist in the coal industry are the following: mine assets have a high degree of deterioration; the equipment is rather obsolete and does not correspond to the world level; among the existing face equipment, the specific weight of longwall mining equipment, road headers, loading machines, and belt conveyors of the new generation is only several percent. Five steps of introduction of the virus management at the enterprise are identified: opening, development, participation, diffusion, sustainability.

30|$|A major {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> as a carrier material, however, is its high moisture content (typically 60 – 70  % for <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> mined in Victoria, Australia). This makes transportation of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> prohibitively expensive and thus makes drying of the coal an essential process. Dried <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> is prone to crumble into a fine dust when handled, increasing its propensity to undergo spontaneous combustion. This introduces further difficulties for handling and storage. Dried <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> granules of suitable strength and resistance to attrition may be a viable solution to these issues.

30|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>coal,</b> {{also known}} as lignite, is an {{alternative}} material with properties that make it appealing {{for use as a}} N fertiliser carrier. Previous work found that <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> incorporation into soil slightly reduced ammonium availability in one soil, but the study did not look at mineral N leaching or nitrous oxide emissions [13]. One reason that <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> may differ in their N retention behaviour compared with biochars that unlike most biochars, <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> are generally acidic rather than alkaline. Furthermore, whereas most biochars are of limited availability and relatively high cost of $ 500 – 3000 per tonne [14, 15], <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> is readily available in many countries at lower cost, for example, approximately $ 50 per tonne in Australia.|$|R

Blends of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> ash with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag were developed for compressive strength and durability tests.

40|$|With {{the rising}} cost of energy and fuel oils, clean coal {{technologies}} will continue {{to play an important role}} during the transition to a clean energy future. Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> have high oxygen and moisture contents and hence low calorific value. This paper presents an alternative non evaporative drying technology for high moisture <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> based on osmotic dewatering. This involves contacting and mixing <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> with anionic super absorbent polymers (SAP) which are highly crossed linked synthetic co-polymers based on a cross-linked copolymer of acryl amide and potassium acrylate.

The amount of water present in Loy Yang coal was reduced by approximately 57 % during four hours of SAP contact. The extent of SAP <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> drying is directly proportional to the SAP/coal weight ratio. It is observed that moisture content of fine <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> can readily be reduced from about 59 % to 38 % in four hours at a 20 % SAP/coal ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} {{volatile}} sodium during coal combustian {{is a significant}} factor in the fouling and corrosion of heat transfer surfaces within industrial coal-fired boilers. In this paper, new measurements of sodium release from combusing South Australian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> particles are reported for the first time using a previously established method (van Eyk et al. 2008).
