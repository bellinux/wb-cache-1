500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{an official}} remix version for [...] "We Belong Together", which she produced with DJ Clue. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, {{two-thirds of the}} hip-hop trio the LOX. The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, he sounds like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E
50|$|HanCinema's William Schwartz: As a genre film, Deep Trap {{does what}} it does well. There's not very much deep {{material}} to chew on, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> Ma Dong-seok himself chews the scenery all right, and that's good enough for me.|$|E
50|$|Sleep It Off {{is not for}} the MTV crowd, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> 'My life is in a turmoil/My thighs {{are black}} and blue/My sheets are stained, so is my brain/What's a girl to do?' Buy this record, I'd advise. Class is in session.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Reitz (with {{the same}} {{pleasant}} self-conscious, self-satisfied, and yet semi-apologetic smile): Well, I suppose not; <b>but</b> even <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> of that? ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>But</b> if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> {{does this}} first lesson--the chapter of Exodus from which my text is taken--what does it teach us {{concerning}} God? Does it teach us {{that his name}} is love? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{linearity}} of the concept: can {{the spiral}} jump steps? Can it go counter-clockwise? Since {{the model is}} bi-directional with only two nodes, the answer is yes, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> An example would be an elevator in a two story building. While it may have numbers for the floor to push to go to, it {{could just as easily}} function with only a [...] "go" [...] button.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, Next Generation {{listed the}} Track & Field series collectively as number 78 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time", remarking, [...] "OK, so the games' play style {{has little to}} do with skill at (or even {{knowledge}} of) the actual sports. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> In a test of pure button pushing endurance, nothing can beat Track and Field, especially when you play with four players." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kory Grow of Rolling Stone {{described}} the song as [...] "a Bee Gees-like indie-disco number," [...] a sentiment also expressed by NPR's Bob Boilen, {{who wrote that}} he [...] "heard Bee Gees in something like this." [...] In an interview with Boilen, Danger Mouse concurred with this comparison, saying, [...] "It sounded {{kind of like the}} Bee Gees a little bit, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> The Bee Gees had some good choruses." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lavoisier {{weighted}} {{a sample}} of tin, then reweighed after he had heated it and found it had increased in mass. This was an unexpected result given that the tin was thought to have released phlogiston during the burning process. Lavoisier was struck with a ground-breaking thought - maybe the tin had absorbed something from the air, making it heavier, <b>but</b> if <b>so,</b> <b>what?</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Spec cars, such as SCCA Spec Miata, and now NASCAR - and {{increasingly}} Formula One - {{take the car}} out of the equation and it becomes more driver vs. driver. This is the purest form of racing, and in some cases, such as Spec Miata, it might not draw a crowd, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> We're talking pure sport. I predict that in the next two decades, every major type of racing will be a spec series." [...] - H.A. Wheeler ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the members}} of The Stranglers, JJ Burnel, later said, [...] "Yes, it sounds like us, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> Of course there's plagiarism, but unless you live in a vacuum there's always going to be. It's the first thing our {{publishers}} have done for us in 20 years, but if it had been up to me, I wouldn't have bothered." [...] Another member of The Stranglers, Jet Black, even thanked Elastica in Melody Maker for bringing attention to his old band.|$|E
5000|$|There's {{something}} wonderful, I think, {{about taking}} chances on loveand sex. ... Going {{out on a}} limb can be roller-coaster scary because none of us want to be rejected or to have our heart broken. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> if that happens? I, for one, would rather fall flat on my face as I serenade my partner (off-key and all) in a bikini and a short little pool skirt than {{sit on the edge of}} the pool, dipping my toes in silence.|$|E

5000|$|In 1954, {{after the}} success of The Captain's Paradise, she {{expressed}} a desire to do more comedy:"I've had my share of sirens and am happy to get away from them, no matter what the part. Just to look pretty on the screen as a romantic lead is probably all right, <b>but</b> - <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> I'd much rather do something in a good Western provided there's plenty of action. Action is what I like." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had gone}} too far indeed; but I got off as I could. [...] "You neglect him <b>so!</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> is she, at any rate," [...] I went on, [...] "nervous--as nervous as you {{describe}} her--about?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I love melodic music. ... When {{you look}} at that music, you have to take it for what it is. I can write a pretty melody. That takes some talent. It may not be {{complicated}} and maybe it doesn't challenge anybody, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> Some people obviously like it. ... You don't have to analyze my lyrics to understand them. You enjoy these songs or you don't. You can put these songs on while you're driving. They make you feel good. What more can you ask? ...|$|E
5000|$|But Tanenhaus went on {{to answer}} his question: Shortcomings, to be sure. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> Nature doesn't owe us perfection. Novelists don't either. Who among us would even {{recognize}} perfection if we saw it? In any event, applying critical methods, of whatever sort, seemed futile {{in the case of}} an author who, as Randall Jarrell once wrote of Walt Whitman, 'is a world, a waste with, here and there, systems blazing at random out of the darkness'—those systems 'as beautifully and astonishingly organized as the rings and satellites of Saturn.' ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, many economists and {{business}} analysts endorsed the coin {{as a way}} to counter threats by congressional Republicans to force the country into default by refusing to raise the debt limit. Paul Krugman said [...] "So minting the coin would be undignified, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> At the same time, it would be economically harmless — and would both avoid catastrophic economic developments and help head off government by blackmail." [...] He also declared the trillion dollar coin debate to be [...] "the most important fiscal policy debate of our lifetimes".|$|E

60|$|Then {{there was}} that strange and {{beautiful}} woman, Quilla, to whom my heart went out {{and not only because}} she was beautiful, and who, as I thought, at times looked kindly on me. <b>But</b> if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> did it avail; seeing that she was promised in marriage to some high-placed native man who would be a king? Surely I had known enough of women who were promised in marriage to other men, and should do well to let her be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{let him go}} {{down the}} cabin," [...] demanded the skipper angrily. [...] "It's a fine thing I can't leave the ship {{for an hour or}} <b>so</b> <b>but</b> <b>what</b> I come back and find people sitting all round my cabin." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{glance at}} a map is suggestive of a fourth possibility. Malacañan {{is on the right}} bank of the Pasig River, and there is a Tagalog word {{referring}} to “of the right,” which is malakánan. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> The river is somewhat long and meandering, with a correspondingly lengthy right bank. However, the river at Malacañan divides around the Isla de Convalecencia as it does nowhere else along its course. Hence, the need to make a distinction between left and right would seem to be most relevant at this very place. Perhaps then, Malacañan’s origin is as a point of reference in the lively and ancient traffic on the water of the Pasig river.|$|E
5000|$|Atlantic {{has also}} had a notable {{collaboration}} with the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, having premiered three of his plays in York: The Cripple of Inishmaan (2008), The Lieutenant of Inishmore (2006) and The Beauty Queen of Leenane (1998). The latter two were immediately transferred to Broadway. [...] Other Mamet productions by Atlantic include his adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, and his own plays The Blue Hour, Yes, <b>But</b> <b>So</b> <b>What?,</b> Revenge of the Space Pandas, The Poet and the Rent, Vermont Sketches, Reunion, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, The Duck Variations, The Water Engine, Home, School, and Keep Your Pantheon. In February 2017, Mamet's play The Penitent started its previews leading to its premiere {{at the end of}} February.|$|E
5000|$|Professor Richard Murphy criticised the {{reliability}} of the data sources used for GERS. He also remarked they were liable to manipulation by the London based UK Government. Murphy also supported the Deloiite view by stating, [...] "nothing will be the same if Scotland leaves: a government of an independent Scotland will have a very different structure to that imposed now." [...] Graeme Roy of New Labour think tank, the Fraser of Allander Institute, responded to Murphy's comments by acknowledging GERS has shortcomings but also attempted to defend some aspects of GERS. Murphy criticised Roy's comments by saying, [...] "GERS might comply with the rules <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> when the rules are biased?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{etiquette}} of {{a vessel}} {{of war is}} rigid certainly, and wisely <b>so.</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> you fancied rudeness, was in truth a compliment. Among us sailors, it is the inferior who goes first into a boat, and who quits it last." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{one thing}} that {{literature}} and film {{have in common is}} narrative, as Brian McFarlane observes in Chapter 1. McFarlane throws down a gauntlet to literary elitism by arguing that an adaptation simply doesn't counterfeit (and reduce) but adds to the original narrative a battery of codes, both cultural and cinematic; in this he is in agreement with Morris Beja, who assets that 'what a film takes from a book matters; <b>but</b> <b>so</b> does <b>what</b> it brings to a book'...|$|R
60|$|Hume {{does not}} discuss the nature of language, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> much of <b>what</b> remains to be said, {{concerning}} his philosophical tenets, turns upon the value and the origin of verbal propositions, that this summary sketch of the relations of language to the thinking process will probably not be deemed superfluous.|$|R
5000|$|The uncensored {{version of}} the [...] "It's Coming Down" [...] music video was banned by music channels, {{including}} MTV, due to its sexually explicit content. The music video depicts various acts of bondage, sadomasochism, and cock and ball torture. The video was directed by Jon Reiss and features an appearance by performance artist Bob Flanagan, both known for their video work with Nine Inch Nails. Eerie Von explained the concept behind the music video: “It was part of mine and Glenn's personalities, {{part of what we}} used to see when we lived in New York. The director also had some good ideas, and we let him do what he wanted. I like stuff that people think is bizarre. It was pretty heavy, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> Sexually, you're either open minded or you're not.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Some game {{developers}} showed {{sympathy for}} abandonware websites as they preserve their classical game titles. ...personally, I think that sites that support these old games {{are a good}} thing for both consumers and copyright owners. If the options are (a) having a game be lost forever and (b) having it available on one of these sites, I'd want it to be available. That being said, I believe a game is 'abandoned' only long after it is out of print. And just because a book is out of print does not give me rights to print some for my friends. Richard Garriott [...] Is it piracy? Yeah, sure. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> Most of the game makers aren't living off the revenue from those old games anymore. Most of the creative teams behind all those games have long since left the companies that published them, so there's no way the people who deserve to are still making royalties off them. So go ahead—steal this game! Spread the love! Tim Schafer ...|$|E
6000|$|Angus looked {{round at}} the dim {{room full of}} dummies, and in some Celtic corner of his Scotch soul a shudder started. One of the life-size dolls stood {{immediately}} overshadowing the blood stain, summoned, perhaps, by the slain man an instant before he fell. One of the high-shouldered hooks that served the thing for arms, was a little lifted, and Angus had suddenly the horrid fancy that poor Smythe's own iron child had struck him down. Matter had rebelled, and these machines had killed their master. <b>But</b> even <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> had they done with him? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Canadians are an {{independent}} lot," [...] Barbara remarked. [...] "In this country, {{we use our}} friends for all they are worth, and we're justified {{so long as they}} want to help.
