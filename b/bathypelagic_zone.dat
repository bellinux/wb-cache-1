25|$|In deep waters, the fishes of the {{demersal}} zone {{are active}} and relatively abundant, compared to fishes of the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many forms {{other than}} fish {{live in the}} <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> such as squid, large whales, octopuses, sponges, brachiopods, sea stars, and echinoids, but this zone is {{difficult}} for fish to live in.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} bathypelagic fishes {{are small}} bristlemouth and anglerfish; fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth and barracudina are also common. These fishes are small, many about 10 centimetres long, and not many longer than 25cm. They {{spend most of}} their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone</b> filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20% of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5% filters down to the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

25|$|Below the {{mesopelagic zone}} it is pitch dark. This is the midnight or <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> {{extending}} from 1000 m {{to the bottom}} deep water benthic zone. If the water is exceptionally deep, the pelagic zone below 4000 m is sometimes called the lower midnight or abyssopelagic zone.|$|E
25|$|Anglerfish {{are named}} for their {{characteristic}} method of predation. Anglerfish typically {{have at least}} one long filament (the illicium) sprouting {{from the middle of the}} head, protruding above the fish's eyes and terminating in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca) at the tip of the filament. The filament can move in all directions and the esca can be wiggled so as to resemble a prey animal, thus acting as bait to lure other predators close enough for the anglerfish to devour them. Some deep-sea anglerfishes of the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone</b> emit light from their escas to attract prey. This bioluminescence is a result of symbiosis with bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{luminescence}} is symbiotic bacteria that dwell {{in and around}} the esca. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are Gram-negative rods that lack capsules, spores, or flagella. They have double-layered cell walls and mesosomes. A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the pH and tonicity of the culture medium to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone</b> inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of bacterial cultures.|$|E
50|$|The true whelks occur {{worldwide}} in all seas from tropical oceans {{to the cold}} seas of the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean. They are found from the intertidal to the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones.</b> Most prefer a solid bottom, but some inhabit sandy substrates.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{worldwide}} distribution in tropical and subtropical waters, in the mesopelagic and <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones</b> {{at a depth}} of 700 - 2,745 m. It is a very common and widespread ocean fish; of its genus, it is the most common species in the North Atlantic.|$|R
50|$|Mature bolitaenids occupy depths in the meso- to <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones</b> of {{the water}} column, down to about 1,425 m. Younger animals (under 20 mm mantle length) are known to remain in {{shallower}} waters, either from 170-270 m or 500-800 m depending on size. Japetella is known to venture into far northern waters.|$|R
2500|$|Some deep-sea {{anglerfish}} of the <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone</b> emit {{light from}} their esca to attract prey. This bioluminescence {{is a result}} of symbiosis with bacteria. The mechanism that ceratioids use to harness them is unknown, but researchers speculate that the bacteria [...] enter the esca through small pores from seawater. Once inside, they multiply until their density is sufficient to produce a bright collective glow.|$|E
2500|$|Barreleyes inhabit {{moderate}} depths, {{from the}} mesopelagic to <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> circa 400–2,500 m deep. They are presumably solitary {{and do not}} undergo diel vertical migrations; instead, barreleyes remain just below the limit of light penetration and use their sensitive, upward-pointing tubular eyes—adapted for enhanced binocular vision {{at the expense of}} lateral vision—to survey the waters above. The high number of rods in their eyes' retinae allows barreleyes to resolve the silhouettes of objects overhead in the faintest of ambient light (and to accurately distinguish bioluminescent light from ambient light), and their binocular vision allows the fish to accurately track and home in on small zooplankton such as hydroids, copepods, and other pelagic crustaceans.

In contrast, preliminary studies indicate that B. doederleinii stops feeding when the temperature falls below [...] This lower temperature limit may explain their absence from temperate and frigid regions where seas at the depth preferred by Bathynomus often are colder. They are thought to prefer a muddy or clay substrate and lead solitary lives.|$|E

Here, we investigated the abundance, diversity, {{and distribution of}} planktonic Crenarchaeota in the epi-, meso-, and <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones</b> at three stations in the South China Sea (SCS) by analysis of crenarchaeal 16 S rRNA gene, ammonia monooxygenase gene amoA involved in ammonia oxidation, and biotin carboxylase gene accA putatively involved in archaeal CO(2) fixation. Quantitative PCR analyses indicated that crenarchaeal amoA and accA gene abundances varied similarly with archaeal and crenarchaeal 16 S rRNA gene abundances at all stations, except that crenarchaeal accA genes were almost absent in the epipelagic zone. Ratios of the crenarchaeal amoA gene to 16 S rRNA gene abundances decreased similar to 2. 6 times from the epi- to <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones,</b> whereas the ratios of crenarchaeal accA gene to marine group I crenarchaeal 16 S rRNA gene or to crenarchaeal amoA gene abundances increased with depth, suggesting that the metabolism of Crenarchaeota may change from the epi- to meso- or <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones.</b> Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of the 16 S rRNA genes revealed depth partitioning in archaeal community structures. Clone libraries of crenarchaeal amoA and accA genes showed two clusters: the "shallow" cluster was exclusively derived from epipelagic water and the "deep" cluster was from meso- and/or bathypelagic waters, suggesting that niche partitioning may take place between the shallow and deep marine Crenarchaeota. Overall, our results show strong depth partitioning of crenarchaeal populations in the SCS and suggest a shift in their community structure and ecological function with increasing depth...|$|R

40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) data are {{presented}} from three meridional transects {{conducted in the}} North Atlantic {{as part of the}} US Climate Variability (CLIVAR) Repeat Hydrography program in 2003. The hydrographic sections covered a latitudinal range of 6 °S to 63 °N along longitudes 20 °W (CLIVAR line A 16), 52 °W (A 20) and 66 °W (A 22). Over 3700 individual measurements reveal unprecedented detail in the DOC distribution and systematic variations in the mesopelagic and <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones</b> of the North Atlantic basin. Latitudinal gradients in DOC concentrations combined with published estimates of ventilation rates for the main thermocline and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) indicate a net DOC export rate of 0. 081 PgCyr- 1 from the epipelagic zone into the mesopelagic and <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones.</b> Model II regression and multiple linear regression models applied to pairwise measures of DOC and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC- 12) ventilation age, retrieved from major water masses within the main thermocline and NADW, indicate decay rates for exported DOC ranging from 0. 13 to 0. 94 γmolkg- 1 yr- 1, with higher DOC concentrations driving higher rates. The contribution of DOC oxidation to oxygen consumption ranged from 5 to 29 % while mineralization of sinking biogenic particles drove the balance of the apparent oxygen utilization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Respiration (= oxygen consumption) and {{chemical}} composition [water content, ash, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) ] were determined for seven chaetognaths (Parasagitta elegans, Caecosagitta macrocephala, Pseudosagitta scrippsae, Solidosagitta zetesios, Eukrohnia hamata, Eukrohnia bathypelagica and Eukrohnia fowleri) from the epipelagic through <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones</b> (< 3000 m) {{in the western}} subarctic Pacific Ocean. Enzyme activities of the electron transfer system (ETS) were also determined on mesopelagic and bathypelagic chaetognaths, and ETS:Respiration ratios were calculated to confirm the validity of respiration rates measured at near in situ temperature but under normal pressure (1 atm).

Designating body mass (dry mass, C or N), ambient temperature, oxygen saturation and sampling depth as independent variables, stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that body mass, habitat temperature and sampling depth were significant, attributing 82 – 93 % of the variance of respiration rates. No significant effect of sampling depth and habitat temperature was detected in the chemical composition.

50|$|Telescopefish are {{presumed to}} be solitary, active predators, frequenting the mesopelagic to <b>bathypelagic</b> <b>zones</b> of the water column, from 500 to. 3,000 m. By using their tubular, large-lensed eyes - which are adapted for optimal {{binocular}} light collection, {{at the expense of}} lateral vision - telescopefish are likely able to spy their prey's weak bioluminescence from a distance, as well as (by looking skyward) resolve the outlined silhouettes of prey against the gloom above. Their eyes may also help telescopefish to better judge distance of prey; these visual adaptations are typical of deep-sea fish (barrel-eye, tube-eye). Common prey include bristlemouths, lanternfish, and barbeled dragonfish. Owing to the telescopefishes' highly extensile jaws and distensible stomachs, they are able to swallow prey larger than themselves; this is also a common adaptation to life in the lean depths (sabertooth fish, black seadevil).|$|R
