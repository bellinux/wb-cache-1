500|$|Overall, {{critics and}} fans have {{generally}} praised Sora's character. When Sora was first revealed in 2002, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini regarded him as [...] "an appropriate amalgamation of the Square and Disney universes." [...] He also comically noted that Sora [...] "doesn't look like much, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it goes." [...] A 1UP.com writer called Sora [...] "one of my all-time favorite Square characters", praising his cheerful personality. Gamasutra commented on Sora's journey along the series in their feature [...] "The Birth of Collecting: The Osiris Archetype In Games" [...] by Jason Johnson; while comparing Sora with Isis, Johnson found Sora's adventure appealing. IGN praised Sora's resilient character, noting how such an ordinary [...] "youngster" [...] could {{face up to}} his challenges during his adventures {{for the sake of}} friendship, while RPGFan's Nicole Monet Kirk labelled him as an [...] "extremely likable hero". Furthermore, in the book [...] "Interactive Storytelling for Video Games: A Player-Centered Approach to Creating Memorable Characters and Stories", it is noted that while Sora follows a [...] "standard hero archetype", his character becomes more believable and strong when worrying about his friends' fates. Haley Joel Osment, Sora's English voice actor, has also been praised by Gaming Target's Matt Swidder, who mentioned Osment [...] "makes a perfect fit for Sora". While remarking on Osment's work, Louis Bedigian from GameZone mentioned that [...] "Sora had something rarely found in video-game characters: depth" [...] also praising his role in Kingdom Hearts. Game Informers Bryan Vore found that in Kingdom Hearts II, Osment has improved in voicing the character, praising his work. In their Super Smash Bros Brawl list, IGN described Sora as [...] "...the most active and evolved hero on this week's list." [...] IGN listed him as a possible character in Brawl, though he was not chosen as the [...] "reader's choice".|$|E
