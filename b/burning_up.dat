5|$|Preparations for {{the launch}} resumed on 22 January, and the launch {{occurred}} successfully at 04:28:42 GMT on 24 January. Following the launch, Progress M1-5 {{spent three days}} in free flight before docking with the rear port of the Kvant-1 module of Mir at 05:33:31 GMT on 27 January. The docking port had previously been occupied by Progress M-43, which departed at 05:19:49 on 25 January, and subsequently remained in orbit until Progress M1-5 had docked with Mir. Progress M-43, which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise Mirs orbit, in anticipation of manned flights which were never launched, was subsequently deorbited at 02:12 GMT on 29 January, <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> during re-entry at 02:58.|$|E
5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E

25|$|Bogan {{was placed}} in the back room of a local saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, the next day in fact, he took {{advantage}} of the poor security and made an escape during a roaring blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. He was right, as two weeks later Bogan, <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan {{in the back of the}} Sweeney Saloon. The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.|$|E

Jim Farber of New York Daily News complimented the track, writing that the disco beat and the Warhol quote was reminiscent of Studio 54. John Sargent for Pitchfork Media was less impressed with the song, simply commenting that the song [...] "is a gloopy scoop of Cher schmaltz". AXS writer John Shetler was critical of [...] "Meteorite" [...] and included it on his four worst songs list from the album, writing Meteorite' gets bonus points for opening with an Andy Warhol quote, but that’s not enough to save the non-descript dance track with a grating, repetitive chorus and unimaginative lyrics about shooting stars and <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> the night sky." ...|$|E

Some 30 Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) flew close escort. The bombers were travelling slowly, forcing the fighters to lower their flaps to stay with the bombers, which made them sitting ducks. They crossed the coast at Folkestone at 11:36. Fighters from II.Lehrgeschwader 2 (Demonstration Wing 2) were also to form part of the escort. They flew in advance of the main force to drop [...] bombs and then resume their role as fighters. The strong head wind slowed the Dorniers, which meant that the Germans took even longer to reach the target while <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> the Bf 109s' limited fuel supplies. It also sped up the RAF fighters coming in from the north.|$|E
500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{was written}} by Aguilera, Lucas Secon and Olivia Waithe, with {{production}} done by Secon. An up-tempo song, it combines a variety of genres, including dance and disco, [...] "subtle" [...] tones of Latin, hip hop, and pop. It also features elements of dancehall. The track, which lasts for a duration of , is a [...] "smoky, sultry" [...] song. It features an [...] "old-school hip-hop loop" [...] and vocal samples, as well as [...] "dirty bass" [...] which creates an [...] "underground" [...] feel. On [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", Aguilera keeps her use of melisma to a minimum which allows for a [...] "relaxed and playful" [...] vocal performance. Lyrically, the song talks about Aguilera's attempts to impress the man she is flirting with. She has [...] "fallen hook, line and sinker for him" [...] and will not {{take no for an}} answer. Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that his favorite lyric in the song is [...] "Baby I'm <b>burning</b> <b>up,</b> you got that red hot kinda love", which the song's hook is built around. According to Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine, it features [...] "a catchy pre-chorus, and an even catchier chorus."

500|$|The NTSB {{investigators}} {{found that the}} weather data that the flight crew received in Medellín was nine to ten hours old. Additionally, the alternate airport on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the safe minima for landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew {{should have been more}} aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also found no evidence that the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 52 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express any concern to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication of worry came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the [...] "expect further clearance" [...] (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, <b>burning</b> <b>up</b> its reserve fuel {{to the point where it}} could no longer divert to Boston.|$|E

2500|$|The phlogiston {{theory is}} a {{superseded}} scientific theory that postulated that a fire-like element called phlogiston is contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion.
