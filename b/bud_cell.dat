To test whether specific cytoskeletal components mediate this influence of cell shape, we examined different cytoskeleton disrupting agents {{for their ability to}} affect chondrogenesis. Limb <b>bud</b> <b>cells</b> cultured at subconfluent densities on plastic substrata normally become flattened, contain numerous cytoplasmic microtubules and actin bundles, and do not undergo spontaneous chondrogenesis. If such cultures are treated with 2 micrograms/ml cytochalasin D during the initial 3 - 24 h in culture, the cells round up, lose their actin cables, and undergo chondrogenesis, as indicated by the production of immunologically detectable type II collagen and a pericellular Alcian blue staining matrix.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mammalian}} taste bud, {{a complex}} collection of taste sensory cells, supporting cells, and immature basal cells, is the structural unit for detecting taste stimuli {{in the oral}} cavity. Even though {{the cells of the}} taste bud undergo constant turnover, the structural homeostasis of the bud is maintained by balancing cell proliferation and cell death. Compared with nongustatory lingual epithelial cells, taste cells express higher levels of several inflammatory receptors and signalling proteins. Whether inflammation, an underlying condition in some diseases associated with taste disorders, interferes with taste cell renewal and turnover is unknown. Here we report the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced inflammation on taste progenitor cell proliferation and taste <b>bud</b> <b>cell</b> turnover in mouse taste tissues. Results Intraperitoneal injection of LPS rapidly induced expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interferon (IFN) -γ, and interleukin (IL) - 6, in mouse circumvallate and foliate papillae. TNF-α and IFN-γ immunoreactivities were preferentially localized to subsets of cells in taste buds. LPS-induced inflammation significantly reduced the number of 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled newborn taste bud cells 1 - 3 days after LPS injection, suggesting an inhibition of taste <b>bud</b> <b>cell</b> renewal. BrdU pulse-chase experiments showed that BrdU-labeled taste cells had a shorter average life span in LPS-treated mice than in controls. To investigate whether LPS inhibits taste cell renewal by suppressing taste progenitor cell proliferation, we studied the expression of Ki 67, a cell proliferation marker. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that LPS markedly reduced Ki 67 mRNA levels in circumvallate and foliate epithelia. Immunofluorescent staining using anti-Ki 67 antibodies showed that LPS decreased the number of Ki 67 -positive cells in the basal regions surrounding circumvallate taste buds, the niche for taste progenitor cells. PCR array experiments showed that the expression of cyclin B 2 and E 2 F 1, two key cell cycle regulators, was markedly downregulated by LPS in the circumvallate and foliate epithelia. Conclusions Our results show that LPS-induced inflammation inhibits taste progenitor cell proliferation and interferes with taste cell renewal. LPS accelerates cell turnover and modestly shortens the average life span of taste cells. These effects of inflammation may {{contribute to the development of}} taste disorders associated with infections. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fibronectin induces {{ureteric}} bud cells branching {{and cellular}} cord and tubule formation. BackgroundThe extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin {{is involved in}} several stages of embryogenesis. Fibronectin exerts its effect through interaction with cellular integrin and nonintegrin receptors. MethodsWe investigated the effect of fibronectin on branching and tubulogenesis of ureteric bud cells in a three-dimensional gel culture system. Primary ureteric bud cells from mouse embryos at gestation 11 days (E 11) were isolated and established in culture. Fibronectin and integrin subunits were localized using immunoperoxidase staining. ResultsIn three-dimensional collagen type I gel culture of ureteric <b>bud</b> <b>cell,</b> fibronectin dose dependently induces cord and tubule formation. Both ureteric bud cells and ureteric bud branches in embryonic kidney express the same multiple integrin subunits that include β 1, β 3, α 3, α 4 and αv. Embryonic kidneys examined at E 12, E 14, and E 16 days of gestation express fibronectin in the undifferentiated mesenchyme especially next to ureteric bud branches and in the interstitium around glomerulotubular structures and blood vessels. Fibronectin expression was similar at the tips and stalks of branching ureteric bud. Fibronectin expression is maximum at E 12 and decreases with advanced gestation. Cultured ureteric bud cells also express fibronectin. RGD peptides inhibit cord and tubular formation in the three-dimensional gel. Anti-α 3 β 1 antibody partially inhibits fibronectin-induced cord and tubule formation. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) induce ureteric <b>bud</b> <b>cell</b> cord formation in three-dimensional gel. The effects of growth factors are delayed and quantitatively less compared {{to the effect of}} fibronectin. ConclusionFibronectin induces ureteric bud cells branching and tubulogenesis through interaction with multiple integrin receptors. Cultured ureteric bud cells express febronectin and the origin of fibronectin at mesenchyme-ureteric bud interface is likely both the metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud epithelium. Addition of individual neutralizing antibodies to β 1, β 3, α 3, α 4,α 6 and αv integrin subunits does not block the effect of fibronectin. Only an antibody to α 3 β 1 integrin substantially blocks the effect of fibronectin.

The NASA-developed bioreactors known as STLV (Slow Turning Lateral Vessel) provide homogeneous distribution of cells, nutrients, and waste products, with less damaging turbulence and shear forces than conventional systems. Cultures under these conditions have higher growth rates, viability, and longevity, allowing larger "tissue-like" aggregates to form, thus opening the possibilities of producing enough tissue for implantation, along with the inherent advantages of in vitro manipulations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{budding yeast}} SKP 1 gene, {{identified}} as a dosage suppressor of a known kinetochore protein mutant, encodes an intrinsic 22. 3 kDa subunit of CBF 3, a multiprotein complex that binds centromere DNA in vitro. Temperature-sensitive mutations in SKP 1 define two distinct phenotypic classes. skp 1 - 4 mutants arrest predominantly as large <b>budded</b> <b>cells</b> with a G 2 DNA content and short mitotic spindle, consistent with a role in kinetochore function. skp 1 - 3 mutants, however, arrest predominantly as multiply <b>budded</b> <b>cells</b> with a G 1 DNA content, suggesting an additional role during the G 1 /S phase. Identification of Skp 1 p homologs from C. elegans, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens indicates that SKP 1 is evolutionarily highly conserved. Skp 1 p therefore represents an intrinsic kinetochore protein conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and may be directly involved in linking kinetochore function with the cell cycle-regulatory machinery...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic chick wing bud tissues secrete diffusible mitogens when cultured {{in vitro}} (Bell & McLachlan, 1985). These {{molecules}} may {{play an important}} role in limb development since media conditioned by morphogenetically active regions of the wing bud possess greater mitogenic activity than media conditioned by non-morphogenetic regions. These studies show that while the chick-derived growth factors were mitogenic for mouse-derived NIH 3 T 3, 10 T 1 / 2 and NR 6 cells and chick limb <b>bud</b> <b>cells,</b> they did not stimulate DNA synthesis in 3 B 11, PC 13 END, normal rat kidney or bovine endothelial cells. Furthermore, the effects of the chick-derived mitogens were synergistically enhanced by insulin and PGF ^ but remained unaffected by ECDGF, EGF, FGF and MSA. These findings indicate that embryonic chick limb <b>bud</b> <b>cells</b> synthesize and secrete growth factors which resemble in function other well-characterized growth factors and in particular PDGF...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} sensor {{based on}} <b>budding</b> <b>cells</b> of the dimorphic yeast Arxula adeninivorans LS 3 {{is one of}} the best suitable sensors for rapid measurement of biodegradable substances. However, Amnia is able to change its morphology (<b>budding</b> <b>cells</b> double left right arrow mycelia) in response to the cultivation temperature. The suitability of such mycelia was tested as microbial sensor component. The mycelia-based sensor possess a similar linear response, stability, limit of determination and detection compared with the conventional budding cell-based sensor. However, differences exist in the storage capacity and substrate specificity: the mycelia-sensor has with six months a better storage stability as the conventional sensor, achieves a higher sensitivity for specific amino acids or sugars, shows a better correlation between sensorBOD and the BOD 5 -value with yeast extract as model wastewater and is more suitable for measurement of salt water.
