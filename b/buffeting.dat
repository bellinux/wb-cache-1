5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or <b>buffeting.</b> This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, <b>buffeting</b> western Cuba {{for an extended period}} of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or <b>buffeting</b> problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant <b>buffeting</b> from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe <b>buffeting.</b> Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.|$|E
5|$|While sharing broadly the blended {{wing-body}} {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version {{by the addition of}} canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate <b>buffeting</b> at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.|$|E

25|$|<b>Buffeting</b> is a {{high-frequency}} instability, {{caused by}} airflow separation or shock wave oscillations from one object striking another.

40|$|Time-varying <b>buffet</b> forcing {{functions}} {{arise from}} unsteady aerodynamic pressures and {{are one of}} many load environments, which contribute to the overall loading condition of a launch vehicle during ascent through the atmosphere. The <b>buffet</b> environment is typically highest at transonic conditions and can excite the vehicle dynamic modes of vibration. The vehicle response to these <b>buffet</b> forcing functions may cause high structural bending moments and vibratory environments, which can exceed {{the capabilities of the}} structure, or of vehicle components such as payloads and avionics. Vehicle configurations, protuberances, payload fairings, and large changes in stage diameter can trigger undesirable <b>buffet</b> environments. The Space Launch System (SLS) multi-body configuration and its structural dynamic characteristics presented challenges to the load cycle design process with respect to buffet-induced loads and responses. An initial wind-tunnel test of a 3 -percent scale SLS rigid <b>buffet</b> model was conducted in 2012 and revealed high <b>buffet</b> environments behind the booster forward attachment protuberance, which contributed to reduced vehicle structural margins. Six <b>buffet</b> mitigation options were explored to alleviate the high <b>buffet</b> environments including modified booster nose cones and fences/strakes on the booster and core. These studies led to a second <b>buffet</b> test program that was conducted in 2014 to assess the ability of the <b>buffet</b> mitigation options to reduce <b>buffet</b> environments on the vehicle. This paper will present comparisons of <b>buffet</b> forcing functions from each of the <b>buffet</b> mitigation options tested, with a focus on sectional forcing function rms levels within regions of the vehicle prone to high <b>buffet</b> environments...|$|R
40|$|The Ares I-X Flight Test Vehicle (FTV), {{launched}} in October 2009, carried with it over 243 <b>buffet</b> verification pressure sensors {{and was one}} of the most heavily instrumented launch vehicle flight tests. This flight test represented a unique opportunity for NASA and its partners to compare the wind-tunnel derived <b>buffet</b> environment with that measured during the flight of Ares I-X. It is necessary to define the launch vehicle <b>buffet</b> loads to ensure that structural components and vehicle subsystems possess adequate strength, stress, and fatigue margins when the vehicle structural dynamic response to <b>buffet</b> forcing functions are considered. Ares I-X <b>buffet</b> forcing functions were obtained via wind-tunnel testing of a rigid <b>buffet</b> model (RBM) instrumented with hundreds of unsteady pressure transducers designed to measure the <b>buffet</b> environment across the desired frequency range. This paper discusses the comparison of RBM and FTV <b>buffet</b> environments, including fluctuating pressure coefficient and normalized sectional <b>buffet</b> forcing function root-mean-square magnitudes, frequency content of power-spectral density functions, and force magnitudes of an alternating flow phenomena. Comparison of wind-tunnel model and flight test vehicle <b>buffet</b> environments show very good agreement with root-mean-square magnitudes of <b>buffet</b> forcing functions at the majority of vehicle stations. Spectra proved a challenge to compare because of different wind-tunnel and flight test conditions and data acquisition rates. However, meaningful and promising comparisons of <b>buffet</b> spectra are presented. Lastly, the <b>buffet</b> loads resulting from the transition of subsonic separated flow to supersonic attached flow were significantly over-predicted by wind-tunnel results...|$|R
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused by turbulence-induced {{structural}} failure. Due to <b>buffeting</b> stresses, the stabilizer shaft broke and the B-52's vertical stabilizer came off the plane.

25|$|The engines were unusually quiet {{because the}} {{exhausts}} were muffled by the General Electric turbo-superchargers on the twin Allison V12s. There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too {{hot in the}} tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe <b>buffeting</b> and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as {{the distance of the}} engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer.

25|$|They {{reported}} that the aircraft, flying in clouds, may have been thrown into an unusual attitude. This resulted in <b>buffeting</b> of the tailplane, causing the port tailplane to fail, and the aircraft entered a dive. The flutter effect on the starboard tailplane caused it to fail next. The aircraft was moving at high speed and reached a stalling attitude, causing the port wing to break away. The rapid angular acceleration caused the engine supports to break and the engine to fall away. Nine other causes were investigated but dismissed by the committee.|$|E
