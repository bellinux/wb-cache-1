5|$|The {{major event}} of the second day (August 31, 1983) was the {{successful}} deployment of the INSAT-1B satellite, which took place at 7:48 UTC, with Challenger then maneuvering to avoid the firing of the <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> forty minutes later. Other experimentation continued, though telemetry through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A fire alarm sounded in the morning, indicating signs of {{a fire in the}} avionics compartment, but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E

50|$|Instead of a {{launcher}} that {{is aimed}} at the target by the fire-control system, VL Sea Wolf uses a vertical launch system (VLS). Missiles are launched vertically by a Cadiz <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> and turnover pack, to clear the ship's superstructure and rapidly flipped onto their flight path by thrust vectoring. The <b>booster</b> <b>motor,</b> which also increases the range of VL Sea Wolf from 6.5 km to 10 km, then separates from the missile, which flies on to engage the target.|$|E

5000|$|The Triple Deacon was {{a single}} stage member of the Deacon family that used three Deacon <b>booster</b> <b>motors.</b> Five {{launches}} from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility occurred in 1953 - 1954.|$|R
50|$|The missile {{had four}} {{wrap-around}} <b>booster</b> <b>motors</b> which separated after launch. After separation the main motor ignited {{to power the}} missile to the target. The <b>booster</b> <b>motors</b> were positioned {{at the front of}} the missile, but this unusual arrangement gave acceleration, and, with the motor nozzles angled outwards at 45°, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the Royal Air Force (Bristol Bloodhound) and the British Army (English Electric Thunderbird) were not required. Once the boosters were clear the control surfaces became active.|$|R

50|$|A launch capsule is {{a device}} used to propel a submarine-launched missile {{to the ocean}} surface. Upon {{reaching}} the ocean surface, the launch capsule is jettisoned, and the missile continues its journey, propelled by its <b>booster</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Little Joe II was a single-stage, {{solid-propellant rocket}} which used a <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> {{developed}} for the Recruit rocket, and a sustainer motor {{developed for the}} Algol stage of the Scout rocket family. It could fly with a variable number of booster and sustainer motors, but all were contained within a single airframe.|$|E

50|$|On launch, a small {{gyroscope}} is spun up by {{the firing}} of a powder pellet. The missile is propelled into the air by a <b>booster</b> <b>motor,</b> which takes the missile to its flight speed of approximately 85 meters per second. As it leaves the launcher box, four wings unfold, which begin to spin the missile in flight, which provides a degree of stability. Once the missile has travelled about 30 meters the gyro is unlocked and operator-controlled flight begins. Once 40 meters of wire has deployed {{from one of the}} missile's two spools, the sustainer motor is ignited along with up to four tracer flares {{in the back of the}} missile. At 45 meters range, the <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> runs out. Once 230 meters of wire have deployed from the second spool of wire, the missile's shaped charge warhead is armed.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{is similar}} to the Stinger missile it {{replaced}} with two rocket solid motors, an initial <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> and a sustainer. The imaging seeker uses 3rd generation-made infrared and ultraviolet guidance systems. On launch, the missile records the target's image profile and is able to ignore defensive countermeasures such as flares. The Type 91's missile travels at a Mach speed of 1.9.|$|E
50|$|The {{propellant}} {{production plant}} produces composite solid propellant for rocket motors of ISRO using ammonium perchlorate (oxidiser), fine aluminium powder (fuel) and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (binder). The solid motors processed here include {{those for the}} first-stage <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) — a five segmented motor of 2.8 m diameter and 22 m length, weighing 160 tons with a thrust level of 450 tons.|$|E
50|$|The Seaslug Mark 1 was {{powered by}} the solid-fuel Foxhound {{sustainer}} <b>motor</b> and Gosling <b>booster</b> <b>motors.</b> It had a radio proximity fuze and 200 lb blast warhead.The Mark 1 was a beam rider missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.|$|R
50|$|ISRO has envisaged {{a number}} of {{variants}} of PSLV to cater to different mission requirements. There are currently three operational versions of the PSLV — the standard (PSLV), the core-alone (PSLV-CA) without the six strap-on <b>booster</b> <b>motors,</b> and the (PSLV-XL) version, which carries more solid fuel in its strap-on motors than the standard version. These configurations provide wide variations in payload capabilities ranging from 3800 kg in LEO to 1800 kg in Sun-synchronous orbit.|$|R

The principal areas emphasized in the design and development of the <b>Booster</b> Separation <b>Motor</b> (BSM) relative to debris control were the propellant formulation and nozzle closures which protect the motors from aerodynamic heating and moisture. A description of the motor design requirements, the propellant formulation and verification program, and the nozzle closures design and verification are presented...|$|R

The two motors {{involved in this}} system are the Hybrid Upper Stage motor and the SpaceDev Streaker Small Common <b>Booster</b> <b>motor,</b> which will produce 20,000 and 120,000 pounds of thrust respectively. Both motors {{are used in the}} SpaceDev Dream Chaser. Other important components include a Common Core Booster and a hybrid transfer stage.|$|E

25|$|The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) (Delta 9240) {{is similar}} to the Medium, but uses two Alliant-built 1.5-m (60-in) {{diameter}} solid rocket <b>booster</b> Graphite-Epoxy <b>Motors</b> (GEM-60s) strap-on <b>boosters</b> to increase payload capacity to 6,150kg to GTO.|$|R
5000|$|When {{launched}} the <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> burns for two seconds, this permits the radar {{to gather and}} control it at very short ranges (about 1.6 km). The sustainer motor has a 15-second burn, bringing the missile to {{a top speed of}} about Mach 2. Once {{launched the}} missile is command-guided for the whole flight, and the warhead is detonated by its proximity fuze or possible command. The warhead is said to have a lethal radius of 5 m at low altitude against a F-4 Phantom size target.|$|E
50|$|A {{potential}} {{solution to}} the problem of MIRV is to attack the ICBMs during the boost phase before the warheads have separated. This destroys all of the warheads with a single attack, rendering MIRV superfluous. Additionally, attacking during this phase allows the interceptors to track their targets using the large heat signature of the <b>booster</b> <b>motor.</b> These can be seen at distances on the order thousands of miles, with the proviso that they would be below the horizon for a ground-based sensor and thus require sensors being located in orbit.|$|E
50|$|Since 1999, a {{modified}} version of the weapon has been used as a surface-to-air missile (SAM) as part of the Yugoslav M55A3B1 towed anti-aircraft artillery system. It has also been seen carried on a twin rail mount on {{a modified}} M53/59 Praga armored SPAAG of (former) Czechoslovakian origin. These missiles have been modified with the addition of a first stage <b>booster</b> <b>motor,</b> with the missile's own motor becoming the sustainer. This was done in lieu of modifying the missile's motor for ground launch, as in the case of the US MIM-72 Chaparral.|$|E
25|$|GSLV-Mk III is {{a launch}} vehicle. It is capable to launch four tonne {{satellites}} into geosynchronous transfer orbit.

The upper stage is cryogenic with a propellant loading of 25 tonne (C-25). The vehicle has a lift-off mass of about 640 tonnes and be 43.43 metres tall. According to ISRO, the payload fairing has a diameter of 5 metres and a payload volume of 100 cubic metres. It will allow India to become less dependent on foreign rockets for heavy lifting.|$|R
50|$|The <b>booster</b> {{separation}} <b>motors</b> on the Space Shuttle {{were relatively}} small rocket motors {{that separated the}} reusable solid rocket boosters (SRB) from the orbiter after SRB burnout. Eight <b>booster</b> separation <b>motors</b> were attached {{to each of the}} shuttle's two reusable solid rocket boosters, four on the forward skirt and four on the aft skirt. About two minutes into a space shuttle flight, all 16 of these motors were fired simultaneously for 1.2 seconds, providing the precise thrust required to safely separate the spent boosters from the space shuttle's external tank and orbiter, while traveling more than 1,300 m/s and an altitude of approximately 44 km.|$|R

50|$|Alan Carter is also {{conducting}} an investigation, as {{three-quarters of the}} Eagle fleet is currently non-operational. Records show that every affected ship was worked on by Chief Engineer Pete Garforth. Garforth has only recently returned to duty after recuperating from injuries obtained in a bad crash; the frustrated engineer is unable to offer any explanation for the string of malfunctions. After Garforth is called away, Carter lingers in the workshop for a moment. When trying to leave, he finds the hatch unresponsive to his commlock. Without reason, a large atomic <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> starts of its own accord.|$|E
5000|$|The missile has a {{distinctive}} bulging nose and four clipped triangular wings. The missile has two {{solid fuel rocket}} motors. One is a powerful booster rocket that burns for 2.2 seconds and the second, is a sustainer motor that burns for 28 seconds. The <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> exhausts through two nozzles on the sides near {{the trailing edge of}} the wings [...] and the sustainer motor exhaust is located in the missile rear at the center. The wings are positioned at an angle of one degree to the direction of flight so that the missile spins, giving it stability. Two rearward-facing flares which ignite on launch make the missile more visible to the operator during flight. Two flares are mounted {{on the opposite side of}} the booster nozzles between the wings so as not to interfere with the two guidance wires spooling out of the rear section of the missile.|$|E
50|$|CF-03B ramjet is the {{propulsion}} engine of Drone-6 and it required mother aircraft to reach speed of Mach 0.75 to release Drone-6. A solid rocket <b>booster</b> <b>motor</b> is attached {{at the end}} of engine, with output power at 70.5 t/s, with sustaining time of 3.5 to 4.7 seconds. At an altitude of 8 km, the thrust of CF-03B ramjet is 2018 kg and propels Drone-6 to Mach 2.2. At an altitude of 20 km, the thrust of CF-03B is 446 kg and propels Drone-6 to Mach 2.5. Drone-6 is usually launched at an altitude of 9.3 km. Obviously, such speeds are too slow to simulate SR-71, and {{this was one of the}} primary reasons the Drone-6 project was finally cancelled. Although failing to fulfill the mission of simulating SR-71, Drone-6 was used in extremely limited application is support of developing other SAMs, mainly because there was nothing else to replace it, as a result of political turmoil in China at the time, namely, Cultural Revolution, which also prevented later plans to improve CF-03B ramjet from being carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guidance}} {{system of the}} missile is actually command guidance, as the missile doesn't have its own radar. It only follows orders provided by the onboard radar of the carrier/launcher helicopter, the Thomson-CSF I/J-band [...] "Agrion 15". When this radar detects and identifies a suitable target, it switches to automatic tracking mode. Once the target is inside the missiles range it launches, the <b>booster</b> <b>motors</b> accelerate the missile to its cruise speed of 280 meters per second, after which the sustainer motor cuts in. The missile immediately begins descending to an altitude of around 3 to 5 meters. The rocket motors have a combined burn time of around 45 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The aft skirt was {{modified}} to include eight <b>booster</b> deceleration <b>motors,</b> which pulled the booster directly {{away from the}} upper-stage simulator, as well as four <b>booster</b> tumble <b>motors,</b> which caused the booster to tumble horizontally to decrease its velocity prior to reentry. The aft skirt also housed one of two Redundant Rate Gyro Units (RRGUs), which provided data to inform the Fault Tolerant Inertial Navigation Unit (FTINU) of the vehicle’s attitude and position. Steel ballast of 3,500 pounds (1,589 kg) was also added to the aft skirt to move the first stage’s center of gravity aft {{to ensure that the}} first stage would tumble properly after separation.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} and design effort was conducted {{as part of}} the study of solid rocket motor for a space shuttle booster. The 156 -inch-diameter, parallel burn solid rocket motor was selected as its baseline because it is transportable and is the most cost-effective, reliable system that has been developed and demonstrated. The basic approach was to concentrate on the selected baseline design, and to draw from the baseline sufficient data to describe the alternate approaches also studied. The following conclusions were reached with respect to technical feasibility of the use of solid rocket <b>booster</b> <b>motors</b> for the space shuttle vehicle: (1) The 156 -inch, parallel-burn baseline SRM design meets NASA's study requirements while incorporating conservative safety factors. (2) The solid rocket <b>motor</b> <b>booster</b> represents a cost-effective approach. (3) Baseline costs are conservative and are based on a demonstrated design. (4) Recovery and reuse are feasible and offer substantial cost savings. (5) Abort can be accomplished successfully. (6) Ecological effects are acceptable...|$|R
