5|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} (Xenopsaris albinucha), {{also known as}} the reed <b>becard</b> and white-naped <b>becard,</b> is a species of suboscine bird in the family Tityridae, {{the only member of the}} genus Xenopsaris. It is found in South America, in humid {{subtropical}} and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae.|$|E
5|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} was {{described}} in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires. Burmeister originally placed it in the <b>becard</b> genus, Pachyramphus. It {{was moved to the}} monotypic genus Xenopsaris by Robert Ridgway in 1891, but was still known to be closely related to Pachyramphus. A 1989 study of anatomy identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris, but the white-naped xenopsaris was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of its legs, the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) and the construction of the nest.|$|E
500|$|The genus name Xenopsaris {{was derived}} from the Ancient Greek word xeno, meaning [...] "stranger", and Psaris, a synonym for Tiyra, based on the Ancient Greek for starling, {{described}} by Georges Cuvier in 1817. The specific name albinucha is from Latin and refers to the bird's white (albus) nape (nuchus). The species is also known as the reed <b>becard,</b> white-naped <b>becard</b> and simply xenopsaris.|$|E
40|$|As {{far as we}} know, <b>becards</b> are {{socially}} monogamous. This group includes the {{five members of the}} monophyletic Platypsaris clade, nested within Pachyramphus. These five species have white scapular feathers which are usually hidden and whose function has been largely ignored by ornithologists. Because of becards' conspicuous, bulky nests, comparatively more is known about their breeding biology than about that of many other Neotropical groups, though much remains to be learned on this subject even in <b>becards.</b> Breeding behavior of <b>becards</b> has been considered relatively ordinary, but the displays we report reflect more complexity than previously supposed. We provide evidence that at least four of the five members of the Platypsaris clade (Rose-throated, Pink-throated, One-colored, and Crested <b>becards)</b> engage in courtship displays, some of which are dramatic. The normally hidden white scapulars are employed as erectile "badges" in these displays. 4 page(s...|$|R

50|$|The crested <b>becard</b> (Pachyramphus validus), {{also known}} as the plain <b>becard,</b> is a species of bird in the family Tityridae.

50|$|The green-backed <b>becard</b> (Pachyramphus viridis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tityridae. It has {{traditionally}} been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggest it is better placed in Tityridae, where now placed by SACC. It often includes the Andean yellow-cheeked <b>becard</b> (Pachyramphus xanthogenys) as a subspecies.|$|E
500|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} {{is smaller than}} the closely related <b>becards</b> and tityras, {{measuring}} [...] in length and weighing around [...] The subspecies X.a.minor has the same plumage as the nominate subspecies, but is smaller; the wing-chord (measurement from the wrist-joint {{to the end of}} the wing) length of the nominate subspecies, for example, is [...] compared to [...] in X.a.minor.|$|R
50|$|Rose-throated <b>becards</b> usually {{occur in}} {{riparian}} areas of pine-oak woodlands and evergreen forest. They breed from south-easternmost Arizona and extreme southern Texas of the United States to western Panama. Breeding is local and sporadic in the USA, and becomes more regular in Mexico. Birds are normally permanent residents, but any birds {{found in the}} US do retreat for the winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} {{is smaller than}} the closely related <b>becards</b> and tityras, {{measuring}} 12.5 to(-) 13 cm in length and weighing around 10 g.

50|$|They are {{primarily}} found in Central and South America, but the rose-throated <b>becard</b> occurs {{as far north}} as southern United States and, as suggested by its common name, the Jamaican <b>becard</b> is restricted to Jamaica.

50|$|Gnateaters are {{notable for}} their absence from these flocks, while swifts and {{swallows}} rarely join them, but will {{if there is}} for example an ant or termite swarm. Cotingidae (cotingas) are mainly opportunistic associates which rarely join flocks for long if they do so at all; {{the same holds true}} for most Muscicapoidea (mockingbirds and relatives), though some thrushes may participate on more often. And though most Tityridae rarely join mixed flocks, <b>becards</b> do so regularly. Tapaculos are rarely seen with mixed flocks, though the collared crescentchest, doubtfully assigned to that family, may be a regular member. Icteridae (grackles and relatives) are also not too often seen to take part in these assemblages, though caciques like the golden-winged or red-rumped cacique join mixed flocks on a somewhat more regular basis. Cuculiformes (cuckoos and allies) are usually absent from mixed feeding flocks, but some - for example, the squirrel cuckoo - can be encountered not infrequently.|$|R
5000|$|The cherry-throated tanager {{moves through}} its habitat singly, in pairs (especially during {{breeding}} season) {{or in small}} flocks led by a dominant bird. If undisturbed, it utilizes regular [...] "tracks" [...] to visit feeding sites {{over the course of}} the day; these tracks vary according to season. It is apparently a resident bird; there is no indication even for altitudinal migrations. The species, like many tanagers, joins mixed-species feeding flocks. Those in which N. rourei was observed to participate were usually led by Sirystes and contained chestnut-crowned <b>becards</b> and rufous-headed tanagers as [...] "core" [...] species. The food of adult birds at least seems to consist entirely or nearly entirely of small invertebrates such as caterpillars, butterflies, ants, and other arthropods; Eucalyptus flowers are visited though it is not clear whether to feed on nectar or on nectar-feeding insects. Food is taken by gleaning and clambering through branches to look under leaves as typical for tanagers (Isler & Isler 1987); the birds do not hang down from branches like titmice.(Bauer et al. 2000, Venturini et al. 2005) ...|$|R

5000|$|The becards are {{characterized}} by their large heads with a slight crest. The smaller members of this genus have graduated tails and most members are sexually dimorphic, although the cinnamon <b>becard</b> and the chestnut-crowned <b>becard</b> have similar plumages for the males and females. Juvenile becards resemble the adult females in plumage and, as far as known, obtain their adult plumage after about a year. The bills of the becards are grey, and many (but not all) have a black culmen or upper mandible. Their legs are dark gray.|$|E
