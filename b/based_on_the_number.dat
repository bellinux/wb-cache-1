5|$|Laser {{data are}} also used {{horizontally}} in two dimensions. An algorithm provides a real-time position estimation of the robot when enough elements from the landing gears and engines are visible. A confidence index is calculated <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of items collected by lasers. If good data confidence is achieved, the position is updated. This mode is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E

This makes them the third most abundant arthropods of the Burgess Shale (after Marrella and Canadaspis). The National Museum of Natural History alone houses more than a thousand specimens of the species from the Burgess Shale. Waptia fieldensis are often found disarticulated, with parts remaining in close proximity to each other.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have {{included}} all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, boats, jet-skis, fixed-wing aircraft, and military vehicles. Reviewers have compared these games <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles.|$|E

5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E

5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E
5|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} the number of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), {{and in the case of}} continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D flight {{simulator}} {{in which the}} player must complete a variety of missions involving different airborne vehicles and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight. The tests presented to the player require {{him or her to}} complete an objective in order to earn a license for the given event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, softness of landing, and similar criteria. The player is awarded either a bronze, silver, or gold license <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of points attained. More difficult tests become available as the player progresses.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST on December 31, 2009, in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia. Bowl {{officials}} announced 73,777 people attended the game, but that figure was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of tickets sold rather than actual turnstile attendance. That attendance figure was the fourth-largest in Chick-fil-A Bowl history, including {{when the game}} {{was known as the}} Peach Bowl, and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game. The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, and was watched by an estimated 4.87 million people, earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4.2. That figure was the 10th highest among bowl games that season, and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year's rating. The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough, Matt Millen, and Holly Rowe. Because the game was played indoors, weather was not a factor.|$|E

5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of offences. When a player tests positive, {{the rest of their}} team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E
