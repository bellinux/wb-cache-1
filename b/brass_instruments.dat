5|$|In 1881, Nielsen {{began to}} take his violin playing more seriously, {{studying}} privately under Carl Larsen, the sexton at Odense Cathedral. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for <b>brass</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{and that he had}} difficulty in {{coming to terms with the}} fact that <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to Niels W. Gade, the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Company diversified into {{manufacturing}} woodwind {{instruments in}} 1851, collaborating in 1856 with flautist R.S. Pratten (1846–1936) {{to develop new}} designs for flutes. The firm bought over the business of Henry Distin in 1868, allowing it to begin making <b>brass</b> <b>instruments.</b> Among its achievements was the widely acclaimed design for compensating valves developed by David James Blaikley in 1874. The company also commenced production of string instruments.|$|E
40|$|Mainly, {{the purpose}} of this work is to give the <b>brass</b> <b>instrument</b> player a more {{thorough}} understanding of how to improve the many factors which combine to make up his technique as a whole; also, to give the <b>brass</b> <b>instrument</b> player a more thorough understanding of the construction and history of his instrument, as well as a list of books which can be useful in developing specific phases of <b>brass</b> <b>instrument</b> playing. In other words, this book is intended to be a help to all <b>brass</b> <b>instrument</b> players who {{want to learn more about}} their instrument as well as to improve on it...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brass</b> <b>instrument</b> {{players can}} produce vibrato by {{repeatedly}} and rapidly altering the embouchure, or use and shaping of the lips and facial muscles, essentially repeatedly [...] "bending" [...] the note. This is called lip-vibrato, and {{is probably the}} most commonly used technique of vibrato on a lower <b>brass</b> <b>instrument.</b> It is also known to give the best sound and timbre on a <b>brass</b> <b>instrument</b> and is encouraged in upper-level or militaristic style brass ensembles.|$|R

5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> evokes film noir, {{playing to the}} film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> are {{a key component of}} the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E
5|$|Bach, the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723, {{composed}} this cantata {{to complete}} his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724. He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged, which reflect the psalm and Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Bach structured the work in five movements. The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, both on the hymn tune. Bach set the inner stanzas as aria – recitative – aria, with music unrelated to the hymn tune. He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. Bach scholars agree that the <b>brass</b> <b>instruments,</b> normally reserved for Feast days, could come from an earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with {{the text of the}} German Gloria.|$|E

25|$|Whole-tube {{instruments}} have larger bores {{in relation}} to tubing length, and can play the fundamental tone with ease and precision. The tuba and euphonium are examples of whole-tube <b>brass</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
25|$|Valved <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> use {{a set of}} valves (typically {{three or}} four but {{as many as seven}} or more in some cases) {{operated}} by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or crooks, into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> except the trombone: the trumpet, horn (also called French horn), euphonium, and tuba, as well as the cornet, flugelhorn, tenor horn (alto horn), baritone horn, sousaphone, and the mellophone. As valved instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually piston valves, but can be rotary valves; the latter are the norm for the horn (except in France) and are also common on the tuba.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} German and Austrian <b>brass</b> <b>instruments,</b> rotary valves {{are used to}} the {{exclusion}} of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long water keys and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.|$|E

25|$|Slide <b>brass</b> <b>{{instruments}}</b> use a {{slide to}} change the length of tubing. The main instruments in this category are the trombone family, though valve trombones are occasionally used, especially in jazz.

25|$|Half-tube {{instruments}} have smaller bores {{in relation}} to tubing length and cannot easily or accurately play the fundamental tone. The second partial (first overtone) is the lowest note of each tubing length practical to play on half-tube instruments. The trumpet and horn are examples of half-tube <b>brass</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
25|$|Keyed or Fingered <b>brass</b> <b>instruments</b> used holes {{along the}} body of the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a woodwind instrument. These {{included}} the cornett, serpent, ophicleide, keyed bugle and keyed trumpet. They are more difficult to play than valved instruments.|$|E
