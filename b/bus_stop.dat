40|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>stops</b> are key {{links in}} the {{journeys}} of riders with disabilities. Inaccessible <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> prevent people with physical disabilities from using fixed-route bus services, thus limiting their mobility. Due to limited budgets, transit agencies must select <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> for which their improvements, {{as part of}} the effort to comply with the Americas with Disabilities Act (ADA), can maximize the overall benefits to riders with physical disabilities. In this paper, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to combine the factors affecting the benefits to riders with physical disabilities, and a binary linear programming model was used to identify <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> for ADA improvements based on budgetary and construction cost constraints. As an application example, the optimization model was applied to the 5, 034 <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> in Broward County, Florida. Compared to the usual approaches, the optimization model provides a more objective platform on which to identify <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> for ADA improvements...|$|R
50|$|The {{buses and}} <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> alike are {{integrated}} via the Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS) which enable travellers {{to know the}} ETA of the <b>bus.</b> The <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> and the buses are equipped with automatic doors, that open {{when they are in}} close proximity. The bus-stops are easily accessible by a low-gradient ramp on one end. Signals are being installed near the <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> to enable pedestrians to cross the road.|$|R

5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through grass, at the <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into the <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics {{reported}} that 13.9% of Hamersley's residents used public transport {{to get to}} work. This was a sizable jump from 8.5% in the 2006 census, and was higher than the north-western metropolitan average of 13.1%. Public transport usage was highest (16.8%) in the section of Hamersley closest to the train station, and lowest (8.3%) in the Vickers Street section to the southeast, where many residents live more than 10 minutes' walk from the nearest <b>bus</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E
5|$|Except for the Q53, all buses {{along the}} {{corridor}} end northbound service at Queens and Woodhaven Boulevards, at the Woodhaven Boulevard subway station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line and {{at the foot of}} Queens Center mall.

The Q53 serves these stops on its through service to or from Woodside.|$|E
50|$|In bus {{rapid transit}} systems, <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> may be more {{elaborate}} than street <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> and can be termed 'stations' to reflect this difference. These may have enclosed areas to allow off-bus fare collection for rapid boarding, and be spaced further apart like tram <b>stops.</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>stops</b> on a <b>bus</b> rapid transit line may also have a more complex construction allowing level boarding platforms, and doors separating the enclosure from the bus until ready to board.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} is to use Ant Colony Optimization {{techniques}} with Genetic Algorithm to design and analyse routes and recharging schedules for electric buses. One system so-called “en route” charging was analysed where the bus applies a kind of pantograph at <b>bus</b> <b>stops</b> to recharge the bus batteries. This implies more frequent, but short recharging intervals. The program offers diff t variants of placing for charging station with diff t characteristics and amount. Also there is possible to predict the best battery capacity for electric bus. The application was implemented for fi e diff t cases: if we don’t want to place new <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> we use homogeneous charging stations and fi battery capacity; if we don’t place new <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> we use inhomogeneous charging stations and fi battery capacity; {{if we want to}} place new <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> we use homogeneous charging stations and fi battery capacity; if we want to place new <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> we use inhomogeneous charging stations and fi battery capacity; if we don’t want to place new <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> we use homogeneous charging stations and variable battery capacity. In the presented project we have the main focus on the cases where we don’t place the new <b>bus</b> <b>stops,</b> because we analyse only one route. Also we focus on the case where we use variable battery capacity, in this case we can analyse if there is possibility to reduce the battery capacity for the bus...|$|R
5|$|Huddle was artistic {{director}} for {{the world premiere of}} the play Comfort and Joy: A Play in Two Acts, which premiered at PCS on December 2, 1995. Huddle had commissioned playwright Jack Heifner to write Comfort and Joy, which {{was the first time that}} Portland Center Stage had ever produced a new play.

5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} pull away from Trulli. Although Button tried to pass Trulli on the fourth lap at the <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane, he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit for dry tyres. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of the <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane, but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside, but made contact with the latter. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher in the incident. On the next lap Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders to pit for dry tyres, as Alesi began setting faster lap times than the front-runners. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by Button, and re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard made his pit stop on the following lap, re-emerging in ninth position.|$|E
