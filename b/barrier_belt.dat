30|$|In the Cretaceous, {{which was}} the primary {{hydrocarbon}} accumulation period, paleo oil and gas pools were formed in the Mosuowan-Mobei area due to the good configuration of source rock, structure, sand body and fault. These large-scale paleo oil and gas pools provide a great potential for predicting secondary accumulations. In the Neogene time, tectonic tilting enabled linear adjustment of the paleo hydrocarbon towards the north along the Mobei low uplift belt and the Qiaoshao low-relief uplift belt. As a result, secondary oil and gas pools were formed in reshaped traps or new traps. Different types {{of oil and gas}} pools were formed along the adjustment pathways after the paleo ones, i.e., the low-relief anticlinal pools distributed along the residual low uplift belt on the northern flank of the paleo-anticline, the lithologic pinch-out pools controlled by lithologic pinch-out zones in the peripheral area of the inherited paleo uplift, and the fault block pools formed as the result of barriers produced by fault zones perpendicular to the migration pathway. According to the main factors that control the secondary oil and gas pools and current structural characteristics, four secondary plays of the above three types have been predicted. These are (1) a low-relief structural zone on the northern flank of the Mosuowan paleo uplift; (2) the Qianshao low-relief uplift belt, (3) {{the northern part of the}} Mobei uplift that parallels the fault zone; and (4) the fault <b>barrier</b> <b>belt</b> on the western flank of the Mobei uplift.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Three Gorges Reservoir {{project is}} a famous project {{in the world for}} the {{profound}} and long-term effect. <b>Barrier</b> <b>belts</b> of the Three Gorges Reservoir were concerned by China and all worlds, for causing water loss and soil erosion, geologic hazards and environmental pollution. In this paper, taking Wanzhou district as study area, the division methods of <b>barrier</b> <b>belts</b> of The Gorges Reservoir Area were discussed. Appling Remote Sensing (RS) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, the mutation lines of surface brightness temperature and surface humidity were obtained through analyzing the annual change from 1995 to 2008. Based on Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, ridge Line were extracted form DEM data. Under the principle of max scope, the ranges of <b>barrier</b> <b>belts</b> were divided. The results indicate that the influence distance of temperature and humidity change is only 35 Km, for raise of the Three Gorges Reservoir. And the area of <b>barrier</b> <b>belts</b> is 2215 Km 2, 64. 2 % of Wanzhou district. The results provide references for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area integrated studies...|$|R

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{installed}} passive water explosion barriers in two operating mines {{to determine their}} usefulness in U. S. coal mines. The primary objective of this field trial {{was to determine the}} effect of the explosion barriers on mining operations. Data were also obtained on the ability of the barriers to withstand the mine environment and on the effect of the <b>barriers</b> on <b>belt</b> operation, ventilation, worker travel, and rock dusting. Fifty barriers were installed at three separate beltway locations, and periodic inspections were made. A year after installation, no defects of the barriers or support hardware were detected, nor was any complaint as to the presence of the barriers made by the mine personnel. To date, 2 - 1 / 2 years after installation, the barriers have had no detrimental ef-fect on rock dusting, belt operation, or ventilation.

It also suggests that the present biogeography of Eurasian Branta - breeding at Arctic and wintering at Mediterranean latitudes - {{is a product of}} post-Miocene times, possibly due to range shifts during the ice age era. In this aspect it is notable that such a breeding-wintering range disjunction is less pronounced in the Canada and cackling geese of North America, where unlike in there was no W-E <b>barrier</b> (the Alpide <b>belt)</b> barring range shifts in response to the advancing ice.|$|R
40|$|A coconut {{dehusking}} machine comprising of two rollers with spikes, screw conveyor, <b>barrier</b> plates, conveyor <b>belt,</b> two {{spur gears}} and a handle {{was developed for}} small scale production in the rural areas. Performance test analysis conducted shows that the machine dehusks coconut fruits without nut breakage and distortion of the extracted fibre length and also that its average dehusking efficiency and capacity are 93. 45 % and 79 coconuts per hour. All materials used in the fabrication of this machine were of standard specifications and locally sourced. The estimated cost for producing one unit of the machine is thirty five thousand, six hundred and sixty-five naira (N 35, 665. 00). The machine also eliminated dependency on the epileptic public electric power supply in our rural areas which the major obstacle {{in the use of}} other mechanized coconut dehusking equipments in the rural areas...|$|R
50|$|Lewis Abbott has {{identified}} green <b>belt</b> <b>barriers</b> to urban expansion {{as one of}} several major protectionist political-economic barriers to house building with negative effects on the supply, cost/prices, and quality of new homes. (The others include new housing development taxes and quasi-taxes; political discrimination against particular classes of new housing supplier, household consumer, and housing product; and controls on housing technical-product development - in particular, the blocking of innovative low-cost house building using new materials and production technologies). Abbott argues that the greenbelts actually defeat their own stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces. By preventing existing towns and cities from extending normally and organically, they result in more land-extensive housing developments further out - i.e., the establishment beyond the greenbelts of new communities with lower building densities, their own built infrastructure and other facilities, and greater dependence on cars and commuting, etc. Meanwhile, valuable urban green space and brownfield sites best suited to industry and commerce are lost in existing conurbations {{as more and more}} new housing is crammed into them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Highly {{disrupted}} and deformed {{slices of}} ophiolitic rocks occurring along a linear belt in Nagaland and Manipur states, NE India, {{are known as}} the Naga Hills Ophiolites (NHO). The principal rock types include dunite, harzburgite, lherzolite, wehrlite, pyroxenite and mafic volcanics. The volcanic rocks of NHO have been classified into low-Ti and high-Ti groups with 2 wt. % TiO, as the boundary, which is corroborated by the differences in their immobile trace element and Rare Earth element characteristics. The two groups are probably not cogenetic; their chemical differences reflect variable source composition. Within group variation of incompatible elements such as La/Ta in the high-Ti group {{may be related to}} varying degrees of partial melting. The Ti/V ratios and REE distribution pattern of low-Ti group show overlapping Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt and island arc-like characteristics, and possibly suggest back-arc basin setting. The high-Ti group, on the other hand, has similarities with within-plate basalts erupted at off-axis sea-mounts and ocean islands. The sea-mounts and ocean islands brought to the subduction zone acted as barriers. Within the imbricate fault slices are components from the oceanic crust which were accreted to the continental margin and which represent clipped off portions from these <b>barriers.</b> A linear <b>belt</b> of ultramafic and mafic rocks associated wit...|$|R
40|$|The US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard for frontal {{protection}} requires vehicle crash tests into a rigid <b>barrier</b> {{with two}} <b>belted</b> dummies {{in the front}} seats. The standard was recently modified to require two separate 56 Kph frontal tests. In one test the dummies are 50 % males. In the other test, the dummies are 5 % females. Analysis of crash test data indicates that the 56 Kph test does not encourage technology to reduce chest injuries in lower severity crashes. Tests conducted by Transport Canada provide data from belted 5 % female dummies in the front seats of vehicles that were subjected crashes into a rigid barrier at 40 Kph. An analysis of {{the results showed that}} for many vehicles, the risks of serious chest injuries were higher in the 40 Kph test than in a 56 Kph test. This paper examines the benefits that would result from a requirement for a low severity (40 Kph) frontal barrier crash test with two belted 5 % female dummies and more stringent chest injury requirements. A preliminary benefits analysis for chest deflection allowable in the range of 28 mm. to 36 mm. was conducted. A standard that limits the chest deflection to 34 mm. would reduce serious chest injury by 16 % to 24 % for the belted population in frontal crashes...|$|R
