It is thus, a very important piece of infrastructure for both entities.|$|R

[...] "This is more than {{two thirds of the}} revenue received from passengers and is excessive," [...] the Inquiry report stated.|$|R

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is the {{complete}} {{design of the}} web application for <b>booking</b> and <b>selling</b> package tours and other related services offered by the travel agency. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the theory basis for the proposition, creation (production) and the implementation of the web applications with the emphasis on the methodology and technology used in this diploma thesis. The second part of the thesis consists of an analysis of current state in the travel agency and this analysis is the foundation of the last part of this thesis which contains the design of the design web application...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{the work}} is to design and {{implement}} an information system for a travel agency. The system is supposed to assist at business of a small travel agency. Editing of capacities, <b>booking</b> and <b>selling,</b> voucher printing and sale statistics are all problems to deal with. Application is designed only for inside use in a travel agency and for its contract partners, it's not intended as a booking software for clients. There are some accountant information and cost items in system because of this focus. Coffers control can be managed thru the application interface and user management is of course also part of this application. The system allows mass import of data due to a lot of data which have to be inserted into it...|$|R
50|$|As if {{this were}} not bad enough, in 1952 American had ordered 30 Boeing 707s, their first jets. These {{aircraft}} increased seating from about 80 on the existing Douglas DC-7 fleet to 112 on the new aircraft. Their speed was also much greater, allowing almost twice as many flights per aircraft per day. The result was that the aircraft could deliver passengers faster than their existing <b>booking</b> systems could <b>sell</b> tickets for them.|$|R
40|$|In the 1940 s Hollywood saw {{the biggest}} {{changes in its}} history. Based {{on a series of}} {{antitrust}} investigations, the U. S. Supreme Court decided to break up the Hollywood studio system [...] production, distribution and exhibition. As a result, the studios were forced to sell their affiliated theatre chains and to abandon certain business practices, such as block <b>booking</b> and blind <b>selling.</b> The purpose of my thesis is to clarify how the film industry was affected by this intervention and whether these changes should have occurred, in the first place...|$|R
50|$|Globespan, an Edinburgh-based tour {{operator}} with over 30 years experience, already offered scheduled and charter flights, cruise travel, rail and coach travel, motor home and car rental, and hotel accommodation tailored for holidaymakers visiting destinations in Canada, the USA and Spain. The scheduled flights, mainly to Canada, were operated by Air Transat from airports throughout the UK, with Globespan {{acting as the}} <b>booking</b> agent and <b>selling</b> the flights under its own brand. In summer 2002 a similar arrangement was trialled between Edinburgh and Nice, {{in the south of}} France. This was to prove successful for Globespan, and {{led to the creation of}} its own no-frills brand, 'Flyglobespan'.|$|R
5|$|Almost There is {{the first}} major-label studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Pete Kipley, the album was {{released}} on August 14, 2001 by INO Records. After releasing six independent records, the band decided to pursue a record contract due {{to the difficulty of}} <b>selling,</b> <b>booking,</b> and managing for themselves. The band signed with the newly formed INO Records, and were assigned to work with Kipley, who had not produced a major project before. Four of the songs on the album had previously appeared on the band's independent records; the rest were newly recorded songs. The album is a worship and pop rock album, and adopts a more radio-friendly sound than the band's independent albums.|$|R
5000|$|Airlines {{and other}} travel {{companies}} use differentiated pricing regularly, as they sell travel {{products and services}} simultaneously to different market segments. This is often done by assigning capacity to various <b>booking</b> classes, which <b>sell</b> for different prices and which {{may be linked to}} fare restrictions. The restrictions or [...] "fences" [...] help ensure that market segments buy in the booking class range that has been established for them. For example, schedule-sensitive business passengers who are willing to pay $300 for a seat from city A to city B cannot purchase a $150 ticket because the $150 booking class contains a requirement for a Saturday-night stay, or a 15-day advance purchase, or another fare rule that discourages, minimizes, or effectively prevents a sale to business passengers.|$|R
500|$|The {{conflicting}} information surrounding the burial {{has led to}} the claim of it being an [...] "E.T. Dump" [...] being referred to as an urban legend, which in turn has led to a degree of skepticism and doubt over the veracity of the dumping story itself, and the relevance of conflating the event with the later industry downturn. As recently as October 2004, Howard Scott Warshaw, the programmer responsible for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial game, expressed doubts that the destruction of millions of copies of the game ever took place. Warshaw also believes that Atari's downfall was more a result of their business practices—including alleged block <b>booking</b> of poorly <b>selling</b> games with successful ones when dealing with distributors—than any specific failed games. This latter view has been echoed by Travis Fahs of IGN, who believes that Atari's problems, including their huge surplus of unsold stock, arose from the company's overestimation of the sustainability of Atari 2600 sales, rather than being due to the individual quality of games being released.|$|R
