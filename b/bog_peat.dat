50|$|Barkip {{is located}} in {{southwest}} Scotland in North Ayrshire and lies about three miles south-west of Beith. Geologically, Barkip consists of mainly sandstone. Two areas of the rare habitat type known as 'raised bogs' are located at Barkip and Little Barkip. These were surveyed for the Ayrshire Biodiversity Action Plan (ABAP) by the NAC Ranger Service in 2010. Raised bogs develop over centuries from open lake, to marsh, and eventually bog that continues to form peat, and over time a shallow dome of <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> develops: a raised bog. The dome is typically a few metres high in the centre, and is often surrounded by strips of fen.

50|$|The {{coastal areas}} consist of Holocene lake and river marshes and lagoons {{connected}} to Pleistocene Old and Young Drift terrain {{in various stages}} of formation and weathering. After or during the retreat of the glaciers, wind-borne sand often formed dunes, which were later fixed by vegetation. Human intervention caused the emergence of open heath such as the Lüneburg Heath, and measures such as deforestation and the so-called Plaggenhieb (removal of the topsoil for use as fertiliser elsewhere) caused a wide impoverishment of the soil (Podsol). The most fertile soils are the young marshes (Auen-Vegen) and the Börde areas (Hildesheim Börde, Magdeburg Börde, with their fertile, loess soils). High level <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> {{can be found in the}} poorest soils, e.g. in the Teufelsmoor. In the loess areas of the lowland are found the oldest settlement locations in Germany (Linear Pottery culture).|$|E

Over centuries {{there is}} a {{progression}} from open lake, to marsh, then fen (or on acidic substrates, valley bog) and carr, as silt or peat fills the lake. Eventually peat builds up to a level where the land surface is too flat for ground or surface water to reach {{the centre of the}} wetland. This part therefore becomes wholly rain-fed (ombrotrophic), and the resulting acidic conditions allow the development of bog (even if the substrate is non-acidic). The bog continues to form peat, and over time a shallow dome of <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> develops: a raised bog. The dome is typically a few metres high in the centre, and is often surrounded by strips of fen or other wetland vegetation at the edges or along streamsides, where ground water can percolate into the wetland.|$|E

The trackway was embedded in the peat in a depth of only 1 m from below the surface.

40|$|The {{emission}} of methane (1. 3 mmol of CH 4 m− 2 day− 1), precursors of methanogenesis, and the methanogenic microorganisms of acidic <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> (pH 4. 4) from a moderately reduced forest site were investigated by in situ measurements, microcosm incubations, and cultivation methods, respectively. <b>Bog</b> <b>peat</b> produced CH 4 (0. 4 to 1. 7 μmol g [dry wt] of soil− 1 day− 1) under anoxic conditions. At in situ pH, supplemental H 2 -CO 2, ethanol, and 1 -propanol all increased CH 4 production rates while formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate inhibited {{the production of}} CH 4; methanol had no effect. H 2 -dependent acetogenesis occurred in H 2 -CO 2 -supplemented <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> only after extended incubation periods. Nonsupplemented <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> initially produced small amounts of H 2 that were subsequently consumed. The accumulation of H 2 was stimulated by ethanol and 1 -propanol or by inhibiting methanogenesis with bromoethanesulfonate, and the consumption of ethanol was inhibited by large amounts of H 2; these results collectively indicated that ethanol- or 1 -propanol-utilizing bacteria were trophically associated with H 2 -utilizing methanogens. A total of 109 anaerobes and 107 hydrogenotrophic methanogens per g (dry weight) of <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> were enumerated by cultivation techniques. A stable methanogenic enrichment was obtained with an acidic, H 2 -CO 2 -supplemented, fatty acid-enriched defined medium. CH 4 production rates by the enrichment were similar at pH 4. 5 and 6. 5, and acetate inhibited methanogenesis at pH 4. 5 but not at pH 6. 5. A total of 27 different archaeal 16 S rRNA gene sequences indicative of Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinaceae were retrieved from the highest CH 4 -positive serial dilutions of <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> and methanogenic enrichments.

In five model simulations, four sets of K data were used. The first set comprised measured K values from an anisotropic and heterogeneous <b>bog</b> <b>peat.</b> These data were aggregated to produce the following simplified data sets: an isotropic and heterogeneous distribution of K; an isotropic and homogeneous distribution; and an anisotropic and homogeneous distribution. We demonstrate that, where anisotropy and heterogeneity exist, groundwater flow in <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> is complex.

However, for our data at least, it is heterogeneity and not anisotropy that has the greater influence on producing complex patterns of groundwater flow.

For example, when measured K values are aggregated to produce isotropy and homogeneity, the rate of modelled seepage is reduced by 28 %. We also show that when measured K values are used, the presence of a drainage ditch can increase seepage through a modelled cross-section.
