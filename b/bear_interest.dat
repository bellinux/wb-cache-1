25|$|In {{addition}} to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50 {{million in the}} form of Demand Notes, which did not <b>bear</b> <b>interest</b> but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act of 1862, issuing United States Notes, which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were legal tender, meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through Gresham's Law. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in Hepburn v. Griswold that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the Legal Tender Cases. In 1875, Congress passed the Specie Payment Resumption Act, requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes to be redeemed for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 November 1979, the {{government}} of Comoros signed the Accord de coopération monétaire entre la République Française et la République fédérale islamique des Comores, a monetary cooperation agreement with France, making Comoros part of the franc zone (but {{not part of the}} CFA franc zone). This agreement provided {{for the establishment of a}} system of fixed parity between the French franc and the Comorian franc and free convertibility between the two currencies, guaranteed by the Comorian central bank's opening of an operations account (compte d'operation) at the French Treasury (Trésor public) to handle all exchange transactions. Sixty-five percent of the foreign exchange reserves of Comoros are held in euros in this account. This account is similar to overnight deposits with the French Treasury: [...] it may <b>bear</b> <b>interest</b> and may, in special circumstances, post a negative balance.

6000|$|About {{eight months}} after the first {{transaction}} relative to Cheyt Sing, and which is just reported, that is, on the 5th of January, 1781, Mr. Hastings produced a demand to the Council for money of his own expended for the Company's service.[28] Here was no occasion for secrecy. Mr. Francis was on his passage to Europe; Mr. Wheler was alone left, who no longer dissented from anything; Mr. Hastings was in effect himself the whole Council. He declared that he had disbursed three lacs of rupees, that is, thirty-four thousand five hundred pounds, in secret services,--which having, he says, [...] "been advanced from my own private cash, I request that the same may be repaid to me in the following manner." [...] He accordingly desires three bonds, for a lac of Sicca rupees each, to be given to him in two of the Company's subscriptions,--one to <b>bear</b> <b>interest</b> on the eight per cent loan, the other two in the four per cent: the bonds were antedated {{to the beginning of the}} preceding October. On the 9th of the same month, that is, on the 9th of January, 1781, the three bonds were accordingly ordered.[29] So far the whole transaction appears clear, and of a piece. Private money is subscribed, and a public security is taken for it. When the Company's Treasury accounts[30] are compared with the proceedings of their Council-General, a perfect correspondence also appears. The three bonds are then [there?] entered to Mr. Hastings, and he is credited for principal and interest on them, in the exact terms of the order. So far the official accounts,--which, because of their perfect harmony, are considered as clear and consistent evidence to one body of fact.|$|E

30|$|This {{problem can}} be related with a classic issue: the {{transaction}} demand for the cash, which began with Baumol (Baumol WJ 1952) and Tobin (Tobin J 1956), and more recently with Álvarez and Lippi (Álvarez F, Lippi F 2009). The transaction demand for the cash consists of managing an inventory of cash holdings: the decision maker holds two distinct types of assets, one asset which <b>bears</b> <b>interest</b> at a given rate, and a noninterest bearing asset where periodic receipts of deposit and expenditures are made. Transfers of funds between the two accounts are permissible but at a cost (transfer cost).|$|R

However, only $3,392,994 were issued, and these were rapidly exchanged for bonds.

50|$|In {{order to}} make a clear {{distinction}} between true deposits which serve as money and time loans, which are investments, we should also discourage the too easy conversion of these time “deposits” into cash. At present, time deposits seldom turn over as often as once a year; {{and the fact that they}} draw interest is, and would continue to be, a considerable safeguard against any attempt to make them function as a medium of exchange. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that abuses might creep in; for example, that the banks might encourage the savings “depositor” to circulate his “deposit” by providing him with some sort of certificates, in convenient denominations of say $1 or $5, as consideration for a lowering of the rate of interest paid to him. This subterfuge should be forbidden.
