2500|$|Heseltine {{was brought}} up in {{relative}} luxury at No. 1, Uplands Crescent (now No. 5). Heseltine told Tatler interviewer Charlotte Edwardes in 2016: [...] "At prep school, I started a birdwatching club called the Tit Club. Every member was named after a member of the tit family: the Marsh Tit, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Tit.</b> I was the Great Tit". He once feared the story might reach the press: [...] "I just know if that had got out when I was in active politics, I would never have recovered". He enjoyed angling in Brynmill Park and won a junior competition. He was educated at Shrewsbury School.|$|E
2500|$|Dias {{also argued}} that an {{inversion}} between source and sink habitat is possible so that the sinks may actually become the sources. [...] Because reproduction in source patches {{is much higher than}} in sink patches, natural selection is generally expected to favor adaptations to the source habitat. [...] However, if the proportion of source to sink habitat changes so that sink habitat becomes much more available, organisms may begin to adapt to it instead. [...] Once adapted, the sink may become a source habitat. [...] This is believed to have occurred for the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> (Parus caeruleus) 7500 years ago as forest composition on Corsica changed, but few modern examples are known. [...] Boughton described a source—pseudo-sink inversion in butterfly populations of E. editha. [...] Following the frost, the butterflies had difficulty recolonizing the former source patches. [...] Boughton found that the host plants in the former sources senesced much earlier than in the former pseudo-sink patches. [...] As a result, immigrants regularly arrived too late to successfully reproduce. [...] He found that the former pseudo-sinks had become sources, and the former sources had become true sinks.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{specialization}} {{within a}} habitat {{is associated with}} behaviors and morphological adaptations (physical traits of size and shape). Tiny birds are lightweight enough to hang onto the ends of twigs and pluck small prey; the goldcrest of Europe and its counterpart the golden-crowned kinglet of North America exhibit this feeding style. The related common firecrest is very similar in size and shape, but slightly bulkier, and has less of a tendency to glean along twigs {{and more of a}} habit of flying from perch to perch. Having a very small bill seems to be good for taking tiny prey from the surfaces of leaves, and small-billed birds such as the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> forage in broad-leafed woodlands. The long-billed gnatwren and speckled spinetail of Central and South America, and the ashy tailorbird and striped tit-babbler of South Asia, show a preference for gleaning in tangles of vines. [...] The ash-browed spinetail of South America specializes in gleaning among epiphytes on moss-covered tree branches. Many hummingbirds take small insects from flowers while probing for nectar, and some species glean actively among bark and leaves. The Puerto Rican emerald is one such hummingbird. Found only on the island of Puerto Rico, the female subsists on insects and spiders, while the male has a typical hummingbird diet of nectar. [...] Hummingbirds and other gleaners are also sometimes attracted to the sap wells created by sapsuckers. [...] Sapsuckers, which are in the woodpecker family, drill small holes in living tree branches to get the sap flowing. The sap and the insects it attracts are then consumed, and rufous hummingbirds have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source. Clusters of dead leaves also often harbor invertebrate prey, and the Bewick's wren and worm-eating warbler of North America have long bills well-suited for probing them, as do certain Asian babblers, such as the rusty-cheeked scimitar-babbler. In Central and South America, foliage-gleaners such as the red-faced spinetail and buff-throated foliage-gleaner are also examples of birds that glean clusters of dead leaves.|$|E

60|$|The Species of Tits as Illustrating Areas of Distribution.--In our own {{hemisphere}} {{the overlapping}} of allied species may be well {{illustrated by the}} various kinds of titmice, constituting the genus Parus, several of which are among our best known English birds. The great titmouse (Parus major) has the widest range of all, extending from the Arctic circle to Algeria, Palestine, and Persia, and from Ireland right across Siberia to the Ochotsk sea, probably following the great northern forest belt. It does not extend into China and Japan, where distinct species are found. Next in extent of range is the coal tit (Parus ater) which inhabits all Europe from the Mediterranean to about 64° N. latitude, in Asia Minor to the Lebanon and Caucasus, and across Siberia to Amoorland and Japan. The marsh tit (Parus palustris) inhabits temperate and south Europe from 61° N. latitude in Norway to Poland and South-west Russia, and in the south from Spain to Asia Minor. Closely allied to this--of which it is probably only a variety or sub-species--is the northern marsh tit (Parus borealis), which overlaps the last in Norway and Sweden, and also in South Russia and the Alps, but extends further north into Lapland and North Russia, and thence probably in a south-easterly direction across Central Asia to North China. Yet another closely-allied species (Parus camtschatkensis) ranges from North-eastern Russia across Northern Siberia to Lake Baikal and to Hakodadi in Japan, thus overlapping Parus borealis in the {20} western portion of its area. Our little favourite, the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> (Parus coeruleus) ranges over all Europe from the Arctic circle to the Mediterranean, and on to Asia Minor and Persia, but {{does not seem to}} pass beyond the Ural mountains. Its lovely eastern ally the azure tit (Parus cyaneus) overlaps the range of P. coeruleus in Western Europe as far as St. Petersburg and Austria, rarely straggling to Denmark, while it stretches all across Central Asia between the latitudes 35° and 56° N. as far as the Amoor valley. Besides these wide-ranging species there are several others which are more restricted. Parus teneriffæ, a beautiful dark blue form of our <b>blue</b> <b>tit,</b> inhabits North-west Africa and the Canaries; Parus ledouci, closely allied to our coal tit, is found only in Algeria; Parus lugubris, allied to the marsh tit, is confined to South-east Europe and Asia Minor, from Hungary and South Russia to Palestine; and Parus cinctus, another allied form, is confined to the extreme north in Lapland, Finland, and perhaps Northern Russia and Siberia. Another beautiful little bird, the crested titmouse (Parus cristatus) is sometimes placed in a separate genus. It inhabits nearly all Central and South Europe, wherever there are pine forests, from 64° N. latitude to Austria and North Italy, and in the west to Spain and Gibraltar, while in the east it does not pass the Urals and the Caucasus range. Its nearest allies are in the high Himalayas.|$|E
60|$|But where, {{during the}} days when the vociferous cuckoo, with hoarse chuckle and dissyllabic call and wild {{bubbling}} cry was so much with us--where, in this period of many pleasant noises was the cuckoo's mate, or maid, or messenger, the quaint and beautiful wryneck? There are few British birds, perhaps not one--not even the crafty black and white magpie, or mysterious moth-like goatsucker, or tropical kingfisher--more interesting to watch. At twilight I had lingered at the woodside, also in other likely places, and the goatsucker had failed to appear, gliding and zig-zagging hither and thither on his dusky-mottled noiseless wings, and now this still heavier disappointment was mine. I could not find the wryneck. Those quiet grassy orchards, shut in by straggling hedges, should have had him as a favoured summer guest. Creeper and nuthatch, and starling and gem-like <b>blue</b> <b>tit,</b> found holes enough in the old trunks to breed in. And yet I knew that, albeit not common, he was there; I could not exactly say where, but somewhere {{on the other side of}} the next hedge or field or orchard; for I heard his unmistakable cry, now on this hand, now on that. Day after day I followed the voice, sometimes in my eagerness forcing my way through a brambly hedge to emerge with scratched hands and clothes torn, like one that had been set upon and mauled by some savage animal of the cat kind; and still the quaint figure eluded my vision.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the curious}} {{results of the}} general action of this {{principle}} in nature is, that the most closely allied species--those whose differences though often real and important are hardly perceptible to any one but a naturalist--are usually {{not found in the}} same but in widely separated countries. Thus, the nearest allies to our European golden plover are found in North America and East Asia; the nearest ally of our European jay is found in Japan, although there are several other species of jays in Western Asia and North Africa; and though we have several species of titmice in England they are not very closely allied to each other. The form most akin to our <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> is the azure tit of Central Asia (Parus azureus); the Parus ledouci of Algeria is very near our coal tit, and the Parus lugubris of South-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor is nearest to our marsh tit. So, our four species of wild pigeons--the ring-dove, stock-dove, rock-pigeon, and turtle-dove--are not closely allied to each other, but each of them belongs, according to some ornithologists, to a separate genus or subgenus, and has its nearest relatives in distant parts of Asia and Africa. In mammalia the same thing occurs. Each mountain region of Europe and Asia has usually its own species of wild sheep and goat, and sometimes of antelope and deer; so that in each region there is found the greatest diversity in this class of animals, while the closest allies inhabit quite distinct and often distant areas. In plants we find the same phenomenon prevalent. Distinct species of columbine are found in Central Europe (Aguilegia vulgaris), in Eastern Europe, and Siberia (A. glandulosa), in the Alps (A. Alpina), in the Pyrenees (A. pyrenaiea), in the Greek mountains (A. ottonis), and in Corsica (A. Bernardi), but rarely are two species found in the same area. So, each part of the world has its own peculiar forms of pines, firs, and cedars, but the closely allied species or varieties are in almost every case inhabitants of distinct areas. Examples are the deodar of the Himalayas, the cedar of Lebanon, and that of North Africa, all very closely allied but confined to distinct areas; and the numerous closely allied species of true pine (genus Pinus), which almost always inhabit different countries or occupy different stations. We will now consider some other modes in which natural selection will act, to adapt organisms to changed conditions.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{research}} on the foraging ecology and breeding biology of <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits(Parus major) has mainly concentrated on populations in woodland. However increasing urbanisation means much of the suitable tit habitat is represented by fragmented areas, not large woodlands, and {{little is known about}} factors that may affect reproductive success in urban environments. Using General and Generalised Linear Models this study compared reproductive performance in four habitat types with differing levels of habitat modification: the Cambridge University Botanic Garden (CUBG) with an abundance of non-native vegetation and structural fragmentation, two marginal sites with native scrubby vegetation and structural fragmentation and small fragments and large fragments of native woodland. Compositional analysis was used in a study focused on how foraging <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> used the heterogeneous habitat of the CUBG. Additionally frequency tests were used to compare foraging preferences and foraging behaviours of both species in the CUBG. Productivity was poor in the CUBG compared to all of the other habitats, with great tits appearing to do worse than <b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> rearing lower quality chicks (significantly lower mean mass than in other habitats). Within the CUBG, positive relationships were found between the abundance of native trees and shrubs and breeding success for both <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and great tits. A positive relationship was found between breeding success in <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and the abundance of Quercus and Betula. However, habitat and year interactions showed that habitat and reproductive relationships were complicated by annual variation. The two species differed in their foraging preferences in the CUBG; <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> were observed feeding in native deciduous trees significantly more than in non-native species and had a preference for birch trees over other taxa. Great tits however showed no strong preferences for any of the habitat types. With regards to foraging behaviours, great tits used a wider range of foraging heights and different foraging locations and capture techniques than <b>blue</b> <b>tits.</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>tits</b> were observed‘hanging’ from twigs more frequently, and appeared to be more effective at foraging in the wider variety of plants available in the heterogeneous vegetation of the garden. The data presented in this thesis suggest that <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> have adopted a better foraging strategy by preferentially choosing native deciduous trees over the abundance of non-natives available in the CUBG. However, despite the apparent better foraging strategy of <b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> reproductive performance of both species is poor in this urban garden compared to marginal sites and woodland. Urbanisation and the associated loss of optimal tit habitat are likely to continue. It is therefore important to offset urbanisation by the addition of appropriate foraging habitats that are likely to improve reproductive success, such as native trees and shrubs...|$|R

Learned as well as innate {{avoidance}} has been observed in birds, but the existing evidence is based on experiments with rather few unrelated model species. We compared the origin of avoidance in European species of tits (Paridae). First, we tested whether wild-caught birds (<b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> great tits, crested tits, coal tits, willow tits, and marsh tits) avoid aposematic (red and black) adult firebugs Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera) more than nonaposematic (brown painted) ones. Larger proportion of birds avoided aposematic than brown-painted firebugs in majority of species (except coal tits). Second, we tested whether naive hand-reared birds of 4 species (<b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> great tits, crested tits, and coal tits) attack or avoid aposematic and nonaposematic firebugs, both novel for them. Behavior of the naive <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and coal tits {{was similar to that}} of the wild-caught birds; majority of them did not attack the firebugs. Contrastingly, the naive great tits and crested tits behaved differently than the wild-caught conspecific adults; majority of the wild-caught birds avoided the aposematic firebugs, whereas the naive birds usually did not show any initial avoidance and had to learn to avoid the aposematic prey. Our results show that the origin of avoidance may be different even in closely related species. Because <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and coal tits avoided not only aposematic firebugs but also their brown-painted form, we interpret their behavior as innate neophobia rather than innate bias against the warning coloration.
