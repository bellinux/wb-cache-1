5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if the difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether {{the total number of}} electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E
5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|In Victoria {{groups of}} {{locomotives}} {{of the same}} design are classed together by letter, in a system introduced in 1886. Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which is unique to the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E

5|$|The four-engined {{chartered}} propliner departed Columbia, South Carolina, at 15:24 EST, {{and landed}} in Newark, New Jersey, at 17:37, where it picked up its first group of 26 passengers. It departed at 18:22 for Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where it picked up 31 additional passengers. At 19:12 it departed for Baltimore, Maryland, where it picked up a final group of 17 passengers and departed for South Carolina at 20:30. During these flight segments, as he would later testify at the CAB hearing, the flight engineer opened the cross feed valves <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> three and four engines, since {{he had seen a}} drop in fuel pressure on the number 3 fuel pressure gauge after the initial takeoff from Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in Ascaris and Ancylostoma on Stoll 2 ̆ 7 s egg counting method which has been widely in use in determining the presence of parasite worm eggs in the stool. By making 30 counts each of the eggs contained in {{the upper and lower}} layers of the solution of feces in a test tube, studies. were made on whether there were any differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of eggs contained in two layers of solution, and what are the patterns of the distribution of eggs in a test tube. (1) Ascaris Eggs. a. When x^^-= 5. 6, there was no difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of eggs contained in the upper and lower layers of the solution of feces in a test tube, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of eggs in a tube was distributed according to Poisson distribution. b.

5|$|Much of Japan's {{industrial}} capacity was also destroyed by Allied bombing. Over 600 major industrial facilities were destroyed or badly damaged, {{contributing to a}} large decline in production. Absenteeism caused by the air attacks further reduced output. It {{is not possible to}} determine the exact damage bombing caused to Japan's economy, however, as the Allied naval blockade also contributed to general breakdown which occurred from late 1944. Statistics compiled by the USSBS show a correlation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of B-29 sorties directed at different industries and the amount by which their production declined, but air attacks were not the only reason for these differences. In addition to the heavy bomber attacks, the operations by Allied aircraft carriers tightened the blockade by disrupting Japanese coastal shipping; the naval aircraft were unable to carry enough bombs to seriously damage Japanese industrial plants, however. Compounding the effects of the air attacks, Japan's rice crop of 1945 failed. The resulting shortage of rice caused widespread malnutrition, and mass starvation would have occurred had the war continued. In financial terms, the Allied air campaign and attacks on merchant ships destroyed between one third and a quarter of Japan's wealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E
