40|$|In this paper, the {{exceptional}} story of “Simit Sarayı”, transformation {{from a national}} café into an <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and retailer, is discussed with respect to network modalities and strategic management processes. How a manufacturing firm has managed to achieve a high value added competitive advantage? Does being a partner of network (taking franchising licence) and getting the advantage of retailing network satisfies only the necessary conditions to be a global retailer or both necessary and sufficient conditions? This paper contains the interesting idea that marketing strategy choice of members of a franchise network {{may be related to}} their structural position in that network. It develops a potentially valuable metric of proximity to network resources and deploys the somewhat novel CRT technique to test some propositions. Within this research firm’s achievement of a high value added competitive advantage is expressed with network modalities. The research design would benefit from clearer focus on the strategic options open to the individual franchiser...|$|E
40|$|A pay-for-delay drug settlement, {{also called}} a reverse payment settlement, {{occurs when a}} brand name {{pharmaceutical}} company agrees to pay the maker of a similar generic drug to delay {{the release of the}} generic drug into the stream of commerce, thereby allowing the brand name pharmaceutical company to eliminate competition {{for an extended period of}} time. These agreements allow both the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and the generic manufacturer to profit immensely. These settlements cost the American public an estimated $ 3. 5 billion per year. Further, reverse payment settlements on average prevent generic drugs from entering the stream of commerce for an additional seventeen months. As a result, the public is missing out on generic drugs that could be up to ninety percent cheaper than the brand name version. This Comment intends to show that reverse payment settlements are unduly burdensome on interstate commerce, and thus it is within the purview of Congress to regulate these types of agreements. First, this Comment will explore the statutory framework through which pay-for-delay settlements became prominent. Next, this Comment discusses the history of pay-for-delay litigation and the underlying patent and antitrust laws that courts have focused on in making their decisions. After the necessary background is established, this Comment explores the commerce clause of the United States Constitution and argues that pay-for-delay settlements are unduly burdensome on interstate commerce, and therefore, either Congress should illegalize the settlements through legislation or the Supreme Court should find them unconstitutional. Finally, the possible benefits of such legislation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{two issues}} in {{operations}} management. The {{first one is}} the impact of counterfeits and strategies of fighting counterfeits for brand name companies, which includes two parts, and the second one is the effect of timing of payments in a joint replenishment and pricing control problem. Counterfeiting is a widely spread phenomenon and has seen rapid growth in recent years. All counterfeits can be divided into two categories, non-deceptive and deceptive, depending on whether consumers can recognize them when making a purchase. In the first part, we focus on how non-deceptive counterfeits affect the price, market share and profitability of brand name products. We also consider the strategies for brand name companies to fight non-deceptive counterfeits, compare different fighting strategies in a market with one brand name product and its counterfeit, and derive equilibrium fighting strategies in a market with two competing brand name products and a counterfeit under general conditions. In the second part, we focus on how deceptive counterfeits affect a brand name manufacturer’s profit and supply chain structure. In a market with deceptive counterfeits, the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> <b>manufacturer</b> should consider protective strategies on its supply chain to avoid being penetrated by counterfeits. We analyze a brand name manufacturer’s optimal decision on whether to establish a reliable distribution channel, decentralized or centralized, to guarantee 100 % authenticity, and whether to sell through the general channel having been penetrated by counterfeits. We also compare the profit from a centralized reliable channel to the one from a decentralized one. In the third part, we consider the joint replenishment and pricing control problem in a periodic review system in which consumers pay upon receiving their goods and unmet demand is lost if not filled in the following period, referred to as conditional backlogging. We show that a base-stock list price policy is optimal in the case without a fixed ordering cost, and provide a sufficient condition for an (st, St, pt) policy to be optimal in the case with a positive fixed ordering cost. We also compare this system to the one where customers pay upon arrival analytically and numerically...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a formal model of the {{pharmaceutical}} market as a market with price competition between the original and the generic alternative. The generic substitutes are perceived by the consumers as di¤erentiated products, {{even though they are}} chemically identical. In addition, because of price regulation, a low ”limit price” will be a credible commitment not to increase prices upon entry. Hence entry can be deterred. We show that in such a context, the original manufacturer may have an incentive to deter entry. Finally, some empirical results concerning the determinants of the price paths of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> drugs are presented. The results suggest that the introduction of potential competition, i. e. patent expiration, does force <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to lower their prices, as does generic entry and did the introduction of the reference-price system. The opinions expressed in this paper {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily coincide with those ot the Competition Authoriy. 1 Key Words: Price paths, patent expiration, limit pricing (, natural experiment?) ...|$|R

40|$|In durablegoods markets, many <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> {{including}} IBM, HP, Epson, and Lenovo, {{have adopted}} dual-channel supply chains to market their products. There is scant literature, however, addressing the product durability {{and its impact}} on players’ optimal strategies in a dual-channel supply chain. To fill this void, we consider a two-period dual-channel model in which amanufacturer sells adurable product directly through both amanufacturer-owned e-channel and an independent dealer who adopts a mix of selling and leasing to consumers. Our results show that the manufacturer begins encroaching into the market in Period 1, but the dealer starts withdrawing from the retail channel in Period 2. Moreover, as the direct selling cost decreases, the equilibrium quantities and wholesale prices become quite angular and often nonmonotonic. Among other results, we find that both the dealer and the supply chain may benefit from the manufacturer’s encroachment. Our results also indicate that both the market structure and the nature of competition have an important impact on the player’s (dealer’s) optimal choice of leasing and selling...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court’s 2011 {{decision}} in PLIVA v. Mensing left consumers of generic drugs without {{a remedy for}} failure-to-warn claims.

Because of this impossibility, the Court held that the FDA regulations preempt state failure-to-warn claims.

40|$|Evergreening' is not {{a formal}} concept of patent law. It is best {{understood}} as a social idea {{used to refer to}} the myriad ways in which pharmaceutical patent owners utilise the law and related regulatory processes to extend their high rent-earning intellectual monopoly privileges, particularly over highly profitable (either in total sales volume or price per unit) 'blockbuster' drugs. Thus, while the courts are an instrument frequently used by pharmaceutical <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to prolong their patent royalties, 'evergreening' is rarely mentioned explicitly by judges in patent protection cases. The term usually refers to threats made to competitors about a brand-name manufacturer's tactical use of pharmaceutical patents (including over uses, delivery systems and even packaging), not to extension of any particular patent over an active product ingredient. This article focuses in particular on the 'evergreening' potential of so-called 'linkage' provisions, imposed on the regulatory (safety, quality and efficacy) approval systems for generic pharmaceuticals of Canada and Australia, by specific articles in trade agreements with the US. These 'linkage' provisions have also recently appeared in the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KORUSFTA). They require such drug regulators to facilitate notification of, or even prevent, any potential patent infringement by a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer. This article explores the regulatory lessons to be learnt from Canada's and Australia's shared experience in terms of minimizing potential adverse impacts of such 'linkage evergreening' provisions on drug costs and thereby potentially on citizen's access to affordable, essential medicines...|$|R

50|$|Less {{well-known}} but plentiful is {{a family}} of projectors based around a design originated by Sawyer's and later sold under other <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> That <b>manufacturer's</b> first slide projectors, in the late 1950s, had used straight trays.

Unlike the Carousel tray's use of a locking collar to hold the slide in the tray, the Rototray held slides in place using friction {{against the side of}} each slide. Projectors using the 100-slide Rototray were backward-compatible with the TDC-Universal straight slide trays that had been popular since the late 1950s.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: India {{has more}} than 20, 000 {{registered}} pharmaceutical manufacturers. Consequently, there is a flood of <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> to choose from. We conducted this study to analyse and sort out the multitudinous <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> thronging the Indian market, and identified those that could create a possible confusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recent issues of drug formularies like Indian Drug Review, Drug Index, and Monthly Index of Medical Specialities-India were checked and all the <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> given were included. Some other <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> that are available with the pharmacists but {{are not included in}} these indexes were also included in the study for analysis. OBSERVATIONS: Potentially confusing <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> were sorted out and categorised according to the severity of damage they can cause if misinterpreted by the pharmacist or the patient. Subgroups were made according to the <b>brand</b> <b>name,</b> the generic <b>name,</b> and the <b>manufacturers</b> of the drug. CONCLUSION: Several <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> are strikingly identical, similar looking (orthographic), or similar sounding (phonological). Preventing this possible confusion is not the work of any one person involved. We describe the role of prescribing doctors, dispensing pharmacists, consumer patients, and the manufacturing companies to prevent "wrong prescribing" due to similarities in <b>brand</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R
