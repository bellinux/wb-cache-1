5|$|Glass <b>beads</b> for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue <b>beads</b> and glass <b>beads</b> with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green <b>beads,</b> and 'eyes' <b>beads,</b> there are examples of <b>beads</b> of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of <b>beads</b> {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of <b>beads</b> found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed <b>beads</b> into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular <b>beads</b> made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of <b>beads.</b> All but 25 of the 558 <b>beads</b> categorized as class 1–3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 <b>beads</b> in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass <b>beads</b> formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass <b>beads</b> are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass <b>beads</b> to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} jewellery, <b>beads,</b> and charms was also found. 100 <b>beads</b> in total were {{recovered}} from 16 graves, though only two {{had more than}} 10 <b>beads.</b> The small number of <b>beads</b> found in the remaining 14 graves is indicative of how styles had changed; in the 6th century it was customary for women to wear up to 100 relatively plain <b>beads</b> {{at a time in}} the form of necklaces, but by the mid-7th century, the fashion was for a small number of high-quality <b>beads</b> which may have been attached with wire or carried in a bag. A very unusual discovery was made in grave 21– the remnants of a necklace comprising eight <b>beads</b> and two Iron Age gold coins minted by the Corieltauvi tribe of modern Lincolnshire some time between 15–45AD, before the Roman conquest of Britain. Holes had been drilled in the coins, which were more than 600years old {{by the time they were}} buried, to convert them into items of jewellery. Their excellent condition suggests that they had not been used for long, or at all, as currency; it is possible that they had been part of a hoard buried shortly after they were minted and were rediscovered during Saxon times. The discovery of Roman coins in a Saxon grave of this period is unique to the Street House cemetery. It is likely that they were valued because of the cross-shaped designs on the coins' reverse.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere between 100 and 200 {{million years}} after the Serenitatis basin and Taurus–Littrow formed, the lavas that began to seep through the lunar crust began to flood the low-lying areas. These lava flows were often {{accompanied}} by fire fountains that blanketed the surrounding area with tiny glass <b>beads.</b> These <b>beads</b> were sometimes colored orange, explaining the orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts at Shorty crater. Most of these <b>beads,</b> however, were darkly colored, resulting in the dark appearance of the Serenitatis basin from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{findings of}} glass and stone <b>beads</b> at the site provided Begley the link to Arikamedu's history. She identified the <b>beads</b> as Indo-Pacific <b>beads</b> crafted at Arikamedu. Based on the antiquities and structural features from the excavations, Begley and Raman established a revised sequence of six major periods of occupation of the site. Finds of new variety of Roman Amphorae ware also facilitated revision of the dates of occupancy. They have also inferred that the site has been in continuous occupation since at least 2nd or 3rd century BCE to much more recent times.|$|E

5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A <b>bead</b> breaker {{is a tool}} {{used for}} {{separating}} tires from rims. The inner-most diameter of the tire that interfaces with a wheel is called the Tire <b>Bead.</b> The tire <b>bead</b> is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the <b>Bead</b> Bundle. [...] The inner-most surface of the tire <b>bead</b> creates the air seal between the tire and rim on a radial-ply tire and a bias-ply tire. Often, the <b>bead</b> can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring {{the use of a}} <b>bead</b> breaker in order to be removed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Laser Beam Welding (LBW) is {{a widely}} used welding {{technique}} in Automotive, Aerospace, and Electronic and Heavy manufacturing industries to join a variety of metals and alloys because of its high speed, fine welding seam quality, low heat input per unit volume, deep penetration, and narrow heat affected zone, and reduced tendency to cracking. Laser welding input parameters play a very significant {{role in determining the}} quality of a weld joint. The joint quality can be defined in terms of the weld <b>bead</b> parameters such as weld <b>bead</b> penetration, <b>Bead</b> width & <b>bead</b> volume. In this study, the weld <b>bead</b> geometry such as depth of penetration, <b>bead</b> width and <b>Bead</b> volume of the laser welded butt joints made of INCONEL 600 sheets were investigated. Full factorial design was used to carry out the experimental design. Artificial Neural networks (ANN) program available in MatLab software is used to establish the relationships between the laser welding input parameters i. e pulse duration, pulse frequency, welding speed, pulse energy and the output responses i. e <b>bead</b> penetration, <b>bead</b> width, <b>bead</b> volume...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of the draw <b>bead</b> could reduce the concave/convex wall features. However, it also affected the wall thinning. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} determine the suitable draw <b>bead</b> geometry to obtain a straight wall without the wall thinning. In this study, the effects of draw <b>bead</b> geometry of height and width on concave/convex wall feature and wall thinning were investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) and experiments. Based on the stress distribution analysis, the increasing in draw <b>bead</b> width and the decreasing in draw <b>bead</b> height lead to the concave wall feature increased; however, the {{application of}} the too small draw <b>bead</b> width and the too large draw <b>bead</b> height generated the convex wall feature. The wall thinning also decreased as the draw <b>bead</b> width increased as well as the draw <b>bead</b> height decreased. Therefore, the application of suitable draw <b>bead</b> height and width significantly suppressed the concave/convex wall feature and wall thinning, which resulted in the straight wall with the smallest wall thinning could be achieved...|$|R
5|$|At {{the current}} time, the most-adopted method is an {{automated}} synthesis on a solid support (e.g., polystyrene <b>beads),</b> using protecting groups (e.g., Fmoc and t-Boc) and activating groups (e.g., DCC and DIC).|$|E
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. <b>Beads</b> of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved <b>beads,</b> clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the <b>beads,</b> hexagonal designs on <b>beads,</b> inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
5|$|On {{completion}} of the course, participants are awarded the Wood Badge <b>beads</b> to recognize significant achievement in leadership and direct service to young people. The pair of small wooden <b>beads,</b> one on each end of a leather thong (string), is worn around the neck {{as part of the}} Scout uniform. The <b>beads</b> are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the £7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians.|$|E
40|$|Weftless <b>bead</b> design used in tires {{has long}} been the cause of failure. This type of <b>bead</b> design is {{generally}} used in agriculture, buses, trucks and passenger car tires. The main problem with this kind of <b>bead</b> is the splice region. It has ten cut wires, five at each over and underlap region. It is known since 1950 that Weftless design of the tire <b>bead</b> had failures within about 5 cm {{from the end of the}} overlapping parallel wire ribbon. The cause for this failure is generally attributed to the mounting process in which the diameter of the tire <b>bead</b> is changed during the mounting process as it moves from the well of the rim to the <b>bead</b> seat. The ideal <b>bead</b> design is a high strength flexible cable with minimal cross section, having same over and under windings to prevent stress concentrations in deflections as used in a normal steel cable. A finite element model of the tire <b>bead</b> was developed using ANSYS and tested under the known stresses of the mounting and final use conditions. Finite element calculations show the failure point of the Weftless <b>bead</b> is almost always at the under lap or at the starting point of this <b>bead.</b> Cable <b>bead</b> have significant advantages in safety over the Weftless <b>bead</b> still used in tires...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. As {{a part of}} a {{study and}} {{analysis}} on the effects of process para-meters on weld <b>bead</b> volume in sub-merged arc welding (SAW) of pipes, mathematical models were developed to relate the process parameters and the weld <b>bead</b> quality parameters. Further, the optimization of weld <b>bead</b> volume was carried out using the optimization module available in the MATLAB version 4. 2 b software package. The mathemati-cal models thus developed for optimiza-tion are also helpful in predicting the weld <b>bead</b> quality parameters and in set-ting process parameters at optimum val-ues to achieve the desirable weld <b>bead</b> quality at a relatively low cost {{with a high degree of}} repeatability and increased production rate. Total volume of the weld <b>bead,</b> an important <b>bead</b> parameter, was optimized (minimized), keeping the di-mensions of the other important <b>bead</b> pa-rameters as constraints, to obtain sound and superior quality welded pipes. Sen-sitivity analysis was also carried out to predict the direct and few interaction ef-fects of important <b>bead</b> parameters on the total volume of the weld <b>bead,</b> and the results are presented in graphical form. The results of the sensitivity analy-sis are very useful in understanding the interdependence of various weld <b>bead</b> quality parameters in controlling the vol-ume of the weld <b>bead,</b> to improve weld quality, to increase productivity with the available welding facilities and to mini-mize the total welding cost...|$|R

40|$|The {{directional}} {{movement on}} a microtubule {{of a plastic}} <b>bead</b> connected elastically to a single one-headed kinesin motor is studied theoretically. The kinesin motor can bind and unbind to periodic binding sites on the microtubule and undergo conformational changes while catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP. An analytic formalism relating {{the dynamics of the}} <b>bead</b> and the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the motor is derived so that the calculation of the average velocity of the <b>bead</b> can be easily carried out. The formalism was applied to a simple three-state biochemical model to investigate how the velocity of the <b>bead</b> movement is affected by the external load, the diffusion coefficient of the <b>bead,</b> and the stiffness of the elastic element connecting the <b>bead</b> and the motor. The <b>bead</b> velocity was found to be critically dependent on the diffusion coefficient of the <b>bead</b> and the stiffness of the elastic element. A linear force-velocity relation was found for the model no matter whether the <b>bead</b> velocity was modulated by the diffusion coefficient of the <b>bead</b> or by the externally applied load. The formalism should be useful in modeling the mechanisms of chemimechanical coupling in kinesin motors based on in vitro motility data...|$|R
