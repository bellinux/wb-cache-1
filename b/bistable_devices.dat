A general deterministic model of <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> is proposed, consisting of a non-liner differential system with some adequate properties. Analysis of this model shows that <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> can be driven into a logically undefined region by certain admissible inputs and can remain in this region for an unbounded length of time.

30|$|In {{the past}} few decades, organic {{electrically}} <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> have attracted much attention due to their potential applications {{in the next generation}} of nonvolatile memory technology [1 – 3]. To date, various candidates have been exploited to be used in electrically <b>bistable</b> <b>devices,</b> in which hybrid inorganic/organic nanocomposites have currently aroused broad interests due to their simple fabrication and low cost [4 – 6]. In general, the hybrid organic/inorganic nanocomposites are formed by dissolving colloidal inorganic nanocrystals and polymers into organic solvent to form a homogeneous phase. A typical device structure for the hybrid organic/inorganic bistable device is a single nanocrystal/polymer hybrid layer sandwiched between two electrodes, in which the hybrid layer is formed by using a simple spin-coating method. Substantial research efforts in the exploitation of inorganic nanocrystals have led to the applications of different types of inorganic nanocrystals in the fabrication of hybrid organic/inorganic <b>bistable</b> <b>devices,</b> such as II-VI group semiconductors, noble metals, and graphene and metal oxide nanocrystals [7 – 9]. Recently, our group reported some electrically <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> based on dodecanethiol-capped Cu 2 S, hybrid silver sulfide (Ag 2 S), and Ag nanocrystals blending with conjugated polymer, and obvious electrical bistability and negative differential resistance (NDR) effects were clearly observed. Although some different resistive switching mechanisms, such as charge trapping [10, 11], redox reaction [12], and metallic filament conducting [13, 14], have been brought out to elucidate the charge transport process, the resistive switching mechanism is still under debate. Therefore, there is no end to study the working mechanisms of the electrically <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> based on organic/inorganic nanocomposites. In our previous work, an obvious electrical bistability was observed in the hybrid organic/inorganic nanocomposites [15], but the environmental gas effects on the electrical bistability and working mechanism were not discussed. Based on our previous work, herein, the effects of environmental gas on the electrical bistability of the devices were studied, and the devices were fabricated based on hybrid organic/inorganic Ag 2 S/poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) nanocomposites through a simple spin-coating technique. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the hybrid electrically <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> exhibit a strong dependence on the oxygen concentrations, in which the current of ON and OFF states changes with the measurement atmosphere variation from N 2 to air. On the basis of the experimental results, different organic electronic models were employed to describe the carrier transport of the electrically <b>bistable</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{new kind}} of optical bistability is {{discussed}} {{that is based on}} mutual self-action of light beams in a nonlinear medium.

[...] However {{it can be seen}} that it was essentially a <b>bistable</b> <b>device,</b> a radio-wave-operated switch, and so it did not have the ability to rectify the radio wave to demodulate the later amplitude modulated (AM) radio transmissions that carried sound.|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{limitations on}} the operation of optical <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> in a ring cavity and in GaAs etalons are investigated. Experimental results of spontaneous transitions due to shot noise fluctuations are found in good agreement with various "ladder" models, if one allows the counting rates to vary accordingly. Stability analysis for two-photon homogeneously broadened media reveals single-wavelength instabilities for the laser but not for absorptive optical bistability. Appreciable regions of sidemode gain exist for both problems allowing for multiwavelength instabilities to occur. GaAs <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> show attractive features such as low power and high speed {{at room temperature for}} optical processing. However, experimental evidence in GaAs confirm the computer simulations of bistability that cavity losses, due to unsaturable background absorption, limit the switching power at room temperature.
