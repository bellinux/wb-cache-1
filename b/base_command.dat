5|$|Haynes {{returned}} to Assam in June 1943, to organize for Bissell the Assam-American Air <b>Base</b> <b>Command</b> (AAABC) which he led as a mixed force composed primarily of Tenth Air Force units with {{some elements of}} the Fourteenth Air Force. Haynes was tasked with coordinating area defense and offensive destruction of the enemy, {{the emphasis on the}} former. For the first two months, Haynes was given fewer officers and men than he deemed necessary, and the AAABC made little headway in its mission. In mid-August, large-scale re-organization of Allied forces in Asia resulted in the AAABC being renamed the , and placed under George E. Stratemeyer. Haynes led the group until September 1943, when he {{returned to}} the U.S. after 18 months in Asia. Before he left, he told American reporters that his forces had helped deny the port of Rangoon to the enemy, and helped soften Burma for invasion. He stated that the highlight of his time in Asia was the air raid against Hong Kong. After his upcoming air crossing of the Atlantic, his eighth such, Haynes said that the first thing he intended to do was look up his 14-year-old son in high school and his wife who was working in the drafting department at Sperry in Garden City, New York.|$|E

The courts of inquiry into both accidents concluded that insufficient supervision of the units stationed at RNZAF Base Ohakea had contributed to unsafe flying practices. In particular, the court of inquiry into the Iroquois accident found that the abolition of the RNZAF's geographically co-located <b>base</b> <b>command</b> positions in 2001 had resulted in a harmful lack of clarity around command responsibility.|$|E

After attending the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 8 January to 6 March 1945, he was posted to the Cavalry Replacement Training Center at Fort Riley, and then, on 9 July 1945, to the staff of the Central Pacific <b>Base</b> <b>Command</b> on Okinawa. On 15 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) of the 7th Infantry Division, then also based on Okinawa, but which subsequently participated in the United States occupation of Korea after the war ended.

25|$|Recognizing {{the link}} between {{geographic}} and social isolation, the <b>base</b> <b>command</b> incorporated a number of recreational facilities into their programs and building projects, making Ernest Harmon AFB a leader of sorts among USAF facilities. By the mid-1950s, thousands of service men and their families were making use of these activities monthly. In the area of Hobby Shops there was space available for leather craft, ceramics, amateur radio, lapidary, woodworking, automotive shops, model airplanes and photo labs. Sports facilities and groups were set for softball, baseball, bowling, golf, picnicking, archery and guns. The Stephenville area was located near good hunting and fishing grounds, thus the base established a fishing lodge at Camp 33 with eight large cabins, a 40-man bunk house, along with a mess hall and kitchen. Camp 33 was owned by the Bowater Pulp and Paper Company which had a mill in Corner Brook, although the camp was leased to the base during {{the spring and summer}} months.|$|E

500|$|To {{command and}} support all Army units on Okinawa and perform the theater {{logistic}} functions for United States and allied {{forces in the}} Pacific, U.S. Army <b>Base</b> <b>Command,</b> Okinawa was established as a major subordinate command of U.S. Army Japan on 15 May 1972. The command was reorganized as U.S. Army Garrison Okinawa and was reorganized in 1978 as U.S. Army Support Activity. This was again changed back to U.S. Army Garrison Okinawa in September 1979. In February 1986, the unit was re-designated as 10th Area Support Group and served as the Installation Command for all Army units located on Okinawa. [...] It was then officially reflagged effective 18 February 1986 as 10th Area Support Group (Provisional). The provisional status was dropped on 16 October 1987. During this timeframe, the headquarters was transferred to Torii Station. The 10th Area Support Group served as the installation command for all Army organization on Okinawa and provides contingency support to forces in the Pacific Rim. U.S. Army Garrison Torii Station was activated on July 11, 2011 and was officially recognized as a battalion-level command. On 4 March 2014, U.S. Army Garrison Torii Station was redesignated U.S. Army Garrison Okinawa.|$|E

2500|$|Haynes {{responded by}} moving the other {{squadron}} of the 51st FG to Sookerating, while the China Air Task Force was ordered to launch a series of attacks by B-25s against Lashio. While Chennault complied, {{he did not believe}} that the Japanese strikes originated there and the rift between him and Tenth Air Force grew wider. Whatever the case, the Japanese raids were not repeated in 1942. In June 1943, following small, sporadic raids during the dry season, the entire fighter strength of the India Air task Force, amounting to less than 100 P-40s, was organized as the Assam American Air <b>Base</b> <b>Command</b> (later the 5320th Air Defense Wing, Provisional), [...] specifically to protect the Assam airfields.|$|E

Stephenville Air Base was renamed [...] "Ernest Harmon Air Force Base" [...] on June 23, 1948, in honor of Captain Ernest Emery Harmon. Capt Harmon was a U.S. Army Air Corps pilot who was killed in an air crash in 1933. The deepwater port which supported the base was named Port Harmon at this time.|$|E
