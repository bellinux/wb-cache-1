5000|$|At 02:18 Cherry 01 {{transmitted}} the execute command [...] "Alpha, Alpha, Alpha" [...] to all aircraft as it overflew {{the prison}} and deployed four illumination flares, then performed a hard-turning descent to 500 ft to drop two <b>battle</b> <b>simulators</b> south and southeast of Sơn Tây. After Apple 03 made its strafing pass with side-firing miniguns on the prisons guard towers, Cherry 01 successfully dropped {{one of two}} planned napalm ground markers {{as a point of}} reference for the A-1s, then departed the objective area to a holding point over Laos where it would provide UHF direction-finding steers for the departing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{pilot of}} Apple 02 {{observed}} the errors in navigation by the helicopters {{in front of}} him and made a hard turn towards the prison. He also observed Apple 01 unload at the secondary school and initiated Plan Green, the contingency plan for the loss or absence of Greenleaf. The Redwine security group, including ground force commander Sydnor, landed at 02:20 outside Sơn Tây prison and immediately executed the previously rehearsed contingency plan. In the meantime, Cherry 02 arrived with the A-1 force, dropped two more napalm ground markers, and created other diversions to disguise the target area by dropping MK-6 log flares and <b>battle</b> <b>simulators</b> at road intersections that North Vietnamese reaction forces might be expected to use. Cherry 02 then orbited in the area just west of the Black River acting as on-call support for the ground teams, jamming North Vietnamese radio communications, and providing a secure radio link to the mission command post in Da Nang.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{returning}} {{features that}} appear in mission play include mission rankings and mission branching. As in Front Mission Alternative, players are graded on how well or poorly they clear missions. While there are incentives to perform well, the game does not reward the player with new parts or weapons {{as it did in}} Alternative. Mission branching returns and now allow players to choose what type of mission to play next. Aside from these, the Network feature from Front Mission 2 returns and is greatly expanded upon. Players can now browse through the pseudo-Internet, send and receive e-mail messages, tinker with online files and wallpapers, or use the new <b>Battle</b> <b>Simulator</b> feature. The <b>Battle</b> <b>Simulator</b> is a game mode where the player can participate in VR training exercises. These drills can be used to increase the fighting proficiencies of the player's pilots and can be taken as many times as needed. Lastly, players can strengthen their parts with the return of the remodeling feature.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{attractiveness}} of Pokemon which is a turn-based Role Playing Game (RPG) and has been very popular for the decades. In this study we focus on Pokemon battle {{which is the most}} important component in Pokemon. The game refinement theory is used as a tool to assess the degree of sophistication of Pokemon battle. For this purpose we apply two approaches of game progress modeling to derive game refinement measure, i. e., score limit sports approach and board game approach. We calculated game refinement values for Pokemon battle by collecting many data from Pokemon Showdown, an online Pokemon <b>battle</b> <b>simulator.</b> The results show that the values of game refinement for Pokemon are slightly lower than the comfortable zone that we supposed in the previous study. We are tempted to conclude that such a slightly lower value is important to attract children with appropriate degree of excitement in playing Pokemon...|$|R

The Army's existing <b>battle</b> effects <b>simulators</b> have experienced more than 120 documented malfunctions, many of which caused serious injuries, such as third-degree burns, loss of appendages, and lacerations. The Army has tried to make the devices safer and has suspended their use many times. It is also assessing the safety and the effectiveness of a new system from a foreign source. However, it does not plan to assess a U. S. system due to funding limitations. The Army could rely on the Marine Corps' planned type classification of a U.

50|$|For example, it {{has been}} shown in DDM {{research}} that motorists who have more than 10 years of experience or expertise (in terms years of driving experience) are faster to respond to hazards than drivers with less than three years of experience. Also, owing to their greater experience, such motorists tend to perform a more effective and efficient search for hazards cues than their not so experienced counterparts. A way to explain such behavior is based upon the premise that situation awareness in DDM tasks makes certain behaviors automatic for people with expertise. In this regard, the search for cue in the environment that could possibly lead to hazards for experienced motorists might be an automatic process whereas lack of situation awareness among novice motorists might lead them to a conscious non-automatic effort to find such cues leading them to become more prone to hazards by not noticing them at all. This behavior has also been documented for pilots and platoon commanders. The considerations of novice and experienced platoon commanders in a virtual reality <b>battle</b> <b>simulator</b> has shown that more experience was associated with higher perceptual skills, higher comprehension skills. Thus, experience on different DDM tasks makes a decision maker more situational aware with higher levels of perceptual and comprehension skills.|$|R
5000|$|This {{story begins}} as Ender is made the {{commander}} of Dragon Army at Battle School, an institution designed to make young children into military commanders against an unspecified enemy. Armies are groups of students that fight mock battles in the Battle Room, a null gravity environment, and are subdivided into [...] "toons". Due to Ender's genius in leadership, Dragon Army dominates the competition. After his nineteenth consecutive victory, Ender is told that his Army is being broken up and his toon leaders made commanders in their turn, while he is transferred to Command School for {{the next stage of}} his education. Here, veteran Maezr Rackham tutors him in the use of a space <b>battle</b> <b>simulator.</b> Eventually, many of his former toon leaders serve under him once more. Once familiar with the simulator, they fight a series of what Maezr tells them are mock battles against a computer-controlled enemy. Ender's team wins again and again, finally destroying a planet that the enemy fleet seems to be protecting. Once the battle is over, Maezr tells Ender that all battles were real, the children's commands having been relayed to the extant fleet, and that he has destroyed the enemy's home world and ended the war.|$|R

40|$|Faster {{time-to-market}} for {{new products}} {{is important for}} hi-tech corporations to gain premium pricing and higher sales volume. An activity overlapping strategy is a frequently used technique in practice for quicker product launch. However, complex interaction patterns between components and activities increase the chance of unanticipated iterations {{that may lead to}} late time-to-market. This paper presents an overlapping process model to analyze the impact of process structure on the lead-time of a complex development project. Information evolution and change sensitivity, which are two major factors for activity overlapping, are considered in the proposed model and a simulation algorithm is developed to analyze the impacts of process structure on the development lead-time. The example of a <b>battle</b> tank <b>simulator</b> project is used to illustrate the proposed approach. The computational experiment shows that the proposed approach allows project managers to design a better process structure to minimize the risk of being late-to-market. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: Historically one of {{the areas}} lacking in {{military}} training simulators is attention to the military intelligence operators, the individuals manning the ground stations, and operating the sensor platforms. This is a difficult area to simulate and even more challenging to integrate with modern joint <b>battle</b> space <b>simulators.</b> This paper discusses the current efforts of the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) to model intelligence and electronic warfare sensors and to integrate operator training into large-scale joint training simulations. The imagery and signals sensors in the IEWTPT program deliver information to operators in real intelligence ground stations. The sensor models must replicate the protocol, format, and content of information provided to operators in a real combat environment. This includes the presentation of three dimensional imagery, moving target indicator tracks, radar signatures, and spoken audio from radio transmissions. This information originates from constructive simulations such as the JSIMS Land Component (formerly known as the Army’s Warfighter Simulation (WARSIM)), live units at the combat training centers (e. g. NTC, JRTC, CMTC), and legacy systems such as CBS/TACSIM and JCATS/TACSIM. To accomplish this, the IEWTPT system includes modules for disaggregation, enhancement, traffic generation, area of interest filtering, velocity filtering, frequency filtering, sensor processing, and efficien...|$|R
