Clarke had also <b>built</b> <b>his</b> popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member to sit on the Northwest Territories council.|$|E

5|$|Davenport {{has several}} neighborhoods {{dating back to}} the 1840s. The {{original}} city plot was around current day Ripley and 5th Streets, where Antoine Le Claire had <b>built</b> <b>his</b> house.

Many architectural designs are found throughout the city including Victorian, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and others. Many of the original neighborhoods were inhabited by German settlers.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the castle was important both because it controlled an important mountain pass, and possibly because Llywelyn claimed authority as {{the lord of the}} mountains and coasts of Wales: several of his castles appear to have been located with such political symbolism in mind. It is also possible that Llywelyn may have <b>built</b> <b>his</b> castle on top of the remains of a previous fortification constructed by Maelgwn Gwynedd, a king of Gwynedd in the 6th century, although no such remains have been found.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, {{the area}} that is today Elmsford was known as Storm's Bridge, after Abraham Storm, who {{established}} a tavern at the junction of the Saw Mill River and Tarrytown roads (today routes 9A and 119) that {{is the center of}} that village today. In 1719, one of the Philipse tenant farmers, William Hammond, <b>built</b> <b>his</b> house on land he leased in what is today Eastview, where his house still stands. Along the river to the north, his brother Staats Hammond built two mills along the river; the small settlement of Hammond's Mill became today's Hawthorne.|$|E

5|$|Carl Eytel (September 12, 1862 – September 17, 1925) was a German American {{artist who}} <b>built</b> <b>his</b> {{reputation}} for {{paintings and drawings}} of desert subjects in the American Southwest. Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran Desert, Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert, and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Eytel's most important work, Desert Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library.|$|E
5|$|Colt {{purchased}} a large {{tract of land}} beside the Connecticut River, where he <b>built</b> <b>his</b> first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E
5|$|He stopped {{racing and}} opened a {{motorcycle}} dealership in Wichita Falls in 1966. The dealership is still open (as of 2008), {{and it is now}} the oldest Honda and Kawasaki dealership in Texas. He soon wanted to race again, so he <b>built</b> <b>his</b> own motorcycle and began racing as a 30-year-old. He raced in numerous types of motorcycle racing: cross country, drag racing, hare scramble, motocross, road racing, and short track. When Hill participated in a Daytona race in 1971, he had an opening lap at , which was faster than factory rider Gary Nixon. Hill continued to race motorcycles and in 1972 and won the Texas state road racing championship. Hill won over 100 trophies in his motorcycle career.|$|E

5|$|In his roles at the ICTY and ICTR he had {{to design}} prosecutorial {{strategies}} for both those ground-breaking tribunals, from scratch. In doing so, he sought to be scrupulously even-handed – a goal he was more easily able to achieve at ICTY than at ICTR. He <b>built</b> <b>his</b> strategy at both courts {{to a large degree}} on that pursued by the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945–46. He served as the chief prosecutor of the two tribunals until September 1996. Among his most notable legal achievements as chief prosecutor was securing the recognition of rape as a war crime under the Geneva Convention.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{became a}} key player in Crewe's bid for {{promotion}} in the 2006–07 season, playing mostly as a midfielder. He made nineteen appearances during the season, scoring three goals – against Swansea City, Nottingham Forest and Yeovil Town. The first two goals came from the penalty spot, as he <b>built</b> <b>his</b> reputation as a solid penalty taker. He also received the first red card of his professional career in October 2006, in a defeat at Bristol City. He was dismissed for violent conduct after a challenge on Louis Carey, though the referee's decision was reported as 'harsh' and 'strange' by the Bristol City website. That red card was the only sending off, and subsequent suspension, of the season for Crewe, as the club was awarded the 'Bobby Moore Fair Play award for outstanding conduct and discipline throughout the season'.|$|E
5|$|Stanley was {{a skilled}} {{architect}} who designed and founded the UK's first Trades school, Stanley Technical Trades School (now Harris Academy South Norwood), {{as well as}} designing the Stanley Halls in South Norwood. Stanley designed and <b>built</b> <b>his</b> two homes. He was a noted philanthropist, who gave over £80,000 to education projects during the last 15 years of his life. When he died, most of his estate, valued at £59,000, was bequeathed to trade schools and students in south London, {{and one of his}} homes was used as a children's home after his death, in accordance with his will.|$|E

5|$|The Finsta Chapel or St Eric's Chapel on the north-west {{corner of}} the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, {{the patron saint of}} Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later <b>built.</b> <b>His</b> shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but {{replaced}} it with a new gold-plated one which still contains Eric's relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, and a dam was {{probably}} constructed to turn the surrounding marshy, low-lying land into an artificial lake, called Skipsea Mere, in turn connected the channel leading to the sea. The complex had its own private harbour, and probably a boat yard and a fresh-water fishery. By the end of the 11th century a church had been built to the east of the castle across the mere, and the village of Skipsea soon grew up alongside the church. Drogo settled 10 knights on lands near the castle in an arrangement known as a castlery or castle-guard system, under which the knights helped to guard the castle in return for their estates, and one of them probably <b>built</b> <b>his</b> own smaller fortification at nearby Aldborough.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{presence}} at other single-day {{races in the}} spring season was paltry. Only two other races featured top-ten finishes from the team. Txurruka took seventh at the Klasika Primavera, finishing staunchly {{in the middle of}} a 15-man sprint at the finish. Antón similarly made all the day's selections and finished 11th in this group, as he <b>built</b> <b>his</b> form for the Giro d'Italia. Later in April at the Gran Premio de Llodio, Nieve rode to eighth place finishing with the first chase group behind a solo winner.|$|E
