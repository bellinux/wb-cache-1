5000|$|For {{reasons that}} will be {{mentioned}} below, passenger vehicles usually traverse a curve at a speed higher than the <b>balance</b> <b>speed.</b> The amount by which the actual <b>speed</b> exceeds the <b>balance</b> <b>speed</b> is conveniently expressed via the so-called cant deficiency, i.e., by the amount by which the superelevation {{would need to be}} increased to raise the <b>balance</b> <b>speed</b> to the speed at which the vehicles actually travel.

50|$|On {{routes that}} carry freight traffic in cars with the maximum allowed axle loads {{it will be}} {{desirable}} to set superelevations so that the <b>balancing</b> <b>speed</b> of each curve {{is close to the}} speed at which most such traffic runs. This is to lessen the tendency of heavy wheel loads to crush the head of either rail.|$|E
5000|$|However, these {{experiments}} {{did not provide}} usable formulas for curve resistance, because the experiments were, unfortunately, all done on a test track with the same curvature (radius = 955 meters). Therefore, {{it is not clear}} how to account for curvature. The Russian experiments plot curve resistance against velocity for various types of railroad cars and various axle loads. The plots all show smooth convex curves with the minimums at <b>balancing</b> <b>speed</b> where the slope of the plotted curve is zero. These plots tend to show curve resistance increasing more rapidly with decreases in velocity below <b>balancing</b> <b>speed,</b> than for increases in velocity (by the same amounts) above balancing speeds. No explanation for this [...] "asymmetrical velocity effect" [...] is to be found in the references cited nor is any explanation found explaining the smooth convex curve plots mentioned above (except for explaining how they were experimentally determined).|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s in the Soviet Union curve {{resistance}} {{was found by}} experiment [...] to be highly dependent on both the velocity and the banking of the curve, also known as superelevation or cant, as can bee seen in the graph above. If a train car rounds a curve at <b>balancing</b> <b>speed</b> such that the component of centrifugal force in the lateral direction (towards {{the outside of the}} curve and parallel with the plane of the track) is equal to the component of gravitational force in the opposite direction there is very little curve resistance. At such <b>balancing</b> <b>speed</b> there is zero cant deficiency and results in a frictionless banked turn. But deviate from this speed (either higher or lower) and the curve resistance increases due to the unbalance in forces which tends to pull the vehicle sideways (and would be felt by a passenger in a passenger train). Note that for empty rail cars (low wheel loads) the specific curve resistance is higher, similar to the phenomena of higher rolling resistance for empty cars on a straight track.|$|E

5000|$|The Russian {{experiments}} cited below {{show that}} all these formulas are inaccurate. At <b>balancing</b> <b>speed,</b> they give a curve resistance a few times too high (or worse). However, these approximation formulas are still contained in practically all standard railway engineering textbooks. For the US, AREMA American Railway Engineering ..., PDF, p.57 claims that curve resistance is 0.04% per degree of curvature (or 8 lbf/ton or 4 kgf/tonne). Hay's textbook also claims it is independent of superelevation. [...] For Russia in 2011, internet articles use 700/R.|$|E

50|$|Normally, {{passenger}} trains run above the <b>balancing</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and the difference}} between the balancing superelevation for the speed and curvature and the actual superelevation on the curve is known as unbalanced superelevation. Track superelevation is usually limited to 6 in, and is often lower on routes with slow heavy freight trains in order to reduce wear on the inner rail. Track unbalanced superelevation in the U.S. is restricted to 3 in, though 6 in is permissible by waiver. There is no hard maximum set for European railways, some of which have curves with over 11 in of unbalanced superelevation to permit high-speed transportation.|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} ten days after the service was provided, the line's {{performance}} was monitored and the lowest connection speed is noted. This figure was used from then on to define minimum service standards below which the service can be considered to have a fault.

DLM could make adjustments to the DSLAM output power, suggested target signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) margin and sync rate and could choose to apply a technique known as interleaving which aids error correction. Several factors dictate the sync rate, which limits the maximum attainable speed, such as the presence of noise within the frequency spectrum used by ADSL, but chiefly it is the distance from the telephone exchange which had the largest influence on the line's performance.|$|E
50|$|As the DC motor {{starts to}} turn, {{interaction}} of the magnetic fields inside causes it to generate a voltage internally. This back EMF (electromotive force) opposes the applied voltage and the current that flows is governed by {{the difference between the}} two. As the motor speeds up, the internally generated voltage rises, the resultant EMF falls, less current passes through the motor and the torque drops. The motor naturally stops accelerating when the drag of the train matches the torque produced by the motors. To continue accelerating the train, series resistors are switched out step by step, each step increasing the effective voltage and thus the current and torque for a little bit longer until the motor catches up. This can be heard and felt in older DC trains as a series of clunks under the floor, each accompanied by a jerk of acceleration as the torque suddenly increases in response to the new surge of current. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. The train's speed remains constant {{at the point where the}} torque of the motor, governed by the effective voltage, equals the drag - sometimes referred to as <b>balancing</b> <b>speed.</b> If the train starts to climb an incline, the speed reduces because drag is greater than torque and the reduction in speed causes the back-EMF to fall and thus the effective voltage to rise - until the current through the motor produces enough torque to match the new drag. The use of series resistance was wasteful because a lot of energy was lost as heat. To reduce these losses, electric locomotives and trains (before the advent of power electronics) were normally equipped for series-parallel control as well.|$|E

40|$|This study proposes an {{improved}} cell balancing circuit for fast equalization among lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries.

40|$|Due {{to the low}} cost, small size, {{and ease}} of control, the switched-capacitor (SC) battery {{equalizers}} are promising among active balancing methods. However, {{it is difficult to}} achieve the full cell equalization for the SC equalizers due to the inevitable voltage drops across Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) switches. Moreover, when the voltage gap among cells is larger, the balancing efficiency is lower, while the <b>balancing</b> <b>speed</b> becomes slower as the voltage gap gets smaller. In order to soften these downsides, this paper proposes a cell-to-cell battery equalization topology with zero-current switching (ZCS) and zero-voltage gap (ZVG) among cells based on three-resonant-state SC converters. Based on the conventional inductor-capacitor (LC) converter, an additional resonant path is built to release the charge of the capacitor into the inductor in each switching cycle, which lays the foundations for obtaining ZVG among cells, improves the balancing efficiency at a large voltage gap, and increases the <b>balancing</b> <b>speed</b> at a small voltage gap. A four-lithium-ion-cell prototype is applied to validate the theoretical analysis.
