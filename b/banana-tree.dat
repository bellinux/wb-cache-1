60|$|Agnes vented {{a sudden}} little {{laugh at the}} {{expression}} of Zubby's face; and, the door opening at that moment, Colonel Langley entered the court, and sat down beside his wife under the giant leaves of a small <b>banana-tree,</b> whose life was drawn from a boxful of earth about three feet square.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days after}} the events narrated in the last chapter, Mrs Langley, being seated on her {{favourite}} couch in the court under the small <b>banana-tree,</b> sent Zubby into the garden to command the attendance of Ted Flaggan. That worthy was gifted with a rare capacity for taking the initiative in all things, when permitted to do so, and had instituted himself in the consul's mansion as assistant gardener, assistant cook and hostler, assistant footman and nurseryman, as well as general advice-giver and factotum, much to the amusement of all concerned, for he knew little of anything, but was extremely good-humoured, helpful, and apart from advice-giving--modest.|$|E
6000|$|Sauntering away to his {{favourite}} cliff, {{one fine}} evening towards sunset he seated himself beneath the <b>banana-tree</b> and gazed longingly at the distant mountains, whose sharp summits glittered in the ruddy glow. He had long racked his brain {{in order to}} devise some method of escape, but hitherto without success. Wherever he went the [...] "shadow" [...] followed him, armed with the deadly blow-pipe; {{and he knew that}} even if he did succeed in eluding his vigilance and escaping into the woods, hundreds of savages would turn out and track him, with unerring certainty, to any hiding place. Still the strength of his stern determination sustained him; and, at each failure in his efforts to devise some means of effecting his purpose, he threw off regret with a deep sigh, and returned to his labour with a firmer step, assured that he should eventually succeed.|$|E

6000|$|... "My aguardiente," [...] said Madama, with pride, [...] "is the best. It grows, in {{beautiful}} bottles, {{in the dark}} places among the <b>banana-trees.</b> Si, Señor. Only at midnight can they be picked by sailor-men who bring them, before daylight comes, to your back door. Good aguardiente is a verree difficult fruit to handle, Señor Goodwin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, as I gazed affrighted, I saw my mistress, the Shepherdess, flying {{towards the}} wall behind which I stood, the book she was reading being still in her hand. But as she reached it, the man mounted on the mule overtook her, and she turned about and faced him, setting {{her back against the}} wall. Then I {{crouched}} down and hid myself among some <b>banana-trees,</b> and watched what passed through a crack in the wall.|$|R
60|$|So that danger passed by. Some of {{the slaves}} had been struck by the Arab bullets or trodden down in the rush or {{collapsed}} from weakness, and at those of them who still lived the pursuers were firing. One woman, who had fallen {{under the weight of}} the great slave-stick which was fastened about her throat, was crawling forward on her hands and knees. An Arab fired at her and the bullet struck the ground under her stomach but without hurting her, for she wriggled forward more quickly. I was sure that he would shoot again, and watched. Presently, for by now the light was good, I saw him, a tall fellow in a white robe, step from behind the shelter of a <b>banana-tree</b> about a hundred and fifty yards away, and take a careful aim at the woman. But I too took aim and--well, I am not bad at this kind of snap-shooting when I try. That Arab's gun never went off. Only he went up two feet or more into the air and fell backwards, shot through the head which was the part of his person that I had covered.|$|E
60|$|The soil {{is fully}} sufficient—indeed, more than sufficient—to support this population, whose wants {{are of the}} most limited character. The land is {{exceedingly}} fertile and bears in abundance all tropical products, particularly rice, sugar, and the abaca, a variety of the <b>banana-tree.</b> The fibres of the abaca are employed in making the finest and most delicate fabrics, of which from three to four million dollars’ worth are exported annually. The exports of sugar amount to about four millions and a half, of gold to two millions and a half, and of coffee and tobacco close on to {{a million and a}} quarter each. The rice is consumed at home. It forms the staple food of the people, and nearly three million dollars’ worth is imported yearly. The husbandman cannot complain that his toil is inadequately rewarded. A rice plantation will yield a return of at least fifteen per cent.; if he plant his farm with sugar-cane he will realise thirty per cent., if not more. On the other hand, the price of labour is very low. An adult who gains a real fuerte (about thirteen cents) a day, thinks he is doing well.|$|E
60|$|During his {{frequent}} rambles in the neighbourhood of the Indian village, Martin discovered many beautiful and retired spots, {{to which he}} was in the habit of going in the evenings after his daily labours were accomplished, accompanied, as usual, at a respectful distance, by his vigilant friend the tall savage. One of his favourite resting-places was {{at the foot of a}} <b>banana-tree,</b> which grew on the brow of a stupendous cliff, about a mile distant from the hut, in which he dwelt. From this spot he had a commanding view of the noble valley and the distant mountains. These mountains now seemed to the poor boy to be the ponderous gates of his beautiful prison; for he had been told by one of his Indian friends that on the other side of them were great campos and forests, beyond which dwelt many Portuguese, while still further on was a great lake without shores, which was the end of the world. This, Martin was convinced, must be the Atlantic Ocean; for, upon inquiry, he found that many months of travel must be undergone ere it could be reached. Moreover, he knew that it could not be the Pacific, because the sun rose in that direction.|$|E
60|$|Thus we {{advanced}} {{to the foot of}} the hill without encountering anything to alarm us, except, indeed, once, when we were passing close under a part of the hill which was hidden from our view by the broad leaves of the <b>banana-trees,</b> which grew in great luxuriance in that part. Jack was just preparing to force his way through this thicket when we were startled and arrested by a strange pattering or rumbling sound, which appeared to us quite different from any of the sounds we had heard during the previous part of our walk.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFour fibers from <b>banana-trees</b> (leaf, trunk) and coconut-tree (husk, fabric) were {{examined}} before their incorporation in cementitious matrices, {{in order to}} prepare insulating material for construction. Their botanical compositions have been determined following a method described previously. Thermal degradation of these fibers were studied between 200 and 700 °C under nitrogen gas flow. Temperature of pyrolysis was the experimental parameter investigated. The solid residues obtained were analyzed by classical elemental analysis, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy and were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This study has shown (1) the relation between botanical, chemical composition with both localization of fibers in the tree and type of tree; (2) the rapid and preferential decomposition of banana fibers with increasing temperature of pyrolysis and (3) the rough samples are made of hollow fibers...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The ti-ovens are {{frequently}} thirty feet in diameter, {{and the large}} stones, heaped upon small logs of wood, take about twenty-four hours to get properly heated. Then they are flattened down, by means of long green poles, and the trunks of a few <b>banana-trees</b> are stripped up and strewn over them to cause steam. The ti-roots are then thrown in whole, accompanied by short pieces of ape-root (Arum costatum), that are not quite so thick as the ti, but grow {{to the length of}} six feet and more. The oven is then covered over with large leaves and soil, and left so for about three days, when the ti and the ape are taken out well cooked, and of a rich, light-brown colour. The ape prevents the ti from getting too dry in the oven.|$|R

5000|$|Monsieur Chaté writes, [...] "This {{species was}} {{formerly}} {{described in the}} English, Dutch, and German horticultural journals {{under the name of}} C. excelsa. It was named musæfolia by Monsieur Théodore Année, who introduced it into France in 1858, from the resemblance of its leaves to those of the Musa or <b>banana-tree.</b> It reaches a height of more than 8 ft and has green, downy stems, and very large, oval, green leaves. Flowers small, orange-yellow. It is a tender species without rhizomes, and requires to be kept constantly growing. Peru." ...|$|E
50|$|Froggatt's {{work was}} not {{confined}} to entomology, he was also vine inspector and later inspector under the vegetation diseases act. In the many papers he was writing at this time there is an increasing tendency for his attention {{to be given to}} insect pests. He published Australian Insects in 1907, the first comprehensive text-book on Australian entomology, and in this year was sent abroad to study the best ways of dealing with fruit flies, etc. His Report on Parasitic and Injurious Insects was published by the New South Wales department of agriculture in 1909. Also in 1909 he went to the Solomon Islands to report on pests attacking coconut palms and sugar-cane, and in 1913 went on a similar mission to the New Hebrides. From 1911-21 he lectured at the University of Sydney. During the war he spent much time on the control of weevils in stored wheat, and in 1922 investigated pests attacking <b>banana-trees</b> in Queensland. He retired from the department of agriculture in 1923 but was forest entomologist in the department of forestry until his final retirement on 31 March 1927. His volume on Forest Insects of Australia was published in 1923; in the following four years many papers on forest entomology were also published, and in 1927 another volume, Forest Insects and Timber Borers, appeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{houses of}} the Moorish town were square white-washed blocks, built so {{close to each other}} that most of the streets were mere lanes, not more than from six to ten feet wide. No windows worthy of the name garnished the dead white walls of these houses, whose light sprang in reality from within, each house being {{in the form of a}} square of {{building}} surrounding a central court, which at the top was open to the weather. The real windows of the houses looked into the courts, which, however, were by no means dismal. They had fountains in the midst of them, which sent up a perpetual--and, in such a climate, grateful--sound of trickling water; while in their corners and elsewhere boxes of earth enabled <b>banana-trees,</b> and palms, and various creepers, to convert the little spots into delightful, though miniature, gardens. Such windows as opened outwards were mere loop-holes, not much more than a foot square-- many of them less,--the larger of them being always strongly grated. Most of these houses projected beyond their basement storeys, thus rendering the open space above narrower than the streets below, and in many cases the walls absolutely met, and converted the streets into tunnels. Strange wooden props, seemingly insufficient for their duty, upheld these projecting upper storeys, and gave a peculiarly un-European character to the streets,--a character which became still more perplexing to the stranger when he observed here and there, in places where architecture had scarcely space or light to be seen, fountains of the most elegant design and workmanship; doorways of white marble, most elaborately and beautifully carved; and entrance-halls that resembled courts of the Alhambra in miniature.|$|R
5000|$|Another cannibal story which {{introduces}} interesting features is {{told in the}} New Hebrides. There {{was once}} a cannibal named Taso, who came one day upon the sister of Qatu and killed her, but did not eat {{her because she was}} with child. So he abandoned her body in a thicket, and there, though their mother was dead, twin boys were bom. They found rain-water collected in dead leaves, and shoots of plants that they could eat; so they lived, and when they grew old enough to walk, they wandered about in the forest until one day they found a sow belonging to their uncle Qatu. He came daily to give it food, but when he had gone, the boys would eat part of the sow's provisions. Thus they grew, and their skins and hair were fair. Qatu wondered why his sow did not become fat, and watching, discovered the tmns and caught them; but when they told him who they were, he welcomed them as his nephews and took them home with him. After they grew bigger, he made little bows of sago fronds for them, and when they could shoot lizards, he broke the bows, giving them larger ones with which they brought down greater game; and thus he trained them until they were grown up and could shoot anything. When they were young men, Qatu told them about Taso and how he had murdered their mother, warning them to be careful, lest he should catch them. The twins, however, determined to kill the cannibal, so they set a tabu on a <b>banana-tree</b> belonging to them and said to their uncle: [...] "If our bunch of bananas begins to ripen at the top and ripens downwards, you will know that Taso has killed us; but if it begins to ripen at the bottom and ripens upwards, we shall have killed him." ...|$|E
