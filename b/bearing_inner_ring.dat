However, a system-driven configuration of the condition monitoring system requires {{the knowledge of the}} system kinematics and could induce lots a false alarms because of predefined thresholds. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a complete data-driven method to automatically generate system health indicators without any a priori on the monitored system or the acquired signals. This method is composed of two steps. First, every acquired signal is analysed: the spectral peaks are detected and then grouped in more complex structure as harmonic series or modulation sidebands. Then, a time-frequency tracking operation is applied on all available signals: the spectral peaks and the spectral structures are tracked over time and grouped in trajectories, which will be used to generate the system health indicators. The proposed method is tested on real-world signals coming from a wind turbine test rig. The detection of a harmonic series and a modulation sideband reports the birth of a fault on the main <b>bearing</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring.</b> The evolution of the fault severity is characterised by three automatically generated health indicators and is confirmed by experts...|$|E

Magnetic supports always have to include the so-called retainer bearings in order to prevent the rotor from dangerous increase of oscilla-tions due to damage in magnetic bearings. Retainer bearings are rolling <b>bearings,</b> the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> of which rotates after an oblique impact by the rotor journal.

The tail rotor was powered by its own engine (for easier control) and its angle of incidence could not be adjusted during flight. Another notable achievement was use of collective and cyclic pitch control. The swashplate principle was applied.

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) easily occurs illusive component and mode mixing problem. From the view of feature extraction, a new feature extraction method based on integrating ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the correlation coefficient method, and Hilbert transform is proposed to extract fault features and identify fault states for motor bearings in this paper. In the proposed feature extraction method, the EEMD is used to decompose the vibration signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequency components. Then the correlation coefficient method is used to select the IMF components with the largest correlation coefficient, which are carried out with the Hilbert transform. The obtained corresponding envelope spectra are analyzed to extract the fault feature frequency and identify the fault state by comparing with the theoretical value. Finally, the fault signal transmission performance of vibration signals of the <b>bearing</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> and outer ring at the drive end and fan end are deeply studied. The experimental results show that the proposed feature extraction method can effectively eliminate the influence of the mode mixing and extract the fault feature frequency, and the energy of the vibration signal in the bearing outer ring at the fan end is lost during the transmission of the vibration signal.

40|$|The SHABERTH {{computer}} program {{was developed to}} predict operating characteristics of bearings in a multibearing load support system. Lubricated and non-lubricated bearings can be modeled. SHABERTH calculates the loads, torques, temperatures, and fatigue life for ball and/or roller bearings on a single shaft. The program also allows for {{an analysis of the}} system reaction to the termination of lubricant supply to the bearings and other lubricated mechanical elements. SHABERTH {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool in the design and analysis of shaft bearing systems. The SHABERTH program is structured with four nested calculation schemes. The thermal scheme performs steady state and transient temperature calculations which predict system temperatures for a given operating state. The bearing dimensional equilibrium scheme uses the bearing temperatures, predicted by the temperature mapping subprograms, and the rolling element raceway load distribution, predicted by the bearing subprogram, to calculate bearing diametral clearance for a given operating state. The shaft-bearing system load equilibrium scheme calculates <b>bearing</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> positions relative to the respective outer rings such that the external loading applied to the shaft is brought into equilibrium by the rolling element loads which develop at each <b>bearing</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> for a given operating state. The bearing rolling element and cage load equilibrium scheme calculates the rolling element and cage equilibrium positions and rotational speeds based on the relative inner-outer ring positions, inertia effects, and friction conditions. The ball bearing subprograms in the current SHABERTH program have several model enhancements over similar programs. These enhancements include an elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thickness model that accounts for thermal heating in the contact area and lubricant film starvation; a new model for traction combined with an asperity load sharing model; a model for the hydrodynamic rolling and shear forces in the inlet zone of lubricated contacts, which accounts for the degree of lubricant film starvation; modeling normal and friction forces between a ball and a cage pocket, which account for the transition between the hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic regimes of lubrication; and a model of the effect on fatigue life of the ratio of the EHD plateau film thickness to the composite surface roughness. SHABERTH is intended to be as general as possible. The models in SHABERTH allow for the complete mathematical simulation of real physical systems. Systems are limited to a maximum of five bearings supporting the shaft, a maximum of thirty rolling elements per bearing, and a maximum of one hundred temperature nodes. The SHABERTH program structure is modular and has been designed to permit refinement and replacement of various component models as the need and opportunities develop. A preprocessor is included in the IBM PC version of SHABERTH to provide a user friendly means of developing SHABERTH models and executing the resulting code. The preprocessor allows the user to create and modify data files with minimal effort and a reduced chance for errors. Data is utilized as it is entered; the preprocessor then decides what additional data is required to complete the model. Only this required information is requested. The preprocessor can accommodate data input for any SHABERTH compatible shaft bearing system model. The system may include ball bearings, roller bearings, and/or tapered roller bearings. SHABERTH is written in FORTRAN 77, and two machine versions are available from COSMIC. The CRAY version (LEW- 14860) has a RAM requirement of 176 K of 64 bit words. The IBM PC version (MFS- 28818) is written for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS, and includes a sample MS-DOS executable. For execution, the PC version requires at least 1 Mb of RAM and an 80386 or 486 processor machine with an 80 x 87 math co-processor. The standard distribution medium for the IBM PC version is a set of two 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskettes. The contents of the diskettes are compressed using the PKWARE archiving tools. The utility to unarchive the files, PKUNZIP. EXE, is included. The standard distribution medium for the CRAY version is also a 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskette, but alternate distribution media and formats are available upon request. The original version of SHABERTH was developed in FORTRAN IV at Lewis Research Center for use on a UNIVAC 1100 series computer. The Cray version was released in 1988, and was updated in 1990 to incorporate fluid rheological data for Rocket Propellant 1 (RP- 1), thereby allowing the analysis of bearings lubricated with RP- 1. The PC version is a port of the 1990 CRAY version and was developed in 1992 by SRS Technologies under contract to NASA Marshall Space Flight Center...|$|E

Calculations were performed for up to seven interference fit classes for each of ten bearing sizes. Each fit was taken at tightest, average and loosest values within the fit class for RBEC- 5 tolerance, thus requiring 486 separate analyses. The hoop stresses were superimposed on the Hertzian principal stresses created by the applied radial load to calculate roller bearing fatigue life. The method was developed {{through a series of}} equations to calculate the life reduction for cylindrical roller bearings based on interference fit. All calculated lives are for zero initial bearing internal clearance. Any reduction in bearing clearance due to interference fit was compensated by increasing the initial (unmounted) clearance. Results are presented as tables and charts of life factors for bearings with light, moderate and heavy loads and interference fits ranging from extremely light to extremely heavy and for bearing accuracy class RBEC 5 (ISO class 5). Interference fits on the <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> of a cylindrical roller bearing can significantly reduce bearing fatigue life.

30|$|The soil {{infiltration}} {{experiment was}} conducted using the double-ring infiltrometer method. The <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> employed Markov bottles to supply water automatically, while the outer ring added water manually {{every few seconds}} to maintain the water level flush with the <b>inner</b> <b>ring.</b> In addition, another ring was embedded in the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> with a diameter of 24  cm and height of 20  cm, which was suspended in the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> to prevent contact with the soil surface. The soil infiltration rate tends to become smaller over time. The infiltration time depended on when the soil infiltration approached stability, ranging from 60 to 90  min depending on the vegetation.|$|R
