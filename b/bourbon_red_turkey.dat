40|$|The dyed cotton {{textiles}} called <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> {{are a significant}} part of Scotland’s cultural heritage and the legacy of its textile manufacturing industry, and were known for their exceptional colour and fastness to light and wash fading. This thesis is a multi-disciplinary investigation of the chemistry of these unique textiles in the context of 19 th c. Scotland using historical material re-creations and modern analytical chemistry, situating the dyeing process in a historical context. This research is a significant contribution toward the continued preservation of historical <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> textiles. Through a detailed, chemistry-focused examination of <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> methods published in English and French between 1785 - 1911, the key ingredients and steps for the process from a chemical perspective are identified (Chapter 1). The significance, chemistry, and previous research {{on the role of the}} oil (Chapter 2) and dye sources used (Chapter 3) are discussed to form the basis of the material re-creations and analysis. The oil is fundamental to and characteristic of the process, which is also noteworthy for being the first to replace a natural dye source (madder or garancine) with a coal-tar derived analogue (synthetic alizarin). Re-creations of dyed <b>Turkey</b> <b>red,</b> <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> oil, oiled calico, and synthetic alizarin provide experiential data and reference materials to test analyses prior to application on historical objects (Chapter 4). The analysis of <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> oils by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) (Chapter 5) provides information used to characterise, for the first time, how the oil and cotton fibres bond to form the basis of the <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> complex. This is studied using conservation-based diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) on replica and 19 th c. pieces of <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> (Chapter 6). Dyes analysis of these samples by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array (UHPLC-PDA) identifies chromatographic profiles of textiles dyed with natural or synthetic dye based on synthetic chemical markers. The presence of pigments on printed <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> is confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) (Chapter 7) ...|$|R

40|$|Nineteenth-century <b>Turkey</b> <b>red,</b> {{a cotton}} textile dyed by a {{peculiar}} and unique process, {{is found in}} many collections around the world. It was known for its bright colour and remarkable fastness to light exposure and washing. Light fading is a significant concern in the display of historical textiles, and understanding more about the properties of these objects may increase the accessibility of collections. This research explored the identification of historical <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> through non-invasive Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to detect the presence of oil – a necessary {{step in the process}} – on the fibres. Around 1869, <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> dyers began to transition from using madder and garancine to synthetic alizarin, which was investigated through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The chemical profiles of 19 th-century samples and references of known dye source were used to predict whether <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> of unknown date was dyed with natural or synthetic dye...|$|R
40|$|<b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> {{textiles}} {{were major}} economic commodities for the 19 th-century industrial powerhouses of Glasgow and Manchester. An accomplished feat of dyeing technology and chemical complexity, the multi-step <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> dyeing process and its fabled superior colour-fastness has remained compellingly mysterious {{for over a}} century. Innovative cross-disciplinary, process-based heritage science research by the University of Glasgow is now unravelling secrets of past production methods and materials to inform the preservation and display for museum and archive <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> textile collections. Central to the research is identifying key chemical markers to distinguish real <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> from imitations for collection significance and material behaviour prediction, especially colour-fastness. Re-creation of the process by historical technical research informed by modern dye chemistry and organic synthesis, combined with comparative analytical studies of historical examples by 1 H and 13 C NMR, ATR-FTIR, diffuse FTIR (DRIFTS), UHPLC-PDA and LC-MS, reveals signature material markers for true <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> and explains why such a chemically-complex process was needed. Hand-held DRIFTS is proving highly useful for non-invasive screening of historical collections to detect oil residues as chemical signatures of the true process, while increased sensitivity from UHPLC-PDA greatly reduces sample sizes for dye analysis to detect photosensitive and labile components and to distinguish the anthraquinones of traditional natural madder dyes from synthetic alizarin equivalents used commercially from 1870. Placing the analytical results within historical contexts of commercial technology is offering a unique perspective on primary material evidence for the collections care of <b>Turkey</b> <b>red</b> textiles...|$|R
50|$|The Bourbon Red is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} turkey {{named for its}} unique reddish plumage and for Bourbon County, Kentucky. The breed standard indicates mature Bourbon Red toms (males) weigh 15 kg, and mature hens (females) weigh 8.2 kg. The breed standard indicates the Bourbon Red should weigh 10.4 kg for toms and 6.3 kg for hens at slaughter age (28 weeks). These standard weights were published with anticipation of {{the potential of the}} Bourbon Red and when the breed was at its prime. Though there are efforts to restore and accomplish the Bourbon Red standard, today these weights are realized by few breeders and growers. <b>Bourbon</b> <b>Reds</b> have been unrefined for too long {{due to the lack of}} selective breeding to preserve the breed. However, Mature Turkeys in a breeding flock will exhibit an intense fluctuate ~30% from these published weights due to their relentless, extensive and highly instinctive breeding season with their lowest weights typically being recorded in July.|$|R
