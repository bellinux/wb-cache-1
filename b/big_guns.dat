5|$|During {{the period}} of time in which the battleships were out of {{commission}} in the United States, several technological updates and breakthroughs enabled naval ships, submarines, and aircraft to compensate for the absence of <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> within the fleet.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October New Jersey engaged {{a coastal}} {{installation}} with her guns; however, she shifted her fire when a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky. New Jersey gunners quickly retrained the battleship's <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> {{and managed to}} inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, bunkers, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{move into}} {{electronic}} media {{led to the}} founding of The <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Project. The <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Project was conceived as a loosely organized artistic electronic commune made up of artists, designers, writers, and computer programmers. The <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Project was responsible for creating early websites such as The Crash Site, FilmZone, and Salvo. The <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Project's work-for-hire initiatives led to the completion of many web sites for major motion pictures. Among them, Men in Black, Tomorrow Never Dies, Seven, Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx, The Mummy, The Big Lebowski, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which was done {{in collaboration with the}} film director Terry Gilliam. On the music side, the <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Project built web sites for The Beastie Boys, The Ozzfest, Grand Royal Records, and The Tibetan Freedom Concert.|$|R

[...] "I {{got a letter from}} Lord De Guest this morning, pressing me very much to go to him at Easter. It's about business," [...] added Johnny.

5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot {{out as soon}} as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from <b>big</b> <b>guns,</b> by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up...

5|$|Throughout January {{and into}} February New Jersey {{operated}} {{in support of}} the Marines. On 10 February the battleship left to reinforce the Korean 2nd Marine Brigade operating near Da Nang. The battleship's target was a suspected subterranean staging area for a Viet Cong regiment. New Jerseys <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> went to work on the complex, firing 16inch shells into tunnels and bunkers to aid the ground troops. On 14 February the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division, in the process destroying an anti-aircraft site with her <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> The next day New Jersey fired on an enemy rocket site northeast of Con Thien, destroying the facility, then trained her guns on known Communist positions to harass PAVN forces. On 22 February New Jersey responded to an urgent request for fire support from the besieged Oceanview observation post near the DMZ. For the next six hours New Jersey fired her guns, ultimately repelling the attacking force.|$|E
5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey {{was off the}} key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships' <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force command ship.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October New Jersey steamed {{south to}} engage Communist targets. During the {{shelling}} aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft {{fire to the}} extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> The next day New Jersey leveled 30structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. New Jersey responded by firing six 16inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.|$|E
5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow {{on the rim of}} the {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign of the superstructure or the <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They were able to see the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Fast <b>Gun</b> clubs, <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> clubs operate {{based upon}} a loose confederation, with each club reserving the ability to {{establish}} and maintain its own rules, provided that they coincide with the spirit of <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Model Warship Combat. With versions in 1/48, 1/72, 1/96, and 1/144 scale, <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Model Warship combat clubs have provisions for cannon caliber and armor thickness to be scaling according to what existed on the prototype vessel. <b>Big</b> <b>Gun</b> Model Warships allow weapons to be installed in rotating turrets as if they were mounted on the historical vessel. Damage Control is accomplished via a centrifugal bilge pump capable pumping a regulated volume of water out of the hull. The volume allowed is based on the prototype vessel's displacement. Typically, the flow rate varies from 30 gallons per hour (GPH) for the smallest ships to 90GPH for the largest ships.|$|R

25|$|The 99th as a whole, outnumbered five to one, inflicted {{casualties}} in the ratio of eighteen to one. The division lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or trench foot. German losses were much higher. In the northern sector opposite the 99th, this included more than 4,000 deaths {{and the destruction of}} sixty tanks and <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{overhaul}} in Sydney, Australia, she {{was back}} at Espiritu Santo in March to participate in bombardments of New Georgia, soon to be invaded. The first goal on New Georgia proper was Rice Anchorage. In the force escorting the transports carrying the initial landing parties, Helena moved into Kula Gulf just before midnight on 4 July, and shortly after midnight on the 5th, her <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> opened up in her last shore bombardment.|$|E

25|$|Bouamlong was {{steadily}} raked by incoming 122mm and 130mm shells. As {{the result}} of a 17 December conference on the matter, an intelligence data base was developed of locations of past usage of Communist 122mm and 130mm field guns. Raven Forward Air Controllers and photo reconnaissance pilots surveilled the old gun locations. As the Communists reused their past locations, their guns were spotted and struck with laser guided bombs. By the turn of the year, seven of the <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> had been hit. U.S. air power totaled 957 sorties for December; the RLAF flew 2,200.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, Union forces probed a {{point in}} the Confederate line at Dam No. 1. The Union failed to exploit the initial success of this attack, however. This lost {{opportunity}} held up McClellan for two additional weeks while he tried to convince the U.S. Navy to bypass the Confederates' <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> at Yorktown and Gloucester Point and ascend the York River to West Point and outflank the Warwick Line. McClellan planned a massive bombardment for dawn on May 5, but the Confederate army slipped away during the night of May 3 toward Williamsburg.|$|E

Even though Mags struggled with the screen test and has no formal cooking training, she was declared the winner of heat 2 and Rita was granted a wild card.|$|E

25|$|Robertson {{was clear}} {{that it would take}} more than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he {{overestimated}} the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies’ favour as “the Germans are approaching the limit of their resources”.|$|E
25|$|Fisher saw {{the need}} to improve the range, {{accuracy}} and rate of fire of naval gunnery, and was an early proponent of the use of the torpedo, which he believed would supersede <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> for use against ships. As Controller, he introduced torpedo boat destroyers as a class of ship intended for defence against attack from torpedo boats or submarines. As First Sea Lord, he was responsible for the construction of , the first all-big-gun battleship, but he also believed that submarines would become increasingly important and urged their development. He was involved with the introduction of turbine engines to replace reciprocating engines, and the introduction of oil fuelling to replace coal. He introduced daily baked bread on board ships, whereas when he entered the service it was customary to eat hard biscuits, frequently infested by biscuit weevils.|$|E
25|$|The <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> {{opened fire}} on the New Madrid {{defensive}} positions on March 13, and continued throughout the day. McCown realized that Pope would try to attack his forts by regular approaches. He felt that his reduced artillery companies would be too exhausted to resist, so {{he decided not to}} wait for the inevitable. On the night of March 13–14, orders were given to abandon the town and its two forts. A heavy rainstorm hid the troop movements from the enemy, so the evacuation was accomplished without incident. There was some confusion (which seems to have been exaggerated in Pope's reports), and the departure was so sudden that the guns in the forts had to be spiked and left behind, but most of the troops were successfully removed and redistributed. On the morning of March 14, two deserters appeared bearing a white flag, and informed Pope that the town was deserted.|$|E
