5|$|On {{the night}} of September 18, 1964, Kinne left the hotel without Pugliese, either to acquire money because the couple was running low or to get {{medicine}} she required. Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> in Hotel La Vada. According to Kinne's account, she went with Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, but he soon began to make sexual advances toward {{her and she was}} forced to fire her gun at him in an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that she had had no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed her {{and watched}} her drive off. Then he went slowly and unmolested <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|He kissed her, {{and handed}} her into the carriage. Then he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> and lit a cigar.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} after tea and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> but at eight o'clock, when the shop closed, {{he was waiting}} outside.|$|R
500|$|In a {{limousine}} {{on the way}} to the airport Moon insisted they return to their hotel, saying [...] "I forgot something." [...] At the hotel he ran <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> grabbed the television and threw it out the window into the swimming pool below. He then jumped back into the limo, saying [...] "I nearly forgot." ...|$|E
500|$|After Holliday's {{confrontation}} with Ike Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> at Camillus Sidney [...] "Buck" [...] Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then {{went home and}} to bed. Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp played cards with Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and a fifth man (unknown to Ike and to history), until morning.|$|E
2500|$|Now that Joe {{was into}} the final, he didn't mention his broken thumb to anyone. He went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> and soaked his thumb {{in hot water}} and Epsom salts. [...] "Pain or not, Joe Frazier of Beaufort, South Carolina, was going for gold." [...] Joe proclaimed. Joe would fight a 30-year-old German {{mechanic}} named Hans Huber, who failed {{to make it on}} the German Olympic wrestling team. By now Joe was used to fighting bigger guys, but he was not used to doing it with a damaged left hand. When the opening bell sounded on fight night, Joe came out and started swinging punches, he threw his right hand more than usual that night. Every so often he'd used his left hook, but nothing landed with the kind of impact he managed in previous bouts. Under Olympic rules, 5 judges judge a bout, and that night three voted for Joe.|$|E
60|$|WHEN Stella {{left the}} conservatory, the {{attraction}} of the ball for Romayne was at an end. He went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> at the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|But Jacob moved. He murmured good-night. He {{went out}} into the court. He buttoned his jacket across his chest. He went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> and being the only man who walked at that moment <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>his</b> {{footsteps}} rang out, his figure loomed large. Back from the Chapel, back from the Hall, back from the Library, came the sound of his footsteps, as if the old stone echoed with magisterial authority: [...] "The young man--the young man--the young man-back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rooms." ...|$|R
60|$|After lunching in the {{basement}} of the Medical School Philip went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms.</b> It was Saturday afternoon, and the landlady was cleaning the stairs.|$|R
2500|$|Later, Edmund {{finds himself}} {{haunted by the}} {{headless}} ghost of his great-uncle, who openly accuses him of beheading him and even calling him [...] "Edna" [...] in order to taunt him. During the celebratory banquet in honour of the new king, a portrait of Henry Tudor is presented for ridicule, and Edmund is horrified {{to learn that the}} wounded man he is sheltering is actually the enemy. Edmund rushes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> only to find Henry Tudor gone. Edmund pursues him but the ghost of Richard III chases Edmund into a foggy meadow, where he meets three witches who address the Black Adder as [...] "Ruler of men, Ravisher of women, Slayer of kings" [...] and predict that he shall one day become king. Edmund thus proclaims [...] "History, here I come!" [...] When he leaves the meadow, the witches remark among themselves that they had expected Henry Tudor to look different, before realising that they had prophesied to the wrong person.|$|E
2500|$|Newton's single-minded {{attention}} to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton. His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how {{when he took a}} walk in his garden he would sometimes rush <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down. [...] Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the Principia: Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all. [...] So it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was normally dedicated, and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson died on August 16, 1938, {{at the age}} of 27, near Greenwood, Mississippi, {{of unknown}} causes. Several differing {{accounts}} have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about [...] from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician Sonny Boy Williamson, Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, [...] "Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand." [...] Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The musicologist Robert [...] "Mack" [...] McCormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but he declined to reveal the man's name.|$|E
60|$|When {{as usual}} he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> tidy himself, {{he had no}} sooner put the latch-key in his door than he heard a voice behind him.|$|R
6000|$|Deane drove <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms.</b> As yet {{he could}} {{scarcely}} realize the situation. Had anyone ever been {{confronted with a}} position so unique? The mystery of the girl's impenetrability was solved at last! ...|$|R
60|$|One afternoon, {{when he went}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> {{from the}} {{hospital}} to wash and tidy himself before going to tea as usual with Norah, as he let himself in with his latch-key, his landlady {{opened the door for}} him.|$|R
60|$|The poor dwarf hurried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> {{and poured}} out his grief to the goose.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{she gently}} led {{him from the}} room, {{closed the door and}} locked it. Reginald Carne {{staggered}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|When he came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> Sophy was {{curled up}} on the couch with a {{cigarette}} between her lips. She looked at him severely.|$|E
50|$|But real horror awaits. He {{makes it}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> and discovers that Magda {{did not go}} to the theatre the night before. She stayed at home, dressed her face in a clown makeup, chopped her hair with a razor, and then hanged herself.|$|R
60|$|The cab glided off. Laverick {{caught a}} glimpse of a wan little face with a faint smile quivering at the corner of her lips as she leaned out for a moment to say good-bye. Then he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> breakfasted, and made <b>his</b> way <b>to</b> <b>his</b> office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pity on a murderess, a thief!" [...] he cried. [...] "Not I! I have {{suffered}} enough for my folly. I will go {{and tell the}} truth to-morrow. It was you who killed him. You {{did it in the}} cab and stole <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> rob--afterwards. Horrible! Horrible!" ...|$|R
60|$|She ran {{and got the}} two decanters-one {{of whiskey}} and one of brandy, which {{he was in the}} habit of {{carrying}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> from such an incursion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{show them}} through," [...] {{he said to}} his uncle; and the old man assented with, [...] "Well, perhaps you'd better, Jack," [...] and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thomson {{took the}} hint and departed. He walked quickly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> thrust the order he had {{received}} into an envelope, and sent it round to the Censor's Department.|$|E
60|$|He bowed, and {{she stepped}} into the lift without any further form of farewell. Vine walked thoughtfully <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms.</b> He was a man who had grown hard and callous in the stress of life, but somehow the memory of Virginia's pale face and dark reproachful eyes {{remained}} with him.|$|R
60|$|John went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> {{fighting}} all {{the time}} against a sense of unreality, a sense almost of lost identity. He bought an evening newspaper and read it on the way. He talked to the hall-porter, he talked to a neighbor with whom he ascended in the lift--he did everything except think.|$|R
6000|$|He {{paid the}} cab and walked slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>His</b> {{solicitor}} had already rung up. Two of his directors were waiting to see him, a reporter buttonholed him upon the pavement. From all of which things Deane knew that Ruby Sinclair had lost no time, that the first note of battle had been sounded! ...|$|R
60|$|Going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> he {{took out}} his {{revolver}} and loaded every chamber. In the set of his lips was menace to the next employer who dared to insult and degrade him.|$|E

6000|$|Lapham {{showed no}} {{surprise}} at seeing Corey still there, and merely answered, [...] "Well!" [...] {{when the young}} man said that he wished to speak with him, and led the way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was Berenice! The {{sight of}} her in such {{intimate}} association with a man utterly distasteful to him was one before which he winced and suffered. He was aware {{of a new and}} altogether undesired experience. To rid himself of it with all possible speed, he finished his lunch abruptly, and lighting a cigarette, started <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|St. Just, {{satisfied}} that Chauvelin had finally gone, now turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear girl," [...] he laughed, [...] "what {{was there}} to fear for me? I {{had a very good}} dinner with a very charming man. Afterwards, we went to a music-hall for a short time, I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> and here I am, just in time to wish you good night. What could the voices have to tell you about that?" ...|$|R
