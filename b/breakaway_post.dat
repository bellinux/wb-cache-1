50|$|Roadside hazards must be {{assessed}} for the danger they pose to traveling motorists based on size, shape, rigidity, and {{distance from the}} edge of travelway. For instance, small roadside signs and some large signs (ground-mounted <b>breakaway</b> <b>post)</b> often do not merit roadside protection as the barrier itself may pose a greater threat to general health and well-being of the public than the obstacle it intends to protect. In many regions of the world, the concept of clear zone is taken into account when examining the distance of an obstacle or hazard {{from the edge of}} travelway.|$|E
50|$|To {{address the}} {{vaulting}} and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed. The {{first generation of}} these terminals in the 1970s were breakaway cable terminals, in which the rail curves back on itself and is connected to a cable that runs {{between the first and}} second posts (which are often <b>breakaway</b> <b>posts).</b> The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the guide rail, dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the guide rail sections. A guide rail may also be terminated by curving it back to the point that the terminal is unlikely to be hit end-on, or, if possible, by embedding the end in a hillside or cut slope.|$|R
40|$|Long-span {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been recognized as {{an effective means of}} shielding low-fill culverts while minimizing construction efforts and limiting culvert damage and repair. The current MGS long-span design provided the capability to span unsupported lengths up to 25 ft (7. 6 m) without the use of nested guardrail. The excellent performance of the MGS long-span system in full-scale crash tests suggested that longer span lengths may be possible with the current design. A detailed analysis of the MGS long-span guardrail system was performed using the finite element software program LS-DYNA®. It was shown that the MGS long-span design had the potential for satisfying MASH TL- 3 evaluation criteria at increased span lengths of 31 ¼ ft (9. 5 m) and 37 ½ ft (11. 4 m). Further increasing the span length led to questionable vehicle capture and severe impacts into the culvert wingwall. It was determined that the 31 ¼-ft (9. 5 -m) span MGS long-span system would proceed to full-scale crash testing. A critical impact study identified two impact locations that (1) evaluated the structural capacity of the guardrail system and (2) maximized the vehicle’s extent over the culvert and potential for vehicle instabilities. Ultimately, the sponsors decided to perform full-scale crash testing with Universal Steel <b>Breakaway</b> <b>Posts</b> in lieu of Controlled Release Terminal posts to determine their suitability with the MGS long-span guardrail system. Prior full-scale crash testing indicated that the post-to-guardrail bolt connections were sensitive to the MGS long-span design. A simulation study investigated several techniques to improve the modeling of these bolted connections. Advisor: John D. Rei...|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Minneapolis {{architectural}} model builder Feyereisen Studios completed {{a model of}} the Stillwater Lift Bridge. The idea to build a physical model of the Stillwater Lift Bridge was undertaken in an effort to enlist the assistance of the disabled community, so as {{to make it easier for}} everyone to visualize and clearly understand the project. Unlike most {{architectural model}}s, the model of the Stillwater Lift Bridge was designed so that the visually impaired could explore it by sense of touch. The architectural model builders enlisted the help of the visually impaired while creating the model, and utilized various unconventional materials, including magnets to make <b>breakaway</b> lamp <b>posts,</b> sandpaper to indicate detectable warnings, raised crosswalk markings to indicate the crosswalk, and fuzzy grass. Everything on the model was labeled with both large text and Braille to enable people with low vision to understand the plans for the bridge.|$|R
