50|$|The {{notion that}} {{information}} processing {{is essential to}} life and to evolution predates the entry of the term informatics into the English language (1966). Various investigators argued in the 1940s that certain principles of information processing apply both in living and engineered systems, and much of their thinking is encapsulated in Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (1948). Wiener regarded evolution as phylogenetic learning, or accrual of information in the genome.

This laboratory study tested if compliance in electrodermal activity, heart rate or breathing in two-person teams (iV= 16) was predictive of team performance or coordination in a continuous tracking task that simulated teleoperation. Social-physiological compliance for each physiological measure was scored separately using weighted coherence and cross correlation ofthe physiological changes occurring in both participants (e. g., the cross correlation of the breathing pattern of the first team member with the breathing pattern of the second team member). Direct visual feedback between participants was systematically manipulated. Multiple regression analyses revealed that many coherence measures and one correlation measure were predictive of team performance. While social-visual contact had no impact, physiological compliance was predictive of improved performance, with coherence robust over all three physiological measures. These results provide correlational evidence that social-physiological compliance among team members may benetit team performance.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the potential of multi-sequence texture analysis in the characterization of prostatic tissues from in vivo Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The approach consists in simultaneous analysis of several images, each acquired under different conditions, but representing the same part of the organ. First, the texture of each image is characterized independently of the others. Then the feature values corresponding to different acquisition conditions are combined in one vector, characterizing a combination of textures derived from several sequences. Three MRI sequences are considered: T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted, and diffusion-weighted. Their textures are characterized using six methods (statistical and model-based). In total, 30 tissue descriptors are calculated for each sequence. The feature space is reduced using a modified Monte Carlo feature selection, combined with wrapper methods, and Principal Components Analysis. Six classifiers were used in the work. Multi-sequence texture analysis led to better classification results than single-sequence analysis. The subsets of features selected with the Monte Carlo method guaranteed the highest classification accuracies. © 2016 Nałȩcz Institute of <b>Biocybernetics</b> and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

As has already successfully done in various clinical fields, {{the technique of}} electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement can be applied in order to study tissue changes. The {{aim of this study}} was to study changes in the electrical properties of muscular tissues due to an isometric contraction and successive relaxation. For this work, the electrodes lay out and trials protocol were carefully designed, also according to studies concerning muscle fatigue. A device previously tested and employed for in vivo EIS measurements was used. Impedance measurements were carried out on the forearm flexor muscles in a group of sixteen healthy adult subjects. In order to have a quantitative index of spectral impedance variation, the relative variation of the area under curve of Nyquist plots was computed to study the different muscle states under consideration (rest, contraction and 4 min after contraction). The index introduced showed itself to be sensitive to different muscular conditions. Results from healthy subjects showed statistically significant differences in the impedance data in the various muscle conditions under examination. �� 2013 Na����cz Institute of <b>Biocybernetics</b> and Biomedical Engineering...|$|E
40|$|Accelerating global {{growth and}} {{frequent}} man-made crises generate uncertainties and demand new alternatives and viable solutions in technology, energy, and health {{as well as}} political, ecological, and media organiza-tions. This paper focuses on the key role of human communication and the increasing signifi cance of ‘human factors ’ (HF). In technology, currently 70 to 90 % of all defi ciencies originate from the complex HF-area, which includes human errors as well. In spite of human complexity, {{it is useful to}} study nature and com-pare it with our communication and behavior. Starting from control engineering and <b>biocybernetics,</b> a simple building block is discussed: the control circuit with negative feedback and stability. Two examples are then presented from biology and mechanics to illustrate communication, cooperation, self-regulation and stabiliz-ing mechanisms: (i) The mutualism between a tree and animals with fast adaptation to new symbioses and (ii) The elastoplastic, self-controlled buckling with ‘snap-through ’ and stabilizing mechanisms. Observing human behaviour and nature lead to an integral mental approach with the Limbionik ® Method (LM), which focuses on inter- and intrapersonal communication.

40|$|This {{model was}} {{developed}} {{for the study of}} excitation-contraction coupling for single cardiac cell. The basic assumptions are following: depolarization of cellular sarkolemma (membrane) rises inward calcium current Is, which rises the level of sarcoplasmatic calcium but also induces release of calcium from cisternal sarcoplasmic reticulum. These two basic sources increase the level of sarcoplasmic calcium so that calcium ions combine with regulatory protein troponin C and this enables combination of actin and myosin (i. e. crossbridge formation) and initiates contraction according to Huxley’s sliding filament theory. Properties of muscle are modelled by Hill (Maxwell) model. The simulation was done for both types of contraction: isometric and isotonic. Formation (disjunction) of crossbridge is supposed to be an active process utilizing energy. 1. DYNAMICS OF INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM Theory of compartments commonly used in <b>biocybernetics</b> was used for the modelling of intracelullar calcium dynamics. Calcium is supposed to be in homogeneous concentraction in all compartments and so modellling of calcium dynamics by the first order ordinary differential equations (ODE) is possible. Constants k in these equations are called rate constants and are reciprocal values of respective time constants. For the development of dynamic equations we used similar assumptions used by Wong (1981), Michailova (1992) : 1. We did not include potassium and sodium currents in the model {{due to the fact that}} they do not affect directly development of tension. 2. The inward current Is is supposed to be carried mainly by calcium ions. 3. The reversal potential ER does not change appreciably, i. e. is considered to remain constant during the whole cycle of contraction. 4. Na-Ca exchanger is not included in the model although the extrusion of Ca ions out of the cell is considered...|$|E
40|$|Located in the Italian city of Latina, near Rome, the LABoEx {{certainly}} {{represents a}} one-of-its kind concentrate of know-how and advanced {{research in the}} field of Cardiovascular disease. Conceived during a meeting between cardiologists and bioengineers, LAboEx was created in reply to the shared needs for an in-depth understanding of the many variables and parameters of the cardiovascular system and of their interaction with mechanical assist devices (such as the oxygenator, the intra-aortic balloon pump, centrifugal pump, the ventricular assist device, the ventilatory assistance etc). The initial idea, brought forth by the bioengineers, was to develop a tool of diverse numerical models that could simulate the behaviour of the cardiovascular system in presence of different mechanical cardiac or ventilatory assist devices. The concept was then extended by the cardiologists who suggested to extend its application in predicting, starting from few cardiovascular variables (measured non invasively), the trend, or better, the behaviour of those variables that cannot be directly measured on the patient. The successive step was use numerical models ad hoc for patents affected by specific pathologies, hence providing the physician a tool for deciding the most appropriate strategies for the patient. From there, the group developed the idea of orienting the cardiovascular numerical models also towards other applications, such as a commercial device that monitors the correct functioning of a 24 -hr blood pressure Holter. Indeed, the laboratory of the Institute of Clinical Physiology of the Italian National Research Council (C. N. R.) has already started working towards the realization of a software tool (CARDIOSIM?) aimed at simulating the behaviour of the cardiovascular system. This modular software was developed by Italian researchers together with colleagues from the Institute of <b>Biocybernetics</b> and Biomedical Engineering, IBIBPAN Warsaw, Poland, of the Iwate Prefectural University in Japan, the Biomedical Engineering and Cardiothoracic Surgery of the University Medical Center Groningen in Holland, and the N. I. H in the USA. The software implements on a PC platform a family of lumped parameter circulatory models designed to be used in clinical, research, and educational applications. The family of the circulatory models represents the circulation at the level of large vessels and allows to evaluate the global effects of external disturbances (pathologies, therapies, mechanical assistance, special environments or surgery) on the circulatory system. The software tool simulates different mechanical heart assist devices, like left and right Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) and Intraaortic Balloon Pumping (IABP) : both pulsatile and continuous flow VAD can be used inside the tool.

40|$|The {{textbook}} {{sets the}} methodology of exploration of emotional, cognitive and behavioral processing inside the live organism {{on the base of}} quantum physics. In the second part sumarises the overview of to date disponible knowledge of neurosciences, evolutional psychiatry, functional neuroanatomy, biopsychiatry and <b>biocybernetics,</b> needed for pedagogical use. The important point is the question of interaction between genoms and environment. Third: we apply the displayed above into the pedagogy with the aim to prevent children of trangeneration transmission of psycho- and sociopathology and for purpose of subclinical pedagogical intervention as well as resocialisation to help to maladapted individuals. This should be understood as a contribution to prevention efforts of world wide spreading psychopathology epidemy. The textbook offers to the reader an inovative view on the principle of the neurons population organisation on the basis of AND/OR logic function of a single neuron and feedback loops iterative decision making [executive] system. And finally, the textbook connects into single undividable system the brain and body, where body plays a master and brain a slave role. The brain does static and dynamic correlation analysis of external and internal sensory signals on the base of weight coefficients. The very important and new discovered role is that one of neuromodulation and neuromodulators. The key question, the textbook is searching the answer of, is, how the brain is learning and thus how to teach it as best as possible. The discovery is, the brain does work rather than a memory medium as a passive by experience programable filter. The body is recognised as a substantial part of this kind of memory and processing as well. The synthesis is finalised by the case study of hazard of stiring up a schizophrenia by a child aproximately two years old. The general conclusion is, the (probably) found fundamental principle of the organisation of the brain hardware and mental information processing functions and it´s application into the effective upbringing and education of a child. At the same end of the textbook we present a case study of pedagogical psychotherapy of a young, 20 years old blind, extremely anxious maladapted schoolboy Ondra. This is to be understood as an experimental evidence of efficiency of neuropedagogy approach in the everyday life. Main ideas: 1. The computation does not only the brain, but organism - brain and soma feedback interaction. 2. The generation of the response to the environmental asks goes through an iteration. 3. The iteration can converge to the atractor or diverge - in case of mental disorder. 4. The divergency can be oscilating or linearly shifting - cognitive bias. 5. The organism information processing is labile if not anchored to the outer reference point. 6. Neuromodulators are means, how the soma changes weights on synapses and controlls the iterative process. 7. In this sense the soma {{is a part of the}} memory system - so called functional memory. 8. Hypotetically description of how the organism stops the iteration and releases the response. 9.
