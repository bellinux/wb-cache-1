40|$|Gorlin {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to PTCH 1 mutation, identified by {{a collection of}} clinical and radiologic signs. We describe {{the case of a}} family in which father and son fulfilled clear cut diagnostic criteria for Gorlin syndrome including multiple basal cell carcinomas, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, atypical skeletal anomalies and a novel PTCH 1 germline mutation (c. 1041 delAA). Craniofacial and other skeletal anomalies displayed at 3 D and helical CT scan were: macrocephaly, positional plagiocephaly, skull base and sphenoid asymmetry, <b>bifidity</b> of multiple ribs and giant multilocular odontogenic jaw cysts. Extensive multilamellar calcifications were found in falx cerebri, tentorium, falx cerebelli and in the atlanto-occipital ligament. The inclusion of bifid ribs as a novel major criteri may be useful for the recognition and characterization of misdiagnosed cases...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 13 cadavers (12 men and 1 women) of {{different}} age group {{were used for}} the study with the purpose to determine the prevalence of femoral vein duplication. Lower limb regions (26 sides) were carefully dissected as per the standard dissection procedure. Femoral vein (unitruncular) was found in 96. 15 % of specimen. Bitruncular configurations (total <b>bifidity)</b> was found in a male cadaver of 75 years of age (3. 85 %). In the right lower limb, 6. 5 cms below the inguinal ligament the femoral vein - lateral ramus received the lateral circumflex femoral vein, and the medial circumflex femoral vein, and the lateral and medial ramii formed a common venous trunk. Knowledge of the truncular venous variations is important to recognize and avoid potential errors in diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the femoral vein, {{in the case of an}} occluded duplicated trunk...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{technique}} of vertical dome division or tip defining, involves incising the lateral crura and vestibular skin at or lateral to the dome or tip defining point. The incision divides the lower lateral cartilage into a lateral segment and a medial segment, which are advanced anteriorly and sutured together to increase tip projection. The present study aimed at assessing a new vertical dome division, {{which is a}} modified version of vertical dome technique to decrease nasal tip projection, and increase or decrease nasal tip rotation and other tip deformities. Methods: The medical files of patients undergone rhinoplasty from 2003 to 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The files were selected from a computerized rhinoplasty database of patients, who had been operated using a modified vertical dome technique and followed-up for one year or more after the surgery. Results: A total of 3756 patients were operated. Complications related to the nasal tip such as bossae, <b>bifidity,</b> persistent tip projection or tip asymmetry was seen in 81 patients (2. 1 %). Revisions for tip-related problems were performed in 42 patients (1. 1 %). Conclusions: The findings suggest that the modified vertical dome technique is an effective method for nasal tip deprojection and narrowing via an open approach. The length of follow-up and the large sample size support effectiveness of the techniqu...|$|E
40|$|The four {{available}} "short-spine dogs" {{were investigated}} pathologically; {{the results obtained}} may be summarized as follows. 1. The cartilaginous tissues in the vertebral column, in point of composition of the column, were quantitatively more abundant than those of normal dogs. In addition, the epiphyseal cartilaginous plates remained {{for a long period}} of time and especially cartilaginous fragments in the arcus vertebrae were recognized in all cases. These phenomena are suggesive of the probability that ossification of the vertebrae is feeble during the developmental process and also after birth. 2. The tissue debris of the chorda dorsalis in the spaces of the nuclei pulposi (n. p.) began to disappear during considerably early stages after birth, and the spaces of the n. p. were gradually invaded by low-differentiated cartilage cells of the perinuclear layer of the annulus fibrosus (a. f.) and were-entirely in some instances-occupied by the cartilaginous structures. On that occasion, even in the 5 -year-old dog, there sometimes existed such n. p. as the replacing by cartilaginous tissues had not been perfectly occurred. 3. In the a. f., according to the progressive changes of the low-differentiated cartilage cells, the formation of many groups constituted of these cells was recognized. These cell groups were found chiefly in the interior but also in the peripheral portion of the a. f.; moreover, massive hyaline cartilaginous tissues were scatteringly found in the a. f. That is to say, in the a. f. pretty extensively low-differentiated and progressive changes were seen simultaneously. In addition to these changes, degeneration of cartilaginous tissues was recognized in various portions of the a. f. and especially, usually found in scattered portions of the cartilage cell groups. It may be understood that these pictures are highly significant in respect to the deformation of the vertebral coltumn in the developmental process and moreover, after birth. 4. In the parts of the a. f. constituted of fibrocartilaginous tissue, fish-bone patterned structures were irregular in some places due to the morphological abnormalities of the corpus vertebrae and degenerative changes of the cartilaginous tissue. 5. In the a. f. adjacent to the corpus vertebrae and in the cartilaginous plates adjacent to the corpus vertebrae which were seen on the central surfaces of the epiphysis of the corpus vertebrae and in the parts facing the central portions of <b>bifidities</b> of the corpus vertebrae, the loss of the calcified zones of cartilage was seen in some places, as a result of the degenerative changes of cartilaginous tissue principally, though occasionally, in having no relation to such changes. In the majority of the epiphyseal cartilaginous plates, foci of degeneration were recognized. It may be considered that these changes exert considerable interference in the growth of the corpus vertebrae. 6. In the a. f., free new-formed bone tissues and periostally new-formed bone tissues deposited in the corpus vertebrae were observed here and there. 7. In one place respectively in cases Nos. 1 and 4,fusion of a part of the corpus vertebrae and of the entire vertebrae was recognized. As to the embryological mechanism of these changes further investigation needs to be performed. 8. The areas of clefts of the arcus vertebrae and proc. spinosus were occupied by cartilaginous or fibrous or both; in these cartilaginous tissues, pictures of degeneration were found. Furthermore, as shown in the vertebrae cervicales in case No. 3,there were <b>bifidities</b> of the arcus vertebrae which had been repaired with new-formed bone tissues. 9. In the articulationes intervertebralis, costovertebralis and sacro-iliaca, both degeneration of the articular cartilages and unification of the articular surfaces were observed in many of the joints. A picture of ossification was observable in the peripheral part of the unified articulatio intervertebralis between the os sacrum and the vertebrae coccygeae in case No. 1. It may be understood that in the joints of the vertebral column, degeneration of the articular cartilages and unification of the articular surfaces arise from mechanical factors and, sometimes, that osseous fusion occurs in these joints. 10. The relation between the changes of the ganglia spinalia and nerve bundles of the nervi spinales in the vertebral canal and the deformity of the vertebral column must be a subject for further research. 11. In the costo-chondral junctions foci of degeneration were found in all cases. In case No. 4,the dorsal ends of some costae were articulated with each other. Moreover, in these joints, there were degeneration of articular cartilages, unification of articular surfaces, formation of free new-formed bone tissue and periostal apposition of new bone tissue. It may be considered that the morphological abnormalities of the costae have occurred as secondary results of deformities of the vertebral column. 12. In the bones other than the vertebral column, costae, sternum and os coxae, and in the visceral organs, there was no finding directly related with deformation of the vertebral column. Thus, on the basis of the present pathological findings concerning the "short-spine dogs", the following conclusions may be drawn. It may be regarded that in the vertebral column, low differentiation, progressive changes and degeneration of cartilaginous tissue in the a. f. as well as low accomplishment of ossification occurred in the developmental process and after birth. It may be understood that these processes are principal causes of deformation of the vertebral column and that the morphological abnormalities of the arcus vertebrae and other portions can be induced secondarily...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although, {{different}} grafts {{are used}} for nasal tipplasty in cases with under projected or ill defined tip, the selectionof a graft material, which provides sufficient amount oftissue with least donor site morbidity and low recipient sitecomplication is challenging. The objectives of the presentstudy were to examine the usefulness of cartilaginous dorsumas a proper material for tip graft, and to introduce the cartilaginousdorsum as an acceptable material for columellar strut. Methods: Fifty six (18 males and 38 females) patients wereoperated for augmentation tip plasty and hump reduction from 2004 to 2008. The tailored cartilaginous or ostecartilaginousdorsum {{was used as a}} tip graft or columellar strut in 35 and 21 cases, respectively. The cartilaginous framework was exposedusing open or close rhinoplasty approach in 41 and 15 cases,respectively. The patients were followed for 12 - 36 months. Cosmetic outcomes and patients' satisfaction were obtainedusing qualitative measures. Results: The percentage of patients with very improved, improved,unchanged or unacceptable aesthetic outcome were 39. 29 %, 50 %, 3. 57 % and 7. 14 %, respectively. Moreover, thepercentages of very satisfied, satisfied, indifferent and unsatisfiedpatients were 66 %, 18 %, 9 %, and 7 %, respectively. Conclusion: The procedure provides a well-defined nasal tipwith no evidence of <b>bifidity,</b> angularity, or cartilage graft visibilityand displacement. The use of dorsal osteocartilaginousgraft offers outstanding advantages including ease of harvest,mould, fix, and low resorption...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Heart {{dimensions}} play {{an important}} role in heart valve replacement surgeries of the modern era. While fixing of valve during replacement even a minimal difference in the measurements will be crucial for effective postsurgical effective functioning of the valve. There is a marginal difference in the measurements between the attachments of the chordae from the papillary muscle to the valve and the measurements between the papillary muscles to the valve. This study aims to highlight the crucial differences between these measurements which will provide a ready reference for the operating surgeon. Materials & Methods: The left ventricle was studied in 50 human hearts. The distances between the anterior and posterior papillary muscles to the mitral annulus were measured from four fixed points. Results: The mean vertical diameter of the mitral annulus was 16. 56 mm SD ± 3. 27. The mean transverse diameter of the mitral annulus was 18. 06 mm SD ± 2. 93. Mean measurements from the tip of the anterior papillary muscle to the four fixed points in the annulus were 15. 97 mm, 17. 82 mm, 11. 95 mm and 16. 57 mm. Measurements from the tip of the posterior papillary muscle to the four fixed points in the annulus were 16. 20 mm, 13. 58 mm, 12. 35 mm and 14. 97 mm. In cases where the tip of the papillary muscles was bifid, anterior papillary muscle <b>bifidity</b> was 60 % and posterior papillary muscle was 30 % and 10 % i...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe venous anatomy {{is highly}} variable. This {{is due to}} {{possible}} venous malformations (minor truncular forms) occurring during the late development of the embryo that produce several anatomical variations in the number and caliber of the main venous femoral trunks at the thigh level. Our aim was to study the prevalence of the different anatomical variations of the femoral vein at the thigh level. MethodsThis study used 336 limbs of 118 fresh, nonembalmed cadavers. The technique included washing of the whole venous system, latex injection, anatomical dissection, and then painting of the veins. ResultsThe modal anatomy of the femoral vein was found in 308 of 336 limbs (88 %). Truncular malformations were found in 28 of 336 limbs (12 %); unitruncular configurations in 3 % (axo femoral trunk [1 %] and deep femoral trunk [2 %]). Bitruncular configurations were found in 9 % (<b>bifidity</b> of the femoral vein [2 %], femoral vein with axio-femoral trunk [5 %], and femoral vein with deep femoral trunk [2 %]). ConclusionTruncular venous malformations of the femoral vein are not rare (12 %). Their knowledge {{is important for the}} investigation of the venous network, particularly the venous mapping of patients with cardiovascular disease. It is also important to recognize a bitruncular configuration to avoid potential errors for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the femoral vein, {{in the case of an}} occluded duplicated trunk. Clinical RelevanceTruncular venous malformations of the femoral vein are not rare. For the investigator, it may be clinically prudent to scan the opposite limb in the presence of venous duplication since femoral vein duplication is frequently bilateral. It should also be noted that a thrombus is more likely to be seen in one canal of a duplicated femoral vein than in the normal anatomy. Thus, a thrombus in that canal could be easily missed on ultrasound. For the surgeon, femoral vein duplication could provide the opportunity to use one of the trunks for deep vein transposition reconstruction surgery of the opposite limb...|$|E
40|$|Gorlin-Goltz {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder linked to PTCH 1 mutation, recognized by {{a collection of}} clinical and radiologic signs (macrocephaly, frontal bossing, multiple intracranial calcifications including falx cerebri and atlanto-occipital ligament). We describe here a {{the case of a}} family with clear cut criteria for Gorlin-Goltz syndrome presenting the association of cranio-facial and skeletal anomalies together with a peculiar sphenoid variant. Two patients, father and son, were examined because of multiple basal cell carcinomas and keratocystic odontogenic tumours. Other suggestive findings were multiple positive family history, typical skeletal anomalies and a novel PTCH 1 germline mutation (c. 1041 delAA). Craniofacial and other skeletal anomalies displayed at 3 D and helical CT scan were: macrocephaly, skull base asymmetry (positional plagiocephaly), mandibular prognathism, mandibular condylar deformation with hyperplasia of the coronoid process, <b>bifidity</b> of multiple ribs and giant multilocular odontogenic jaw cysts. Extensive multilamellar calcifications were found in falx cerebri, tentorium, falx cerebelli and in the apical segment of the atlanto-occipital ligament. Thoracic anomalies included bifid left 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th and 6 th rib, dismorphic body of the 3 rd thoracic vertebra, dorsolumbar scoliosis, sacrum acutum. Interestingly, 3 D-CT scan showed asymmetry of both sphenoid wings with thickening of the left wing sphenoid wing together with irregularity of the architecture of trabecular bone with alternating osteolytic and sclerotic areas. Abnormalities of the sphenoid bone are not very common, and consist of differently aggressive entities: some of them are typical of the pediatric age in few hereditary and congenital disorders. The application of new criteria (i. e. peculiar calcifications of ligaments and sphenoid asymmetry) to a wider case series can lead to the early diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome, especially in pediatric patients, when the full phenotype is not yet expressed. The inclusion of bifid ribs as a novel major criteria and the recognition of peculiar cranial anomalies such as sphenoid asymmetry, well detected at volume CT reconstruction, might be useful for the recognition and characterization of misdiagnosed cases...|$|E
