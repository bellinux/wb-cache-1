60|$|And {{if any of}} {{you have}} a neighbour, or a {{relation}} fallen into sin, even into utter shame;--oh, for the sake of Him who ate and drank with publicans and sinners, never cast them off, never trample on them, never turn your back upon them. They are miserable enough already, doubt it not. Do not add one drop to their cup of bitterness. They are ashamed of themselves already, doubt it not. Do not you destroy in them what small grain of self-respect still remains. You fancy they are not so. They seem to you brazen-faced, proud, impenitent. So did the publicans and harlots seem to those proud, blind Pharisees. Those pompous, self-righteous fools did not know what terrible struggles were going on in those poor sin- tormented hearts. Their pride had blinded them, while they <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> 'It <b>is</b> we alone who see. This people, which knoweth not the law, is accursed.' Then came the Lord Jesus, the Son of man, who knew what was in man; and he spoke to them gently, cordially, humanly; and they heard him, and justified God, and were baptized, confessing their sins; and so, as he said himself, the publicans and harlots went into the kingdom of God before those proud, self-conceited Pharisees.|$|R

He has said that if the government felt marriage was a right, then it would not stop polygamists and incestuous couples from marrying.

50|$|One of {{the main}} debate around the new {{commission}} was the recommendation of amnesties for crimes under international law within the Act itself. Many victims’ groups were against {{this part of the}} Act. That is why five experts for the UN Human Rights Council examined the TRC Act passed by Nepal’s Constituent Assembly. According to Richard Bennett, Asia director at Amnesty International, “the UN’s findings are consistent with what human rights groups have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> - Nepal’s TRC Act is fundamentally flawed and could leave thousands of victims of conflict-related violations without access to the justice they deserve”. Under international pressure, the Supreme Court annulled the amnesty provision saying it was against constitutional provisions and international laws.|$|E
5000|$|The Irish Independent {{reported}} in February 2006 that an upcoming Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) {{report on the}} murder was expected to link Rafferty's murder to the IRA. In a statement, Rafferty's other sister, Esther Uzell-Rafferty, said of the upcoming IMC report: [...] "It's what we have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> <b>along.</b> We've never said murder was sanctioned by the IRA's top man, but other Sinn Féin members {{knew it was going}} to happen and did nothing about it." [...] She added [...] "murderer is definitely an IRA member and we know this because of the information we have received." [...] Uzell-Rafferty ran as an independent candidate in the 2007 Irish general election for Dublin South-East to call on Daithí Doolan to fully co-operate with the Garda investigation into her brother's killing, stating, [...] "The murderer is still walking the street. Sinn Féin have done absolutely nothing at all." ...|$|E

For the past three-and-a-half months, we have been defending ourselves against assumptions made based on an unsubstantiated report rather than on facts or evidence. Despite our adamant denials, the report ran on February 2, 2008, the day before Super Bowl XLII. That game was the second-most watched program in television history and {{it is unfortunate that}} today’s news will not also reach an audience of that size. We hope that with Matt Walsh's disclosures, everyone will finally believe what we have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> and emphatically stated {{on the day of the}} initial report: 'The suggestion that the New England Patriots recorded the St. Louis Rams' walkthrough on the day before Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 is absolutely false.

2500|$|After assaulting Jarrett {{from behind}} on the June 24 edition of Impact!, TNA {{president}} Dixie Carter suspended Sting for 30 days without pay the following week. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 edition of Impact!, wearing his nWo Wolfpac red face paint, and helping Kevin Nash, who had backed him up during his suspension, beat down Jarrett, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan. On the September 2 edition of Impact! Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Nash. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat. On the September 16 edition of Reaction, Sting and Nash were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, {{who claimed to have}} gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Sting and Nash were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory Sting, Nash and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was slated to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe, and Sting, Nash, and Dinero tried to tell Joe this was what they <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> <b>along.</b> Joe fought them anyway and ended up pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> as they turned heel with Jarrett and Jeff Hardy as Abyss's [...] "they", and in the process turned Sting, Nash and Dinero back to being faces. On the following edition of Impact!, Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan, Bischoff and their new group, Immortal, and walked out on TNA and Dixie Carter, noting that they had tried to warn her that Hogan and Bischoff would try to take over the company for their own gain, but she hadn't listened, meaning Sting was never a true villain his entire heel run. After Impact!, Sting took hiatus from TNA television, as Borden's TNA contract had expired at the end of 2010.|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. House Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert {{issued a}} {{statement}} {{on the day of}} publication: [...] "I think this report shows the value of Congress handling scientific disputes by asking scientists to give us guidance. The report clearly lays out a scientific consensus position on the historic temperature record." [...] He noted that the report raised no doubts about global climate change or the legitimacy of any paper, and concluded that [...] "The report does show, unsurprisingly, that scientists need to continue to work to develop a more precise sense of what global temperatures were between the beginning of the last millennium and about 1600. Congress ought to let them go about that work without political interference." [...] In an opposing statement Senator Jim Inhofe said that [...] "Today's NAS report reaffirms what I have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> that Mann's ‘hockey stick' is broken. Today's report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age."
