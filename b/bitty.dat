Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what happened that day.|$|E

Hallmark worked on the design, storylines, {{distribution}} and sales which have, so far, been limited to Hallmark shops in the United States and Canada, and the Hallmark website. The line began with a limited production of Hallmark's Itty <b>Bittys</b> plush miniatures before expanding to larger Twink & Starlite plushes, a 16" [...] Rainbow Brite doll, a series of hard cover story books, women's clothing, and an expansion of the Itty <b>Bittys</b> line. More Rainbow Brite merchandise was introduced in 2016 and even more is expected in 2017.

5000|$|Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss {{noted on}} the mixtapes music that it's [...] "Combined and {{scattered}} {{amid all the}} compulsive name-drops, '93 West Coast posturing and abhorrent Kardashian family drops, is something very good. Maybe not as excellent as his steroid-era classic, The Documentary, or the jilted lunacy of Doctor's Advocate, but rock solid nonetheless. Far from revolutionary, but a nice addition to a deceptively estimable catalog". Giving it a 3.5 out of 5 stars Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen cited it as something that fans of Game [...] "never quite experienced from him: fun" [...] also commenting on Game's music that [...] "The beats, by everyone from the Neptunes to Dr. Dre, are taut and funky, but the Game's charisma holds center stage". Vibe writer Mikey Fresh stated that [...] "While Game's highly anticipated R.E.D. Album {{seems to be on}} its way to becoming Detox Jr., Chuck Taylor throws two dishes worth of hors d'oeuvres in the form of Purp & Patron, to wet [...] our appetites until the arrival of the full course meal". Giving it a 4 out of 10 rating, David Amidon of PopMatters criticized the way Game name-drops stating that [...] "brands, cars, other rappers, their parents, their siblings, neighborhoods, actors, directors, homeless people, flight attendants, police officers, EMTs, waiters, <b>bitties</b> in the BK lounge, and really just about any name that comes to his mind" [...] and [...] "in his eagerness to do this shit, he almost always loses track of where he started a verse". Nathan Slavik of DJBooth.net gave the project an [...] "Above Average" [...] review, stating, [...] "None of these tracks are hits, but they certainly indicate that a hitmaker still lurks underneath that face tattoo." ...|$|R
25|$|Other UK based {{artists that}} had {{international}} impact include Aswad, Misty In Roots, Steel Pulse, Janet Kay, Tippa Irie, Smiley Culture {{and more recently}} <b>Bitty</b> McLean. There {{have been a number}} of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be Alborosie (Italy) and Gentleman (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many riddims. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley's famous Tuff Gong Studios. Since the early 1990s, several Italian reggae bands have emerged, including Africa Unite, Reggae National Tickets, Sud Sound System, Pitura Freska and B.R. Stylers. Another Italian famous reggae singer was Rino Gaetano.|$|E

Ted Levine was cast in an audition in Vancouver, British Columbia as [...] "the main cop". Jason Gray-Stanford accepted {{to work on it}} when he became aware of Shalhoub and Parisot's involvement. He originally auditioned for the role of deputy mayor and, as he was not cast, Parisot invited him to read for Disher. Gray-Stanford agreed as he became excited to try for the role of Levine's sidekick. The pilot, originally developed as a TV film, was written by Breckman and filmed in the fall of 2001 in Vancouver. Originally shot in 35 mm film, it was changed to Super 16mm for budget reasons when USA acquired it.|$|E

[...] A writer for Rap-Up provided a favorable review, complimenting Cyrus for [...] " [...] up the heat" [...] in the [...] "striking visuals". Writing for VH1, Emily Exton joked that [...] "hip-hop's fledgling relationship with a former Disney star just got a little stronger", and noted that [...] "Jay-Z may have encouraged Miley’s love of twerking with his [...] "Somewhereinamerica" [...] shout-out, but it appears Sean is less interested in seeing Billy Ray's daughter shake her thing than having her walk around in dazzling heels and stare the camera down {{in the name of}} art." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed".

So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun.

She credits this to three months of research she did at Yale, as she was writing screenplay Hardy, starring a hockey player who falls in love with his best friend. Ukazu describes Check, Please! as somewhat of a reaction to Hardy, as her screenplay was rather depressing. Hardy featured themes of [...] "addiction, externalized and internalized homophobia, the anxiety of graduating and feelings of failure."

I was scared to death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lymon's slowly declining sales fell {{sharply in}} the early 1960s. [...] Within the span of one year, {{as a result of}} heroin use, his voice changed from his {{signature}} tenor to a much deeper baritone. [...] His highest-charting solo hit was a cover of Bobby Day's [...] "Little <b>Bitty</b> Pretty One", which peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 pop chart in 1960 and which had been recorded in 1957. Addicted to heroin since the age of 15, Lymon fell further into his habit, and his performing career went into decline. According to Lymon in an interview with Ebony magazine in 1967, he was first introduced to heroin when he was 15 by a woman twice his age. In 1961, Roulette, now run by Morris Levy, ended their contract with Lymon and he entered a drug rehabilitation program. After losing Lymon, the Teenagers went through a string of replacement singers, the first of whom was Billy Lobrano. In 1960, Howard Kenny Bobo sang lead on [...] "Tonight's the Night" [...] with the Teenagers; later that year, Johnny Houston sang lead on two songs. The Teenagers, who had been moved by Morris Levy to End Records, were released from their contract in 1961. The Teenagers briefly reunited with Lymon in 1965, without success.|$|E
