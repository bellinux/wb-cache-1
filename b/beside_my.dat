500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, {{and for a long time}} I slept with a loaded gun <b>beside</b> <b>my</b> bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry." [...] Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "If you shall afflict my daughters, {{and if you}} shall take wives <b>beside</b> <b>my</b> daughters," [...] in [...] to mean that Jacob forswore two kinds of affliction. The Gemara read [...] "if you shall afflict" [...] to mean by denying conjugal duty, and the Gemara read [...] "if you shall take" [...] to refer to marrying rival wives. Thus the Gemara deduced that abstention from marital intercourse is considered an affliction.|$|E

Hans Herzl, then thirteen, read the kaddish.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Christian Leadership Conference {{suspended}} King {{from the}} presidency in June 2001, concerned that he was letting the organization drift into inaction. The group's national chairman at the time, Claud Young, sent a June 25 letter to King that read, [...] "You have consistently been insubordinate and displayed inappropriate, obstinate behavior in the (negligent) carrying out of your duties as president of SCLC." [...] King was reinstated only one week later after promising {{to take a more}} active role. Young said of the suspension, [...] "I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention. Well, it got his attention all right." [...] After he was reinstated, King prepared a four-year plan outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge to the Bush administration in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. In a rally on August 5, 2001, in Montgomery, SCLC leaders, including Rev. Joseph Lowery, former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and Rev. Jesse Jackson all pledged their support for King. [...] "I sit <b>beside</b> <b>my</b> successor, to assure him of my love and support," [...] said Rev. Lowery. King said he also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners' rights and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks. However, King also suggested the group needed a new approach, stating, [...] "We must not allow our lust for 'temporal gratification' to blind us from making difficult decisions to effect future generations." ...|$|E
