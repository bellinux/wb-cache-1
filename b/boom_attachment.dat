25|$|The {{fracture}} surfaces on {{the outer}} part of the left wing were examined by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at its Division of Aeronautics in Melbourne. These examinations determined that separation of the left wing was initiated by metal fatigue of the lower main spar <b>boom</b> <b>attachment</b> socket. The primary structure of the Stinson was of welded steel tube construction. A fatigue crack had initiated in weld metal on the inner surface of the socket. After propagating through the weld metal during {{a large number of}} flights, the fatigue crack entered the socket's parent metal. This crack eventually affected 45% of the cross-section of the socket before the lower boom failed on the fatal flight. Investigators noted the amount of metal in the socket that was unaffected by the fatigue crack {{at the time of the}} accident and calculated that the wing was capable of supporting loads up to about 2.5 times the weight of the aircraft on its fatal flight. This suggested the gusting winds prevailing at the time, and the turbulence associated with the low altitude at which the aircraft was flying, were partly responsible for the failure.|$|E
2500|$|All {{aircraft}} in the UH-1 family have similar construction. [...] The UH-1H is the most-produced version, and is representative of all types. The main structure consists of two longitudinal main beams that run under the passenger cabin to the nose {{and back to the}} tail <b>boom</b> <b>attachment</b> point. The main beams are separated by transverse bulkheads and provide the supporting structure for the cabin, landing gear, under-floor fuel tanks, transmission, engine and tail boom. The main beams are joined at the lift beam, a short aluminum girder structure that is attached to the transmission via a lift link on the top and the cargo hook on the bottom and is located at the aircraft's center of gravity. The lift beams were changed to steel later in the UH-1H's life, due to cracking on high-time airframes. The semi-monocoque tail boom attaches to the fuselage with four bolts.|$|E

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 31 January 1945 Tokana was on the Essendon to Kerang leg of its regular service when the port wing {{separated}} in flight between Redesdale and Heathcote, fifty miles north of Melbourne. The aircraft then plunged to the ground, killing both crew and the full load of eight passengers. An investigation revealed that metal fatigue had developed in the wingâ€™s lower main spar <b>boom</b> <b>attachment</b> socket, the actual failure possibly being instigated by the aircraft encountering a particularly heavy gust of wind. It was the first known occurrence {{of this type of}} accident in an aircraft anywhere in the world, but it was to become a problem all too common in later years where progressively larger aircraft would be built from light-weight alloys that were more susceptible to the underlying metallurgical phenomenon. It being assumed that the same problems could occur in Binana, its certificate of airworthiness was cancelled, and the old aircraft was subsequently broken up.|$|E

40|$|Inflatable {{technology}} is under continual development and advances in high strength fibres {{have pushed the}} limitations of these structures. This has led to their application in deploying large-aperture antennas, reflectors, solar sails and more recent large-scale inflatable spacecraft such as 'Transhab' and Genesis I and II. There is ongoing research into increasing the range of capabilities of these structures by enhancing the stiffness of the deployed structure. However, the lower stiffness and inherent flexibility of these inflatable structures also allows the structure to be morphed and controlled, which can be advantageous {{for a wide variety}} of applications. Initial research has previously been performed into integrating Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) with inflatable wings for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) allowing airfoil optimization for various flight regimes. The aim of this work is to investigate the integration of shape memory alloys into inflatable structures for space applications. This article outlines ongoing research work at the University of Southampton into the field of morphing inflatable structures. Various commercially available shape memory alloys have been purchased and initially investigated to determine fundamental parameters such as maximum achievable force, power required, controllability and repeatability of the motion. These SMA's are then attached onto the side of a cantilevered inflatable cylindrical <b>boom,</b> using various <b>attachment</b> configurations, to investigate what tip deflections can be achieved for a voltage input. The tip deflection results of these configurations are presented along with an assessment of the technology and the areas of further research...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Mm Pitching moment {{generated}} by the model Inverse force measurement using a wind-driven dynamic manipulator is explored. Using system identification techniques, the WDM offers a method of measuring forces and moments on wind tunnel models during rapid, multi-axis maneuvers. Previous work has shown the measurement of dynamic stability parameters for small disturbances using the WDM. System identification {{has been used to}} construct simulations of WDM behavior in order to match desired and actual maneuver trajectories. Here the nonlinear behavior of a pitch manipulator is measured over a range of model loads and attitudes. A look-up table constructed from these data is used to measure quasi-steady forces and moments on a rectangular wing and a delta wing. The WDM is used to hold models steady in a wind tunnel under feedback control, at various attitudes. Each model is taken through a range of attitudes, and the control input needed for equilibrium is recorded. By repeating the experiment with 3 model-mounting positions, a set of 3 simultaneous equations is generated for the lift, drag and pitching moment at each angle of attack. The technique is successful in measuring the lift of a rectangular wing and a delta wing. Measurement resolution was inadequate to resolve drag and pitching moment accurately in these tests. Methods for measuring these are discussed. Continuous force measurement from repeated maneuvers is discussed. lb Length of model <b>attachment</b> <b>boom</b> (WDM pivot to model quarter chord) q Wind tunnel freestream dynamic pressur...|$|R
