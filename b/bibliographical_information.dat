6000|$|Constable's death {{might have}} been a most {{important}} thing to me if it had happened some years ago, and I should then have lamented it much. He has lived to do me some injury; yet, excepting the last £5000, I think most unintentionally. He was a prince of booksellers; his views sharp, powerful, and liberal; too sanguine, however, and, like many bold and successful schemers, never knowing when to stand or stop, and not always calculating his means to his objects with mercantile accuracy. He was very vain, for which he had some reason, having raised himself to great commercial eminence, as he might also have attained great wealth with good management. He knew, I think, more of the business of a bookseller in planning and executing popular works than any man of his time. In books themselves he had much <b>bibliographical</b> <b>information,</b> but none whatever that could be termed literary. He knew the rare volumes of his library not only by the eye, but by the touch, when blindfolded. Thomas Thomson saw him make this experiment, and, that it might be complete, placed in his hand an ordinary volume instead of one of these libri rariores. He said he had over-estimated his memory; he could not recollect that volume. Constable was a violent-tempered man with those that he dared use freedom with. He was easily overawed by people of consequence, but, as usual, took it out of those whom poverty made subservient to him. Yet he was generous, and far from bad-hearted. In person good-looking, but very corpulent latterly; a large feeder, and deep drinker, till his health became weak. He died of water in the chest, which the natural strength of his constitution set long at defiance. I have no great reason to regret him; yet I do. If he deceived me, he also deceived himself.[14] ...|$|E

40|$|The Epigraphic Database Bari project (EDB), {{started in}} 1988, {{specializes in the}} epigraphic {{documents}} by Christians of Rome between III-rd and VIII-th cent. CE {{in the framework of}} the Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy (EAGLE), to whom it participates as founding-member - with EDH and EDR - since 2004 n its first version: since 2011, the database and the related site are completely renewed. Most of these epigraphic documents were published in the Inscriptiones Christianae Vrbis Romae, nova series, voll. I-X, Pontificio Istituto di Archeologia Cristiana, in civitate Vaticana 1922 - 1992 (ICVR). EDB plains to update ICVR and to collect also the other Christian inscriptions from Rome and its suburbium published elsewhere*. The total amount of Christian inscriptions from Late Ancient Rome is estimated to be around 40, 000, although this number is increasing continually. Currently, EDB has 40654 items (online: 40475; awaiting definitive approval: 179). Every epigraphic document is accompanied by data about <b>bibliographical</b> <b>informations,</b> contexts, material, graphical and linguistic elements. The transcription of texts is obviously offered as well, and the entire document is accompanied by its estimated date of production (if possible) and short comments, when necessary. Based an agreement established between the EDB and the Papal Commission of Sacred Archeology (PCAS), a dynamic link to the Archive of the PCAS allows the visualization of pictures - if existing - of the documents. The interrogation of the database features more research criteria, both within the texts (various possibilities for textual research are featured, included a thesaurus finalized to search also aberrant forms) and in relation to the other descriptive elements of the documents. Research on the texts in Latin and Greek, within which the figurative apparatus is also described (signa Christi, symbols, various representations) can be made in combination with the other provided data...|$|R
