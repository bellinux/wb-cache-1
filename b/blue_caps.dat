Jackson insisted that Nelson make her records sound {{like those of}} label mates Gene Vincent and the <b>Blue</b> <b>Caps.</b> Nelson brought in many experienced and popular session players, including the rock-and-roll pianist Merill Moore and the then-unknown Buck Owens. With a unique vocal style and upbeat material, Jackson created {{some of the most}} influential rock and roll of the time.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ {{was well}} known for his flamboyant, {{colorful}} conduct and dress during his younger days. His trademark fashion accessory before he faded from public view in the 1970s was a silk scarf, which he wore with his black flight suit. He often raised eyebrows {{when he was the}} military prime minister by arriving at events to meet civilians with his wife in matching black flight suits, boots, <b>blue</b> <b>caps,</b> and silk scarves. He rarely was seen without a cigarette. He was notorious for his love of gambling, women, and glamour, which made American officials wary of him. One official called him an “unguided missile.” When he was a young pilot, Kỳ once landed a helicopter in the road in front of a girlfriend's house in order to impress her, causing the locals to panic and earning the ire of his commander for misusing military equipment. On one occasion, Kỳ is said to have pulled a handgun on a journalist whose questions annoyed him. Many in the South Vietnamese public service, military, and the general public hated his tempestuous and impetuous style and regarded him as a “cowboy.” and a “hooligan.” At his only public campaign appearance during the 1967 presidential election, the large crowd repeatedly heckled him loudly, calling him a “cowboy leader” and “hooligan” and as a result he did not make any more appearances at rallies.|$|E

2500|$|Another uniform {{controversy}} {{arose in}} 1994 when the Phillies introduced <b>blue</b> <b>caps</b> on Opening Day which {{were to be}} worn for home day games only. The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well among fans. A compromise was reached as the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games. In all, the Phillies wore the [...] "unlucky" [...] <b>blue</b> <b>caps</b> for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5-2 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29).
