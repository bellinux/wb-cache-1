40|$|Distributed {{electricity}} producers, such {{as small}} wind farms and solar installations, pose several technical and economic challenges in Smart Grid design. One approach to addressing these challenges is through Broker Agents who buy electricity from distributed producers, and also sell electricity to consumers, via a Tariff Market–a new market mechanism where Broker Agents publish concurrent bid and ask prices. We investigate {{the learning of}} pricing strategies for an autonomous <b>Broker</b> <b>Agent</b> to profitably participate in a Tariff Market. We employ Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning. An important concern with this method is that even simple representations of the problem domain result in very large numbers of states in the MDP formulation because market prices can take nearly arbitrary real values. In this paper, we present the use of derived state space features, computed using statistics on Tariff Market prices and <b>Broker</b> <b>Agent</b> customer portfolios, to obtain a scalable state representation. We also contribute a set of pricing tactics that form building blocks in the learned <b>Broker</b> <b>Agent</b> strategy. We further present a Tariff Market simulation model based on real-world data and anticipated market dynamics. We use this model to obtain experimental results that show the learned strategy performing vastly better than a random strategy and signifi- cantly better than two other non-learning strategies...|$|E

30|$|An {{efficient}} multi-agent {{resource allocation}} technique {{is necessary for}} building an efficient system. <b>Brokering</b> <b>agent</b> resource allocation strategy must maximize the benefit in resource allocation, {{take advantage of the}} large services offered by the federation, which can be said to realize the best quality of service provision and improve the rate of client satisfaction. Open federated cloud is a dynamic environment that is subject to several changes due to its open nature. To face such an environment, AMACE uses a self-organization property in a multi-agent system to allocate providers resources. Users, providers and brokers are considered as agents: the user (CA: a consumer <b>agent),</b> the <b>broker</b> (BA: a <b>brokering</b> <b>agent)</b> and the provider (PA: a provider agent). BA will assume the complicated task of resource allocation between the users and providers of the clouds federation. Nowadays, the world of business is a highly dynamic environment. Haresh et al. [1] considered a static model system however; we present in this paper a flexible model, with a possible evolution of the federation. New providers can be acquired to satisfy new client’s requests; other providers can leave the federation too. The model integrates interactions between <b>broker</b> <b>agents</b> organization, permitting a multi-criterion migration of a submitted customer request.|$|R

Simple broker agents provide match-making services based on the capability information volunteered by individual agents and the (recommendation) request. The problem is, even with a very good agent capability description language and a powerful match-making mechanism (such as LARKS), if the actual capability information volunteered by each individual agent is not accurate, it won’t be of much help.

40|$|Abstract. The {{realization}} of complex distributed applications, required {{in areas such}} as e-Business, e-Government, and ambient intelligence, calls for new development paradigms, such as the Service Oriented Computing approach which accommodates for dynamic and adaptive interaction schemata, carried on on a per-to-peer level. Multi Agent Systems offer the natural architectural solutions to several requirements imposed by such an adaptive approach. This work discusses the limitation of common agent patterns, typically adopted in distributed information systems design, when applied to service oriented computing, and introduces two novel agent patterns, that we call Service Oriented Organization and Implicit Organization <b>Broker</b> <b>agent</b> pattern, respectivelly. Some design aspects of the Implicit Organization <b>Broker</b> <b>agent</b> pattern are also presented. The limitations and the proposed solutions are demonstrated {{in the development of a}} multi agent system which implements a pervasive museum visitors guide. Some of the architecture and design features serve as a reference scenario for the demonstration of both the current methods limitations and the contribution of the newly proposed agent patterns and associated communication framework. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{ultimate}} goal of service matching {{is to find the}} service provider(s) that can perform tasks of given description with the best overall degree of satisfaction. However, service description matching solves only part of the problem. Agents that match a given service request description may vary greatly in the level and/or quality of services that they can perform and an agent may have strong and weak areas in its advertised service space. In this work, we take a quantitative approach in which the <b>broker</b> <b>agent</b> (match maker) considers performance rating an integral part of an agent’s capability model, captures an agent’s strong and weak areas through the interaction with the agents, and refines the agent’s capability model with the information gathered. The <b>broker</b> <b>agent</b> also dynamically builds a service distribution model that can provide vital information for determining the degree of match in cases of non-exact matches. An experimental system has been designed and implemented using OWL-S as the upper service ontology and the result statistics show significant advantage over other major levels of brokers. 1...|$|E

40|$|Service {{brokerage}} is {{a central}} issue in multi-agent platforms. When interacting directly with software agents - {{as is the case}} with common approaches at present - the user is likely to loose track of his work in the event of an increasing number of available agents. To enable the user to continue working with agents effortlessly, a facility for brokering agent services has to be introduced that lets the user select a desired service and assign it a task that will subsequently be computed by the agent offering the service. The main objective of the development of a <b>broker</b> <b>agent</b> is to conceive an agent capable of supporting the user in this respect. An agent acting as broker between user and service provider agents requires metadata about the features of services, so he is able to inform the user about the types of in- and output parameters expected by the service. Likewise, when conveying data submitted by the user to a service provider agent, both <b>broker</b> <b>agent</b> and recipient have to share knowledge about the particular meaning of a term used to mark-up the message. Thus, a practical approach to describe the characteristics of a service needs to provide a common model to describe metadata alongside a well-defined syntax and unambiguous semantics. To this extend, two standard languages for service description are discussed: the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) and the DAML Web Services Ontology (DAML-S). In comparison to WSDL, DAML-S offers the advantage of the semantic expressiveness and powerful type system of an ontology, thus making it the more favourable alternative. Necessary extensions are made to the DAML-S ontology by taking into account the specific requirements of agent-based systems. Furthermore, an agent modelling ontology is introduced that permits the specification of characteristics of service provider agents. Finally, a prototype is presented that implements the abovementioned criteria and demonstrates the benefits of deploying a <b>broker</b> <b>agent</b> in an exemplary use case. These benefits comprise: modelling agents and services by means of metadata profiles, automated brokering of services based on these profiles and user access to services independent of time, location and type of device. The work concludes by showing future enhancements that could be made to provide a flexible way to ensure transaction security in the event of a system crash, exploit inferencing techniques to better interpret services and design user interaction with the <b>broker</b> <b>agent</b> even more convenient...|$|E
