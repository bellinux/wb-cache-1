40|$|The {{delight of}} this book is the {{constant}} surprise. Lee Douglas’s physical and contemplative world is where the quotidian meets the sublime and does a hula dance. Howard W.

The poetry accesses Lee Douglas’s perspective with a curious and compelling simultaneity, akin to reading a journal and hearing internal monologue. This is a landscape where a sensei wears a cowboy hat and scrambled eggs are symptomatic of authentic being. However {{this is not an}} entirely ethereal world; the poems also create a narrative where we meet Douglas’s children, ex-wife, and even the new city <b>budget</b> <b>manager.</b> Robertson reminds the reader that living is a beautiful and terrible mystery that is best faced with humor, endurance, and love.

40|$|The {{budget process}} in the {{municipal}} organization is a complex institution in which administrations should follow the framework that the municipal council and city council has produced. Administrations then {{have the ability to}} internally distribute the framework how they want in their businesses and can determine their own internal budget process. If there are no clear rules on budget implementation process of the administration this could create differences between the administrations, since the decision makers internally in the administrations may have different views on the budget and budget process. Based on this reasoning, the research questions developed: how can the budget process in a municipality look like and what similarities and differences may exist between various levels of municipal administrations budget process in a local government. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify how the budget process in a municipal administration might look like and also identify how the budget process in a municipality can look like. The purpose of this study also wanted to investigate whether there are any similarities and differences in process between different administrations. To get as good overall picture as possible of the administrations' budget process, this study focused on the financial responsibility of each administration. Interviews were conducted with each <b>budget</b> <b>manager</b> to identify similarities and differences between them. The results from this study are summarized; the first operation in the actual submission of the framework for administrations is the same between them. Differences can then occur in how the internal administrations decide to work out a plan, the setting and action plans within businesses. There have also been differences in both the monitoring and execution. Similarities between administrations have been traced to hierarchism-building activities, interim reports and accounting systems. Differences that emerged have been traced to various administrations of activity, size and responsibilities in the operations. Differences have also been traced to what type of control each municipal administration chosen to use. Validerat; 20110627 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|When setting <b>budgets,</b> <b>managers</b> may place {{constraints}} on how resources {{can be used}} in an effort to mitigate opportunistic behavior by subordinates. These restrictions can affect the ability of the subordinate to succeed in the budgeted task, but may also have an unintended spillover effect on the ability to innovate. Using an experiment, we find that individuals working under higher budgetary constraints are more efficient in their use of budgeted resources, but are less successful in the budgeted tasks, than their counterparts working under lower budgetary constraints. Importantly, we find that imposing budgetary constraints also causes employees to subsequently generate fewer highly original and creative ideas in an unrelated activity. These findings suggest that budget structures can have unintended consequences on the innovative capabilities of organizations.

40|$|From 1997 to 1999 and 2003 to the present, Major League Baseball has had {{a luxury}} tax on high payroll teams. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of the}} tax as a budget constraint on teams’ ability to reward and retain high performing players. In contrast to other papers, we use wins above replacement (WAR), a popular sabermetrics statistic, to measure performance. Using this metric, we quantify the number of top performers, how this performance is rewarded with salary, and how salary impacts players’ mobility decisions. We conclude that when using WAR, the distribution of performance is not heavy tailed and rather follows an exponential distribution. Our results suggest that there are fewer top performers in periods with a luxury tax/budget constraint. We use efficiency wage theory to understand this decrease in top performers {{as the result of a}} decrease in motivators. We understand two different mechanisms of motivating performance: (1) under a stochastic <b>budget</b> constraint, <b>managers</b> did not choose to extend the contracts of top players; and (2) under a fixed <b>budget</b> constraint, <b>managers</b> decreased the monetary reward for an increase in performance. Both these mechanisms decrease the motivation for top talent to perform highly...|$|R
