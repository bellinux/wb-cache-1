5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on September 24, 1991. Produced by Rick Rubin, it was the band's first record released on Warner Bros. Records. The musical styles of <b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik differed notably from the techniques employed on the Chili Peppers' preceding album, Mother's Milk, and featured little use of heavy metal guitar riffs. The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death as well as themes of lust and exuberance.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> is not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
25|$|Measure your <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> regularly, {{and make}} sure that they are well {{balanced}} as the majority of complications of diabetes can be prevented by ensuring such <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> stay within normal limits.|$|R
50|$|Medications such as insulin may {{be given}} in order to lower <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b> For not so high <b>blood</b> <b>sugars,</b> oral {{treatments}} {{in the form of}} a pill or capsule {{may be given}}.|$|R
50|$|Millions {{of people}} have diabetes. When <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> are not well controlled, diabetics can quickly develop {{a wide range of}} complications. Diabetes results in {{elevated}} <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> in the body, and this environment allows viruses and bacteria to thrive.|$|R
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik {{was written}} {{at a more}} rapid pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to the Chili Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, in order to arrange song structures and guitar riffs. They would then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide what they would use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E
50|$|If <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> {{are poorly}} controlled, a mild flu can quickly turn severe, leading to {{hospitalization}} and even death. Uncontrolled <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> suppresses the immune systems and generally {{lead to more}} severe cases of the common cold or influenza. Thus, it has been recommended that diabetics are vaccinated against flu, {{before the start of}} the flu season.|$|R

5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.|$|E
5|$|One Hot Minute is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on September 12, 1995, on Warner Bros. Records. The worldwide {{success of the}} band's previous album, <b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik (1991), caused guitarist John Frusciante to become uncomfortable with their status, eventually quitting mid-tour in 1992.|$|E
5|$|One Hot Minute was a {{commercial}} disappointment despite producing three hit singles and reaching number four on the Billboard 200 chart. It sold {{fewer than half}} as many copies as <b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik and received much less critical acclaim. Navarro was ultimately fired from the band in 1998 due to creative differences.|$|E

50|$|For Type 1 diabetics {{there will}} always be a need for insulin {{injections}} throughout their life. However, both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics can see dramatic effects on their <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> through controlling their diet, and some Type 2 diabetics can fully control the disease by dietary modification. As diabetes can lead to many other complications it is critical to maintain <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> as close to normal as possible and diet is the leading factor in this level of control.|$|R
50|$|Richard K. Bernstein (born June 17, 1934) is a {{physician}} and an advocate for a low-carbohydrate diabetes diet to help achieve normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> for diabetics. Bernstein has type 1 diabetes. His private medical practice in Mamaroneck, New York is devoted solely to treating diabetes and prediabetes. He is {{a fellow of the}} American College of Nutrition, the American College of Endocrinology and The College of Certified Wound Specialists. He is the author of six books on diabetes and normalizing <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b>|$|R
5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{decreases}} high <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{primarily by}} suppressing liver glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis). The average patient with {{type 2 diabetes}} has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{endocrine}} {{conditions are}} also {{known to cause}} secondary hyperhidrosis including diabetes mellitus (especially when <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> are low), acromegaly, hyperpituitarism, and various forms of thyroid disease.|$|R
50|$|You {{have the}} right to have normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> like a healthy non diabetic, so even when you eat, your bs should stay {{constant}} (see March 2017 teleseminar).|$|R
25|$|Another way {{of energy}} {{harvesting}} {{is through the}} oxidation of <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b> These energy harvesters are called biobatteries. They {{could be used to}} power implanted electronic devices (e.g., pacemakers, implanted biosensors for diabetics, implanted active RFID devices, etc.). At present, the Minteer Group of Saint Louis University has created enzymes {{that could be used to}} generate power from <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b> However, the enzymes would still need to be replaced after a few years. In 2012, a pacemaker was powered by implantable biofuel cells at Clarkson University under the leadership of Dr. Evgeny Katz.|$|R
5|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt {{combines}} avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, {{piano and}} various effects on a four-track recorder. The album's first half, Niandra Lades, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992; during {{the recording of}} <b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik. The second half, Usually Just a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour {{in the months leading}} up to Frusciante's departure. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt sold poorly upon its release in 1994, and was taken off the market, only to be re-released in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> and low blood potassium.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies show}} that a low-carbohydrate diet or low GI diet may be {{effective}} in dietary management of type 2 diabetes, as both approaches prevent <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> from spiking after eating.|$|R
5|$|In various {{situations}} such as infection, insulin demands rise {{but are not}} {{matched by}} the failing pancreas. <b>Blood</b> <b>sugars</b> rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases further {{by way of a}} vicious circle.|$|R
50|$|Testing {{occasionally}} {{during the}} middle of the night is also important, particularly when high waking <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> are found, to determine if more insulin is needed to prevent hyperglycemia or if less insulin is needed to prevent such a rebound.|$|R
5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} <b>Blood</b> <b>Sugar</b> Sex Magik in 1991. The {{album was}} an instant hit, selling over seven million copies in the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band's newfound fame and started to dislike it. Frusciante often argued with his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in catalytic converters. Palladium {{is also used}} in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. Palladium {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is also needed to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
40|$|Current {{studies suggest}} that the control of Diabetes {{mellitus}} can be improved with home monitoring of <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b> Voice synthesizers and recent technology, allowing decoding of Touch-Tone® pulses into their digital equivalents, make it possible for diabetics with no more sophisticated equipment than a Touch-Tone® telephone to enter their <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> directly into a medical office computer. A working prototype that can provide physicians with timely, logically oriented information about their diabetics is discussed along with plans to expand this concept into giving the patients uncomplicated therapeutic advice without the need for a direct patient/physician interaction. The potential impact on health care costs and the management of other chronic diseases is presented...|$|R
5|$|The main aims in the {{treatment}} of diabetic ketoacidosis are replacing the lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing the high <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> and ketone production with insulin. Admission to an intensive care unit or similar high-dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary.|$|R
40|$|A 26 -year-old male patient {{suffering}} from Type 1 diabetes mellitus got admitted with abdominal pain and high <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b> On further evaluation, {{he was found}} to have normal anion gap metabolic acidosis without ketonuria and urinary pH was alkaline. The patient was diagnosed as Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA) (distal RTA) and was managed by alkali replacement in addition to control of <b>blood</b> <b>sugars.</b> The association of Type 1 RTA with Type 1 diabetes mellitus has been rarely reported in the literature. The association needs a different attention as diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis in such cases will be tricky. The case presented here is {{the first of its kind}} from our part of the world and second as far as English literature is concerned...|$|R
