500|$|Other {{members of}} the Enterprise crew include James Doohan as chief {{engineer}} Montgomery Scott, Walter Koenig as navigator Pavel Chekov, and Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, the communications officer. Uhura was supposed to give a dramatic speech in Klingon during the film, but midway through production the element was scrapped and a scene where Uhura is speaking garbled Klingon, surrounded by books, was added for extra humour. Nichols protested the scene, wondering why there were still books in the 23rd century, but accepted the change since {{it would be the}} last Star Trek film she would appear in. Nichols was more uncomfortable with some of the dialogue's racial undertones. Her character was originally to speak the line, [...] "Guess who's coming to dinner," [...] as the Klingons arrive on the Enterprise, but refused to say the part and it was given to Koenig's character instead. Nichols also refused to say the line [...] "yes, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like your daughter to marry one [...] ", and it was dropped from the film altogether. George Takei also returned as former helmsman Hikaru Sulu, though his character is now commander of the USS Excelsior, which includes former Enterprise yeoman Janice Rand (again played by Grace Lee Whitney) as a communications officer.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — I mean, {{you know who}} Rihanna is, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / <b>But</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your lips together and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus {{a number of things that}} give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ All the things I try to hide." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984 only, Zastava (GB) LTD {{imported}} {{small numbers}} of the Zastava 128. After that, with the company’s branding altered to “Yugo Cars”, relegating the Zastava name to the small print, Zastava (GB) LTD concentrated on selling the 101 range, branded as Yugo 311/313/511/513, and the 45/55/65 series. The cars sold steadily throughout the decade, and though they managed to avoid the dreadful reviews reserved for Lada and FSO, commentators in the British motoring press were rarely more than lukewarm in their praise of the car - a headline from 1986 read “The Yugo 55 is a good small car, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> be seen in one?” ...|$|E
