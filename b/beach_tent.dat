50|$|Since 1865 {{the first}} of several bath houses {{operated}} on the Santa Cruz beach, and in 1868 a small boardwalk was built. Swanton envisioned developing the area into a resort similar to Atlantic City, New Jersey or Coney Island near his native Brooklyn. In October 1903 he held a meeting at the courthouse and predicted shares in his enterprise would return up to 25%.On October 29, 1903 the Santa Cruz <b>Beach,</b> Cottage, and <b>Tent</b> City Corporation was formed, and over US$100,000 was raised. Swanson was Director-General (although personally invested only $250). He traveled throughout the state selling shares, eventually raising $1.5million. Existing bath houses were purchased with stock shares, and a tent city was constructed on land leased from the Southern Pacific Railway. In April 1904 the city granted an exclusive franchise for the beach to the company. Although some residents protested because the city had paid for many improvements such as extending roads, mayor David C. Clark (supported by Swanton in his election campaign) broke a tie in the city council to award the contract.|$|R
40|$|The city of Mar del Plata is {{situated}} some 400 km South of Buenos Aires, {{the capital of}} Argentina. The city has two main incomes, namely industry and tourism. In summer, beaches of this Atlantic Ocean faced destination are packed with typical Argentine <b>beach</b> <b>tents,</b> which can be rented, and {{people from all over}} Argentina come to Mar del Plata. The 600. 000 inhabitants are outnumbered 3 to 1 since almost 2 million people visit the town during the months December-February. The crowded beaches in the centre of the town cause the popularity of the more quiet and more expensive beaches south of the town. The surroundings of the beaches around Punta Mogotes, make it a good place to spend the summer. The beaches around Punta Mogotes however, are not in possession of the local or provincial government. Playas del Faro, which mean beaches of the lighthouse, is the last remaining coastline in Argentina which is private. It’s common in Argentina to give concessions for a part of the beach, so this can be exploited by the concessionaire. This concept is applied for Playas del Faro. In the south of these beaches, big erosion problems are present. The most southern concession is called Los Acantilados (‘the cliffs’), named after the cliffs and the neighbourhood which is located a few hundred of meters land inward on top of the cliffs. Once economy flourished here, but with the total disappearance of the dune and beach system in front of the cliffs prospects are bad. With the provincial road and houses some hundred meters away, safety is not an issue. The biggest problem therefore is the lack of beach, which needs to be solved. The erosion is caused by a few reasons. The most important one is the lack of sand input from the south. The wave climate causes an average long shore current over the year from the south to the north. The city of Miramar, located 15 km south of Mar del Plata has had erosion problems since {{the early years of the}} previous century and has been constructing counter measures ever since. Further north of Miramar more groyne systems, the one more effective then the other, can be found. The most northern groyne is a rather large groyne of over two hundred meters situated in front of the house of the president. From this point to the research area of Los Acantilados no beaches, except some small pocket beaches, but only high cliffs can be found. Another reason for the erosion is the presence of heavy storms. Local experts say that in a year with more storms then usual, erosion is even worse. This problem is related with the problem above, as well as with the presence of human interference in the dune system. With no input of sand into the system, the sediment, which is placed on the fore shore by a storm, is immediately picked up by the long shore current instead of being transported back on the beaches by the waves of a milder wave climate. Three main solutions are possible for this problem: periodical nourishment, detached breakwaters and a groyne scheme. Nourishment itself is a nice solution with little negative effects. However it is expensive when compared with the construction of groins. The local quarry {{is situated}} less then 12 km from Los Acantilados. Constructing a groyne from shore is therefore six times less expensive then building a detached breakwater with the use of floating equipment. Besides the financial factor the groyne scheme has the advantage of being a more ‘permanent’ solution although having negative erosion effects downstream. After thorough consideration it was decided to design a groyne scheme. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Escolheu-se a Praia do Futuro para o desenvolvimento deste estudo, em virtude de sua importÃncia para a dinÃmica da atividade turÃstica local e tambÃm por ser um dos principais pontos de lazer buscado pelos fortalezenses. Os freqÃentadores da Praia do Futuro sÃo seduzidos pela beleza do ambiente litorÃneo e pelas diversas atraÃÃes e serviÃos incorporados Ã Ãrea. Destaca-se tambÃm como espaÃo de uso diversificado e dinÃmica diferenciada das outras praias da Capital cearense. A relevÃncia do tema refere-se Ã importÃncia do estudo da maritimidade e da anÃlise das atividades de lazer na cidade de Fortaleza. O objetivo deste trabalho Ã analisar se os banhos de mar na Praia do Futuro ainda constituem fator {{relevante}} na procura por lazer e de que forma a prÃtica ou nÃo destes banhos de mar contribui para a construÃÃo deste espaÃo geogrÃfico. A esta anÃlise alia-se um entendimento das prÃticas marÃtimas modernas no litoral de Fortaleza. Recorre-se a uma anÃlise diacrÃnica como percurso metodolÃgico para o estudo dos banhos de mar na Praia do Futuro, mediante uma recuperaÃÃo histÃrica desta prÃtica atÃ os dias atuais. Por conseguinte, constata-se que a busca pelos banhos de mar foi proporcionada a partir da pressÃo do adensamento urbano das praias no trecho Iracema-Mucuripe, sendo facilitado o acesso Ã Praia do Futuro atravÃs da abertura de vias. Com o aumento do nÃmero de freqÃentadores, instalam-se as barracas de praia e novas atividades de lazer sÃo incorporadas. Com isso, os banhos de mar deixam de ser {{a principal}} motivaÃÃo para a procura desta Ãrea, embora continuem sendo praticados. Assim, estas mudanÃas refletiram-se na maneira como o freqÃentador local passou a utilizar o mar como opÃÃo de lazer. O estudo dos banhos de mar na Praia do Futuro proporcionou uma anÃlise mais aprofundada da dinÃmica e organizaÃÃo espacial desta Ãrea, que vai alÃm da simples prÃtica ou abandono de determinadas atividades, conduziu Ã compreensÃo de uma dinÃmica socioespacial intensa, pois, alÃm de serem inÃmeras as atividades desenvolvidas, tambÃm estÃo inseridos neste processo interesses diferenciados. The work âA cidade e o mar: as prÃticas marÃtimas modernas e a construÃÃo do espaÃo da Praia do Futuro (Fortaleza-CearÃ-Brasil) â analyzes how the practical of bathing beach became {{common in the}} current days, starting from the nitial reflection, with the understanding of searching for this leisure activity contributes, in definitive places, for its occupation and space organization. Praia do Futuro as chosen {{for the development of}} this study, in face of its importance for the dynamic of the local tourist activity and also for being one of the main points of leisure searched for {{the people who live in}} Fortaleza. The frequenters of the Praia do Futuro are seduced by the beauty of the littoral environment and by the diverse attractions and incorporated services to the area. It is also distinguished as differentiated dynamic space of diversified use from other beaches of the capital CearÃ state. The relevance of the subject refers to the importance of the study of the maritime and the analysis of the leisure activities in Fortaleza. The purpose of this work is to analyze if the bathing beach in Praia do Futuro still constitutes an excellent factor when youâre looking for a leisure activity and it these baths can contribute or not for the construction of this geographic space. An agreement of the modern maritime activities in the coast of Fortaleza is added to this analysis. A diacronic analysis is appealed to as methodologic passage for the study of the bathing beach in Praia do Futuro, by means of a historical recovery of this practical until the current days. Therefore, it is evidenced that the search for the bathing beach in Praia do Futuro was proportionated from the pressure of the hugeness urban of beaches in the Iracema- Mucuripe intinery, being facilitated by the access to Praia do Futuro through the opening of ways. With the increase of the number of frequenters, <b>beach</b> <b>tents</b> are installed and new leisure activities are incorporated. With this, the bathing beach stops being the main motivation for the search of this area, though itâs still practised. Thus, these changes reflected the way as the local frequenters started using the sea as a leisure option. The study of bathing beach in Praia do Futuro has provided a deeper analysis of the dynamic and space organization of this area, that goes beyond simple practical or the abandonment of determined activities, has led to the understanding of an intense social-space dynamic, herefore, beyond being innumerable the developed activities, differentiated interests are also inserted in this process...|$|R
60|$|The King {{was very}} proud of this longship. It had {{recently}} been built by him, {{and was one of the}} largest that had ever been seen in Norway. The exact dimensions of it are not now known, but we know that it had thirty-two banks for rowers, from which we may infer that it must have been of nearly the same size with the Long Serpent, a war vessel of thirty-four banks, which was built about the end of the tenth century, and some of the dimensions of which are given in the Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson. The length of her keel that rested on the grass, we are told, was about 111 feet, which is not far short of the length of the keel of one of our forty-two gun frigates. As these warships were long in proportion to their breadth, like our modern steamers, this speaks to a size approaching 400 tons burden. As we have said, the Dragon was a gorgeous vessel. It had a high poop and forecastle, a low waist, or middle part, and a splendidly gilt and painted stern, figurehead, and tail. The sides, which were, as usual, hung round with the red and white painted shields of the crew, were pierced for sixty-four oars, that is, thirty-two on each side, being two oars to each bank or bench, and as there were three men to each oar, this gave a total crew of 192 men; but in truth the vessel contained, including steersmen and supernumeraries, above 200 men. Under the feet of the rowers, in the waist, were chests of arms, piles of stones to be used as missiles, provisions, clothing, goods, and stores, all of which were protected by a deck of movable hatches. On this deck the crew slept at nights, sheltered by an awning or sail, when it was not convenient for them to land and sleep on the <b>beach</b> in their <b>tents,</b> with which all the vessels of the Norsemen were usually supplied. There was but one great mast, forty feet high, and one enormous square sail to this ship. The mast was tipped with gilding, and the sail was of alternate strips of red, white, and blue cloth. Each space between the banks served as the berth of six or eight men, and was divided into half berths--starboard and larboard--for the men who worked the corresponding oars. On the richly ornamented poop stood the King himself, surrounded by his bodyguard and chief men of the Court, including Jarl Rongvold and Thiodolph the scald. From the stem to the mid-hold was the forecastle, on which were stationed the King's berserkers, under Hake of Hadeland. All the men of Hake's band were splendid fellows; for King Harald, having a choice of men from the best of every district, took into his house troop only such as were remarkable for strength, courage, and dexterity in the use of their weapons.|$|R
