Thirteen cirrhotic subjects with subclinical neurophysiological or cognitive alterations were studied. A total of 3 mg of flumazenil or saline was infused intravenously. Before and after the infusion, the number connection test was administered and <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> recorded. After 72 h, patients were crossed over.

The data on thresholds of the BAERs registered to acoustic stimuli in the event of air and bone conduction obtained in this study are comparable; hearing thresholds in the event of acoustic stimulation by means of a bone vibrator correlates with the results of the BAERs registered to the stimuli transmitted by means of air conduction earphones (r = 0. 9).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionObstructive {{sleep apnea}} causes changes in normal sleep architecture, fragmenting it chronically with {{intermittent}} hypoxia, leading to serious health consequences {{in the long}} term. It is believed that the occurrence of respiratory events during sleep, such as apnea and hypopnea, can impair the transmission of nerve impulses along the auditory pathway that are highly dependent on the supply of oxygen. However, this association is not well established in the literature. ObjectiveTo compare the evaluation of peripheral auditory pathway and brainstem among individuals with and without obstructive sleep apnea. MethodsThe sample consisted of 38 adult males, mean age of 35. 8 (± 7. 2), divided into four groups matched for age and Body Mass Index. The groups were classified based on polysomnography in: control (n= 10), mild obstructive sleep apnea (n= 11) moderate obstructive sleep apnea (n= 8) and severe obstructive sleep apnea (n= 9). All study subjects denied a history of risk for hearing loss and underwent audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex and <b>Brainstem</b> <b>Auditory</b> <b>Evoked</b> <b>Response.</b> Statistical analyses were performed using three-factor ANOVA, 2 -factor ANOVA, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test. The significance level for all tests was 5 %. ResultsThere {{was no difference between}} the groups for hearing thresholds, tympanometry and evaluated <b>Brainstem</b> <b>Auditory</b> <b>Evoked</b> <b>Response</b> parameters. An association was observed between the presence of obstructive sleep apnea and changes in absolute latency of wave V (p= 0. 03). There was an association between moderate obstructive sleep apnea and change of the latency of wave V (p= 0. 01). ConclusionThe presence of obstructive sleep apnea is associated with changes in nerve conduction of acoustic stimuli in the auditory pathway in the brainstem.

Sensorineural hearing loss represent one of the serious neurodevelopmental sequelae among preterm infants. <b>Brainstem</b> <b>Auditory</b> <b>Evoked</b> <b>Responses</b> (BAER) is a noninvasive electrophysiological method for assessing the maturation of auditory system in newborn. MATERIALS AND METHODS <b>Brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> of 70 infants (35 preterm and 35 term) were recorded to analyse the impact of prematurity.

RESULTS The absolute latencies I, III, V and interpeak I-III, I-V were significantly prolonged among preterm babies (P value < 0. 05). There was a significant increase in absolute latencies I, III, V and IPL I-III among preterm babies with comorbidities (P value < 0. 05).

Seven neonates had abnormal BAER. Wave complex IV-V was absent in eight record-ings in NHB group {{while they were}} normal {{in the control group}} (p < 0. 001). Prolongation of laten-cy of waves I and V and interwave conduction time (wave I-V) occurred in jaundiced infants especially when unconjugated serum bilirubin level rose above 22 mg/dl. The abnormalities in BAER reversed to normal in all seven neonates after exchange blood transfusion indicating transient nature of bilirubin toxicity to the brain. All seven neonates in the study and control group had normal hearing, development quo-tient and were free of neurological sequelae on follow up for one year. Key words: <b>Brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> (BAER), Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NHB), Development quotient (DQ). Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NHB) is a common problem affecting 5 - 6 % of new-born babies. Persistence of high levels of unconjugated bilirubin for a long duration may lead to neurologic sequelae among the survivors(l). There is no single level of bil-irubin which warrants active intervention in the form of phototherapy or exchange blood transfusion. <b>Brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> (BAER) provide useful information regard-ing the neuro-physiological status of the 8 th nerve, the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary nucleus, lateral leminiscus and the inferior colliculus in the brainstem(2 - 4).

To gain new {{insights}} into the influence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia on the immature brain and to detect abnormalities, we studied the functional integrity of the brainstem in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. METHODS. Forty-one very preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were studied at postconceptional ages of 37 to 42 weeks. Brainstem auditory evoked responses were recorded and analyzed by using the maximal length sequence technique. RESULTS. Compared with term control subjects, wave V latency in the maximal length sequence <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> of the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased significantly at all 91 to 910 clicks per second rates. Similarly, I 9 ̆ 6 V and particularly III 9 ̆ 6 V interpeak intervals increased significantly. The III 9 ̆ 6 V/I 9 ̆ 6 III interval ratio also increased significantly at all click rates. All of these abnormalities became more significant as the click rate was increased. Compared with healthy, very preterm control subjects, all of these maximal length sequence <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> variables increased significantly at all click rates, although the differences between the 2 groups were slightly smaller than those between the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and the term control subjects. The wave I and III latencies and I 9 ̆ 6 III interval in the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia did not show any abnormalities. The slopes of the wave V latency-rate function and I 9 ̆ 6 V and particularly III 9 ̆ 6 V interval-rate functions for the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were significantly steeper than those for both term and healthy, very preterm control subjects. The slope of the III 9 ̆ 6 V/I 9 ̆ 6 III interval ratio-rate function for the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia was also significantly steeper than those for the 2 control groups. CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest poor myelination and synaptic function of the brainstem in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, resulting in impaired functional integrity.

50|$|Since {{cortical}} deafness and auditory agnosia have many similarities, diagnosing the disorder {{proves to be}} difficult. Bilateral lesions near the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are important criteria. Cortical deafness requires demonstration that <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> responses arenormal, but cortical evoked potentials are impaired. <b>Brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> potentials (BAEP), {{also referred to as}} <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> (BAER) show the neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one microvolt. The latency of the responses gives critical information: if {{cortical deafness}} is applicable, LLR (long-latency responses) are completely abolished and MLR (middle latency responses) are either abolished or significantly impaired. In auditory agnosia, LLRs and MLRs are preserved.|$|R
