30|$|The German Accounting Law Modernization Act {{significantly}} increased disclosure requirements {{to guarantee that}} certain information was included in financial statements. Therefore, we investigate disclosure compliance for two important changes in German GAAP. First, we extend our prior investigation of companies’ R&D activities, since capitalizing companies must provide mandatory disclosures related to their R&D activities in their notes. Second, we randomly select 300 companies and investigate their disclosures for other provisions, which are found in a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> whose measurement principles fundamentally changed after {{the adoption of the}} requirements. For both investigations, we find substantial variation in disclosure compliance.|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{different}} profit and loss of previous years, which is first introduced in the Czech legislation in 2013 {{when there was a}} change in the reporting of significant corrections of mistakes in costs (returns), changes in the method and the first accounting for deferred tax from the resultant method to the balance, which does not affect the profit of the current period. In practical terms, the thesis deals with ways of reporting the different profit and loss of previous years' operations in the statements of individual entities. The result of the examination is the correctness of compliance with statutory requirements in the reporting of the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item,</b> especially with respect to the explanatory comment in the notes to the financial statements...|$|E

Other provisions offer an appropriate possibility to investigate companies’ willingness to disclose information because § 285 (12) German GAAP only provides the vague formulation that companies must disclose more information on specific other provisions when there is no separate presentation in the balance sheet and recent other provisions are worth a substantial amount. The term “substantial” is open to interpretation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to formulate and model a multi period scenario optimisation problem and to obtain recommendations for optimal <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> portfolio. To do this the study gathers data from the public financial statements of the case company Aktia PLC, explains the relevant framework and model specifications, describes the actual optimisation model and finally presents the analysis of the results. The process combines many aspects of finance, decision making and optimisation. The portfolio optimisation problem is done over multiple periods with simulated future scenarios by formulating a tree representing the possible future outcomes. The academic background combines aspects from information management and finance. The frameworks are selected from several different journals and fields in business studies and economics. The study explains the theoretical framework around the main topics of financial portfolio management, decision making and scenario optimisation. For the methodology the thesis aims to form qualitative research on the theories behind the model and the case company data in the form of literature review. The more quantitative research is done on the actual optimisation model and the analysis of these results. The case company was selected to allow for quantitative research and to show that the model works in real life. The results from the model conclude with an optimal solution and a suggestion for changes made in one year for the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> portfolio. The results were heavily affected by the inputs and thus different solutions could be obtained easily. The base line model performed very well in comparison to other options. When comparing to the actual realisation for the most recently published data, the model showed a slight reduction in profits with the strong positive effect on balance sheet growth. In this solution the profits were 2 384 000 € lower in the model than those observed in year 2013 but the balance sheet total was 1 959 281 000 € larger...|$|E

It is true assets are very important in a firm but it is not easy to adjust the value of the assets in the balance sheet to get the net asset because of the obvious differences between the historical cost of the assets and their current market value. To incorporate asset variables in model (ii), equity value was ascertained by subtracting long-term debt (<b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item)</b> from firm value. Model (ii) therefore which recognizes the contributions of assets in earning potentials of a firm appears to be better than the model that recognizes earnings alone.

Annual reports from before the year 2005 have all been formulated according to Dutch and German GAAP. From the year 2005 onwards Dutch and German listed companies have been obliged to report according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Also I have engaged more specifically into the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> ‘Provisions’.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse credit-related {{practices}} of Islamic banks in Turkey in comparison with theory. Here, ‘credit-related practices’ are, first, the bank <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> called ‘loans’ in general, and second, loans in terms of their types. By ‘theory’ we mean Islamic economics. In attaining the {{aim of this}} paper, we use comparative methodology depending on quantitative and qualitative research. In this context, we utilize quantitative methods like collecting calculating and representing -through figures and charts- relevant data, and qualitative methods such as searching through, selecting, summarizing and evaluating relevant literature and documents like agreements and reports concerning the subject. Some of the outstanding results of this paper are as follows; loans are the dominant use of funds for Turkish Islamic banks with changing ratios between 60 - 75 % for the period of December 2005 -June 2015 and the main method used for loans is murabahah with 99. 7 % as of June 2015. Secondly, 91 % of household loans are in the form of consumer credits as of June 2015, among which house loans are sweepingly dominant.

After the studies of requirements set in Latvia concerning the recognition and accounting of investment property it was established that it is permitted {{to carry out the}} evaluation and accounting of these assets, after their initial recognition, according to several methods. Thus in Latvia, {{as well as at the}} international level the problem is – which accounting policy should be chosen for the evaluation and accounting of investment property. The aim of the research is to perform the comparative analysis of accounting policy adopted in Latvia and internationally regarding the investment property and to develop suggestions for its improvement. The research methodology is based on the comparative analysis of the requirements set in the documents regulating accounting in Latvia, the European Union Directives regulating accounting and the International Accounting Standards. The paper covers also the analysis of authors’ conclusions, publications in the periodicals, the results of the survey of the members of the Accountants’ Association of the Republic of Latvia, and other bibliographic sources. The authors of the research draw a conclusion that there had been several requirements set in the documents regulating accounting in Latvia, which only partially comply with the regulations adopted internationally regarding the recognition, evaluation and accounting of investment property. At the end of research, the authors have developed suggestions for the improvement of investment property accounting policy in Latvia...|$|E

40|$|Cash pooling is a {{bank service}} that allows {{corporates}} to externalise the intra-group cash management, and thus manage their global liquidity effectively with lower costs. Although {{there is little}} quantitative information on {{the significance of the}} phenomenon, cash pooling appears to have become increasingly popular after the onset of the financial crisis when, in an environment characterised by limited access to capital markets, reduced bank lending, low returns and higher risks on banks' deposits, corporate groups started to maximise their use of internal sources of financing. In particular, cash pooling is currently very relevant in Western and Northern European countries, and is mainly offered in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. This paper first analyses cash pooling agreements with a focus on the aspects that are relevant from a statistical viewpoint. It then addresses their statistical recording in compliance with ESA 2010 and, specifically, the methodological framework of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> statistics. It is proposed that positions related to cash pooling shall be recorded on a gross basis vis- 0 -vis the actual beneficiaries and obligors of the corresponding accounts. However, the proposed treatment goes beyond MFI balance sheet statistics and affects other data domains as well, ranging from financial accounts to balance of payments and international investment positions. While the statistical approach may seem straightforward, applying it in practice is more difficult, not least because of the treatment of cash pooling contracts in accounting terms. The analysis is complemented by numerical examples and also includes data for the Netherlands, which show the importance of clarifying the statistical treatment of cash pooling in light of the large impact it may have on macroeconomic aggregates...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called on firms to provide new MD 2 ̆ 6 A {{disclosures}} about their critical accounting estimates. The new disclosures outline how reasonably likely changes in firms 2 ̆ 7 highly uncertain accounting estimates would affect earnings. Because the new disclosure practice potentially highlights accrual estimates with a reduced level of reliability (i. e. greater estimation error) arising from {{uncertainty in the}} accrual measurement process, I examine whether {{the presence of a}} critical accounting estimate (CAE) disclosure partially explains cross-sectional variation in the value relevance of balance sheet items. Using a sample of non-financial and non-utility S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 firms from 2004 to 2009, I find the value relevance of a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> is negatively associated with the presence of a related CAE disclosure. To corroborate my value relevance findings, I also examine whether the predictive value of accruals with respect to future cash flows and accrual noise, which are two accounting-based characteristics of useful accounting information, are associated with the presence of a CAE disclosure. I find the incremental predictive value of accruals with respect to future cash flows (accrual noise) is negatively (positively) associated with the presence of a CAE disclosure. Overall, these results suggest investors perceive balance sheet items accompanied by a related, account-specific CAE disclosure to have lower reliability, and consistent with investors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, accrual estimates have less predictive value and are noisier when these disclosures are present. Other findings indicate that the magnitude of estimation error and disclosure complexity {{play a role in the}} extent to which investors reduce their reliability perceptions in the presence of a CAE disclosure...|$|E
40|$|The {{realisation}} {{that management}} today is increasingly about managing intangible resources {{is beginning to}} dawn on business managers and academics alike.

This study is investigative of this knew phenomena, and are backed by a comprehensive literature review and empirical study. The literature gives an overview of who entrepreneurs are, as they are the only creators of job opportunities in the South African economy. Secondly, the focus moves to the high failure rates of SMME's and how can they successfully apply for finance. Thirdly, credit evaluation are taken under investigation, and the role commercial banks can play to be more innovative when deciding on approval of a application, as well as the role of intellectual capital in the credit evaluation process. The empirical study consist of two questionnaires that was e-mailed to respondents, as well as personal interviews were held. Fifty commercial clients and 10 credit managers of the five biggest commercial banks in South Africa formed part of this study. The objective of this study was to determine if South African Commercial banks do take intellectual capital in consideration during the credit evaluation process. Recommendations are also made on how commercial banks can be more innovative to adhere to their clients needs. This study is of value not only for Commercial banks, but also for entrepreneurs who want to know what criteria commercial banks use to make a financial decision.
