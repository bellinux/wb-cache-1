40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of an extraction of the 2 nd-order nonlinear responses from model test data. Emphasis is given on the effects of assumptions made for the Gaussian and non-Gaussian input on the estimation of the 2 nd-order response, employing the quadratic Volterra model. The effects of sea severity and data length on the estimation of response are also investigated at the same time. The data sets used in this study are surge forces on a fixed barge, a surge motion of a compliant mini TLP (Tension Leg Platform), and surge forces on a fixed and truncated column. Sea states are used from rough sea (Hs= 3 m) to high sea (Hs= 9 m) for a <b>barge</b> <b>case,</b> very rough sea (Hs= 3. 9 m) for a mini TLP, and phenomenal sea (Hs= 15 m) for a truncated column. After the estimation of the response functions, the outputs are reconstructed and the 2 nd order nonlinear responses are extracted with all the QTF distributed in the entire bifrequency domain. The reconstituted time series are compared with the experiment in both the time and frequency domains. For the effects of data length on the estimation of the response functions, 3, 15, and 40 - hour data were investigated for a barge, but 3 -hour data was used for a mini TLP and a fixed and truncated column due to lack of long data. The effects of sea severity on the estimation of the response functions are found in both methods. The non-Gaussian method for estimation is more affected by data length than the Gaussian method...|$|E
40|$|In {{the need}} for more green energy a {{prominent}} role is reserved for wind energy. Offshore wind energy in deeper waters capitalises on more efficient wind properties and increased public acceptance compared to onshore wind energy and wind farms close to shore. In the coming years the offshore wind market is expected to evolve rapidly, especially in the deeper water range of thirty to sixty meter. In a business case preceding to this study as first reference a jacket type substructure was designed for a 6 MW turbine in a water depth of sixty meter. The goal of this thesis is to reduce the cost of this reference design in total use of material and assembly. Also the transportation and installation of the substructure are taken in consideration. First a step back is taken to reconsider the structural concept of the reference design. Several substructure concepts, like tripods and straight-leg jackets, have passed the review and firstly qualitative weighed against primary criteria in a Multi Criteria Analysis and subsequently by FEM based in-place analysis. The outcome of the total substructure weight and natural frequency with respect to frequency of wave loading and turbine excitement determined the decision to further investigate a three-leg and four-leg battered jacket. Thereto a fatigue analysis was performed. The calculation method used at the original reference design to determine the total fatigue damage due to turbine and wave loading was proven to be too optimistic and therefore modified. In relation to the reference design several optimisations have been proposed, including applying a horizontal brace just above mudline level, applying double sided butt welds and adopting K-bracing instead of X-bracing. Here the four enclosed pictures can be placed. (number 1 upmost left, number 4 upmost right) Finally, four designs have been worked out; the reference design (without optimisations), an optimised four-leg jacket, four-leg jacket with k-braces and a three-leg jacket. The total assembling cost of each design is calculated by considering the handling time and the welding volume with corresponding welding time of each weld. Together with the material use the total fabrication cost is assessed. The jacket shall be transported offshore by a standard North Sea barge. The dimensions of this barge potentially enable the transportation of three four-leg jackets and four three-leg jackets. Depending on the wind farm location this may lead to reduction of one tug and transport <b>barge</b> <b>case</b> of the three-leg jacket. Further consequence of the three-leg jacket is that a foundation pile less needs to be driven. Thereto is the installation time of the three-leg jacket reduced, resulting in less installation cost. By combining fabrication, transport and installation cost it is possible to compute an overview for substructures cost in a complete wind farm. Final conclusion is that the fabrication cost are decisive compared to the installation and transport cost. The four-leg jacket with K-braces {{turns out to be the}} most inexpensive design, respectively followed by the thee-leg jacket, the optimised four-leg jacket and the reference design. It is expected that the four-leg jacket with K-braces brings total cost reduction of approximately nine percent compared to the reference design.

40|$|This study {{presents}} laboratory {{observations of}} flow characteristics for regular waves passing a rectangular barge in a two dimensional wave tank. The rectangular barge was fixed and free to roll (one degree of freedom) in a beam sea. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{was employed to}} measure the velocity field {{in the vicinity of}} the structure. The mean velocity and turbulence properties were obtained by phase-averaging the velocity profiles from repeated test runs. The quantitative flow characteristics were represented to elucidate the coupled interactions between the regular wave and the barge in roll motion or fixed condition. Additionally, the turbulence properties including the turbulence length scale and the turbulent kinetic energy budget were investigated to characterize the flow pattern due to the wave interaction. Because all the data including wave elevations, roll motion, and dynamic pressure were synchronized with velocity profiles, the results between the roll motion and the fixed condition were compared. The viscous effects due to the flow separation depend on the relative relation between the wave water particle motion and the roll motion of the barge. The viscous damping mechanism that reduces the roll motion at the roll natural period wave is illustrated. It shows that the vortex flow was mainly induced by the roll motion. For wave periods longer than the roll natural period, the flow was separated in different directions accompanying the roll natural period wave. The longer waves may help the roll motion with the vortex flow predominantly separated by the wave water particle motion rather than the barge motion. This may be called the viscous exciting effect. Moreover, the variations of dynamic pressures near the corners were measured and analyzed along with the viscous effect for both the roll motion and the fixed <b>barge</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Floating {{structures}} use {{mooring system}} for station keeping in any water depths. Mooring {{system is a}} vital component {{for the safety of}} floating structures. Mooring accidents can cause serious injury or damage to the vessel, and hence it is necessary to establish a systematic risk-based decision making for safety assessment of mobile mooring system. This study uses the mobile mooring system of a semi submersible pipe laying <b>barge</b> as a <b>case</b> study. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a Methodology for Investigation of Critical Hazards (MIVTA), which is carried out by the development of preliminary risk analysis using HAZOP (Hazard and Operability), to generate the root causes using FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and to construct the sequence of the consequences using ETA (Event Tree Analysis). HAZOP is a systematic examination of a system helpful to identify and evaluate the risks related to accidents/incidents in mooring system. FTA is a deductive method useful to generate the potential causes of mooring system failure into undesired events. ETA is an inductive method helpful to define all possible outcomes of accidental events. This study conducts risk-based decision making coupled with the knowledge of the experts of mooring system to identify the root causes, to evaluate the frequency of failure and to classify their class of consequences. This study provides a systematic methodology guideline for the risk-based decisio...|$|R
40|$|The modern {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} a rapidly developing sector of the fisheries industry. Among the fish species reared in marine waters Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) shares a significant part. Nowadays, the largest salmon producing countries are Norway, Chile and Scotland. The common technology used in the salmon production is a sea cage, which is presented in a form of floating plastic rings or robust metal installations fastened to a <b>barge.</b> In both <b>cases,</b> the fish {{is placed in the}} net in the open sea, and therefore, production is highly dependent on the external factors, such as environmental conditions, disease and parasites presence. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have been used to supply smolts for further production of market-size salmon at sea. Nowadays, this system is suggested to provide the whole production cycle from smolt- to market-size in the closed environment with optimal biological conditions. Nonetheless, the existing projects require higher initial investment costs than the conventional net pen farm. In the present work, comparison analysis of net pen system and RAS has been performed {{on the basis of the}} economic analysis of salmon aquaculture farm suggested by Trond Bjørndal and Frank Asche in “The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture”, 2 nd edition (2011) and report “Profitability analysis of the NIRI technology for land-based salmon farming” (2008) by Krisin Roll, Arve Gravdal and Asbjørn Bergheim. The analysis includes compilation of biological and bio-economical models for the both systems. Missing or out-of-date information has been replaced by new data from additional sources such as research articles, industrial reports and expert opinions. The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are the main measures that have been used in analysis. The overall conclusion from the comparison has shown that RAS is around 12 mil NOK less profitable than net pen farm in ten years time horizon, while NPV in both cases is positive. However, other findings from the research revealed an unreliability of the scaling method in respect to RAS, without detailed description of the farm production capacity and equipment. Besides, investment costs estimation is dependent on many factors that are complex and require a thorough investigation. At the same time, in spite of scientific and industrial analyses show lower impact on the environment from RAS in comparison to the net pen aquaculture system, it may be questioned in terms of RAS location and power source use...|$|R
