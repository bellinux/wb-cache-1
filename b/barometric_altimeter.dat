25|$|A radio {{altimeter}} measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft. This type of altimeter provides {{the distance between}} the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeter</b> which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the {{radio altimeter}}. However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} altimeter, {{also known}} as the <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeter,</b> is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. [...] As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. [...] The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|E
500|$|While {{they waited}} for the guns to be {{fabricated}} by the Naval Gun Factory, various propellants were tested. Hirschfelder sent John L. Magee to the Bureau of Mines' Experimental Mine at Bruceton, Pennsylvania to test the propellant and ignition system. Test firing was conducted at the Anchor Ranch with a /50 caliber gun. This allowed the fine-tuning of the testing instrumentation. The first two tubes arrived at Los Alamos on 10 March 1944, and test firing began at the Anchor Ranch under the direction of Thomas H. Olmstead, who had experience in such work at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia. The primers were tested and found to work at pressures up to [...] Brode's group investigated the fusing systems, testing radar altimeters, proximity fuses and <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeter</b> fuses.|$|E

50|$|The {{second problem}} was {{determining}} the aircraft's altitude, as the <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeters</b> then in use lacked sufficient accuracy. Two spotlights were mounted, one under the aircraft's nose {{and the other}} under the fuselage, so that at the correct height their light beams would converge {{on the surface of}} the water. The crews practised at the Eyebrook Reservoir, near Uppingham, Rutland; Abberton Reservoir near Colchester; Derwent Reservoir; and Fleet Lagoon on Chesil Beach. Wallis's bomb itself was first tested at the Elan Valley Reservoirs.|$|R
500|$|Normally, {{bombs are}} cheap and fuses are {{relatively}} expensive, but {{an atomic bomb}} is extremely expensive, and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within [...] of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeter</b> fuses. Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons. In the end, a modified APS-13 Monica tail warning radar known as [...] "Archie" [...] was employed, and the fuses performed flawlessly in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

5000|$|BLEU {{knew that}} an ideal system would require {{components}} {{based on the}} ground and in aircraft. The former system would have to consist of a signal without the land use problems of the cable-based system or the accuracy issues of ILS. All incoming aircraft would need to be equipped with a sensor to receive the signal, a super-precise altimeter, and a reliable autopilot. [...] The <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeters</b> in use at the time were only capable of providing a rough estimate of altitude, so BLEU developed a plane-based radar altimeter to complement its beam so planes knew when to flare up for landing.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{altimeters}} {{measure the}} relative pressure {{difference between the}} lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground. Within the United States and Canada, these readings are provided in inches of mercury. Ground readings vary with weather and along {{the route of the}} aircraft as it travels, so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control. Aircraft operating at higher altitudes (at or above what is called the transition altitude, which varies by country) set their <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeters</b> to a standard pressure of 29.92 inHg (1 atm = 29.92 inHg) or 1013.25 hPa (1 hPa = 1 mbar) regardless of the actual sea level pressure. The resulting altimeter readings are known as flight levels.|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{was analyzed}} of the <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeters</b> onboard {{the space shuttle}} orbiter. Altitude estimates from the air data systems including the operational instrumentation and the developmental flight instrumentation were obtained {{for each of the}} approach and landing test flights. By comparing the barometric altitude estimates to altitudes derived from radar tracking data filtered through a Kalman filter and fully corrected for atmospheric refraction, the errors in the barometric altitudes were shown to be 4 to 5 percent of the Kalman altitudes. By comparing the altitude determined from the true atmosphere derived from weather balloon data to the altitude determined from the U. S. Standard Atmosphere of 1962, it was determined that the assumption of the Standard Atmosphere equations contributes roughly 75 percent of the total error in the baro estimates. After correcting the barometric altitude estimates using an average summer model atmosphere computed for the average latitude of the space shuttle landing sites, the residual error in the altitude estimates was reduced to less than 373 feet. This corresponds to an error of less than 1. 5 percent for altitudes above 4000 feet for all flights...|$|R
40|$|To {{solve this}} problem the authors have {{developed}} a digital automated air pressure control system (ACS) based on automatic frequency pressure selector, which is different from air-operated ones {{due to the fact}} that it is a nonlinear system of automatic stabilization with the relay servo mechanism and adaptive control with high levels of accuracy, reliability and high-speed performance. An optimization of digital ACS of barometric pressure measuring equipment has been conducted, including aircraft <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeters</b> (BA), with its optimal accuracy and speed, with the desired transition process of providing one-way transition process without sacrificing the accuracy. The results can be used for the synthesis of high-speed automated control system, calibration and verification. Optimization of relay digital automated control system of measuring air pressure, optimal according to the criteria of accuracy and speed, with the desired one-way transition process has been carried out in order to remove BA variations indications. Optimization of the accuracy, speed and one-way transition process of the system (multi-criteria optimization problem) allowed choosing the relay servo mechanism as a result. Scientific novelty is that developed algorithm of ACS is of optimal performance, and operates in medium and low vacuum, which establishes a one-way approach to a given level of pressure without sacrificing accuracy. For a complete analysis of dynamic processes in the frequency ACS, including analog (pneumatic, mechanical, electrical) and digital conversions, a comprehensive mathematical model of dynamic processes in ACS has been developed. ????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????????????????? ????????, ??????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????????? ? ???????, ??????????? ?? ????????, ?????????? ? ??????????????, ? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ???????...|$|R

50|$|A radar altimeter, {{electronic}} altimeter, reflection altimeter, {{radio altimeter}} (RADALT), low range radio altimeter (LRRA) or simply RA, used on aircraft, measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft by timing {{how long it}} takes a beam of radio waves to reflect from the ground and return to the plane. This type of altimeter provides the distance between the antenna and the ground directly below it, in contrast to a <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeter</b> which provides the distance above a defined datum, usually mean sea level.|$|E
50|$|Altitude can be {{determined}} based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure. The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure. When a barometer is supplied with a nonlinear calibration so as to indicate altitude, the instrument is called a pressure altimeter or <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeter.</b> A pressure altimeter is the altimeter found in most aircraft, and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions for similar purposes.

40|$|The Orion Crew Module (CM) is NASA's next {{generation}} manned space vehicle, scheduled to return humans to lunar orbit {{in the coming}} decade. The Orion avionics and GN&C architectures have progressed {{through a number of}} project phases and are nearing completion of a major milestone. The first unmanned test mission, dubbed "Exploration Flight Test One" (EFT- 1) is scheduled to launch from NASA Kennedy Space Center late next year and provides the first integrated test of all the vehicle systems, avionics and software. The EFT- 1 mission will be an unmanned test flight that includes a high speed re-entry from an elliptical orbit, which will be launched on an expendable launch vehicle (ELV). The ELV will place CM and the ELV upper stage into a low Earth orbit (LEO) for one revolution. After the first LEO, the ELV upper stage will re-ignite and place the combined upper stage/CM into an elliptical orbit whose perigee results in a high energy entry to test CM response in a relatively high velocity, high heating environment. While not producing entry velocities as high as those experienced in returning from a lunar orbit, the trajectory was chosen to provide higher stresses on the thermal protection and guided entry systems, as compared against a lower energy LEO entry. However the required entry geometry with constraints on inclination and landing site result in a trajectory that lingers for many hours in the Van Allen radiation belts. This exposes the vehicle and avionics to much higher levels of high energy proton radiation than a typical LEO or lunar trajectory would encounter. As a result, Van Allen radiation poses a significant risk to the Orion avionics system, and particularly the Flight Control Module (FCM) computers that house the GN&C flight software. The measures taken by the Orion GN&C, Flight Software and Avionics teams to mitigate the risks associated with the Van Allen radiation on EFT- 1 are covered in the paper. Background on the Orion avionics subsystem is provided, as well as an overview of the GN&C software architecture. The measures taken to handle radiation induced failure of the {{one or both of the}} FCM's are presented, and finally simulation and actual hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) results are shown confirming the validity of the implementation. The paper presents an overview of the Orion avionics architecture describing the GNC sensors, onboard data network as well as the flight control computers and their planned restart capabilities. GN&C sensors include two Orion Inertial Measurement Units (OIMU's), a Vision Processing Unit (VPU) to process camera images, three <b>barometric</b> <b>altimeters</b> and a single GPS receiver. All of the sensors communicate to one of two Power and Data Units (PDU's). The PDU's multiplex analog and serial data from the sensors and write the data to the Orion Data Network (ODN).
