40|$|In {{order to}} reveal the time {{variations}} of water temperature field in the north basin of LakeBiwa, successive measurements of spacial temperature distribution were carried out using a <b>bathy-thermograph</b> for four days during 28 - 31 August, 1973. The horizontal distribution of observedwater temperature at the thermocline depth fluctuates largely day by day. This fluctuation seemsto be caused by the rotating internal wave, which has been pointed out by Kanari. At the fixed buoy station, Ie- 1, time series of current and water temperature were obtained. Results show that the internal wave with the period of about 40 hours has been dominant in thefluctuations of both current and water temperature. An elliptical hodograph of this wave hasbeen obtained and this means the Coriolis' force plays {{a very important role}} to the internal waveof the fundamental mode. It is interesting that the direction of the major axis of the ellipsealmost coincides with that of the longitudal line of Lake Biwa at this buoy station...|$|E

During {{the period}} 1998 – 2000, the Mediterranean Forecasting System Pilot Project, aiming {{to build a}} forecast-ing system for the {{physical}} state of the sea, has been carried out.

40|$|Data from French cruises in 1999 – 2007, {{a period}} during which Deep Blue (DB) or T 7 {{expendable}} <b>bathy-thermographs</b> (XBTs) were deployed, and for which ancillary temperature data {{are available in the}} northeast Atlantic and equatorial Atlantic regions, are examined. There was a total of 16 cruises with XBTs launched between conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) stations; during most of these, as well as during three ad-ditional cruises that were also considered, intake temperature was measured. XBT data from two voluntary observing ships in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre for which intake temperature was measured were also investigated. There is an XBT cold bias due to stirring of a stratified upper layer by the ship, resulting in differences between XBT temperatures at 3 – 5 m and intake measurements. This is most pronounced for midlatitude spring or summer cruises, when it averages about 0. 108 C. When these situations are removed, the comparisons clearly indicate positive biases in XBT temperaturemeasurements in 1999 – 2006, with individual cruise averages generally between 08 and 0. 18 C, and a tendency to have larger biases when surface temper-ature is high. In addition, a positive depth-estimate bias of the XBTs in the upper thermocline (on the order of 4 m) is identified, as well as a depth overestimation through the profile, averaging 1. 7 % (1. 2 %) for the equatorial (midlatitude) cruises (with respect to a previously published depth estimate). 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} frequency bands in altimeter sea surface height (SSH) variability {{over the whole}} Indian Ocean and in temperature profiles near the Sumatra-Java coast are identified and analysed using spectral analysis techniques. We find that in most regions of the Indian Ocean, the lowfrequency part of the SSH spectra (corresponding to signals with periods from six months to six years) is concentrated in five frequency bands separated by substantial spectral gaps: semi-annual, annual, 18 – 20 months, 3 years, and 4 – 6 years. The existence of semi-annual, annual, 2 – 3 -year, and 4 – 6 -year periodical signals is well known; however, the 18 – 20 -month signal has not previously been described. Further investigation of temporal and spatial characteristics of this later signal point to {{its relationship with the}} Indian Ocean dipole events: the signal is particularly strong between 1994 and 2000; it develops near the Sumatra coast and propagates to the Bay of Bengal and into the Indonesian Throughflow.

40|$|The fishery for Illex argentinus in the Southwest Atlantic {{is subject}} to large inter-annual {{variability}} in recruitment strength. In this paper we attempt to build a predictive model using sea surface temperature (SST) to examine links between recruitment to the Falkland Islands fishery and environmental variability during the juvenile and adult life history stages. SST data from the National center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) {{were found to be}} comparable with near-surface data derived from in situ expendable <b>bathy-thermograph</b> (XBT) profiles in the southern Patagonian shelf. Variation in SST during the early life stages appears to be important in determining recruitment of I. argentin us. SST in the hatching grounds of the northern Patagonian shelf during the period of hatching (particularly June and July) was negatively correlated with catches in the fishery in the following season. SST anomaly data from positions in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic were used to examine teleconnections between these areas. Links were seen at a lag of 2 yr between the Pacific and southern Patagonian shelf, and at about 5 yr between the Pacific and northern Patagonian shelf. This is consistent with SST anomalies associated with El Niilo in the Pacific propagating around the globe via the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW). Predicting cold events via teleconnections between SST anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic would appear to have the potential to predict the recruitment strength of I. argentinus in the Southwest Atlantic...|$|E

40|$|The {{subsurface}} {{ocean dynamics}} of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is identified using regular and extended empirical orthogonal function (EOF and EEOF) {{analyses of the}} TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter sea-level anomaly and expendable <b>bathy-thermograph</b> (XBT) temperature data. An IOD event is initiated by an anomalous upwelling along the Sumatra– Java coast {{at the start of}} the normal upwelling season in May–June. This enhances cooling of sea-surface temperature (SST) in the eastern Indian Ocean, which couples with a westward wind anomaly along the equator and drives rapid growth of IOD. The wind anomaly and associated Ekman pumping generate off-equatorial Rossby waves that travel westward, deepen the thermocline, and warm SST in the western Indian Ocean, causing the peak of an IOD event a few months after it begins. The decay of an IOD event is characterized by a slow eastward propagation of warm anomaly along the equator, with warm SST leading deepened thermocline depth. The deepened thermocline arrives at the eastern boundary and reduces the rate of cooling during the next upwelling season. This causes a positive SST anomaly in the eastern Indian Ocean in the following year of an IOD event. The evolution of the event during two upwelling seasons involves the SST, wind, and subsurface temperature. The vertical and horizontal subsurface thermal structure of IOD is described in detail. There are upward propagations of temperature anomaly from subsurface to surface layer in the XBT EEOF analysis, which implies the potential role of ocean dynamics on the SST.

40|$|International audienceSeasonal and year-to-year time {{evolution}} of the thermal structure, including the heat content change in the upper water column and {{its relationship with the}} surface net heat fluxes, have been studied at five locations in the central Mediterranean Sea. The study is based on temperature profiles collected during XBT surveys (eXpendable <b>Bathy-Thermograph)</b> carried out on ships of opportunity, in the framework of the MFSPP (Mediterranean Forecasting System Pilot Project), between September 1999 and May 2001. The five investigated zones are located in the southern Adriatic, NW Ionian, southern and northern Tyrrhenian, and Ligurian Sea. Gradual erosion of the thermocline in autumn, formation of a mixed layer in winter, and the onset of the stratification in spring, are common properties of the temporal {{evolution of}} thermal structures at all five locations. Moreover, in the southern Adriatic, a deep convection took place down to about 600 m in winter 1999 / 2000. On the other hand, mild climatic conditions and small surface heat loss in autumn and winter 2000 / 2001 drastically reduced a mixing/convection depth which hardly reached 200 m. Simultaneously, the NW Ionian remained slightly stratified throughout the winter period. The heat storage rate in the upper portion of the water column (down to 450 m) is compared with the air-sea net heat flux at a monthly scale. A heat content decrease is determined by the surface heat loss, and the processes such as lateral advection, or upwelling of the colder waters through the base of the water column (for example, in the southern Adriatic and Ionian Seas). Elsewhere (for example, in the northern Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Seas), the upwelling does not contribute significantly to the heat balance within the water column, since the vertical temperature gradients in deeper layers are negligible.
