5|$|Only {{the white}} stone mosque, one village mill, the village health center, {{and a few}} {{partially}} destroyed houses remain on the site. The mosque has {{been converted into a}} carpentry workshop and one of the houses has been made into a chicken coop. The health center and grain mill are deserted, and the school is gone. The cemetery remains, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a neglected state; the tomb of Yusuf al-Hamdan, a prominent nationalist who fell in the 1936 revolt, is clearly visible. The surrounding lands are planted with almond trees, wheat, and barley; they also contain animal sheds, a fodder plant, and a pump installed on the spring of 'Ayn al-Hajja. The site is tightly fenced in and entry is blocked.|$|E

25|$|The model which Doyle himself cited (through Sherlock Holmes) in The Valley of Fear is the London arch-criminal of the 18th century, Jonathan Wild.

The original owners supported the work of the local Augustinians and when then property first became abandoned, these brothers took it over. In 1809, the government confiscated it and it has remained government property since.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the {{air force}} signed a letter of intent to {{purchase}} several of the Boeing Integrated Defense C-17 Globemaster III.

Denmark has later withdrawn from this arrangement <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> existence today. See NATO Strategic Airlift Capability. The United States and the United Kingdom have already bought numerous C-17s, and several other NATO countries are considering doing so, too.|$|E
25|$|The word wicket is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers {{it is quite possible that}} the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.|$|E

25|$|The Barton School House, {{built in}} 1877, {{is the oldest}} {{building}} in Redlands. The historic elementary school closed down in the 1960s and has since deteriorated on Nevada Street. In early 2008, construction had become huge in the area surrounding it and in late 2008, the land the property sat on was purchased for construction. Instead of destroying the building, the company paid to move it to Orange Avenue at The Grove School's farm campus. The building has been moved <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> three pieces and will be renovated and remodeled {{over the next three}} years. It will become the school's lunch area as well as theater. It is now owned and operated by The Grove School, but the company that moved it will pay to reattach the pieces, with The Grove School planning to pay for the remodeling.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is a {{cause of}} cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from {{the apex of the}} heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing, which to the layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> fact a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, {{the ancient}} goddess of South Munster, Clíodhna (Cleena), has beneath Lough Cluhir {{one of her}} several palaces in the country, {{according}} to the Storyteller. The story he tells involves {{the wife of a}} peasant working for Burke Far-Shoung and does not involve Ivor himself, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> fact the case that the O'Donovans are one of those noble families long associated with the Goddess. Whatever arrangements Cleena and Ivor might have are not discussed, but approaching four centuries later one of his collateral descendants, the formidable Donal III O'Donovan, is called the Dragon of Clíodhna in a Gaelic praise poem celebrating his accession to the lordship of Clancahill in 1639. In Munster she is most famously associated with Glandore and its environs, the western half of which were controlled by Ivor and his descendants for nearly three centuries, and so some association was certainly inevitable.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} Philcoxias highly {{specialized}} morphology {{has led to}} confusion about its proper taxonomic placement. In 1996, before Philcoxia was even formally published as a taxon, it had been placed by Vinícius Souza in the tribe Scrophularieae of the Scrophulariaceae. Peter Taylor et al. later noted in the 2000 description of the genus that its affinities should include the genera Gratiola and Dopatrium in the tribe Gratioleae of the Scrophulariaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group later changed the circumscription of the Scrophulariaceae so that the tribe Gratioleae is now within the Plantaginaceae. In 2004, E. Fischer also placed in tribe Gratioleae, but also placed it within the informally recognized subtribe Dopatriinae, which was described as also containing the genera Deinostema, Dopatrium, Hydrotriche, and Limnophila, which consist mostly of aquatic species. In 2007, an extensive study and phylogenetic analysis by Peter Fritsch et al. confirmed that Philcoxia should {{be placed in the}} tribe Gratioleae, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> fact not as closely related to Gratiola and the Dopatriinae as was previously assumed.|$|E
