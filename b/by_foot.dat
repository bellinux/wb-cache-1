5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are <b>by</b> <b>foot,</b> chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling <b>by</b> <b>foot.</b> The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E
5|$|After Congo-Léopoldville gained {{independence}} in 1960, it collapsed {{into a state}} of anarchy within a fortnight. The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling <b>by</b> <b>foot,</b> canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E
50|$|It has twelve 24 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 22 <b>feet</b> rooms, twelve 12 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 12 <b>feet</b> rooms, and 6 16 feet X 22 feet rooms.|$|R
50|$|The stockade was a 40 <b>foot</b> <b>by</b> 40 <b>foot</b> {{square with}} a 16 <b>foot</b> <b>by</b> 24 <b>foot</b> blockhouse. The fort was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and pickets.|$|R
2500|$|The {{airport was}} opened in April 1940 as Van De Graaff Field. [...] It {{originally}} consisted of 4 turf runways: 00/18 (2500 <b>by</b> 500 <b>feet),</b> 04/22 (3777 <b>by</b> 600 <b>feet),</b> 09/27 (4082 <b>by</b> 600 <b>feet),</b> 13/31 (5208 <b>by</b> 600 <b>feet).</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1896, {{huge amounts}} of gold were {{discovered}} in the Klondike valley. Once news of this circulated the following year, around 100,000 people rushed to the Klondike in search of wealth, most with no experience in the mining industry. To reach the area, many prospectors travelled <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> over arduous mountain routes and along rivers using primitive boats, although no more than 40,000 of them successfully reached the goldfields. A substantial and expensive mounted police detachment {{was established in the}} Klondike, amounting to 288 men by 1898, representing around a third of the entire force and including many of its most experienced personnel.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong {{is located}} off the National Highway 31A (NH31A), which links Sevok to Gangtok. The NH31A is an {{offshoot}} of the NH 31, which connects Sevok to Siliguri. These two National Highways together, via Sevok, links Kalimpong to the plains. Regular bus services and hired vehicles connect Kalimpong with Siliguri and the neighbouring towns of Kurseong, Darjeeling and Gangtok. Four wheel drives are popular means of transport, as they can easily navigate the steep slopes in the region. However, road communication often get disrupted in the monsoons due to landslides. In the town, people usually travel <b>by</b> <b>foot.</b> Residents also use bicycle, two-wheelers and hired taxis for short distances.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was erected {{at a cost}} of $315,000. It is 84 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 124 <b>feet.</b> The white tiled swimming pool in the basement is 60 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 22 <b>feet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is approximately 90 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 100 <b>feet.</b> The opera house occupied the second floor, 50 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 100 <b>feet</b> with a 24 x 50 stage and a 24 x 24 balcony.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a pointed}} barrel-vaulted crypt below the chancel, {{measuring}} 34 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 16 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 9 <b>feet</b> high {{at the west}} end (10 × 5 × 3 metres), sloping to the entrance at the east.|$|R
5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down {{version of the}} game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed <b>by</b> <b>foot,</b> on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|On a rainy Sunday of 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander <b>by</b> <b>foot,</b> refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: {{at the same}} time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent {{much more than just}} Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed <b>by</b> <b>foot.</b> On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5000|$|The numbers {{represent}} {{the dimensions of}} a grave, 3 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 7 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 77 inches.|$|R
5000|$|The Grade I listed {{church of}} St Mary, Leighton Bromswold, {{consists}} of a chancel ( [...] <b>by</b> [...] <b>feet),</b> nave ( [...] <b>by</b> 24 <b>feet),</b> north transept ( [...] <b>by</b> [...] <b>feet),</b> south transept ( [...] <b>by</b> [...] <b>feet),</b> west tower (15 <b>by</b> 14 <b>feet)</b> and north and south porches. The walls are of coursed rubble with stone dressings, except the tower, which is faced with ashlar, and the roofs are covered with tiles and lead.|$|R
5000|$|It can be {{built in}} two versions, the [...] "Spiral Version" [...] and the [...] "Loop Version" [...] (also called the [...] "Looper"). The Loop's {{dimensions}} are 8 <b>feet</b> long <b>by</b> 3 <b>feet</b> wide <b>by</b> 3 <b>feet</b> tall. The Spiral's dimensions are 5 <b>feet</b> long <b>by</b> 3 <b>feet</b> wide <b>by</b> 3 <b>feet</b> tall.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy VII {{is mostly}} comparable to earlier Final Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, {{and the battle}} screen. At its grandest scale, players explore the entire world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map is littered with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barrierssuch as mountains, deserts, and bodies of waterblock access <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles. Chocobos {{can be found in}} certain spots on the map, and if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> or vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For {{the first time in the}} Final Fantasy series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story. While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters rest at an inn, their hit points and mana points will be completely restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.|$|E
5|$|The {{light is}} {{operated}} by Roads and Maritime Services, while {{the site is}} managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service {{as part of the}} Tomaree National Park, in which it is located. Visiting the lighthouse is difficult. The point is connected to the mainland with a narrow tombolo, and is only accessible <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> at low tide. It is accessible by boat, and the grounds are open, though the tower is closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled <b>by</b> <b>foot,</b> bicycle, and carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.|$|E
50|$|Our Saviour's Evangelical Lutheran Church is a {{rectangular}} structure measuring 50 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 32 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 18 <b>feet.</b> It contains nine windows: three {{on each side}} and three in front. With classic Danish architectural influences, the church featuring an elaborate hand carved altar.|$|R
50|$|The Ammachiveedu Muhurthi's Garbhagriha is small, {{measuring}} only 4 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 4 <b>feet,</b> <b>by</b> 6 <b>feet</b> tall.The temple has a Peedam (small platform), clad {{with silver}} plate, upon which the deity stands. Two Shankha, in golden covers, are placed over the Peedam.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} one-and-one-half-story {{main floor}} contains a lobby, Postmater's office, and mail workroom. The public lobby measures approximately 45 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 13 <b>feet,</b> {{and has a}} terrazzo floor with marble wainscoting. The lobby originally housed a mural, Hauling in the Nets, by Zoltan Sepeshy. The mural is now located in the Marine Museum on Beaver Island. THe postmaster's office measures approximately 12 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 14 <b>feet,</b> and the mail workroom approximately 40 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 59 <b>feet.</b> The basement contains three storage rooms.|$|R
5|$|Following the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Admiral Kinkaid {{requested}} a larger force of 25,000 troops {{to support an}} assault on Kiska. However, as there were not enough ships to transport such a large division to the Aleutians, Kinkaid suggested that the Americans' objective change from Kiska, which was defended by about 9,000 men, to Attu, which was home to only 500 Japanese. On April 1, Kinkaid received approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to execute the operation, codenamed SANDCRAB. The terrain of Attu Island was not hospitable for such an operation – much of the island's landmass not covered in snowy peaks was covered in muskeg, a marshy soil type that {{is almost impossible to}} cross <b>by</b> <b>foot.</b> In addition, Attu Island was subject to frequent storms and soupy fogs.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the sangha, Koṇḍañña and the other monks travelled with the Buddha <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> through the Gangetic plains area of what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to spread the dharma. Koṇḍañña helped to convert many followers to the Buddha's teaching, the foremost being his nephew Punna, born to his sister Mantani. This occurred while the Buddha was at Rajagaha, where he had immediately gone after first communicating his Realisation in order to honour his promise to show his teachings to King Bimbisara. In the meantime, Koṇḍañña returned to his home town of Kapilavastu and ordained Punna. Punna attained arahantship and 500 of his clansmen become monks. Punna was later acknowledged by the Buddha as the foremost of the disciples in preaching skills.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May Prvanović's revenue sergeants {{assembled}} and Sergeant Budivoj Grbić accepted the task and led Princip and Grabež <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> to Isaković's Island, a small island {{in the middle of}} the Drina River that separated Serbia from Bosnia. They and their weapons reached the island on 31 May. Grbić passed the terrorists and their weapons to the agents of the Serbian Narodna Odbrana for transport into Austro-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house. Princip and Grabež crossed into Austria-Hungary on the evening of 1 June. Princip and Grabež and the weapons were passed from agent to agent until on 3 June they arrived in Tuzla. They left the weapons in the hands of the Narodna Odbrana agent Miško Jovanović and rejoined Čabrinović.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} is a rectangular timber crib measuring approximately 32 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 50 <b>feet,</b> and 16 feet tall. The crib is constructed of heavy timbers {{and supported by}} piles. The crib supports an eight-foot thick concrete platform measuring approximately 32 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 50 <b>feet.</b> In {{the center of the}} platform is an unpainted single-story rectangular reinforced concrete pier measuring approximately 32 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 35 feet; open deck space is to either side. A steel doorway facing the breakwater provides access into the structure. Inside is a rectangular room measuring approximately 19.5 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 25 <b>feet.</b> A ladder provides access to the superstructure.|$|R
50|$|Francis Willis {{returned}} to England and bequeathed the estate upon {{his death in}} 1690 to a nephew, Francis Willis. He {{is believed to have}} started the first house, which measured 56 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 22 <b>feet.</b> A wing added later measured 17 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 25 <b>feet.</b>|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the rise}} in the price of copper during World War I {{provided}} both impetus and resources for expansion of the site. [...] Reinforced concrete and brick additions to both stamp mills were constructed in 1919; the addition to mill no. 1 was 123 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 215 <b>feet,</b> and the addition to mill no. 2 was 91 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 132 <b>feet.</b> [...] The additions were equipped and functioning by 1920. [...] The mill also changed their production of electrical power, building a structure to house a new turbine near mill no. 1. [...] Construction on the new building, a brick structure measuring 36 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 38 <b>feet</b> <b>by</b> 45 <b>feet</b> high, began in 1921; the turbine was online in 1923.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} American {{soldiers}} disembarked, {{a group of}} Spanish and Puerto Rican units began moving from Ponce to Aibonito, marching through the Carretera Central (Central Road). The caravan was composed of two companies of the Batallón de Cazadores de la Patria (Battalion of the Motherland's Hunters) and {{some members of the}} Civil Guard and a Puerto Rican guerilla force. A total of 248 infantry men and 42 members of the cavalry formed the battalions under the command of Lt. Col. Rafael Martínez Illescas, the same commander {{who was in charge of}} the Ponce garrison. Traveling <b>by</b> <b>foot,</b> the journey would last two days. The group decided to spend one night in the resort of the town of Coamo known as the Baños de Coamo before continuing their march in the morning. Martínez Illescas immediately ordered the construction of several trenches; while building these, the soldiers were ambushed by an anti-Spanish guerilla force, led by Pedro María Descartes, who managed to kill a member of the Civil Guard.|$|E
5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either <b>by</b> <b>foot</b> or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and <b>by</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
