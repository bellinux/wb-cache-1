40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{maintain}} {{a high quality}} of red blood cells (RBCs), RBC characteristics must be followed during storage under blood <b>bank</b> <b>conditions.</b> By means of infrared (IR) spectroscopy, several characteristics can be measured simultaneously. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: IR spectra were acquired for samples from RBCs that were collected and stored according to Dutch blood bank procedures {{for a period of}} up to 50 days. Spectra of the soluble cell components were acquired separately after hypotonic lysis of the cells, followed by centrifugation. Characteristic vibrational bands were analyzed with respect to storage time-dependent changes in peak position and in intensity. RESULTS: A decrease in corresponding peak intensities indicates that RBCs lose protein and lipid during storage. Changes in protein secondary structure during storage are largely confined to integral membrane proteins and membrane-associated proteins. A concurrent decrease in lipid packing density probably reflects the gradual change in cellular shape from discoidal to globular. By integration over a narrow range, storage-dependent changes in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glucose levels could be estimated. ATP levels decrease during storage, but stay above the required 75 % of the initial level after 35 days of storage. Glucose concentrations stay well above 5 mmol/L over the entire storage period. CONCLUSION: IR spectroscopy is a promising technique to follow structural and metabolic changes in RBCs during storage under blood <b>bank</b> <b>conditions.</b> Several variables can be determined rapidly in a single measurement...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{researches}} {{on aging}} {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) - performed both in vivo and under blood <b>bank</b> <b>conditions</b> - revealed that RBC membrane proteins undergo a number of irreversible alterations, mainly due to oxidative stress. The individuation of proteins {{to be used as}} indicators of irreversible RBC injury and to be proposed as candidate biomarkers of oxidative damage or aging status during blood storage is therefore of great interest. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on this purpose we performed proteomic analysis of the membranes of RBCs during various storage periods under blood <b>bank</b> <b>conditions.</b> Changes in protein composition of RBC membranes were monitored {{as a function of the}} storage period by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses. RESULTS: During storage, a progressive linkage of typical cytosolic proteins to the membrane was detected, including both antioxidant and metabolic enzymes (such as catalase, peroxiredoxin- 2 [Prx 2], and 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate-mutase), as well as nonreducible cross-linkings of probably oxidized or denatured hemoglobin. This phenomenon was unequivocally related to oxidative stress, since storage of RBCs under anaerobic conditions showed a suppression of these protein recruitments to the membrane. CONCLUSION: The detailed analysis of these protein associations to the membrane of aged RBCs allowed Prx 2 to be suggested as a potential RBC oxidative stress marker for the sake of developing new approaches in quality assurance of blood components. © 2011 American Association of Blood Banks...|$|E

30|$|The {{well-known}} orthodox {{theory of}} supply and demand is behind the market discipline hypothesis. In banking markets, economic agents should react to the riskier behavior of their banks, because their costs may present a direct relationship with bank risk taking. Thus, the riskier behavior of a particular bank will change depositors’ preferences, and they will shift the supply curve of deposits toward the left, requiring higher interest rates on deposits or/and withdrawing their resources. As a result, this particular bank should modify its risk taking. We assume that depositors can monitor and indentify riskier banks, and they react in consequence. In other words, market discipline shows two faces: the ability to monitor <b>bank</b> <b>conditions</b> and the ability to influence banks’ actions, market monitor and market influence in terms of Flannery (2001).|$|E
