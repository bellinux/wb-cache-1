40|$|In complex organisms, {{different}} tissues express different genes, {{which ultimately}} shape the function and phenotype of each tissue. An important goal of modern biology {{is to understand}} how some genes are turned on and off in specific tissues and how the numbers of different gene expression products are determined. These aspects are named ‘expression breadth’ (or ‘tissue specificity’) and ‘expression level’, respectively. Here, we show that we can predict substantial amount of variation in levels and <b>breadths</b> of gene expression using genomic information of each gene. Interestingly, many genomic traits are correlated with both aspects of gene expression in similar directions, suggesting shared molecular pathways. However, to elucidate distinctive molecular mechanisms governing gene expression levels and <b>breadths,</b> we need to identify the relative significance of each genomic trait on these two aspects of gene expression. To this end, we developed a novel multivariate multiple regression method. Using this new method, we show that gene compactness (in particular, the mean size of exons), codon usage bias and non-synonymous rates have a stronger influence on expression levels compared with their effects on expression <b>breadths.</b> In contrast, the propensity of promoter DNA methylation is a stronger indicator of expression <b>breadths</b> than of expression levels. Interestingly, intron DNA methylation exhibits an opposite pattern to the promoter DNA methylation in the human genome, suggesting that DNA methylation may play multiple roles depending upon its genomic targets. Furthermore, synonymous rates have stronger associations with expression <b>breadths</b> than with expression levels in the human genome. These findings provide clues toward distinctive molecular mechanisms regulating different aspects of gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Data on the {{physical}} dimension of the hand of Indian women are scanty. This information is necessary to ascertain human-machine compatibility {{in the design of}} manual systems for the bare and gloved hand, such as design and sizing of hand tools, controls, knobs and other applications in different kinds of precision and power grips. The present study was undertaken to generate hand anthropometric data of 95 women, working in informal industries (beedi, agarbatti and garment making). Methods: Fifty one hand measurements of the right hand (lengths, <b>breadths,</b> circumferences, depths, spreads and clearances of hand and fingers) were taken, using anthropometric sliding and spreading calipers, measuring tape and handgrip strength dynamometer. The data were statistically analyzed to determine the normality of data and the percentile values of different hand dimensions, and simple and multiple regression analysis were done to determine better predictors of hand length and grip strength. Results: The hand <b>breadths,</b> circumferences and depths were approximately normally distributed, with some deviation in case of the finger lengths. Hand length was significantly correlated with the fist, wrist and finger circumferences. The fist and wrist circumferences, in combination, were better predictors of hand length.
