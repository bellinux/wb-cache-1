25|$|The {{occupancy}} of {{the energy}} bands in a semiconductor is set by {{the position of the}} Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate reverse bias of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the <b>band</b> <b>edge,</b> lowering the occupancy of the channel. The effect is to increase the gate voltage necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the figure. This change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the 'body effect'.|$|E
25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction <b>band</b> <b>edge</b> is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} spin-flip scattering on the Hall transport and spectral properties of gapped Dirac fermions. We find that in the weak scattering regime, the Berry curvature distribution is dramatically compressed in the electronic energy spectrum, becoming singular at <b>band</b> <b>edges.</b> As a result the Hall conductivity has a sudden jump (or drop) of $e^ 2 / 2 h$ when the Fermi energy sweeps across the <b>band</b> <b>edges,</b> and otherwise is a constant quantized in units of $e^ 2 / 2 h$. In parallel, spectral properties such as the density of states and spin polarization are also greatly enhanced at <b>band</b> <b>edges.</b> Possible experimental methods to detect these effects are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, several {{modifications}} of the Parks-McClellan (PM) program are described that treat the <b>band</b> <b>edges</b> differently {{than does the}} PM program.

The set of lowpass filters obtained with this algorithm {{is the same as}} the set of lowpass filters produced by the PM algorithm. We also find that if passband monotonicity is desired in the design of filters having very flat passbands it is also desirable to modify the usual way of treating the <b>band</b> <b>edges.</b> The second multiple exchange algorithm we describe produces filters having a specified ffi p and ffi s but also includes a measure of the integral square error. 1 Introduction In this paper, several {{modifications of}} the Parks-McClellan (PM) program [11, 13, 17] are described.

40|$|Using a {{one-dimensional}} tight-binding Anderson model, {{we study}} a disordered nanowire {{in the presence}} of an external gate which can be used for depleting its carrier density (field effect transistor device configuration). In this first paper, we consider the low temperature coherent regime where the electron transmission through the nanowire remains elastic. In the limit where the nanowire length exceeds the electron localization length, we derive three analytical expressions for the typical value of the thermopower {{as a function of the}} gate potential, in the cases where the electron transport takes place (i) inside the impurity band of the nanowire, (ii) around its <b>band</b> <b>edges</b> and eventually (iii) outside its band.
