5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Punishment in Hell {{typically}} {{corresponds to}} sins committed during life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with damned souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's myth of Er or Dante's The Divine Comedy), <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are general, with condemned sinners relegated {{to one or}} more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine use disorder, {{also called}} misuse or abuse, {{is the use}} of benzodiazepines without a prescription, often for {{recreational}} purposes, which poses risks of dependence, withdrawal and other long-term effects. Benzodiazepines are one of the more common prescription drugs used recreationally. When used recreationally benzodiazepines are usually administered orally <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are taken intranasally or intravenously. Recreational use produces effects similar to alcohol intoxication.|$|E

25|$|The {{objectives}} of the Alsos Mission were {{to determine if the}} Germans had an atomic bomb program and to exploit German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, materiel resources, and scientific personnel {{for the benefit of the}} US. Personnel on this operation generally swept into areas which had just come under control of the Allied military forces, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> operated in areas still under control by German forces.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the veneration of household Niños Dios during the Christmas season, {{there are a number}} of Child Jesus images that have year-round devotion. These Niños Dios often have a special place in the worship by Mexican Catholics, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> have been the objects of “kidnapping” and disputes. Most of the best-known images are in Mexico City and central Mexico. Offerings to these images are usually toys or candy, a tradition related to offerings made to the dead for the afterlife in pre-Hispanic times.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the mid-19th}} century, Vermont {{attracted}} numerous Irish, Scots-Irish and Italian immigrants, adding to its residents of mostly English and French-Canadian ancestry. Many migrated to Barre, {{where the men}} worked as stonecutters of granite, for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states. Many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses in the late 19th century to support their families. Such facilities helped absorb new residents, who peaked between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> boarded with others.|$|E

25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case {{trimmers}} are available. Die-based trimmers {{have an open}} top, and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual trimmers usually have a base that has a shellholder {{at one end and}} a cutting bit at the opposite end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.|$|E
500|$|Some authors place fully {{secret and}} half-secret trusts in {{different}} categories, including Alastair Hudson and Lionel Astor Sheridan. To this {{it has been}} argued that, if the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory is the true basis for the secret trust, whether the mention of the existence of the trust {{on the face of the}} will should affect its nature. In Hudson's opinion, fully secret trusts are constructive trusts, because they exist to prevent fraud. <b>But</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are express trusts, if [...] "au dehor" [...] doctrine is concerned. Half-secret trusts are constructive trust, because their mention in wills makes fraud unlikely; they are instead in line with a constructive notice, e.g. the use of sealed document. The House of Lords in Blackwell v Blackwell, however, considered the half-secret trust to have the same basis as the fully secret trust.|$|E

2500|$|Clitics can {{belong to}} any {{grammatical}} category, {{although they are}} commonly pronouns, determiners, or adpositions. Note that orthography {{is not always a}} good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are joined to the word on which they depend (like the Latin clitic -que, meaning [...] "and"), or separated by special characters such as hyphens or apostrophes (like the English clitic ’s in [...] "it's" [...] for [...] "it has" [...] or [...] "it is").|$|E
2500|$|Boats were {{to keep to}} {{the right}}. Certain craft had {{preference}} over others: [...] "boats had {{the right of way}} over rafts, descending boats over ascending craft, packets over freight boats at all times, and packets carrying the mail over all others", and later, repair boats actively involved in repair had preference over everybody else. The boat which did not have preference would slow down the mule team, the rope would sink {{to the bottom of the}} canal, and the other boat would float over it, and the mules would walk over also. The towline of the one boat would be unhitched so the lines would not tangle, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> did. There is one report of a towline snagging on the other boat, and the boatman running the boat into the towpath so as not to drag the other mules into the canal.|$|E
2500|$|The colonial {{political}} culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were {{the men who}} ran and were chosen. <b>But</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> competed {{with each other and}} had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches—all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate George Washington spent £39 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to [...] "swill the planters with bumbo" [...] (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.|$|E

5000|$|Espadrilles or espardenyes are casual, flat, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> high-heeled shoes. <b>They</b> {{usually have}} a canvas or cotton fabric upper and a {{flexible}} sole made of esparto rope. The esparto rope sole is the defining characteristic of an espadrille; the uppers vary widely in style.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived a king and queen who loved each other dearly, {{and would have been}} {{perfectly}} happy if they had only had a little son or daughter to play with. They never talked about it, and always pretended that {{there was nothing in the}} world to wish for; <b>but,</b> <b>sometimes</b> when <b>they</b> looked at other people's children, their faces grew sad, and their courtiers and attendants knew the reason why.|$|R

I do know that {{for the amount of}} stuff we're putting in here, it is certainly not a bad deal. There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game. It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March? We're not going away, and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> can't." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern cricket the bowler is no balled if he bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot (either {{grounded}} or raised) behind the popping crease and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1950s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease. The 1958-59 series was a catalyst towards the change as fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease in order to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> would drag it over the line and they would be no balled. The dust raised by the dragging foot and the distance between the bowling hand and the dragging foot of some six or seven feet made it difficult for umpires to make the correct decision. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease[...] It should have been called as a no ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire and impossible for the bowler.|$|E
