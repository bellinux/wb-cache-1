His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir.

Materials and Methods: An observational study on three wards of Mulago Hospital. Physicians, paramedics, nurses, medical students and nurse students were observed using two questionnaires. For comparison, a limited observational study was performed in the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) in Groningen, The Netherlands. Results: In Mulago Hospital guidelines for <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> practice were not easily available. Medical staff members work on individual professional levels. Students perform poorly due to inconsistency in their supervision. Documentation of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> in patient files is scarce. There is no immediate bedside observation, so transfusion reactions and obstructions in the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> flow are not observed. Conclusion: The poor <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> practice is likely to {{play a role in the}} morbidity and mortality of patients who receive a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> There is a need for a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> policy and current practical guidelines...|$|R

The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence of blood doping.|$|E

Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart surgery was cost-effective in India, as it did not require <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions,</b> reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} nursing care for {{patients}} during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. The thesis {{is divided into}} two parts, theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part <b>blood,</b> <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> and nursing care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration are described. In the practical part quantitative research was used and the data collection technique was an anonymous questionnaire designed for nurses working in different departments. The research survey was conducted in Strakonice Hospital, plc, and Písek Hospital, plc, where a total of 130 questionnaires were distributed, 119 questionnaires were returned. The research sample contained 113 properly completed questionnaires, which was defined as 100 %. The objective of this thesis was to identify the knowledge and skills of nurses in the care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. The other objective was to find out what new knowledge would the nurses apply in the care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. To meet these objectives, three following hypotheses were set. Hypothesis 1 : Nurses know the principles of nursing care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration ? it has been confirmed. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses actively monitor the patients´ needs during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration, this hypothesis has also been confirmed. Hypothesis 3 : Nurses try to apply new knowledge in the care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration - it has not been confirmed. As an outcome of his study an informational brochure with the basics of nursing care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration was created, enriched with the information about the needs of patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. The information brochure will be used by nurses who want to enhance or supplement their knowledge in the nursing care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration.

40|$|Abstract: Haemovigilance {{is defined}} as a set of {{surveillance}} procedures from the collection of blood and its components to the follow–up of recipients, denoted to collect and assess information on unexpected or undesirable effects resulting from the therapeutic use of labile blood products, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. In this system the complications of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are systematically collected and reported and data of adverse effects of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are analyzed and a series of corrective measures are performed to prevent the recurrence of them. Another goal of haemovigilance is documentary collections of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> cases which eventually leads to conducting and promoting <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> in hospitals.

5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions,</b> hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E

He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate.

In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections.

5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions,</b> fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E

Methods: A total of 86 cases of traumatic <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> emergency and hospitalized patients during January 2014 to January 2016 in our hospital, divided into two groups according to the early <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion,</b> acute trauma patients need a lot of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> for the observation group (47 cases), trauma patients need a small amount of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> as the control group (39 cases). Statistical analysis and comparison of two groups patients of four blood coagulation [prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB) ], platelet count (PLT), protein C (PC) and fiber soluble system index [D dimer (D-D), fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels before and after <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> of 1 d, 5 d". Results: Before <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion,</b> there was no significant difference between the two groups.
