40|$|After {{the close}} of an auction, the winning bidder may find that {{he is unable to}} carry out his <b>bid</b> <b>offer.</b> This paper seeks to {{determine}} what measures the seller should take to maximize his share of the surplus when bidders are privately informed about their risk of default. Special attention is paid to the effect of imposing a default penalty, the value of gathering information about each bidder's default risk, and the role of commitment. It is shown that the value of gathering information is negligible when the seller has commitment power and negative when the seller lacks commitment power. When the seller is informed about each bidder's risk, the seller benefits from the ability to commit. However, when the seller is uninformed, he is able to capture nearly all the surplus independent of whether or not he has commitment power. ...|$|E
40|$|In theory, a {{call option}} and its {{underlying}} index should {{move in the}} same direction, while a put option and its underlying index should move in opposite directions. This property {{is referred to as}} the Empirical Monotonicity Property (EMP) when applied to time series of prices. In this paper, we use daily call and put options? data to conduct empirical tests of the EMP, including three violation types. Further, we investigate the effect of grouping the option prices by their Black-Scholes implied volatility and by moneyness, and also the effect of using different quotes (<b>bid,</b> <b>offer,</b> and bid-offer midpoint). In addition to EMP, which depends on the signs of the price changes, we also test another theoretical constraint concerning the magnitude of these changes. This is followed by a discussion of the possible causes for violations of the EMP. We use regression analysis to test whether volatility changes may be one of these causes. Lastly, we summarize the implications of our study to hedging strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} {{recurring}} laboratory elections in which {{buyers and sellers}} choose institutional rules to govern a subsequent trading round. The bid auction (buyers propose prices), offer auction (sellers suggest prices) and double auction (both trader types initiate price quotes) make up the electoral candidates. Both plurality rule and approval voting are used as vote-counting schemes. The former allows each trader to vote for, at most, one auction, whereas approval voting permits voters to either abstain or to vote for one, two or all three institutional alternatives. The main result is threefold. First, plurality rule induces a Duverger effect {{in the sense that}} only the bid and offer auctions emerge as viable auctions. Approval voting instead leads to close three-way races with each of the three auctions winning approximately one third of the elections. Second, buyers (sellers) in the plurality-rule sessions concordantly vote for the <b>bid</b> (<b>offer)</b> auction. Approval-voting behavior is comparatively more heterogeneous. Third, bid-auction prices are significantly lower than double-auction prices, which again are significantly below offer-auction prices.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of intraday trades and quotes for individual stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The TSE has no designated market makers and is further distinguished by daily and intraday price limits and conversion to limit orders of market order portions that exceed {{the size of the}} current quote. We examine the transaction and quote record for three firms for {{the first three months of}} 1990. Our findings suggest that the immediacy available (at least for small trades) in the market is high, despite the reliance on public limit orders to supply liquidity. When orders that would otherwise walk through the limit order book are converted into limit orders, execution is delayed, but some orders execute (at least in part) at more favorable prices. Holding order size constant, orders that are delayed in this fashion appear to have a larger information content. Finally, as a consequence of limit order cancellation and autocorrelation in arriving orders, the <b>bid</b> (<b>offer)</b> quote tends to deteriorate further after a sale (purchase) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect on the cost of capital of {{increased}} disclosure that reduces information asymmetry among market participants. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses the decision to regularly hold open (closed) conference calls pre-Reg FD as a proxy for a commitment to the policy of public (selective) disclosure and a cross-sectional research design to examine the associations between open/closed conference calls and three proxies for firms' cost of capital (i. e. bid-ask spreads, share turnover, and implied costs of capital). Findings – The results show that firms that commit to open calls exhibit lower relative bid-ask spreads, lower implied costs of capital, and higher share turnover than firms that commit to closed calls. Practical implications – The findings suggest that increased disclosure that “levels the playing field” for small investors benefits investors as a whole by improving firms' market liquidity and reducing the cost of capital. Originality/value – This study contributes to existing literature on the association between corporate disclosure and firms' cost of capital. <b>Bid</b> <b>offer</b> spreads, Cost of capital, Disclosure, United States of America...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the price impact of block trades for FTSE 100 firms. Design/methodology/approach – Using event studies a sample of 1. 6 million block {{purchases}} and 1. 2 million block sales over the time period 1998 - 2005 is analysed. Findings – Once block price effects are estimated using quote returns to eliminate bid-ask bias, the asymmetry in buyer and seller initiated trades is eliminated. Research limitations/implications – A possible avenue for future research may be {{to look at the}} impact of inflation on the asymmetry between block purchases and sales. This may be an interesting extension to the current study given that inflation appears to be an important determinant of the equity premium in international stock markets. Practical implications – The empirical results suggest that market liquidity is one of the factors that is driving the asymmetry between block purchases and sales on the London Stock Exchange. The paper is of interest to academics and practitioners who study and invest in block trades.
