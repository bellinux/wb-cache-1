5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E
2500|$|Phyllida Lloyd's 2003 {{production}} at Shakespeare's Globe, with an all female cast, starring Kathryn Hunter as Katherina and Janet McTeer as Petruchio. The production emphasised the physicality {{of both the}} comedy and the taming, with McTeer's Petruchio a commanding and domineering figure alongside Hunter's shrinking waif-like Katherina. Katherina's final speech was played in an unusual way. The speech was broken up into separate [...] "beats", with Hunter playing each <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a false ending (to the relief of the 'men') only to begin the next beat immediately afterwards (much {{to the chagrin of}} the 'men'). At the end of the speech, the three giggling wives all flung themselves at their husband's feet. At the end of the play, when the main stage had cleared, Katherina and Petruchio appeared as silhouettes on the upper stage {{in the throes of a}} huge argument. The production received mixed reviews, with many feeling it was unable to decide if it was a farce or a feminist statement, and ultimately ended up being neither.|$|E

60|$|The sun had fairly risen, {{when the}} Neshamony {{came down on}} the Anne's weather-quarter, both craft then {{standing}} to the northward. The Neshamony had seen nothing. The governor now directed her commander to stand directly down towards Rancocus Island. If she saw nothing, she was {{to go in and}} land, {{in order to get the}} news from the people ashore. Unless the information obtained in this way was of a nature that demanded a different course, she was to <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the volcano, reconnoitre there, then stand across to the cove, and go in; whence she was to sail for the Reef, unless she could hear of the governor at some other point, when she was to make the best of her way to him.|$|E

The colour receded from his inflamed face; dread looked out of his pale eyes, to inform M. de La Tour d'Azyr, more clearly than any words, that M. de Kercadiou's hot speech had been the expression of unreflecting anger, that his prayer that retribution might soon overtake his godson had been unconsciously insincere. Confronted now by the fact that this retribution was about to be visited upon that scoundrel, the fundamental gentleness and kindliness of his nature asserted itself; his anger was suddenly whelmed in apprehension; his affection for the lad <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the surface, making Andre-Louis' sin, however hideous, a thing of no account by comparison with the threatened punishment.|$|E

60|$|The captain {{yielded to}} our reasoning, and we <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Port Jackson, where {{we arrived in}} three or four days. The people were then sent to prison, as mutineers, and we watered the ship. We were in port a fortnight, thus occupied. All this time the men were in gaol. No men were to be had, and then arose the {{question}} about trusting the old crew. There was no choice, and, the ship being ready to sail, we received the people on board again, and turned them all to duty. We had no further trouble with them, however, the fellows behaving perfectly well, as men commonly will, who have been once put down. No mutiny is dangerous when the officers are apprized of its existence, and are fairly ready to meet it. The king's name is a tower of strength.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} sail could be {{shortened}} {{and the ship}} hauled close on a wind, the frigate was nearer half {{than a quarter of}} a mile off. We had to wait, therefore, until she could <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the place where we lay. This she soon did, making one stretch to the southward, until in a line with the boat, when she tacked, and came toward us, with her yards braced up, but having the wind nearly abeam. As she got within a cable's-length, both courses were hauled up and left hanging in the brails. Then the noble craft came rolling by us, in the trough, passing so near that we might be spoken. The old officer stood in the weather gangway, with a trumpet, and he hailed, when near enough to be heard. Instead of asking questions, to satisfy his own curiosity, he merely communicated his own intentions.|$|E
60|$|As the brig {{came out}} of the passage, in broad day, the heads of the schooner's masts were seen, as a matter of course. This induced Spike to heave-to, lower a boat, and to go in person to examine the {{condition}} of the wreck. It will be seen that Jack's presence could now be all the better dispensed with. The examination, with the soundings, and other calculations connected with raising the vessel, occupied hours. When they were completed, Spike returned on board, run up his boat, and squared away for the Dry Tortugas. Señor Montefalderon confirmed the justice of Jack Tier's surmises, as to the object of this unexpected visit. The brig had come solely for the chain and anchor mentioned, and having secured them, it was Spike's intention to get under way and <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the wreck again as soon as the moon rose. As for the sloop-of-war, he believed she had given him up; for by this time she must know that she had no chance with the brig, so long as the latter kept near the reef, and that she ran the constant hazard of shipwreck, while playing so near the dangers herself.|$|E

They are occasionally used as bodyguards to various characters, specifically anyone claiming to be the king.

There was one of the owners on board, and he up and forbid Captain Guy to do it. He told him that they had been delayed enough on the voyage by light winds, and now that they would be over-due at their port a good many days before they got there. Every day lost, he said, was money lost to the owners. He had never heard of any skipper undertaking a piece of tomfoolery like this. It would take all day to <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that wreck, and when they reached it they would find an old derelict, which was no more than they could see now. And as for there being a woman on board, that was all stuff. The skipper had woman on the brain.|$|E
60|$|For {{seven hours}} the Anne and Martha stood towards Rancocus Island, running off about two leagues from each other, thereby 'spreading a clew,' as sailors call it, that would command {{the view of}} {{a good bit of}} water. The tops of the {{mountains}} were soon seen, {{and by the end of}} the time mentioned, most of the lower land became visible. Nevertheless, the strangers did not come in sight. Greatly at a loss how to proceed, the governor now sent the Martha down for information, with orders for her to <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Needle, as soon as she could, the Anne intending to rendezvous there, next morning, agreeably to previous arrangements. As the Martha went off before the wind, the Anne hauled up sharp towards the Peak, under the impression that something might have been seen of the strangers from the high land there. About four in the morning the Anne went into the cove, and the governor ascended to the plain to have an interview with Heaton. He found everything tranquil in that quarter. Nothing had been seen of the strange squadron, since it went out of sight, under the volcano; nor had even the Neshamony come in. The governor's arrival was soon known, early as it was, and he had visits from half the women on the island, to inquire after their absent husbands. Each wife was told all the governor knew, and this short intercourse relieved the minds of a great many.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} six days, {{the weather}} having moderated, he resumed his course, {{standing}} eastward for Hispaniola: [...] "his people," [...] as he says, [...] "dismayed and down-hearted; almost all his anchors lost, and his vessels bored as full of holes as a honeycomb." [...] After struggling against contrary winds and the usual currents from the east, he reached Cape Cruz, and anchored at a village {{in the province of}} Macaca, [178] where he had touched in 1494, in his voyage along the southern coast of Cuba. Here he was detained by head winds for several days, during which he was supplied with cassava bread by the natives. Making sail again, he endeavored to <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Hispaniola; but every effort was in vain. The winds and currents continued adverse; the leaks continually gained upon his vessels, though the pumps were kept incessantly going, and the seamen even baled the water out with buckets and kettles. The admiral now stood, in despair, for the island of Jamaica, to seek some secure port; for there was imminent danger of foundering at sea. On the eve of St. John, the 23d of June, they put into Puerto Bueno, now called Dry Harbor, but met with none of the natives from whom they could obtain provisions, nor was there any fresh water to be had in the neighborhood. Suffering from hunger and thirst, they sailed eastward, on the following day, to another harbor, to which the admiral on his first visit to the island had given the name of Port Santa Gloria.|$|E
