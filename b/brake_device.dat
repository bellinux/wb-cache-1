At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed combined <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language.

The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s.

40|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>braking</b> <b>devices</b> is increasing due to the intensification of manufacturing, increase in the moving masses, speeds of movement and frequency of braking. During a short time period the <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> needs to convert {{a significant amount of}} mechanical energy into heat energy and transfer it into the environment without compromising the operability of both devices and machines in general. For electric actuators braking a normally closed mechanical brake is frequently used. When disconnecting the motor from the network the brake friction surfaces are closed and prevent rotation, and when the motor is switched on, they are opens under the action of the electromagnet, electro-hydraulic pusher, special electric motor, mechanical or pneumatic device. In the case of joint implementation of the asynchronous motor and the mechanical brake, the drive of quick stop is more compact and convenient. Such devices are further called asynchronous motors with electromechanical braking systems henceforth. The large number of requirements as well as different conditions of operation cause a large variety of designs of such motors. One of the major shortcomings of the functioning of well-known design is the periodic wear of the friction linings and the need for frequent replacement of them. The solution to this problem is the use of asynchronous motor with recessed combo <b>braking</b> <b>device.</b> However, for some mechanisms that do not require a smooth stop of the motor shaft and that have a speed of rotation of the motor shaft less than 1500 rpm, more simple and cheap solution would be the use of an electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with an air gap compensation. Due to wear of the friction linings the air gap of the electromagnet increases. Due to the compensation of the air gap of the electromagnet these devices make it possible to rub the material of the friction lining longer. The current designs of the electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with compensation of the air gap are quite bulky and complicated to be manufactured. Therefore, the authors developed, experimentally investigated and implemented two new, simple and cheap designs of electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with compensation of the air gap. </p...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} companion paper, we presented a three-tier modelling {{of a particular}} type of rockfall protective cable-net structure (barrier), developed newly in Japan. Therein, we developed a three-dimensional, Finite Element based, nonlinear numerical model having been calibrated/back-calculated and verified with the element- and structure-level physical tests. Moreover, using a very simple, lumped-mass, single-degree-of-freedom, equivalently linear analytical model, a global-displacement-predictive correlation was devised by modifying the basic equation – obtained by combining the principles of conservation of linear momentum and energy – based on the back-analysis of the tests on the numerical model. In this paper, we use the developed models to explore the performance enhancement potential of the structure in terms of (a) the control of global displacement – possibly the major performance criterion for the proposed structure owing to a narrow space available in the targeted site, and (b) the increase in energy dissipation by the existing U-bolt-type Friction-brake Devices – which are identified to have performed weakly when integrated into the structure. A set of parametric investigations have revealed correlations to achieve the first objective in terms of the structure's mass, particularly by manipulating the wire-net's characteristics, and has additionally disclosed the effects of the impacting-block's parameters.

40|$|LecturePg. 49 - 58 Stringent {{stability}} {{screening criteria}} by the American Petroleum Institute (API) result in higher level rotor stability analyses {{to be performed}} on more intermediate-pressure compressor rotors and in more detail. These high-level stability analyses include predictions of impeller and seal rotordynamic forces and even extra effort on design and analysis of special damping devices as a backup, such as damper bearings and seals. Several moderate-pressure compressors were selected here to discuss the use of stability screening diagrams and the proposed API screening criteria. These compressors are operating successfully {{with or without a}} deswirl mechanism. However, most of them fail to pass the proposed new API screening. Furthermore, rotor aerodynamic logarithmic-decrements (log-decrements or log-dec) were predicted by implementing equivalent aerodynamic destabilizing forces that were calculated using Wachel?s equation, the API proposed equation, and the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) empirical method, respectively. In practice, shunt injection and swirl-brakes are standard tools to enhance rotor stability if the predicted log-decrement is relatively low. When adopted with balance pistons or center seals, the swirl brakes are typically installed behind the impeller and outside the labyrinth seal. However, the deswirl effect of the swirl brake is sometimes limited due to its locations away from the entrance of the balance piston or center labyrinth seal. Meanwhile, the implantation of the swirl brake would change the flow pattern behind the final stage impeller backwall. A unique antiswirl <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> was developed to integrate with typical labyrinth seals for improving high-performance compressor stability. The effectiveness of the antiswirl brake mechanism was experimentally investigated when used with the labyrinth seals on a rotating test rig.

Test results show the labyrinth seal was converted into a damping device by reducing the preswirl velocity to zero or even negative...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{about the process of}} {{converting}} a petrol-fuelled Honda GX 35 engine to run on methane gas. The future goal is to use the engine in the engineering competition Shell Eco-marathon, where the aim is to drive a vehicle as far as possible with a set amount of fuel. To enable methane fuelling, the carburator of the GX 35 was replaced with a gas fuel injector from the engine accessory company Ecotrons. This was attached to an aluminium intake pipe constructed by the project group. A new flywheel was constructed, equipped with twelve magnetic detection points instead of one for more accurate detection of the crankshaft position. A magnet was also attached to the upper cam pulley to enable position detection. The original exhaust system was replaced by a holder of a lambda sensor and a straight exhaust pipe. Together with the engine control unit (ECU) KATLA, developed earlier for a bachelor’s thesis at Chalmers, this enabled detailed control of ignition and fuel injection, as well as measurement of the air-fuel ratio. In order to test the engine with a load, a <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> was constructed. A moped was acquired, whose gearbox and rear brake was used to brake and gear down the output shaft of the methane engine. The flywheel of the methane engine was connected to the flywheel of the moped through a vibration reducing rubber disc and a steel adapter. The rear wheel of the moped was lifted from the ground with a support so that it could rotate freely. By doing this, the load of the engine could be controlled with the rear brake pedal of the moped. Methane was not available for the project group, so the engine was tested with liquefied petroleum gas instead, which is another gaseous fuel. Before the engine was started, the flow rate through the gas injector was measured. This data was used to set the fuel parameters in the ECU. With some minor adjustments the engine ran well during testing...|$|E
