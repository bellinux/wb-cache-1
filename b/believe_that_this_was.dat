5|$|The {{footage of}} Don {{returning}} to bed after kicking Andrea {{out of the}} apartment was actually reverse footage of Don getting out of bed only minutes before, which led some to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a directorial touch by Shakman to help the viewer discern the dream sequence by including unreal footage.|$|E

Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> one factor in the film's success.|$|E

500|$|It was {{originally}} discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801. He called the mineral [...] "brown lead" [...] and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, {{he was later}} led to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefström discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río's [...] "brown lead" [...] was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, Hidalgo, Mexico, and was named vanadinite because of its high vanadium content. Other names that have since been given to vanadinite are johnstonite and lead vanadate.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter, dated , was postmarked [...] 1888. It was {{received}} that {{day by the}} Central News Agency, and was forwarded to Scotland Yard on [...] Initially it was considered a hoax, but when Eddowes was found {{three days after the}} letter's postmark with one ear partially cut off, the letter's promise to [...] "clip the ladys (sic) ears off" [...] gained attention. Eddowes' ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack, and the letter writer's threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out. The name [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication. Most of the letters that followed copied this letter's tone. Some sources claim that another letter dated [...] 1888 was the first to use the name [...] "Jack the Ripper", but most experts <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a fake inserted into police records in the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|During the Venetian period {{all public}} acts were drawn {{up in the}} Venetian language, the {{official}} language of the Government. Greek remained spoken by the peasantry whereas Venetian {{was adopted by the}} upper class and it was generally preferred within the towns. Thus, the Venetian language became, if not the common language of the Ionians, at least the prestige one. The Venetians did little in the area of education, mainly {{due to the fact that}} schooling was not considered a responsibility of the state at that time in Europe but a private matter. Some authors <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> done intentionally by Venice, as part of its colonial policy. People belonging to the upper classes were more likely to be educated and to have studied in an Italian university, usually that of Padua. Modelled after the academies operating at that time in Venice, the first literary academy, , was founded in Corfu in 1656 by individuals. It had as an emblem two rocks beneath a winged lion, with an inscription [...] hovering in the air.|$|E
500|$|The {{first group}} of people {{claiming}} to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from [...] "Andun" [...] ( [...] ; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), [...] "king of Daqin" [...] (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named [...] "Antoninus". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states {{that it was the}} first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.|$|E

2500|$|Ostensibly the law {{was created}} to bring to account groups like the Thuggees, a cult devoted to Kali which {{according}} to some estimates murdered a million people between 1740 and 1840. Although that problem had been substantially addressed, the law gave the authorities of the time better means to tackle the [...] "menace of professional criminals". [...] However, some scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> also done due to {{their participation in the}} revolt of 1857, and many tribal chiefs were labelled traitors and considered rebellious.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{finishing}} with a 6-10 record in 1996, the Buccaneers finished strong and {{showed signs of}} developing into a winning team. After a home win versus the Raiders, the Buccaneers fell to a quick 140 hole to the Chargers in San Diego. Instead of folding, the team fought to a hard win, their first win on the West Coast in 15 years. [...] Many Bucs fans <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> where the long-beleaguered franchise finally turned the corner.

2500|$|Trudeau said he {{was willing}} to fight during World War II, but he {{believed}} that to do so would be to turn his back on the population of Quebec that he believed had been betrayed by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King. Trudeau reflected on his opposition to conscription and his doubts about the war in his Memoirs (1993): [...] "So there was a war? Tough... if you were a French Canadian in Montreal in the early 1940s, you did not automatically <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a just war... we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Karaites {{maintain}} {{that in the}} absence of a Temple, ordinary washing with flowing waters (described in the Torah as [...] "living"—flowing—water) should be substituted for purification with water that includes ashes obtained through the red heifer burning ritual. Karaites <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the practice before the Tabernacle was built in the Sinai Peninsula following the Exodus. They follow certain Torah laws for avoiding Ṭum’at Met (ritual impurity caused by contact with a dead body, human bones, graves, or being present in a space under any ceiling where a human died) which are no longer considered relevant in Rabbinic Judaism, except for Kohanim (members of the Jewish priestly class).|$|E
2500|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{issues a}} {{standard}} reply {{to requests for}} their opinion regarding the Book of Mormon as an archaeological or scientific guide. Prior to 1998, the statement denied any evidence for pre-Columbian contact between Old and New Worlds: [...] "Certainly there was no contact with the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews or other peoples of Western Asia or the Near East." [...] In 1998, the Smithsonian began issuing a shorter letter without the detailed response found in the first letter, and limited its comment to briefly deny any use of the Book of Mormon as an archaeological guide by the institution. Some Mormons <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{in part due to}} a critique of their statement by John L. Sorenson.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologists {{no longer}} accept this viewpoint, however. Instead, they now <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an elite {{settlement}} in the Early Medieval period that was inhabited by Dumnonian royalty and their entourage. Archaeologist and historian Charles Thomas believe {{that they did not}} stay at Tintagel year-round but that they moved around: [...] "A typical king with his family, relatives, dependants, resident hostages, officials and court-followers, and a private militia or war-band—in all, probably between a hundred and three hundred souls at least—moved around with his cumbersome entourage; at least, when not busy with inter-tribal campaigning or in repelling invaders and raiders." [...] The site was also made more defensible during this period with a large ditch {{at the entrance to the}} peninsula, leaving only a narrow trackway that had to be traversed by anyone approaching the peninsula.|$|E

2500|$|The Temple Lot church shares {{its early}} {{history with the}} larger Latter Day Saint denominations, {{including}} the LDS Church and the Community of Christ (formerly the RLDS Church). After the death of Joseph Smith, the Latter Day Saint movement's founder, on June 27, 1844, several leaders vied for control and established rival organizations. By the 1860s, five early Mormon branches found themselves unaffiliated with any larger group. Located in Bloomington, Illinois; Crow Creek, Illinois; Half Moon Prairie, Illinois; Eagle Creek, Illinois; and Vermillion, Indiana, these branches united {{under the leadership of}} Granville Hedrick in May 1863. [...] On July 18, 1863, Hedrick was ordained as [...] "President, Prophet, Seer and Revelator". Participating in Hedrick's ordination was John E. Page who had been an apostle under Smith. The Temple Lot church affirms a founding date of April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York, and claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Smith's original Church of Christ. Hedrick later distanced himself from the title of [...] "President", as he ultimately came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an unscriptural office.|$|E
2500|$|Hawkins {{was born}} in Shreveport, Louisiana, the {{youngest}} of five children, to Nyanza Hawkins and Hattie Freeman. In 1918, {{the family moved to}} Los Angeles. Hawkins was fond of his new home. He later wrote, [...] "When people from Texas or Louisiana came out and wrote back South it made people in the South <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> heaven... It was a land of golden opportunities—orange groves and beautiful beaches—and life was a matter of milk and honey." [...] Hawkins graduated from Jefferson High School in 1926, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1931. After graduation, he planned to study civil engineering, but the financial constraints of the Great Depression made this impossible. The impossibility of Hawkins to afford further schooling contributed towards his interest in politics, and his lifelong devotion to education. At this time, Hawkins operated a real estate company with his brother and studied government. While serving in the California State Assembly, Hawkins married Pegga Adeline Smith on August 28, 1945. After she died in 1966, he married Elsie Taylor on June 30, 1977.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after, Caragiale became {{involved}} in a major literary scandal. Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion, a journalist and student whom Tudor Vianu described as [...] "a real pathological character", issued a claim that, in his Năpasta, the Romanian dramatist had plagiarized {{the work of a}} Hungarian-language author named István Kemény. Caion expanded on this in articles published by Revista Literară, where he provided direct comparisons between the two texts. This was received with enthusiasm by Caragiale's old rival, Alexandru Macedonski, who publicized the controversy through one of his journals, Forţa Morală. Initially amazed by the similarity between the two texts, Caragiale carried out his own investigations, and, in the end, discovered that neither the writing nor Kemény had ever existed. Employing Ştefănescu Delavrancea as his lawyer, he brought Caion to trial: a court sentenced Caion for calumny, but he was acquitted after an appeal in June 1902. Several commentators <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> owed to a strong National Liberal presence among members of the jury. During the retrial, Caion retracted all his previous claims, and instead argued that Năpasta plagiarized Leo Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness.|$|E
