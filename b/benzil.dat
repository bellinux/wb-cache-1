The results showed that, with unsymmetrical <b>benzils</b> substituted with electron-withdrawing or electrondonating groups, the carbonyl closest to the ring with the least electron-donating power was the preferred reaction site. However, the dicarbonyl system was nevertheless reduced as a unit, and Hammett sigma values of disubstituted symmetrical <b>benzils</b> were approximately additive. This was ascertained by comparing the ease of reduction of eight unsymmetrical <b>benzils</b> to the ease of reduction of the corresponding disubstituted symmetrical <b>benzils.</b> It was proposed that the electrons were added to the oxygen of one carbonyl, and that the second carbonyl was involved in the reduction chiefly through complete polarization of the dicarbonyl system at the electrode.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} observed photoallergens today is the sunscreen agent 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ′-methoxy dibenzoylmethane (1 a). The structurally similar compound, 4 -isopropyldibenzoylmethane (1 b), was a common cause of sunscreen allergy in the eighties and early nineties but was removed from the market in 1993 and replaced with dibenzoylmethane 1 a. We have studied the photodegradation of the dibenzoylmethane 1 a, to better understand how these substances cause an immune reaction. Several expected degradation products were formed and identified. Of these, arylglyoxals and <b>benzils</b> were of particular interest because they were unexplored as potential contact allergens. The allergenic potential of photodegraded 1 a was evaluated by screening the formed arylglyoxals and <b>benzils</b> for their sensitizing capacity in the murine local lymph node assay. The arylglyoxals were found to be strong sensitizers. They were also found to be highly reactive toward the nucleophile arginine, which indicates that the immunogenic hapten-protein complex could be formed via an electrophilic-nucleophilic pathway. By varying the electron-withdrawing or -donating capacity of the substituent in the para position of the arylglyoxal, the electronic effects were shown to have no significant impact on either the sensitizing or the electrophilic power of arylglyoxals. Thus, a change in the substitution pattern of the parent dibenzoylmethane will not influence the sensitizing capacity of the products formed from them upon photodegradation. Furthermore, the combined studies of <b>benzils,</b> using the local lymph node assay and a cell proliferation assay, indicate that the <b>benzils</b> are cytotoxic rather than allergenic. Taken together, this study presents strong indication that photocontact allergy to dibenzoylmethanes is caused by the arylglyoxals that are formed upon photodegradation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The sun’s UV {{radiation}} {{is necessary for}} the existence of life on earth. However, too much UV exposure can lead to the development of skin cancer. Therefore, sunscreens are often used by the general population as protection from excessive UV radiation. Unfortunately, many of the chemical UV-filters that are used in sunscreens today have the ability to induce contact and photocontact allergy. In this work two different chemical UV-filters together with the anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, all known to induce allergic reactions, have been studied to better understand the reason for these adverse effects. In addition, a synthetic route to the natural UV-filter scytonemin has been developed. One of the most commonly used UVA-filters today is the well known photoallergen 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ’-methoxy dibenzoylmethane. We showed that it degrades when irradiated with UV light and that several different photodegradation products are formed. Of particular interest were arylglyoxals and <b>benzils</b> because they were unexplored as potential contact allergens. The <b>benzils</b> were found to be cytotoxic rather than allergenic, whereas the arylglyoxals were found to be strong sensitizers in the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) used to assess their allergenic potency. Photocontact allergy to dibenzoylmethanes is therefore probably caused by the arylglyoxals that are formed upon photodegradation. Chemical reactivity experiments showed that the arylglyoxals have the ability to form immunogenic complexes via an electrophilic-nucleophilic reaction with the amino acid arginine. A relatively new UV-filter on the market is octocrylene that has grown in popularity, due to its ability to stabilize other UV-filters such as 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ’-methoxy dibenzoylmethane. However, recent clinical reports suggest that it is the UV-filter that causes most allergic reactions. Patch and photopatch testing of 172 patients with suspected skin reactions to sunscreens or ketoprofen was performed and 23 of these patients displayed a positive test reaction to octocrylene. Five patients were diagnosed with contact allergy and 18 with photocontact allergy. Notably, many of these patients also displayed a photoinduced reaction to ketoprofen. Without UV radiation, octocrylene was classified as a moderate allergen in the murine LLNA and it was shown to reacted with amines like lysine via a retro-aldol condensation. In presence of UV radiation, octocrylene also reacted with amines but via acyl substitution resulting in a different product outcome than the reaction in the dark. Both the clinical studies and the chemical reactivity experiments thereby indicate that octocrylene has the ability to induce both contact and photocontact allergy. The apparent photocross-reactivity between octocrylene and ketoprofen observed in the clinical study could not be explained by the previous reactivity studies of octocrylene. Furthermore, according to other clinical reports, photosensitization to ketoprofen also leads to photocontact allergy to many other compounds. Ketoprofen was therefore irradiated in presence of five amino acid analogs and interestingly a reaction between the tryptophan and lysine analogs was substantially enhanced by ketoprofen. We believe that ketoprofen generates singlet molecular oxygen which activates the tryptophan analog that subsequently reacts with the lysine analog. The formation of an immunogenic complex not containing the allergen itself can explain many of the observed photocross allergies between ketoprofen and other structurally different compounds. In theory all compounds that are able to generate singlet molecular oxygen can promote the formation of the same immunogenic complex. Finally, the first total synthesis of the dimeric alkaloid scytonemin was developed. This natural occurring UV-filter enables the survival of different species of cyanobacteria in areas of intense solar radiation. The planed structure activity studies of scytonemin and derivatives thereof will hopefully lead {{to the development of a}} stable UV-filter that does not cause contact or photocontact allergy...|$|R
40|$|Domino {{reactions}} are powerful tools in synthetic chemistry {{for the formation}} of target molecules in a single flask without the isolation of intermediates, and hence the number of reaction steps is reduced and waste may be minimized. 1 As part of a wider research program aimed at exploring new domino reactions, we became interested in developing a new strategy for the oxidation of aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acids. 2 Surprisingly, despite impressive advances in the area of oxidation, domino reactions have not been applied to the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. 3 Very recently, we began to explore the utility of sodium hydride-molecular oxygen (NaH-O 2) system and successful-ly applied to the oxidation of benzoins to <b>benzils,</b> 4 and the oxidative cleavage of benzoins to benzoic acids. 5 Based on these results, we envisioned that the combination of the self-benzoin condensation of aldehyde and the oxidative cleav-age of benzoin using NaH-O 2 could provide a conceptually new domino oxidation reaction. Herein we report our pre-liminary results on NHC-assisted one-pot domino oxidation. To identify the feasibility of our approach, we first carried out domino benzoin condensation/NaH-O 2 oxidation with p-chlorobenzaldehyde 1 a. Thus, self-benzoin condensation reaction of 1 a in the presence of 50 mol % N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precatalyst 3 c with K 2 CO 3 as a base in CH 2 Cl 2 for 24 h yielded the intermediate I. 6 The successive addition of 1 equivalent of NaH in a mixed solvent of THF and CH 2 Cl 2 under oxygen atmosphere, provided the desired p-chloro-benzoic acid 2 a in a 77 % yield after 10 min (Scheme 1). We next attempted to develop one-pot domino reactions by employing NHC precatalyst/NaH-O 2 together. Our studies began with an initial examination of the catalytic activities of several NHCs 7 3 a-e for the domino oxidation of 1 a. Th...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{amorphous}} thermoplastic poly(phenylquinoxaline) s (PPQ), poly(aryl ether ketone) s (PAEKs) and poly(aryl ether phthalazine) s {{have been}} synthesized. The reaction of an aromatic Schiff's base and a tertiary amine incorporating an activated methylene moiety {{in the presence}} of strong base to produce an enamine has been investigated. Hydrolysis of the resulting enamines resulted in deoxybenzoins which were converted to <b>benzils</b> by a mild oxidation reaction. This chemistry was investigated as a possible method for the synthesis of the tetraketone compounds (sometimes called bisbenzils) which serve as monomers for poly(phenylquinoxaline) polymers. Two novel monomers have been prepared, the corresponding polymers with 1, 1 $ sp prime$, 2, 2 $ sp prime$-tetraminobiphenyl were synthesized and their physical properties evaluated. The novel polymers exhibited increased solvent resistance as compared to other PPQ polymers reported previously in the literature. Two novel fluorine containing monomers were synthesized and polymerized with commercial biphenols to produce amorphous, fluorinated poly(aryl ether ketone) s. The physical properties of these polymers were evaluated and compared to those of analogous nonfluorinated polymers in order to determine what benefits can be obtained by introducing fluorine into the polymer architecture. The fluorinated polymers were found to show enhanced solubility. They were readily soluble in solvents which contain a ketone moiety, such as acetone, or cyclohexanone. A novel dihalide monomer incorporating bulky 2 -naphthalenyl moieties was synthesized and polymerized with commercial biphenols in an attempt to obtain poly(aryl ether ketone) s with extremely high glass transition temperatures (Tg's). Several poly(aryl ether ketone) polymers were reacted with hydrazine monohydrate {{in the presence of}} a catalytic quantity of acid to produce poly(aryl ether phthalazine) s via ring closure of the o-diketone moiety in the backbone of the PAEKs. The resulting polymers are amorphous thermoplastics which displayed increased glass transition temperatures (Tg) and Young's moduli. It was found that the poly(aryl ether phthalazine) s undergo a thermal reaction above the Tg of the polymer resulting in a rearrangement of the phthalazine moiety to a quinazoline moiety. Some crosslinking of the polymers also occurs, resulting in insoluble polymers which showed an increase in the Tg...|$|R
