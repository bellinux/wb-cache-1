50|$|The Red Court of Vampires {{are less}} human-like than the White Court. Instead they are slimy bat-like creatures hidden behind {{incredibly}} sensuous human costumes (made of an outer skin). It {{is revealed in}} Changes that {{the oldest and most}} powerful red court vampires are capable of wearing any flesh mask (that is, turn into any human), and that their flesh masks can fully protect them from the sun, so that they can walk about in broad daylight. They use these costumes to trick their prey into being more comfortable and to hide in plain sight. They are incredibly strong and fast, and can shake off most injuries quickly. The Red Court is vulnerable to sunlight and to having their <b>bellies</b> <b>cut</b> open, which can spill the blood they have drunk and eventually kill them. Their saliva contains a potent magical narcotic which gives the prey a euphoric feeling and is highly addictive, allowing the Red Court to control their victims rather easily.

5000|$|Gunnar Ekelöf {{has been}} {{described}} as Sweden's first surrealist poet; he made his debut with the collection sent på jorden ("late on earth") in 1932, a work (written during an extended stay in Paris in 1929-30) that was too unconventional to become widely appreciated and which the author described as capturing a period of suicidal thoughts and apocalyptic moods. It was, in a sense, an act of literary revolt akin to Edith Södergran's Septemberlyran a dozen years earlier. While not disavowing his debut, Ekelöf moved towards romanticism and received better reviews for his second poetry collection Dedikation (1934). Both of his first two volumes are strongly influenced by surrealism and show a violent, at times feverish torrent of images, deliberate breakdown of ordered syntax and traditional poetic language and a defiant spirit bordering on anarchism ("cut your <b>belly</b> <b>cut</b> your belly and don't think of any tomorrow" [...] runs the black humorous refrain of a poem called [...] "fanfare" [...] in sent på jorden, which collection does away with the use of upper case letters). This defiant outsiderhood was grounded in his person; though he came from an upper-class background, Ekelöf had never felt committed to it - his father had been mentally ill and when his mother remarried, Ekelöf strongly disapproved of his stepfather and, by extension, of his mother who had let him in: he became a loner and a rebel already in his teens - and would never feel at ease with the mores of the established upper and middle classes or with their inhibitions and, as he perceived it, hypocrisy and back-scratching. Swedish critic Anders Olsson described Ekelöf's turn to poetry as a choice of [...] "the only utterance that doesn't expurge the contradictions and empty spaces of language and of the mind".|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of dietary manipulations on the fatty acid composition, Se content, and vitamin E content of pork. Sixty Duroc-cross gilts were randomly allocated at weaning to 1 of 4 dietary treatment groups (n = 15 per group). The 4 experimental diets were based on animal plus plant components or plant components only, with or without the inclusion of a dietary supplement (0. 614 %) containing CLA, Se, and vitamin E. The growth performance to approximately 100 kg of BW was similar with diets containing animal plus plant components or only plant components. Growth was also similar when either of these diets included the supplement. Inclusion of the supplement led to expected increases in Se and vitamin E contents (P < 0. 001) of the LM. The differences found in the fatty acid profile of the lipid in LM, loin subcutaneous fat, and the <b>belly</b> <b>cut</b> (pork belly) between the groups with and without animal components in their diets largely reflected differences in the diet composition. Inclusion of the supplement led to greater CLA contents in all 3 tissues (P < 0. 001), and also to lower contents of oleic acid (P < 0. 001) and greater contents of stearic acid (P < 0. 05), possibly due to an inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme. The supplement also led to an increase in LM intramuscular fat (P < 0. 05), but did not affect P 2 fat depths (65 mm lateral to the midline of the spine at the last rib; mean depth of 11. 8 mm). It is concluded that changing from a part animal component diet to an all plant diet will not change the growth performance of pigs but changes in the fatty acid profile of pork are likely to occur. It is further concluded that the nutritional value of pork may be successfully enhanced by simultaneously supplementing the diet with CLA, selenium, and vitamin E...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} assess:a) the in vitro effect of the Crude Phenolic Extract (CPE) obtained by ultrafiltration methods from VW on the growth of several food-borne strains and starter cultures; b) the overall impact of their inclusion in the raw sausages during a storage test. Antibacterial activity (0. 375 ÷ 12 mg/ml CPE final concentrations) was based on the agar diffusion assay in comparison with the MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration; microtitre assay) The microbial genera tested were: Staphylococcus (n. 5), Listeria (n. 4), Escherichia (n. 2), Salmonella (n. 1), Pseudomonas (n. 3), Lactobacillus (n. 2) and Pediococcus (n. 1). Fresh pork raw sausages(shoulder and <b>belly</b> <b>cuts,</b> 1. 5 % NaCl, without) were manufactured, according to local recipe to obtain 3 experimental batch: C control, LL 0. 75 g/kg and HL 1. 5 g/kg of CPE. The two levels of polyphenol inclusion were based on the results provided by the antibacterial activity linked with the sensory analysis (e. g., lowest level of perceived flavours with antibacterial activity). The sausages were submitted to microbiological analysis in order to evaluate the total aerobic mesophilic and psycrotrophic flora, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), the Micrococcaceae, Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., yeast and mould. The change of micro flora composition during a storage period of 15 days (4. 0 ± 0. 5 °C) was evaluated, furthermore pH, water activity (Aw) and NaCl content were measured. The main in vitro results indicated that S. aureus and L. monocytogens showed the lowest level of resistance to CPE (1. 5 – 3 mg/ml) for both MBC and agar diffusion assay. In contrast the Gram negative strains were unaffected by the tested doses on agar assay whereas the MBCs ranged between 6 to 12 mg/ml. Starter cultures were dramatically reduced on growth (e. g. S. xylosus; MBC 0. 75 - 1. 5 mg/ml). The effect of polyphenol in fresh sausages was also evaluated demonstrating a relevant impact in the resident microflora. CPE inclusion influenced the development of microbial numbers, especially the Micrococcaceaeand Staphylococcus spp. counts, during 15 days at 4 °C. LAB counts and psycrotrophic flora were affected only in the HL sausages. During the shelf life NaCl varied from 1. 5 to 2. 2 %, meanwhile Aw decreased from 0. 970 to 0. 945 for C and LL and to 0. 938 in HL; pH ranged from 5. 9 to 5. 7 for C meanwhile for LL and HL the acidification was not appreciable.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the genetic parameters for pork belly traits and muscles in Yorkshire pigs. Each pork <b>belly</b> was <b>cut</b> into nine parts perpendicular to the thoracic vertebrae (6 th to 14 th). Traits of belly muscles including the deep pectoral, latissimus dorsi, cutaneous trunci, rectus abdominis, external and internal abdominal oblique from 382 purebred pigs were recorded and analyzed using SAS Package (9. 1) and Derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood methods. Heritability estimates for belly traits ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 49, while they were 0. 12 to 0. 66 for belly muscles. Moderate to high heritability estimates were noted in belly weight (0. 33), belly length (0. 28), and belly width (0. 49). In belly muscles, the latissimus dorsi and deep pectoral, which are located only in the 6 th to 9 th vertebrae sections, were found to have heritability estimates ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 29 and 0. 23 to 0. 35, respectively. Strong heritability estimates were observed in the 7 th to 13 th sections of cutaneous trunci muscle ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 66. Genetic correlations of latissimus dorsi m. with belly length were positive (0. 50), while cutaneous trunci m. with belly weight also revealed a positive relationship that ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 47. The estimated genetic parameters indicate that belly weight can be improved by genetic selection. Differences in the levels of heritability occurred among various parameters of Yorkshire pork belly, which should be considered when performing selection to improve pork belly quality. Moreover, these results can provide valuable information that can be used as the basis for further investigations to improve pork belly...|$|R

First, we {{assembled a}} consolidated data set on prices, trade flow volumes, and transfer costs-the costs of moving product from one location to another-for feed grains (com and soybean meal), slaughter hogs, and {{fresh or chilled}} carcasses and primal <b>cuts</b> (<b>bellies,</b> hams, loins, ribs) among the eight main pork economies of the Pacific Rim (Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Taiwan, the United States), covering the years 1990 - 96. By making available {{for the first time}} comparable international data, we have helped resolve a major stumbling block to careful empirical analysis of factor and product markets in the pork industry. We are making these data available on the World Wide Web. Second, we developed an improved statistical method for establishing the relationship between spatially distinct markets. The new method we developed permits distinction between 2 ̆ 2 market integration, 2 ̆ 2 reflecting the tradability of products, and 2 ̆ 2 competitive market equilibrium 2 ̆ 2 in which extraordinary profits are exhausted by competitive pressures. These two concepts are conflated in traditional market analysis methods. Third, we applied this new method to the data assembled in the first stage. The estimation results reveal that while there have been extraordinary profit opportunities available in a few niche markets, these are generally highly competitive, well-integrated markets. The Pacific Rim is effectively a single market for pork producers today. Intermarket transfer costs are often substantial, with tariffs especially important, so further trade liberalization to reduce tariffs should further exports by and the competitiveness of U. S. producers...|$|R
40|$|The two {{antibiotics}} fed {{in these}} four trials were Aureomycin and Terramycin HCl {{at the level}} of 10 mg. per pound of total ration. Lot 1 pigs were the controls receiving the basal ration; Lot 2, basal plus 10 mg. of Aureomycin HCl per pound of total feed; Lot 3, basal plus 10 mg. of Terramycin HCl per pound of total feed. Fifty-two pigs were used in the four trials carried out from November 1952 to October 1954. The pigs were slaughtered at the college laboratory when they reached approximately 225 pounds. The stomach and intestinal contents were weighed and subtracted from the live slaughter weight to determine the net body weight. All carcasses were weighed after 48 hours chill at 34 ̊F. The length of body was measured from the anterior portion of the first rib to the anterior portion of the aitch bone. The back fat is the average of the three measurements-opposite the first rib, last rib, and last lumbar vertebra. The primal cuts are the skinned ham, trimmed loin, N. Y. style shoulder, and the trimmed <b>belly.</b> The lean <b>cuts</b> are the skinned ham, trimmed loin, and N. Y. style shoulder. The primal and lean-cut yields were based on net body weight and chilled carcass weight. The carcasses were graded, using the average back fat thickness and length as criteria for grades. These grades are based on the official U. S. Standards for Grades of Pork Carcasses, which are choice 1, 2, 3; medium; and cull...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the carcasses and the percentage effect of the cuts can provide useful data for establishing breeding techniques which can improve the productive performance of autochthonous pigs. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate some post mortem performances of Sarda and Nero Siciliano pigs, reared outdoors. The study was carried out on 30 male, castrated pigs over the age of 2 years and with a live weight at slaughtering of 106. 4 ± 4. 2 kg for the “Sarda” (15 subjects) and 107. 2 ± 3. 6 kg for the “Nero Siciliano” (15 subjects) pigs. The Sarda pigs were reared in a wooded area in the Ogliastra mountains (Sardinia-Italy) and the Nero Siciliano pigs in the Nebrodi mountains (Sicily-Italy), at an altitude of 550 ± 50 m a. s. l., where they fed on underwood vegetation consisting mainly of acorns. After being slaughtered, which for both groups took place in March 2006, we determined the productivity for each subject, the thickness of dorsal fat located at the first (1 T) and the last (UT) thoracic vertebra and at the top of the middle gluteus (GM). Subsequently, on the right side of each subject, we carried out the dissection of the lean cuts (loin, ham, shoulder and neck), adipose <b>cuts</b> (<b>belly,</b> backfat, jowl, flare fat) and bone cuts (head and feet). The data obtained were submitted to variance analyses using the procedure GLM of SAS (2001). The pigs belonging to the two genetic types registered top yield, both hot (Sarda 82. 1...|$|R
6000|$|Burly was, of course, {{obliged to}} leave Fife; and, upon the 25th {{of the same}} month, he arrived in Evandale, in Lanarkshire, along with Hackston, and a fellow, called Dingwall, or Daniel, one of the same bloody band. Here he joined his old friend Hamilton, already mentioned; and, as they {{resolved}} to take up arms, they were soon {{at the head of}} such a body of the [...] "chased and tossed western men," [...] as they thought equal to keep the field. They resolved to commence their exploits upon the 29th of May, 1679, being the anniversary of the Restoration, appointed to be kept as a holiday, by act of parliament; an institution which they esteemed a presumptuous and unholy solemnity. Accordingly, at the head of eighty horse, tolerably appointed, Hamilton, Burly, and Hackston, entered the royal burgh of Rutherglen, extinguished the bonfires, made in honour of the day; burned at the cross the acts of parliament in favour of prelacy, and for suppression of conventicles, as well as those acts of council, which regulated the indulgence granted to presbyterians. Against all these acts they entered their solemn protest, or testimony, as they called it; and, having affixed it to the cross, concluded with prayer and psalms. Being now joined by a large body of foot, so that their strength seems to have amounted to five or six hundred men, though very indifferently armed, they encamped upon Loudoun Hill. Claverhouse, who was in garrison at Glasgow, instantly marched against the insurgents, at the head of his own troop of cavalry and others, amounting to about one hundred and fifty men. He arrived at Hamilton, on the 1st of June, so unexpectedly, as to make prisoner John King, a famous preacher among the wanderers; and rapidly continued his march, carrying his captive along with him, till he came to the village of Drumclog, about a mile east of Loudoun Hill, and twelve miles south-west of Hamilton. At some distance from this place, the insurgents were skilfully posted in a boggy strait, almost inaccessible to cavalry, having a broad ditch in their front. Claverhouse's dragoons discharged their carabines, and made an attempt to charge; but the nature of the ground threw them into total disorder. Burly, who commanded the handful of horse belonging to the whigs, instantly led them down on the disordered squadrons of Claverhouse, who were, at the same time, vigorously assaulted by the foot, headed by the gallant Cleland,[A] and the enthusiastic Hackston. Claverhouse himself was forced to fly, and was in the utmost danger of being taken; his horse's <b>belly</b> being <b>cut</b> open by the stroke of a scythe, so that the poor animal trailed his bowels for more than a mile. In his flight, he passed King, the minister, lately his prisoner, but now deserted by his guard, in the general confusion. The preacher hollowed to the flying commander, [...] "to halt, and take his prisoner with him;" [...] or, as others say, [...] "to stay, and take the afternoon's preaching." [...] Claverhouse, at length remounted, continued his retreat to Glasgow. He lost, in the skirmish, about twenty of his troopers, and his own cornet and kinsman, Robert Graham, whose fate is alluded to in the ballad. Only four of the other side were killed, among whom was Dingwall, or Daniel, an associate of Burly in Sharpe's murder. [...] "The rebels," [...] says Creichton, [...] "finding the cornet's body, and supposing it to be that of Clavers, because the name of Graham was wrought in the shirt-neck, treated it with the utmost inhumanity; cutting off the nose, picking out the eyes, and stabbing it through in a hundred places." [...] The same charge is brought by Guild, in his Bellum Bothuellianum, in which occurs the following account of the skirmish at Drumclog:-- ...|$|R
