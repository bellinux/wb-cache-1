40|$|Digital {{intermediaries}} and Internet search {{technologies have}} commoditized many products, resulting in intense price competition and channel conflict. Firms use decommoditization strategies {{to regain control}} over distribution channels, {{as well as to}} implement resonance marketing and hyperdifferentiation, which allows them to improve margins through differentiation. We test two hypotheses: the decommoditization hypothesis and the resonance marketing hypothesis. We use data from an airline with a new íï¾¿ la carte pricing mechanism, which allows consumers to tailor airline ticket bundles to suit their individual preferences. We compare íï¾¿ la carte ticket pricing, whose features can be modified by the purchaser, and fixed (<b>bundled</b> <b>offer)</b> sales, which cannot be modified. We found that a significant number of travelers do use íï¾¿ la carte pricing, which allows the airlines to regain some control over distribution. We find that travelers customized standard bundles when it was possible for them to make íï¾¿ la carte ticket bookings, but mainly for low-feature standard bundles. Frequent-flyer members purchased higher-feature bundles more often when they had the opportunity. The findings support the proposed hypotheses. We discuss the implications for distribution strategy and channel conflict management...|$|E

40|$|Double {{and triple}} play <b>bundled</b> <b>offers</b> are common {{phenomena}} in many national communication markets. However the overall market context, technological background of provision, {{the level of}} facility based platform competition and strategic role of the <b>bundled</b> <b>offers</b> seems to be different in national markets. There is clear challenge to the current European regulatory approach to broadband markets, which is treated as a separate market on its own. If there was a separate market for the bundled product, the whole market analysis and remedy system had to be adapted to this market reality. Testing the (triple play) bundle the market hypothesis is the logical and necessary first step to address this issue. We designed and conducted an empirical study supported by the Hungarian Competition Authority {{in order to address}} these questions. A special, situation adaptive questionnaire design was applied {{in order to get the}} possibly best informed and adequate stated preference reactions to a 10 % price change. We used the cri ical loss test for market definition, testing whether there is a separate market for triple play bundles. Results indicates that the market definition question whether bundle has to or could be considered as a separate relevant market can be answered using well designed survey techniques. Many clues support the hypothesis that the triple play bundle in 2010 indeed was a separate relevant market.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how bundling affects investment in product quality, and derive welfare implications. A monopolist {{in a primary}} market competes with a rival in a complementary market. Bundling is the monopolist's preferred strategy, since it either extracts surplus from the rival's investment, or forces the rival to provide low quality. Bundling may reduce welfare without foreclosing the rival, but improves welfare when preventing undesirable investment. Since prohibiting bundling is not appropriate, we introduce a price test for <b>bundled</b> <b>offers</b> that preserves efficiencies from both bundling and quality investment, thereby improving welfare relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario. We consequently argue that this test should be applied whenever possible...|$|R

Electrophoretic separation of DNA fragments was simultaneously but independently carried out in 54 narrow capillaries with a diameter of 3. 7 ?孠each.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{consumer}} behavior is developed in which, owing to a nonconvexity in the transportation cost of obtaining the desired commodity bundle, consumers {{are attracted to}} marketplaces offering a larger variety of commodities. Impacts on marketeers' equilibrium locations and pricing strategies are studied within a simple model. Agglomeration economies naturally emerge and lead sellers to associate spatially and charge higher noncooperative equilibrium prices than under locational monopoly, despite possibly increased competition. In general, equilibrium prices at one marketplace depend {{on the structure of}} the commodity <b>bundle</b> <b>offered</b> there. Differences in that bundle across marketplaces lead to a nondegenerate equilibrium price distribution for the same commodity, even if the agents involved are perfectly informed and totally undifferentiated a priori.

40|$|Perks are a {{commodity}} <b>bundle</b> <b>offered</b> by an employer to an employee. They {{are used to}} directly control an employee's consumption. Consuming certain goods increases the marginal disutility of non-contractible effort. Lower consumption of such goods will make it less costly to induce an employee to put in high effort. To compensate for the decrease in such goods, an employer gives luxurious perks. By "luxurious" I mean that per-dollar marginal utilities of these perks are {{lower than those of}} other goods. This model explains the existence of perks such as box seat tickets and club memberships, which neither save tax nor enter the production function. Also, perks can be more luxurious at an unsuccessful outcome than at a successful outcome, and an employee with a more successful history receives more perks. ...|$|R
