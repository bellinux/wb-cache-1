2500|$|Confronted {{with the}} same problem, the United States Air Force (USAF) also {{attempted}} to extend the operational life of its strategic bombers by developing a stand off missile, the AGM-28 Hound Dog. The first production model was delivered to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in December 1959. It carried a [...] W28 warhead, and had a range of [...] at high level and [...] at low level. Its circular error probable (CEP) of over [...] at full range was considered acceptable for a warhead of this size. A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could carry two; <b>but</b> <b>but</b> the underslung Pratt & Whitney J52 engine precluded its carriage by bombers with less underwing clearance. It entered service in large numbers, with 593 in service by 1963. Numbers declined thereafter to 308 in 1976, but it remained in service until 1977, when it {{was replaced by the}} AGM-69 SRAM. Despite its being superior in performance to Blue Steel, the British showed little interest in Hound Dog. It could not be carried by the Handley Page Victor, and there were doubts as to whether even the Avro Vulcan had sufficient ground clearance.|$|E

The entire trials were grouped into four growth stages, namely the first stage of juvenile (5 and 9 g), the second stage of juvenile (20, 30, 40 and 50 g), growing (240 and 317 g) and sub-adult (384 and 525 g) stages with 2, 4, 2 and 2 feeding trials, respectively.
