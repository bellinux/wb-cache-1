They live together somewhere in northern New Jersey in a lake house owned under the name Claire Willis (she took this surname from Parker's past). In the novel <b>Backflash,</b> their home is described as [...] "a house on a lake called Colliver Pond, seventy miles from New York, a deep rural corner where New York and New Jersey and Pennsylvania meet ... mostly a resort community, lower-level white-collar, people who came here three months every summer and left their 'cottages' unoccupied the rest of the year ... For Parker, it was ideal. A place to stay, to lie low when nothing was going on, a 'home' as people called it, and no neighbors. In the summer, when the clerks came out to swim and fish and boat, Parker and Claire went somewhere else." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{analysis}} study on parameters which affecting the <b>backflash</b> over pattern cause by lightning is done. A 132 kV double circuit transmission line is modeled using ElectroMagnetic Transient Program EMTP software for <b>backflash</b> over simulation. A vertically configured double circuit transmission {{line can be}} modeled into several parts: towers, insulators, phase conductors, ground wire and tower footing resistance. The <b>backflash</b> over pattern is simulating by model the lightning current that hit the ground wire at the aim tower. The parameters that include {{in this study are}} the values of front, peak and tail of lightning current, striking distance and lastly the tower ground system. The pattern can also be analysis by taking into account the position of the phase conductors on the double circuit transmission tower...|$|E

Back flashover analysis on insulator string provides ATP software for simulation.

The factor of this study includes,front time of lightning stroke, and tower resistance. Simulations is done with lighting strike on the tower and mid-span with four types of impulse. To analysis of tower footing resistance effected back flashover across a transmission system insulator, Simulations are done by varying the tower footing resistance from 1 Ω - 30 Ω.

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper [1], the voltage induced onto a 132 kV double-circuit {{overhead transmission line}} tower associated with multiple lightning strokes terminating on the tower {{was found to be}} considerable in contrast to single lightning strokes relating to <b>backflash</b> and shielding failure. This paper develops the preceding work in three different areas. At first, considers the induced voltages on the tower due to MSL strikes on all three phase conductors on the left-circuit of the tower during shielding failure. Middle phase arms of all three phases produced the most severe voltages. Secondly, line surge arresters are installed on all towers after performing the preceding investigations when no line surge arresters were installed on the towers. This allows the possibility of determining appropriate arrester configurations for reduction of line outages. Lightning surge arresters are shown to be an important consideration in determining the lightning performance of the line in preventing line failures. © VDE VERLAG GMBH...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the possibilities of two methods to reduce the weight of small commercial timber prior to logging. The two methods studied are injection of cacodylic acid and sour-felling. Treatments were applied in November, 1965 and May, 1966, with final harvest of the stand occurring in September and October, 1966. The weight reduction, as indicated by the moisture content, was compared to untreated trees. Results are based on wood samples taken from all trees and a weighed truckload of logs from each treatment. The data indicate small differences among the same treatments due to seasonal application. Reductions in weight range from ten to 20 percent when compared to the untreated trees. Some indication of economic potentials is presented. Sour-felled trees were readily attacked by insects but chemical treatments suffered negligible attack. Felling and woods operations were not adversely influenced. <b>Backflash,</b> while present to aiimited degree, may be a result of application method and could be reduced by other means of treating...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes {{an investigation into the}} use of hydrogen as a fuel for automotive use. Due to problems of <b>backflash</b> into the engine intake when hydrogen is used as the sole fuel, a dual-fuel system using petrol and hydrogen together was studied. Using this system, a spark-ignited engine has been run at all speeds with a wideopen throttle, and the specific fuel consumption and BTE figures indicate a greater part load efficiency than those from a throttled engine. The performance and emissions curves of the engine are presented, both at the standard compression ratio of 8. 9 : 1 and at a higher compression ratio of 11. 7 : 1. Emissions data indicate reduced levels of CO, and NOx at part load due to the very lean mixtures used. No problem of backfiring was experienced since the concentration of hydrogen was very low. A vehicle was modified to run on such a dual-fuel system, and details of this modification are also presented. A major problem with using hydrogen as an automotive fuel is its on-board storage. This is discussed in some detail, with particular reference to the use of metal hydrides as storage media. Metal hydride tanks are now commercially available, and a detailed mathematical model of such a tank has been developed to describe its behaviour under both hydriding and dehydriding conditions. In contrast to other hydride models previously reported in the literature, this model simulates an actual, commercially available containment vessel, rather than that of an abstract ideal situation. Thus the model provides a convenient means of predicting the time taken to release or absorb given amounts of hydrogen. These are calculated from the heat transfer characteristics and diffusion properties of particular metal alloys. Comparisons are given between the actual operating characteristics and those simulated by the model. A brief discussion of the reaction kinetics of hydriding certain metal alloys is also included...|$|E
