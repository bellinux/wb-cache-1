40|$|A {{model of}} the {{kinetics}} of radiationless energy transfer from upper excited states is presented, where both the possibility of <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> from the excited acceptor to a lower lying level of the donor {{and the possibility of}} energy migration over acceptors is considered. The model leads to a complex variation of the energy transfer quantum yield with the acceptor concentration. This dependence results from the interplay of direct energy <b>transfer,</b> <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> and energy migration. <b>Back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> reduces the efficiency of donor–acceptor overall transfer efficiency. On the other hand, energy migration over the acceptors decreases the efficiency of <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> and results in an increase in the energy transfer quantum yield. The known experimental results of energy transfer from upper excited states are in qualitative agreement with the present treatment. q 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. 1...|$|R

50|$|Shrinking the two-sphere {{model to}} the {{molecular}} level creates the problem that in the self-exchange reaction the charge {{can no longer be}} transferred in arbitrary amounts, but only as a single electron. However, the polarization still is determined by the total ensemble of the solvent molecules and therefore can still be treated classically, i.e. the polarization energy is not subject to quantum limitations. Therefore, the energy of solvent reorganization can be calculated as being due to a hypothetical transfer and <b>back</b> <b>transfer</b> of a partial elementary charge according to the Marcus formula. Thus the reorganization energy for chemical redox reactions, which is a Gibbs free energy, is also a parabolic function of &Delta;e of this hypothetical transfer, For the self exchange reaction, where for symmetry reasons &Delta;e = 0.5, the Gibbs free energy of activation is &Delta;G(0)‡ = &lambda;o/4 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 intersection of the parabolas I and f, f(0), respectively).|$|E

The efficiency is however lowered by <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> from Ln(III) ion to the ligands, especially at higher temperatures. Here we report {{a new strategy}} to reduce <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> losses. Nonanuclear lanthanide clusters containing terbium and gadolinium ions, Tbn Gd 9 -n clusters ([Tbn Gd 9 -n (μ-OH) 10 (butylsalicylate) 16]+NO 3 -, n = 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9), were synthesized to investigate the effect of energy transfer between Tb(III) ions on <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer.</b> The photophysical properties of TbnGd 9 -n clusters were studied by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques and revealed a longer emission lifetime with increasing number of Tb(III) ions in TbnGd 9 -n clusters. A kinetic analysis of temperature dependence of the emission lifetime show that the energy transfer between Tb(III) ions competes with <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer.</b> The experimental results are in agreement with a theoretical rate equation model that confirms the role of energy transfer between Tb(III) ions in reducing <b>back</b> energy <b>transfer</b> losses.

40|$|SummarySeveral {{proteins}} at {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) -Golgi membrane contact sites contain a PH domain that {{interacts with the}} Golgi phosphoinositide PI(4) P, a FFAT motif that interacts with the ER protein VAP-A, and a lipid transfer domain. This architecture suggests the ability to both tether organelles and transport lipids between them. We show that in oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) these two activities are coupled by a four-step cycle. Membrane tethering by the PH domain and the FFAT motif enables sterol transfer by the lipid transfer domain (ORD), followed by <b>back</b> <b>transfer</b> of PI(4) P by the ORD. Finally, PI(4) P is hydrolyzed in cis by the ER protein Sac 1. The energy provided by PI(4) P hydrolysis drives sterol transfer and allows negative feedback when PI(4) P becomes limiting. Other lipid transfer proteins are tethered by the same mechanism. Thus, OSBP-mediated <b>back</b> <b>transfer</b> of PI(4) P might coordinate the transfer of other lipid species at the ER-Golgi interface...|$|E

40|$|In {{photosynthetic}} organisms, the pigment-protein complexes {{that comprise}} the light-harvesting antenna exhibit complex electronic structures and ultrafast dynamics due to the coupling among the chromophores. Here, we present absorptive two-dimensional (2 D) electronic spectra from living cultures of the purple bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, acquired using gradient assisted photon echo spectroscopy. Diagonal slices through the 2 D lineshape of the LH 1 stimulated emission/ground state bleach feature reveal a resolvable higher energy population within the B 875 manifold. The waiting time evolution of diagonal, horizontal, and vertical slices through the 2 D lineshape shows a sub- 100 fs intra-complex relaxation as this higher energy population red shifts. The absorption (855 nm) of this higher lying sub-population of B 875 before it has red shifted optimizes spectral overlap between the LH 1 B 875 band and the B 850 band of LH 2. Access to an energetically broad distribution of excitonic states within B 875 offers a mechanism for efficient energy transfer from LH 2 to LH 1 during photosynthesis while limiting <b>back</b> <b>transfer.</b> Two-dimensional lineshapes reveal a rapid decay in the ground-state bleach/stimulated emission of B 875. This signal, identified as {{a decrease in the}} dipole strength of a strong transition in LH 1 on the red side of the B 875 band, is assigned to the rapid localization of an initially delocalized exciton state, a dephasing process that frustrates <b>back</b> <b>transfer</b> from LH 1 to LH 2...|$|E

In this paper we present results of cyclic voltammetry and laser flash photolysis experiments which demonstrate that Methylene Blue may function also as a photochemical reductant.
