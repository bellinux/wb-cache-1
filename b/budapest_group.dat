These, {{the final}} of the 1944 offensives, {{resulted}} in the capture of Budapest on 13 February 1945. Budapest was surrounded by Soviet forces on 26 December 1944, and was captured after weeks of brutal street fighting. The three offensives were regarded and planned as a single continuous strategic advance that was also imbued with great political significance due to the participation of the Yugoslav communist forces in its final phase. Stalin called it the crossing of the Carpathian mountains, liberation of Belgrade and offering of direct help to Czechoslovakia, destruction of the <b>Budapest</b> <b>group</b> of Axis forces, and Liberation of Belgrade.

25|$|Competitive rhythmic {{gymnastics}} {{began in}} the 1940s in the Soviet Union. The FIG formally recognized this discipline in 1961, first as modern gymnastics, then as rhythmic sportive gymnastics, and finally as rhythmic gymnastics. The first World Championships for individual rhythmic gymnasts was held in 1963 in <b>Budapest.</b> <b>Groups</b> were introduced {{at the same level}} in 1967 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Rhythmic gymnastics was added to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, with an individual all-around competition. However, many federations from the Eastern European countries were forced to boycott by the Soviet Union. Canadian Lori Fung was the first rhythmic gymnast to earn an Olympic gold medal. The group competition was added to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The Spanish team won the first gold medal of the new competition with a team formed by Estela Giménez, Marta Baldó, Nuria Cabanillas, Lorena Guréndez, Estíbaliz Martínez and Tania Lamarca.|$|R

From this we develop a combined performance model for academic research and apply the model to Australian research. This model take advantage of, first, field normalized publication rates (the productivity dimension) and, second, field normalized citation rates (the quality dimension). Based on ISI-data the performance of Australian universities is depicted in a more resource-efficient way than competing models...|$|E

The group was detained in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hannover, Germany, for five months before Eichmann allowed them to leave for Switzerland in December 1944. In the 1950s in Israel, Kastner was accused of collaboration and murdered by Jewish extremists.|$|R

30|$|Blood {{collected}} in the tubes with K 3 -EDTA was used for hematology examination, performed with an Abacus Junior Vet Hematologic Analyzer (Diatron <b>Group,</b> <b>Budapest,</b> Hungary). The following parameters of the whole blood were examined: number of red blood cells (1012 /L), plasma hemoglobin concentration (g/dL), hematocrit (%), number of platelets (109 /L), relative distribution width of the red cell population (% of covariance), red cell mean corpuscular volume (fL), mean erythrocyte hemoglobin concentration (pg), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (g/dL). White blood cell subpopulations were quantified and expressed in absolute numbers (109 /L): white blood cells, lymphocyte counts, granulocyte counts, and mid cell counts. The mean platelet volume (fL) and plateletcrit/relative volume of thrombocytes (%) were also determined.|$|R
25|$|The team's {{success in}} Europe {{increased}} foreign team's {{interest for the}} players. Iversen was sold in 1996, and in 1997 Rosenborg sold or lost as free agents, Løken, Bjørn Tore Kvarme, Trond Egil Soltvedt, Jon Olav Hjelde, Brattbakk and Ståle Stensaas. To compensate, side-back André Bergdølmo, forward Sigurd Rushfeldt and midfielder Runar Berg were bought. The 1997 season saw Rosenborg win the league with a record 87–20 goal difference, and qualify for Champions League by beating MTK <b>Budapest.</b> In the <b>group</b> stage, Rosenborg beat both Real Madrid and Porto 2–0, and Olympiacos 5–1 at Lerkendal, and only a last-minute goal by Olympiacos in the final 2–2 hindered Rosenborg from winning the group—in the unusual season that only group winners advanced to the quarter-finals.|$|R
40|$|Nationalism {{depends on}} the spread of {{urbanization}} and, as Karl Deutsch noted, improved communication networks. This means that nationalist organizations tended to appear in cities, even cities dominated by another ethnic <b>group.</b> <b>Budapest,</b> a German-Hungarian town, hosted several Slavic national organizations, including the Serbian Tekelianum and the Matica Srpska. Slovaks furthermore tried to found the Pan-Slavic Matica Slovanskqch Narodov v Uhersku. Thessaloniki, a Jewish-Turkish-Greek town, hosted several Slavic Revolutionary organizations, notably IMRO, the Revolutionary Brotherhood and the so-called "Boatmen", an anarchist terrorist organization. This Slavic agitation ultimately derived from educational institutions: the University of Buda and the Exarchate Boys' Gymnasium in Thessaloniki. The non-Slavic urban environment, however, led these early nationalist movements to emphasize inter-ethnic cooperation. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, patriots sought to claim multi-ethnic cities for their own group, but Slavic nationalists in Budapest and Thessaloniki emphasized multiethnic themes which are often-overlooked within Balkan and East-European nationalism...|$|R
30|$|All the SPECT and MR scans were {{performed}} on a small animal nano-SPECT/CT imaging system and a small animal nano-PET/MR imaging system (Mediso nano-ScanPM, Mediso Medical Imaging Systems, <b>Budapest,</b> Hungary) individually. <b>Groups</b> of two mice were injected with 3.7  MBq (270  μg) 177 Lu-CHX-A″ DTPA-labelled antibody (huA 33 wild type, hu 3 S 193 wild type or hu 3 S 193 I 253 A/H 310) and serially imaged at 2  days post injection. Imaging procedures involved anaesthesia of mice by isoflurane. Each mouse was scanned in supine position with its head secured via ear and tooth bars. Respiration was monitored by a pressure-sensitive pad adhered to the abdomen. The imaging study started with a whole body T 1 -weighted MR scan, followed by a 60 -min SPECT scan which was reconstructed into a volumetric image with the voxel size of 0.3  mm[*]×[*] 0.3  mm[*]×[*] 0.3  mm using the Mediso Tera-TOMO® Monte Carlo-based algorithm. Subsequently, reconstructed SPECT and MR images were transferred to a research PACS system where the images could be retrieved for further processing and analysis.|$|R
