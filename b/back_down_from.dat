5|$|This {{letter is}} seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his {{printing}} presses to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling were printed {{for the first and}} second edition). This amount proved to be enough for Millar to sell, although he had to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> a second printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition to ensure that the originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E

5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E

25|$|In an {{era when}} {{lacrosse}} was notably rough and tumble and players wore no padding, all the while swinging wooden sticks, Lalonde was one never to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the toughness aspect of the game. His favourite tactic was to crowd his check and bull his way through opposition. Along with all his goals, the intensely competitive Lalonde also amassed 45 penalties and 356 penalty minutes during his career on the West Coast.|$|E
25|$|In 9 AD, the Han {{official}} Wang Mang usurped the Han throne {{and proclaimed}} a new Chinese dynasty, known as Xin. He regarded the Xiongnu as lowly vassals and relations rapidly deteriorated. During the winter 10 to 11 AD, Wang amassed 300,000 troops {{along the northern}} frontier, which forced the Xiongnu to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> launching large-scale attacks. Although Han rule was restored in August 25 AD by Emperor Guangwu, its grip over the Tarim Basin had weakened. The Xiongnu had namely {{taken advantage of the}} situation and gained control over the Western Regions.|$|E

25|$|V. acadica queens {{are rarely}} {{aggressive}} towards workers. However in certain situations, queens have been consistently observed {{to behave in}} a more aggressive manner than usual. Often during oviposition or related activities, queens put on displays to make the workers avoid or <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the queen. These most commonly occurred when a worker was trimming a cap remnant or antennating an emerging individual which is a behavior usually {{carried out by the}} queen. In most cases, workers will begin the process of cell inspection but then back down and allow the queen to finish trimming a cap and then to oviposit.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the British applied {{economic}} {{pressure on the}} Japanese by raising their tariffs on Japanese goods. Though Craigie knew that the dispatch of the British battle fleet had been ruled out, he often implied during his talks with the Japanese that Britain would go to war to end the blockade. Through his policy of bluff and divided counsel within different factions within the Japanese government, Craigie was able to persuade the Japanese to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> their more extreme demands, such as the demand {{to turn over the}} Chinese silver in British banks, but he agreed to submit to the Japanese demand to hand over the Chinese suspects.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 1985 Doctor Who {{was placed}} on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC {{originally}} planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade {{was the target of}} death threats) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible to find anyone (at the time) who knew {{what to do with the}} series.|$|E

25|$|In spring 1834, Lovejoy penned {{a number}} of {{articles}} and editorials criticizing the Catholic Church. The large Catholic community of St. Louis was offended by these attacks, but Lovejoy did not back down. He continued his critical writings to include editorials on tobacco and liquor as well. That same year, Lovejoy began editorializing on slavery, perhaps the most controversial social issue of that time. His views were influenced by Nelson, an abolitionist. In 1835, the Missouri Republican began suggesting gradual emancipation in Missouri, and Lovejoy supported this endeavor through the Observer. Lovejoy's views on slavery began to incite complaints and threats. By October 1835, there were rumors of mob action against the Observer. A group of prominent St. Louisans, including many of Lovejoy's friends, wrote a letter pleading him to cease discussion of slavery in the newspaper. Lovejoy was {{away from the city}} at this time and the publishers declared that no further articles on slavery would appear during Lovejoy's absence and, when he returned, he would follow a more rigorous editorial policy. Lovejoy wrote a response to the letter, making it clear he did not agree with the publishers policy. As tensions over slavery escalated in St. Louis, Lovejoy would not <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> his convictions and had a sense he would become a martyr for the cause. He was asked to resign as editor of the Observer, to which he agreed. However, the newspaper's owners released the Observer property to the moneylender who held the mortgage and the new owners asked Lovejoy to stay on as editor.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 the Austrian {{government}} under the SPÖ chancellor Fred Sinowatz had given approval {{to a series}} of plans from Österreichische Donaukraftwerke AG to construct a hydroelectric power plant near Hainburg. Deemed as a project of particular and special interest to the public, the government bypassed and shortened normal regulatory processes to secure quick approval. The plans were deposited and formal planning began in late 1983, with clearing and earthworks beginning early in 1984. However, the plant was to be located in the middle of what is now the Donau-Auen Nationalpark (Danube Meadows National Park) - a large and environmentally sensitive flood plain {{that is one of the}} last of its size in Europe. By mid-1984 a number of environmental opinion leaders, among them Freda Meissner-Blau, started a campaign which sought to overturn the decision. A Volksbegehren (citizen's petition) was launched and a media campaign began to attempt to inform the public of the environmental risks posed by the project. As a leading figure in the campaign, Meissner-Blau took part in the organization of mass protests during the latter half of 1984, culminating in almost over 8000 staging a sit-in at the worksite on December 8, 1984. The government attempted to restart work at the site by using federal police to clear the protesters on December 19, however the events escalated into violence and hundreds of protesters were injured. That evening, Meissner-Blau and fellow environmental leaders took part in a mass protest in Vienna, where 40,000 marched against the government. As a result, the government bowed to public pressure, and Meissner-Blau and her husband were part of the opposition representation that negotiated a 'Christmas truce' with the government. Over the Christmas period thousands made a point of holidaying in the Hainburg area. By March 1985, a citizen's petition with 353,906 signatures against the plant was submitted to the parliament by Austrian Nobel laureate Konrad Lorenz. The petition was successful, and the government was obliged to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the plan.|$|E
