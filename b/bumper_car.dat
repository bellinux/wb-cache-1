25|$|Each fall, Discovery Kingdom opens Fright Fest for Halloween, {{consisting}} of six haunted houses, scare zones, and many ghouls are added throughout the park. Tinseltown Terror haunted house {{is located in}} the park's <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> ride and the Brutal Planet haunted house {{is located in the}} Roar plaza. The scare zone is located between Ocean Discovery and the entry plaza, where cockroach eating contests are held. In 2007, Discovery Kingdom introduced the Wheel of Fright and the Coffin of Fear for Fright Fest. 2007 also brought the addition of the Kamp Khaos haunted house, replacing Brutal Planet.

25|$|Guybrush Threepwood is {{adrift in}} the sea in a {{floating}} <b>bumper</b> <b>car,</b> unable to recall how he escaped from the Big Whoop amusement park. He approaches Plunder Island, which is governed by his love Elaine Marley and under siege by the zombie pirate LeChuck. LeChuck captures him and locks him in the ship's hold. Seeking a way out, Guybrush fires an unrestrained cannon (causing LeChuck to drop a magical voodoo cannonball and explode), finds a diamond ring in the treasure hold, and escapes the ship as it sinks. He reunites with Elaine and proposes to her with the diamond ring. However, the ring is revealed to be cursed, and when Elaine puts it on she {{is transformed into a}} gold statue and stolen by marauders.|$|E

500|$|Buzz Lightyear's Astroblasters at Walt Disney World's DisneyQuest, {{despite the}} nearly {{identical}} {{name to the}} Disneyland attraction, is a <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> style attraction in which guests compete against each other not only by ramming their ride vehicles into each other but also by firing [...] "asteroids" [...] (playground balls) at each other.|$|E
500|$|The 25th piece came {{suitably}} Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} {{to remind us of}} our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show that goes on [...] "for so long we wish we were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installations message, paying homage to the [...] "ghosts of Bowry," [...] as the antique store owner suggested.|$|E
2500|$|Venice Beach is {{a popular}} {{attraction}} where its Muscle Beach used to find throngs of tourists admiring [...] "hardbodies". [...] Today, it is more arts-centered. Santa Monica's pier is a well known tourist spot, famous for its ferris wheel and <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> rides, which were featured in the introductory segment of the television sitcom Three's Company. [...] Further north in Pacific Palisades one finds the beaches used in the television series Baywatch. The fabled Malibu, home of many a film or television star, lies west of it.|$|E

The disadvantage is that these ships' <b>bumper</b> <b>cars</b> take several hours to recharge their batteries.|$|R

[...] Taking a seat on a <b>bumper</b> <b>car,</b> he embarks on a long ride which leads him to Joke-a-lot, a town where humour is dominant ("In the Land of Joke-a-Lot"). [...] The area's residents are astonished when he lands via parachute upon the town square; a female piglet called Gig tells him where he now is. [...] Then a rat named Sir Funnybone arrives at the scene and dubs Funshine the area's long-lost King (although Funshine insists otherwise). [...] Funnybone actually placed the car within the woods so that he could begin to gain his own power; he tells that to his henchmen, a trio of houseflies named Phido, Cleon, and Bidel.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{original}} 1976 Marriott's Great America ride, Rue Le Dodge, {{is known}} as the world's largest operating <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> floor. An exact copy of the ride under the same name opened at California's Great America in Santa Clara, California. In 2005, however, its <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> floor became a one-way traffic ride (as most <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> floors have started doing). To determine the flow of traffic, a concrete island was added {{to the center of the}} floor, removing floor space. This left Rue Le Dodge at present-day Six Flags Great America as the largest operating <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> floor in the world. The floor currently sits at 51 feet 9 inches × 124’9" [...] or 6455 sq ft. Six Flags Great Adventure's Autobahn is the largest <b>bumper</b> <b>car</b> floor, but it has not operated since 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Located at {{the middle}} of deck 15, the SeaPlex is a large indoor gym with a {{full-size}} basketball court that {{can be converted to}} a <b>bumper</b> <b>cars</b> ride. [...] Besides basketball and soccer, the gym can also be used as a dance floor, a flying trapeze school, or a roller-skating arena. The <b>bumper</b> <b>cars</b> in the SeaPlex run on batteries, which avoids the conductive floor/ceiling of the traditional <b>bumper</b> <b>cars</b> setup, though the batteries take several hours to recharge.
