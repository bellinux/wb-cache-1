25|$|According to {{strontium}} isotope analysis, {{there are}} two distinct groups of individuals in Karsdorf but neither were exotic; {{there was no indication}} of individuals who grew up in geologically distinct uplands or further north in central Germany. The first group, composed {{of the majority of the}} males, could grew up in households that cultivated plots on calcareous soils, very probably in the Unstrut valley in the near vicinity of the settlement. The second group, composed of most of the females, could grew up in households that predominantly cultivated plots on loess, possibly beyond the landmarks of the Unstrut River or about 80m above the site on the Querfurt plateau 1–2km away. Sex-specific tendencies, the combination of the Sr isotope data with the results of previous carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, and the similarity of the Sr isotope data of the youngest child with the majority of the males may be evaluated as <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> with the predominance of patrilocal residential rules.|$|E

They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of Easter, in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but he assured her she would be perfect for it. [...] "Then he placed his hands on my shoulders, looked at me long and ardently, and asked: 'Would you like to have a little child with me, Miss Bosse?'

Uttanka says to his teacher: [...] "What can I do for you that pleases you (kim te priyam karaváni), because thus it is said: Whoever answers without (<b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> with) the Dharma, and whoever asks without (<b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> with) the Dharma (the Law in the literal sense of the word), either occurs: one dies or one attracts animosity."Friedrich Wilhelm (Prüfung und Initiation im Buche Pausya und in der Biographie des Náropa, Wiesbaden 1965, p. 11) maintains that similar phraseology already occurs in the [...] "Book of Manu" [...] (II,111) and in the [...] "Institutes of Vishnu". I.e., taking leave of one's teacher and promising to do whatever this teacher asks of you brings, according to the Vedic teachings, enlightenment or similar attainment.
