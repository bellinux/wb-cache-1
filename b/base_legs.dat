40|$|Abstract-Headspace Pco, was {{measured}} with an infrared gas analyzer over an equilibrated goethite suspension to determine adsorption of carbonate species in the pH range 3 to 8. For a 2 g/L goethite suspension in 0. 1 N NaC 104 (- 3 1 O- 4 M surface sites), the fraction of carbonate species adsorbed increased from 0. 15 at pH 3 {{to a maximum of}} 0. 56 at pH 6. In 0. 0 1 N NaC 104, the fraction of carbonate species adsorbed at pH 6 increased to 0. 67. The total concentration of CO 2 in the suspension increased from about 0. 4 to 0. 6 1 O- 4 M in the pH range of these experiments. The development of surface charge at the goethite surface was determined in the pH range 4 to 11 by potentiometric titration under controlled low CO 2 conditions. No hysteresis was observed between the acid and <b>base</b> <b>legs</b> of titrations in 0. 10, 0. 03, and 0. 01 N NaC 104 resulting in a pH,,, of 8. 9. The carbonate species adsorption data were modelled using the least squares optimization program FITEQL for the diffuse double-layer model and the triple-layer model using stoichiometries of the type Fe-OCOOH and Fe-OCOO for surface bound carbonate species. The model results are consistent with separate experiments showing a significant reduction in chromate adsorption on goethite as the partial pressure of CO * was increased from < 5 to 450 and 40, 000 patm. Our data suggest that mineral oxide surface sites which control solid/solute partitioning of metal ions in natural systems may be largely bound to adsorbed carbonate species...|$|E

50|$|At high altitudes, {{there is}} plenty of space for recovery. But during the final approach, when the {{airplane}} is close to the ground, a stall-spin accident is often fatal.
