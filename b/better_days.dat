5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen <b>better</b> <b>days</b> and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} <b>better</b> <b>days</b> ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

25|$|Oral history {{provides}} {{evidence for}} how housewives {{in a modern}} industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until <b>better</b> <b>days.</b> Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.|$|E

25|$|The sudden {{increase}} in the reputation of Partizan team was not followed by {{increase in}} the organizational structure. After the defeat in the finals, club administration failed to operate on a higher level, and Partizan entered a long organizational crisis. All main players signed contracts with biggest Western clubs, and the promising generation was scattered. Milutin Šoškić went to 1. FC Köln, Milan Galić to Standard Liège, Vladica Kovačević to Nantes, Fahrudin Jusufi to Eintracht Frankfurt and Velibor Vasović, who had scored in the final, was transferred to Ajax where {{he would come to}} feature again in the European Cup. Thus followed a period of mediocre results, and for a decade not a single trophy was won. Few players remained from the previous generation, including Milan Damjanović, Blagoje Paunović and Borivoje Đorđević. In a short period of time, numerous managers were in position. The arrival of the talented young players Momčilo Vukotić, who came through Partizan's youth ranks, and Nenad Bjeković from Proleter Zrenjanin, announced <b>better</b> <b>days</b> for the Black & Whites.|$|E

500|$|After {{the breakup}} of the Butterfield Blues Band and no longer under {{contract}} with Elektra, Butterfield retreated to Woodstock, New York, where he eventually formed his next band, Paul Butterfield's <b>Better</b> <b>Days,</b> with drummer Chris Parker, [...] guitarist Amos Garrett, singer Geoff Muldaur, pianist Ronnie Barron and bassist Billy Rich. In 1972–1973, the group recorded the albums Paul Butterfield's <b>Better</b> <b>Days</b> and It All Comes Back, released by Albert Grossman's Bearsville Records. The albums reflected the influence of the participants and explored more roots- and folk-based styles. [...] Although without an easily defined commercial style, both reached the album chart. The band did not last to record a third studio album, but its album Live at Winterland Ballroom, recorded in 1973, was released in 1999.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Butterfield {{began his}} {{association}} with Elektra Records and eventually recorded seven albums for the label.

[...] His last solo album was released by Amherst Records.|$|E

Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E

500|$|When John Singer Sargent's {{portrait}} {{of her was}} presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, [...] "When I am gone, I hope my friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, {{and it is the}} spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. ... We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces..." [...] But, she said, more important would be [...] "the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and <b>better</b> <b>days</b> to come [...] – greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wandered the}} boulevards alone, and spent what little {{money he had}} on alcohol. A series of {{embarrassing}} encounters with English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in <b>better</b> <b>days,</b> drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, {{on one of his}} final trips outside, [...] "My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go." [...] On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: [...] "Terribly weak. Please come." [...] His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. [...] "I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!" [...] "I am sure", Turner replied, [...] "that you must have been the life and soul of the party." [...] Turner was {{one of the very few}} of the old circle who remained with Wilde right to the end, and was at his bedside when he died.|$|E
500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that rings out for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such <b>better</b> <b>days</b> / Days when I can still feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside." [...] DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the [...] "gigantic, sad" [...] choruses, but upon mixing, only four were used. [...] "The extra ones didn't really do anything besides {{make it a little}} more unclear what was going on." ...|$|E
