5|$|Some solid {{performances}} in the early 1930s led to rumours that he would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Australian team in order to retaliate against England's Bodyline tactics during the 193233 Ashes series. However, this never eventuated and thereafter Halcombe increasingly found state selection hard to come by. In retirement he became a well known sports commentator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, providing description of cricket and Australian rules football matches until his retirement from the media in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{mood was}} now so {{volatile}} that Charles feared a full-scale London {{rebellion against the}} monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted {{to the point of}} non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling; there was no question of distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

25|$|Undescended testes are {{associated}} with reduced fertility, increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors and psychological problems when the boy is grown.

25|$|Developing {{countries}} have an informal sector representing {{an average of}} around 40%, perhaps up to 60% in some. Informal sectors feature many small informal traders {{who may not be}} efficient in bringing into the tax net, since the cost of collection is high and revenue potential limited (although there are broader governance benefits). There is also an issue of non-compliant companies who are 'hard to tax', evading taxes and should <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tax net.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, rumours {{had begun}} to surface about the Princess of Wales's {{relationship}} with Hewitt, who was the family's former riding instructor. These rumours would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open by the publication in 1994 of a book by Anna Pasternak titled Princess in Love, which was filmed under the same title in a movie directed by David Greene in 1996. The Princess of Wales was portrayed by Julie Cox and James Hewitt was portrayed by Christopher Villiers.|$|E
25|$|Susa {{underwent}} {{a major political}} and ethnocultural transition when it {{became part of the}} Persian Achaemenid empire between 540 and 539BCE when it was captured by Cyrus the Great during his conquest of Elam (Susiana), of which Susa was the capital. The Nabonidus Chronicle records that, prior to the battle(s), Nabonidus had ordered cult statues from outlying Babylonian cities to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> capital, suggesting that the conflict over Susa had begun possibly in the winter of 540BCE.|$|E

25|$|The Nabonidus Chronicle {{records that}} prior to the battle, Nabonidus had ordered cult statues from {{outlying}} Babylonian cities to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> capital, suggesting that the conflict had begun possibly {{in the winter of}} 540 BC. In a fragmentary section of the chronicle which is presumed to cover 540/39 BC, there is a possible reference to fighting, a mention of Ishtar and Uruk, and a possible reference to Persia. The Battle of Opis was thus probably only the final stage in an ongoing series of clashes between the two empires.|$|E
25|$|Because of its low boiling point, spent HF is {{regenerated}} by fractionation {{within the}} HF alkylation unit. However, fresh HF must still <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> refinery {{to replace the}} HF consumed. The unloading and handling of fresh HF must be undertaken with great care since this operation carries the same risk to the refinery workers and surrounding community from an HF release as previously discussed. Perhaps the greatest transportation risk related to HF is the potential release during an accident while transporting fresh acid from the manufacturer to the refinery. Since no mitigation equipment would be available at an accident site, the consequences could be catastrophic.|$|E

Despite its relative success, however, the IB Middle Years Program (MYP) has not been introduced into the Middle School.

25|$|Archeological {{evidence}} suggests that viticulture may have been introduced to the lands around the Danube by the Celtic tribes, most notably the La Tène and Noricum federation, prior to the Roman influence that came into the area following conquest around the 1st century BCE. Viticulture continued to flourish under Roman rule, {{with the introduction of}} Roman technology and knowledge, even though grape growing was technically banned in Roman territories north of the Alps. In the 3rd century, Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus officially overturned the ban and is reported to have ordered the introduction of several grape varieties to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> territories. It has been speculated that both Grüner Veltliner and Welschriesling may have been introduced to the region during the Roman period.|$|E
25|$|In Western Han Dynasty, {{elaborate}} and lavish burials were common practice. One reason was {{the notion of}} imperishability of the soul: {{it was believed that}} another world existed for the dead, and they needed food and accommodation just like the living. Therefore, the consecration for the dead should be the same as what was provided for the living, and all the necessities in life should <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grave for use in the afterlife. The other was the emphasis on filial piety during that time. In Han Dynasty, filial piety had become an important approach to become an official, and {{elaborate and}} lavish burials are a significant way to show filial piety to one's deceased parents. These were among the main reasons why there were so many precious artifacts in Xin Zhui's tomb.|$|E
