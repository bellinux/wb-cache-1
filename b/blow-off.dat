25|$|The {{control of}} {{turbocharger}} boost {{has changed dramatically}} over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use wastegates, <b>blow-off</b> valves and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, <b>blow-off</b> valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E

[...] After {{being fired from}} her {{corporate}} job, she was reduced to moving in with her former assistant, spunky Terry Reynolds, and starting up a new promotions business as her partner. Terry and her brother Danny shared a loft apartment atop a clock tower in New York City, and Danny worked as bartender at Clockworks, the restaurant below, while he pursued his {{dream of becoming a}} writer. Clockworks was owned by Guy Mann, an average Joe who adamantly pursued Gwen, though she kept him at arm's length (his response to each of her <b>blow-offs</b> was [...] "Oh, yeah!").|$|R
40|$|Past mining {{activities}} {{in the area of}} Silvermines, Ireland, have resulted in heavily polluted soils. The possibility of spreading pollution to the surrounding areas through dust <b>blow-offs</b> poses a potential threat for the local communities. Conventional environmental soil and dust analysis techniques are very slow and laborious and consequently {{there is a need for}} fast and accurate analytical methods, which can provide real-time in situ pollution mapping. Laboratory-based aqua regia acid digestion of the soil samples collected in the area followed by the atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) analysis confirmed very high pollution, especially by Pb, As, Cu, and Zn. In parallel, samples were analyzed using portable X-ray fluorescence radioisotope and miniature tube powered (XRF) NITON instruments and their performance was compared. Overall, the portable XRF instrument gave excellent correlation with the laboratory-based reference AAS method...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{show that}} male {{external}} catheters /urisheaths combined with urine bags are preferred over absorbent products - in particular {{when it comes}} to ‘limitations to daily activities’. Advantages also include that they are discreet (it is easier to keep a personal matter that you are incontinent), your skin stays dry all the time (avoid skin irritation), and it is convenient to use both day and night. Potential complications can be increase in severity and frequency with long-term use. Up to 40% of condom catheter users will develop a urinary tract infection with long-term use. Additionally, 15% of long term users will develop skin injuries including: inflammation, ulceration, necrosis, gangrene and constriction of the penis. Additionally, sizing can prove difficult for some men, leading to dislodgement of the catheter and urine spillage during voiding (commonly referred to as pop-offs or <b>blow-offs).</b> Additionally, 1.3% of condom catheter users will develop a bladder or renal stone requiring medical treatment.|$|R
500|$|... "Gorgeous" [...] is a bluesy, rock-driven {{song that}} {{features}} West's thoughts on social injustice. Other {{topics such as}} sexual exploitation and social disillusionment are expressed throughout the track. It contains elements of The Turtles's cover version of the song [...] "You Showed Me", {{which is where the}} guitar riff is derived. The song opens with a melodic electric guitar chord, erupting into the hook provided by Cudi. The production style found within the song is noticeably more subdued than average West compositions, quietly playing alongside the lush guitar playing. West muses about social issues and comments on his past critics, rapping at a modest pace over the guitar-driven production. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented on West's lyrical presentation on the track and compared him to rapper Jay-Z, writing [...] "on 'Gorgeous' he sneers at the competition, 'you blowing up? / that’s good / fantastic', maybe the iciest <b>blow-off</b> since 'Jay-Z’s You got a little dough? That’s cool with me.'" [...] Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman felt that the song was [...] "broodingly slow" [...] and that it was [...] "driven by piano chords and a questing electric guitar."

40|$|Flame-spread over {{solid fuels}} in {{presence}} of an opposed flow field has received increasing attention over the last forty years, due to its implications in fire safety and combustion of solid propellants. The opposing flow can {{be due to a}} buoyancy-induced flow, forced flow, or a combination of them. A vertical wind tunnel was used to generate flow velocities in the range of 0 - 100 cm/s, against which a laminar flame spread along the fuel sample. The influence of the boundary layer over the sample on the flame-spread rate has been experimentally investigated using cellulosic fuel (filter paper) and PMMA; results show that the actual velocity seen by the flame embedded in the boundary layer (equivalent velocity) leads to a decreasing spread rate even for constant free stream velocities. This behavior was justified relating the residence time, and therefore the Damköhler number, to the equivalent velocity; thus the flame entered in the kinetic regime before it was expected, eventually causing local <b>blow-offs</b> and the complete extinction of the flame. The distance from the sample edge to the point where extinction occurred increased for higher flow velocities, suggesting that a critical equivalent velocity could determine extinction; an easy-to-use formula has been proposed accordingly with results for both fuels...|$|R
40|$|Compressed air {{is often}} the most {{expensive}} utility in an industrial facility, and cost-effective efficiency opportunities in both the production and use of compressed air are often ignored by facility operators. Leaks, inappropriate uses of compressed air, poor choice of compressors and ancillary equipment, pressure problems and poor attempts to solve them, and inefficient controls are among the many contributors to compressed air inefficiency in many industrial facilities. Through utility demand-side management (DSM) {{programs as well as}} their own efforts, Wisconsin Power and Light customers have been able to improve compressed air system efficiency over the past few years. One customer reduced compressed air operating costs by one third ($ 17, 000 /year saved) by reducing air use without reducing production. Another, by monitoring air production and energy requirements of the system, selected a properly sized 75 hp compressor to replace a worn-out 250 hp compressor and paid for the new compressor in less than three years from the energy savings. Many customers reduced air use by replacing open tube <b>blow-offs</b> with air amplification nozzles. Another customer installed a sophisticated multiple compressor control system, saving the cost of the control system in less than four years of reduced energy costs...|$|R
2500|$|... "Clown Stops" [...] or [...] "interludes" [...] are {{the brief}} {{appearances}} of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically {{made up of}} a few gags or several bits. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a <b>blow-off.</b> These are also called [...] "reprises" [...] or [...] "run-ins" [...] by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of [...] "business" [...] usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the artiste by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.|$|E

60|$|Jack had, as they approached, {{gone down}} to the boiler, and had turned the <b>blow-off</b> cock, and the boiling water swelled the strong leathern hose almost to bursting. Then {{he went back to}} the window, threw it open, and stood with the nozzle in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Martineau {{had assumed}} an {{attitude}} of trained observation on the side path. His hands rested on his hips and his hat was a little on one side.

60|$|There was, by contrast, {{a curious}} silence when {{the roar of}} steam died away, and the thudding of the big engines below decks sank to a lower pitch. The men who could be spared went down in a body, and toiled for another hour in a frenzy. The fierce Latin blood was up; {{they knew it was}} the last round, and they would not be beaten now. The {{throbbing}} blast which rushed skywards from the <b>blow-off</b> valve when they came up again showed what they had done, and Austin walked aft, singed and blackened, to his winch, with his heart in his mouth. It must be now or never, for it was clear to him that the men were making their last effort, and the boilers would not bear another pound of steam.|$|E
60|$|Steam was up {{when the}} Enchantress rose with the tide, and shortly {{afterward}} the engines began to throb. Muddy foam leaped about the whirling screw, flame mingled with the smoke that poured from her funnel, and steam roared from the <b>blow-off</b> pipe. Then the clatter of winch and windlass joined in, and Grahame stood, tense and anxious, holding a rope that slipped round the spinning drum. The winch could not shorten it, though the vessel was shaking and working in her muddy bed. It was high-water, the tide would soon begin to fall, and the sweat of suspense and strain dripped from the man as, {{at the risk of}} breaking the warp, he tightened the turns on the drum. It gripped; to his surprise, a little slack came off, and he nodded to Walthew, who was watching him eagerly from the windlass.|$|E
60|$|He again banked up the fires, and sat thinking. Harry {{would be}} at the magistrate's by a quarter to six. By six o'clock Sir John could be on his way to Birmingham for troops; fifteen miles to drive--say an hour and a half. Another hour for the {{soldiers}} to start, and three hours to do the nineteen miles to the Vaughan, half-past eleven--perhaps half an hour earlier, perhaps half an hour later. There was no fear but there was plenty of water. The boiler was a large one, and was built partly into, partly out of the engine-house. That is to say, while the furnace-door, the gauges, and the safety-valve were inside, the main portion of the boiler was outside the walls. The <b>blow-off</b> cock was two inches in diameter, and the nozzle of the hose an inch and a half. It would take some minutes then, even with the steam at a pressure of twenty-five pounds to the inch, to blow the water out, and a minute would, he was certain, do all that was needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blow-off</b> systemInitially, 4 {{rectangular}} <b>blow-off</b> flaps (valves) were installed; {{later they}} were changed to 8 round flaps. Further during the re-design process, specifically from prototype engine V-07 onwards, this implementation was changed to a different, better controllable system which involved an annular <b>blow-off</b> belt.|$|E
50|$|At a given IP {{compressor}} pressure ratio, {{opening the}} <b>blow-off</b> valve forces the IP compressor entry corrected flow to increase, {{to a point}} where the IP compressor surge margin tends to be better. Effectively, opening the <b>blow-off</b> valve lowers the IP compressor working line. Any flow surplus to that demanded by the HP compressor passes through the <b>blow-off</b> valve into the bypass duct. The <b>blow-off</b> valve is normally only opened at throttled conditions, since it wastes energy.|$|E
