5|$|The Churches of Christ {{generally}} {{combine the}} lack of any historical evidence that the early church used musical instruments in worship and the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's worship service to decide that instruments should not be used today in worship. Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services.|$|E
5|$|The magical {{and mystical}} {{side of the}} herbal also lives on. Herbals often {{explained}} plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful doctrine of signatures, the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were similarities in {{the appearance of the}} part of the body affected the appearance of the plant {{to be used as a}} remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary anthroposophy (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy, aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.|$|E

5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E
5|$|The Confession {{starts with}} the {{doctrine}} of revelation, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature {{as well as the}} Bible, but they also believed that the Bible, or Scripture, is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity, that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible, and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture. While the issue of biblical inerrancy, the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are no errors in the Bible, did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration.|$|E

Traditional Judaism maintains that God established a covenant with the Jewish people at Mount Sinai, and revealed his laws and 613 commandments to them {{in the form of the}} Written and Oral Torah. In Rabbinic Judaism, the Torah consists of both the written Torah (Pentateuch) and a tradition of oral law, much of it later codified in sacred writings (see: Mishna, Talmud).|$|E
25|$|A special {{debate was}} sparked by Un om mare. Culianu {{viewed it as}} a direct {{reference}} to Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and his rise in popularity, an interpretation partly based on the similarity between, on one hand, two monikers ascribed to the Legionary leader (by, respectively, his adversaries and his followers), and, on the other, the main character's name (Cucoanes). Matei Călinescu did not reject Culianu's version, but argued that, on its own, the piece was beyond political interpretations. Commenting on this dialog, literary historian and essayist Mircea Iorgulescu objected to the original verdict, indicating his <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no historical evidence to substantiate Culianu's point of view.|$|E

25|$|Although Kabbalah propounds the Unity of God, one of {{the most}} serious and {{sustained}} criticisms is that it may lead away from monotheism, and instead promote dualism, the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a supernatural counterpart to God. The dualistic system holds that there is a good power versus an evil power. There are two primary models of Gnostic-dualistic cosmology: the first, which goes back to Zoroastrianism, believes creation is ontologically divided between good and evil forces; the second, found largely in Greco-Roman metaphysics like Neo-Platonism, argues that the universe knew a primordial harmony, but that a cosmic disruption yielded a second, evil, dimension to reality. This second model influenced the cosmology of the Kabbalah.|$|E
25|$|According to §176 StGB the {{absolute}} minimum age of consent is now 14 years for all sexual acts {{irrespective of the}} sex of the participants; in special cases, covered in §182 StGB, an age of 16 years applies. §182 (2) StGB allows for prosecution as an Antragsdelikt, a concept in German law that certain acts are treated as crimes only if the victim chooses to become a complainant. Further, §182 (3) StGB allows the public prosecutor's office to pursue a case {{on the basis of its}} <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a special public interest. Finally, §182 (4) StGB allows the court to refrain from punishment if, taking into account the behavior of the victim, the wrongness of the accused's behavior appears small.|$|E
25|$|Justice Stevens {{joined the}} Court's decision. He stated, though, that {{he issued a}} {{separate}} opinion only to clarify his <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was the possibility of further debate on the constitutional limitations of a state's ability to punish assisted suicide. As the second-most senior Justice on the Court (after Chief Justice Rehnquist), {{it is likely that}} Stevens' would have written the opinion himself had Rehnquist not elected to do so. This much is suggested by the length of Stevens' concurrence which runs several pages (official format) longer than Rehnquist's opinion. It is possible that the Chief Justice was in part persuaded to exercise this ability by the fact that Stevens' concurrence offers a less concrete view of the state's ability to regulate euthanasia than the majority of the Justices seem to support.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates, for {{the first}} time, {{whether there is a}} {{relationship}} between international trade and international travel flows using time series econometric techniques. Using data for Australia and four important travel and trading partners, the USA, the UK, NZ and Japan, the paper tests three specific hypotheses: that business travel leads to international trade; that international trade leads to international travel; and that international travel, other than business travel, leads to international trade. Using cointegration and Granger-causality approaches the paper finds support for prior <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a relationship between international travel and international trade, and suggests that this may be a fruitful area for further research. ...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{demonstrated}} {{most famously}} and effectively in Joseph Heller's Catch-22, {{the sense of}} paranoia, the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> an ordering system behind {{the chaos of the}} world is another recurring postmodern theme. For the postmodernist, no ordering is extremely dependent upon the subject, so paranoia often straddles the line between delusion and brilliant insight. Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, long-considered a prototype of postmodern literature, presents a situation which may be [...] "coincidence or conspiracy - or a cruel joke".This often coincides with the theme of technoculture and hyperreality. For example, in Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut, the character Dwayne Hoover becomes violent when he's convinced that everyone else in the world is a robot and he is the only human.|$|R
