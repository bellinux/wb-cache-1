40|$|International audienceAdiabatic Shear Band (ASB) may form at {{very high}} speeds with {{materials}} having poor thermal conductivity. It results from the competition between plastic hardening and strain softening and initiates when the latter becomes predominant.

One of the ongoing issues that has been extensively studied is the Generic Safety Issue GSI- 191, which is dedicated to study and resolve the issues that arise after a Loss-Of-Coolant-Accident (LOCA). Fibrous debris produced during the blow-down phase of Loss-of-Coolant Accidents is transported into the sump and becomes an important cause of head loss through the sump strainer, affecting the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) performance. This study was dedicated to measure the pressure drop across randomly accumulated debris bed on the sump strainer along with measuring the debris bed thickness. Two different types of strainers were installed vertically, one at a time, in a horizontal flow loop and the debris bed thickness was measured during the bed <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>process</b> and after reaching steady state. Fifteen tests were conducted to determine the head loss difference between the two strainers and to study the characteristics of the debris bed accumulated on each strainer.

A realistic permeability model for the NUKON fiber glass insulation material was suggested, to be utilized in related applications, the suggested head loss model was compared to other head loss models developed in previous studies. The permeability model was developed from experimental data acquired from approaching velocities in the viscous region. There was no significant head loss difference between the two strainers for the minimum and intermediate range. Based on the experimental data, the head loss difference between the two strainers for the maximum range was about four times higher than the calculated head loss. The flow rate measurement uncertainty was main reason for the difference in the maximum range. There is a probability that the debris bypass could be different between the two strainers, thus, a debris bypass study is required to further investigate this difference...|$|E
40|$|Self-consciousness is {{a product}} of evolution. Few people today {{disagree}} with the evolutionary history of humans. But the nature of self-consciousness is still to be explained, and the story of evolution has rarely been used as a framework for studies on consciousness during the 20 th century. This last point {{may be due to the}} fact that modern study of consciousness came up at a time where dominant philosophical movements were not in favor of evolutionist theories (Cunningham 1996). Research on consciousness based on Phenomenology or on Analytic Philosophy has been mostly taking the characteristics of humans as starting points. Relatively little has been done with bottom-up approaches, using performances of animals as a simpler starting point to understand the generation of consciousness through evolution. But this status may be changing, thanks to new tools coming from recent discoveries in neurology. The discovery of mirror neurons about ten years ago (Gallese et al. 1996, Rizzolatti et al. 1996) has allowed the built up of new conceptual tools for the understanding of intersubjectivity within humans and non human primates (Gallese 2001, Hurley 2005). Studies in these fields are still in progress, with discussions on the level of applicability of this natural intersubjectivity to non human primates (Decety and Chaminade 2003). We think that these subject/conspecific mental relations made possible by mirror neurons can open new paths for the understanding of the nature of self-consciousness via an evolutionist bottom-up approach. We propose here a scenario for the build up of self-consciousness through evolution by a specific analysis of two steps of evolution: first step from simple living elements to non human primates comparable to chimpanzees, and second step from these non human primates to humans. We identify these two steps as representing the evolution from basic animal awareness to body self-awareness, and from body self-awareness to self-consciousness. (we consider that today non human primates are comparable to what were pre-human primates). We position body self-awareness as corresponding to the performance of mirror self recognition as identified with chimpanzees and orangutans (Gallup). We propose to detail and understand the content of this body self-awareness through a specific evolutionist <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>process</b> using the performances of mirror neurons and group life. We address the evolutionary step from body self-awareness to self-consciousness by complementing the recently proposed approach where self-consciousness is presented as a by-product of body self-awareness amplification via a positive feedback loop resulting of anxiety limitation (Menant 2004). The scenario introduced here for the build up of self-consciousness through evolution leaves open the question about the nature of phenomenal-consciousness (Block 2002). We plan to address this question later on with the help of the scenario made available here...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} analysis, dynamic {{modelling}} {{and control of}} an isolated selfexcited induction generator (SEIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine. The voltage <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>process</b> of an isolated induction generator excited by AC capacitors starts from charge in the capacitors or from a remnant magnetic field in the core. A similar voltage build up is obtained when the isolated induction generator is excited using an inverter/rectifier system with a single DC capacitor on the DC link of the converter. In this type of excitation the voltage build up starts from a small DC voltage in the DC link and is implemented using vector control. The dynamic voltage, current, power and frequency developed by the induction generator have been analysed, simulated and verified experimentally for the loaded and unloaded conditions while the speed was varied or kept constant. Results which are inaccessible in the experimental setup have been predicted using the simulation algorithm. To model the self excited induction generator accurate values of {{the parameters of the}} induction machine are required. A detailed analysis for the parameter determination of induction machines using a fast data acquisition technique and a DSP system has been investigated. A novel analysis and model of a self-excited induction generator that takes iron loss into account is presented in a simplified and understandable way. The use of the variation in magnetising inductance with voltage leads to an accurate prediction of whether or not self-excitation will occur in a SEIG for various capacitance values and speeds in both the loaded and unloaded cases. The characteristics of magnetising inductance, Lm, with respect to the rms induced stator voltage or magnetising current determines the regions of stable operation as well as the minimum generated voltage without loss of self-excitation. In the SEIG, the frequency of the generated voltage depends on the speed of the prime mover as well as the condition of the load. With the speed of the prime mover of an isolated SEIG constant, an increased load causes the magnitude of the generated voltage and frequency to decrease. This is due to a drop in the speed of the rotating magnetic field. When the speed of the prime mover drops with load then the decrease in voltage and frequency will be greater than for the case where the speed is held constant. Dynamic simulation studies shows that increasing the capacitance value can compensate for the voltage drop due to loading, but the drop in frequency can be compensated only by increasing the speed of the rotor. In vector control of the SEIG, the reference flux linkage varies according to the variation in rotor speed. The problems associated with the estimation of stator flux linkage using integration are investigated and an improved estimation of flux linkage is developed that compensates for the integration error. Analysis of the three-axes to two-axes transformation and its application in the measurement of rms current, rms voltage, active power and power factor from data obtained in only one set of measurements taken at a single instant of time is discussed. It is also shown that from measurements taken at two consecutive instants in time the frequency of the three-phase AC power supply can be evaluated. The three-axes to twoaxes transformation tool simplifies the calculation of the electrical quantities...|$|E

The excess {{pore water pressure}} can approach up to twice the in situ vertical effective stress in soil around the pile, although this can reach up to 3 – 4 times the effective stress at the toe of the pile [2].

The dissipation of this excess pore pressure starts immediately after the excess pore water pressure <b>build</b> <b>up.</b> This <b>process</b> is accompanied by changes in the stress field of the soil around the pile, where the effective stress of the soil increases as the pore water dissipation proceeds, which in turn leads to reconsolidation of the soil and, hence, increase in shear strength of the affected soil.

This represents an evolution of an existing process, never developed because of several technical problems. The aim of the thesis is demonstrating process feasibility by experimental tests and <b>build</b> <b>up</b> bases for <b>process</b> improvement. Tests had been made using a simple and cheap system comparing to the classic ECM process. The tool had been moved in one unique direction, saving its handling on a plane for future works. Satisfying results had been obtained, though used machining parameters are different to the calculated ones; this is mainly caused {{by the way the}} electrolyte passed through the working area, allowing a not proper current transfer. This last aspect future works will focus on...|$|R

Hautapu dairy factory, owned by Fonterra Cooperative Group, process milk into a range of dairy-based products including; Cheese, Milk Protein Concentrate and Lactose. This project was focused around reducing fouling during the evaporation of whey permeate for the {{production of}} lactose powder. As whey permeate is heated in evaporators, mineral salts precipitate and accumulate onto the stainless steel heat exchange surfaces. This layer of mineral scale, known as fouling, greatly reduces the amount of heat transfer used for evaporating the whey permeate. Once the fouling gets to a point where it is no longer achievable to reach the concentrated solids target, the evaporator is shut down and cleaned with chemicals to remove the scale <b>build</b> <b>up.</b> To decrease the amount of scale <b>build</b> <b>up,</b> a <b>process</b> aid is added to the whey permeate. This process aid A, or PAA, is a polyphosphate that when added to the feed stream gives longer run times. This project was aimed at establishing the chemistry behind the inhibiting abilities of PAA and its interaction with whey permeate. It is known that PAA acts as a complexing agent with calcium when it is added to the permeate stream which prevents it from forming calcium phosphate, the main source of fouling. In the course of the research, it was fortuitously discovered that PAA works very inefficiently as an inhibitor in whey permeate because of its ability to form an insoluble salt with free calcium ions. The consequence of this was that high calcium levels in whey permeate lead to PAA precipitating out of solution rendering it an ineffective anti-fouling agent to prevent further scale <b>build</b> <b>up.</b> As a result of this, alternative inhibitors were considered and tested for their calcium tolerance and calcium phosphate inhibiting properties. From these considerations, carboxymethyl inulin was regarded as the most favourable replacement candidate for PAA. This resulted in plans being set down for a future industrial trial involving the carboxymethyl inulin...|$|R

If the full experiment is computed using the experimentally measured wind tunnel wall shapes, then any errors in the computation of the model lift or blockage will be amplified by the wall that is now “wrong” for the computed aerodynamics [1]. The solution {{is to use the}} same method to compute wall shapes in the virtual wind tunnel as in the experiment, and this will lead to results that are 1 : 1 comparable. The same method can also be used for models in the design phase that do not have experimental wind tunnel wall contours associated with them. This note shows a method of providing the adaptive wall contours numerically, including comparisons with experiment. The primary objective of the presented investigation was to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> a <b>process</b> chain implementing the same wall adaptation algorithm as found in the experiment and combine it with a grid adaption tool to morph the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) mesh like the real test section. This process starts at straight walls without any deflection. Reference points are obtained from measurements in the Transonic Wind Tunnel Goettingen (DNW-TWG). A secondary objective was an assessment of the convergence behavior of the adaptation algorithm at transonic flow...|$|R

Those studies allowed the description of an approximate sequence of stages through which the internal body image is progressively <b>build</b> <b>up.</b> This <b>process</b> involves a steady increase of the representation of internal organs and genitalia or sex-related organs such as the penis,the uterus,the ovaries. During adulthood,contrary to previous periods,metaphorical/symbolical images of the body interior appear, and when an anatomical drawing is made,a schematic very simplified and partial image is the result. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the graphical behavior with relation to body interior in a group of adults, students of SSIS-Lazio (section Human Sciences). The group consisted of 30 students,divided into 14 males and 16 females. 80 % of the subjects have a degree in Philosophy,some of them have a degree in either Psychology or History,or a teachers'college training. Results show that the drawings are divided into two main categories :A) Anatomical type drawings N= 10 / 30 B) Metaphorical/symbolic drawings N= 20 / 30 Almost all males made body interior drawings of type B (13 / 14), while more females (9 / 16) interpreted body interior from an anatomical point of view. Very few subjects (3 females) depicted sexual parts. These results,that seem to undervalue the body and sexuality could be related to the cultural background (Philosophy) of the subjects...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between organizations and their customers {{is a critical}} issue when establishing a long-term relationship. It is difficult for organizations to really manage and main-tain the relationship with their customers as some organizations fail to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> relationships. The <b>process</b> of learning and adapting to other customers is costly and time intensive. This {{is an issue that}} needs to be taken into consideration. Another aspect that needs to be looked at is the way organizations can set up a plan to build a competitive advantage. With this, most organizations do tend to loose their customers due to the inability to use their resources well and also managing them effectively. This paper examines the {{relationship between}} the supplier and the customer and the possibilities of managing and maintaining the customer relationship. Qualitative analysis is used in this paper since it is the appropriate method to meet our purpose. There were two companies interviewed from the logistic industry and mechanical industry. Finally, our result in this paper indicates that in order to maintain customers, it is vital for organizations to meet their needs. As a result, satisfaction and loyalty is the ultimate goal for organization to maintain their customers. This is the way of avoiding key and non-key customers from leaving and also strengthening the relationship...|$|R
