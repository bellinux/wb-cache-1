He had previously written about Superman in the 2007 novel The Last Days of Krypton. Enemies & Allies was published in May 2009 and met with mixed reviews which noted flat characterization <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be entertaining for comic book fans.|$|E

Chris Smith writes in Boy Genius Report that {{just this one}} version of Android is affected <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a popular version of Android (Chitika claim 4.1.1 is on 50 million devices; Google describe it as less than 10% of activated Android devices). Other Android versions are not vulnerable as they either have heartbeats disabled or use an unaffected version of OpenSSL.|$|E
5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone. It's not only {{hard to believe that}} a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> actually would be followed by a movie that was arguably worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E

5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this had included the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically. A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's resolve to continue operating Concorde.|$|E
5|$|Lead vocalist Nivek Ogre {{said the}} band took a {{simplified}} approach, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was a difficult}} record to make. It charted {{on a number of}} billboard charts, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics focusing on whether it was stylistically similar to previous albums.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called the}} film [...] "a {{frustrating}} case, not good but not particularly bad, with a smokescreen of controversy surrounding it and obscuring its real faults.

5|$|The Food Album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, {{many of whom}} felt that the record was an enjoyable collection of songs, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not an essential record to purchase. Despite the lukewarm reception, the record was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it Yankovic's first and only compilation record to reach this certification.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
5000|$|Bangs {{wrote about}} the death of Janis Joplin in 1970 from a drug overdose: [...] "It's not just that this kind of early death has become a fact of life that has become disturbing, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> been {{accepted}} as a given so quickly." ...|$|R

5|$|Thornton {{signed a}} {{contract}} with CMH Records to release the album. Following a contractual dispute, Fanatik J was released from the project. The album's production was completed by the One-Watt Sun production team based upon three completed vocal recordings and older unfinished recordings. Thornton had little involvement with the production of the album. He later stated that he liked the completed product, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> hurt his musical reputation.|$|E
5|$|Through these ventures he {{promoted}} the millenarian view that modern society was degenerate, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be cleansed through an apocalyptic event {{resulting in the}} establishment of a new Pan-German Empire that would embrace Wotanism. Having erroneously prophesied that this empire would be established by victory for the Central Powers in World War I, List died on a visit to Berlin in 1919.|$|E
5|$|After a {{lunch with}} Logan, Veronica notices that the Hearst Lampoon’s offices were egged. Weevil tells her the Dean's office was egged the same night, which Veronica relays to her father. Keith {{receives}} {{the police report}} of Dean O’Dell’s death, but he doesn’t find anything useful in it. Keith interrogates the Lilith house girls, who admit to egging his office, but seem to have alibis for the Dean’s death. However, Keith later informs Veronica that Nish’s alibi doesn’t check out for the Dean’s car <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was likely true for Mindy’s car, putting her under suspicion.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> went the deepest.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not a distinct substance.|$|E

William Hawkins in the New York World Telegram echoed such sentiments, calling Allegro a vast disappointment.|$|R
