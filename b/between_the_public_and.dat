5|$|The castle's deer park, which {{merged into}} the larger Rising Chase, was {{positioned}} behind the castle {{in a similar way}} to that at Devizes Castle. The castle effectively formed an interface between the town and the park; the great hall in the keep faced the settlement, and the lord's chamber overlooked the park, creating a symbolic divide <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private aspects of the building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
25|$|The {{grassroots}} advocacy {{done by the}} Local Council of Women denotes emerging environmental sensibilities {{that are}} representative of larger trends occurring in North America during this period. Samuel Hays associated such movements {{with the emergence of}} an advanced consumer society.

25|$|A {{multitude}} of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors. For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, {{the use of}} force is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent laws are in place; oversight and separation of powers mechanisms are established and working; and the state's legitimate use of force is regulated through strategies and policies. An operational level example would be improved interaction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> the security sector, including freedom of information and complaint institutes.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2006, McKay {{served as}} Parliamentary Secretary to then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale. Paul Martin, {{during his tenure}} as Prime Minister, {{implemented}} a number of reforms aimed at making parliament more democratic. One of these reforms gave greater authority to MPs serving as parliamentary secretary to a Minister, in contrast to their previous role that had been largely clerical with little purview over government policy.

25|$|Casa Salazar-Candal {{is one of}} a {{group of}} stylistically eclectic houses built in Ponce between 1900 and 1915. Designed by {{architect}} Blas C. Silva Bouscher in 1911, the building reflects an emerging tendency to incorporate freely diverse and competing architectural motifs. The facade is distinctly rendered in roccoco and moorish detailing to emphasize its bifunctional character as a home and an office respectively. The portion of the structure designed to shelter the family is refined, delicately ornamented and asymmetrical.

25|$|After {{the first}} revolutionary years, Congress in 1814 elected José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia {{to be the}} supreme {{dictator}} (Supremo) of Paraguay. Under dictatorships of Francia (1814–1840), Carlos Antonio López (1841–1862) and Francisco Solano López (1862–1870) Paraguay developed quite differently from other South American countries. They encouraged self-sufficient economic development, state ownership of most industries and imposed {{a high level of}} isolation from neighboring countries. The regime of the López family was characterized by a harsh centralism in the production and distribution of goods. There was no distinction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> the private sphere, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.|$|E
25|$|The flourishing {{industrial}} city attracted waves of immigration in the 1950s and 1960s. In these decades there were important partnerships <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private sectors, as productive sector support to programs {{of business administration}} at the University of Valle. The growth of the University training professionals and technologists, as well as infrastructure development, were crucial for the further development of industry and trade in the Valle del Cauca.

It proposed strengthening financial law enforcement through a number of measures. These included establishing FinCEN as a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, enhancing forfeiture laws and preventing the structuring of transactions to bypass anti-money laundering and reporting legislation. It also proposed establishing measures to increase the cooperation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private sectors when it came to reporting and preventing financial crimes such as money laundering, along with further measures to combat international money laundering.|$|E

500|$|On the {{assumption}} Roosevelt would not seek a third term, Willkie had been spoken of {{as a possible}} Democratic presidential candidate as early as 1937.

[...] With {{the topic of the}} debate being the cooperation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private sectors, Willkie came across as a businessman with a heart, while Jackson appeared dull. [...] A stream of positive press mentions for Willkie continued through 1938 and into 1939, culminating with a favorable cover story in Time magazine in July 1939. Willkie was initially dismissive of the many letters he received urging him to run for president, but soon changed his mind. [...] Van Doren thought Willkie could be president, and worked to persuade her contacts. After hosting the Willkies for a weekend, Fortune magazine managing editor Russell Davenport became convinced Wendell Willkie had presidential timber; he devoted the magazine's April 1940 issue to Willkie, and later served as his campaign manager. [...] In that issue, Willkie wrote an article, [...] "We The People: A Foundation for a Political Platform for Recovery," [...] urging both major parties to omit anti-business policies from their party platforms, protect individual rights, and oppose foreign aggression while supporting world trade. This piece won him applause and supporters from the press.|$|E
500|$|On August 30, 2000, the EPB sent {{a letter}} to the United States Congress citing {{previous}} attempt at communication and questioning if a lack of response was motivated by the legislators being more willing to satisfy traditional politicians in exchange for benefits. The organization then accused the territorial politics of the United States of perpetuating a crime against humanity by letting Puerto Rico carry with the negative consequences of the status quo. The Macheteros denied that they were motivated by hatred or a spirit of revenge, claiming that such a portrayal in the media and other outlets was an attempt to manipulate the public and international community (Latin America in particular) led by the FBI and the Navy, who publicly referred to the organization as [...] "terrorists", self-describing themselves as lovers of peace that acted against a lack of justice and equality. The EPB also cited its beliefs that the current generation of American politicians had moved away from the founding fathers and adopted expansionist politics. The organization called the Vieques protests a response to the political divisions promoted by these politics and cited it as an opportunity for Congress to change them. Citing that despite being a pacific people, Puerto Ricans are known to fight for what they perceive as fair, the EPB warned that their actions would continue and this was not meant as a threat, but rather a response. The Macheteros then argued that invading and annexing Puerto Rico as part of the Spanish–American War constituted a violation of international law since the autonomy granted in 1897 placed it en route to become a separate entity. The EPB also expressed that the influence of the United States prevent the actions of other UN members. The organization then recapitulated several events, including the campaigns of Albizu, the Blair house incident and the Congress shooting, and their own actions, discussing them as responses to the perpetuation of the status quo. Additionally, the group condemned the militarization of the archipelago and the unsanctioned medical experimentation with the population. The examples given included the devaluation of the Puerto Rican dollar, the imposition of the Jones Act, the illegal experiments with cancer cells by Cornelius Rhodes, the addition of pesticides to the water supply in an attempt to kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the testing of anticonceptive drugs on the unsuspecting public by Enovid, military tests with Agent Orange, a number of massacres in confrontations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> Congress appointed governors, the acquisition of Vieques and Culebra by the Navy, intelligence efforts to monitor and arrest independence supporters and the general public, a covert cocaine plantation with the intention of testing different methods to exterminate the plant and a program that intended to examine the effects of radiation on the local flora and fauna by the Atomic Energy Commission. Concluding with a call to pursue justice or face the consequences.|$|E
