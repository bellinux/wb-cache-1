40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the inhibitory activity of natural products, against growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Salmonella typhimurium (KCCM 11862). Chitosan, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and garlic were used as natural <b>bioactives</b> for antibacterial activity. The testing method was carried out according to the disk diffusion method. All of chitosan, EGCG, and garlic showed inhibitory effect against the growth of E. coli and Salmonella typhi.

40|$|Recent {{observational}} {{and clinical}} studies have raised {{interest in the}} potential health effects of cranberry consumption, an association {{that appears to be}} due to the phytochemical content of this fruit. The profile of cranberry <b>bioactives</b> is distinct from that of other berry fruit, being rich in A-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) in contrast to the B-type PACs present in most other fruit. Basic research has suggested a number of potential mechanisms of action of cranberry <b>bioactives,</b> although further molecular studies are necessary. Human studies on the health effects of cranberry products have focused principally on urinary tract and cardiovascular health, with some attention also directed to oral health and gastrointestinal epithelia. Evidence suggesting that cranberries may decrease the recurrence of urinary tract infections is important because a nutritional approach to this condition could lower the use of antibiotic treatment and the consequent development of resistance to these drugs. There is encouraging, but limited, evidence of a cardioprotective effect of cranberries mediated via actions on antioxidant capacity and lipoprotein profiles. The mixed outcomes from clinical studies with cranberry products could result from interventions testing a variety of products, often uncharacterized in their composition of <b>bioactives,</b> using different doses and regimens, as well as the absence of a biomarker for compliance to the protocol. Daily consumption of a variety of fruit is necessary to achieve a healthy dietary pattern, meet recommendations for micronutrient intake, and promote the intake of a diversity of phytochemicals.

5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the <b>bioactive</b> compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E
40|$|The {{curative}} {{and therapeutic}} effects of Aloe plants have mostly been ascribed to anthraquinones such as aloin, {{and to some}} characteristic b-polysaccharides. Although the actual concentration of these <b>bioactives</b> in Aloe plants {{has not yet been}} fully clarified, it was expected that plant species, age and growth conditions would play an important role. The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between species, light intensity and the content of <b>bioactives</b> in Aloe arborescens Mill. and Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. Aloin was determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry: Its concentration was higher in the leaves of younger plants and there was more in A. vera than in A. arborescens. The content of b-polysaccharides was determined colorimetrically after binding with Congo Red dye. The results were not affected by plant age, and oncentrations were higher in A. vera than in A. arborescens. Finally, even though the type of tunnel (and therefore light spectrum) under which plants were grown seemed to have no effect on the content of <b>bioactives,</b> the plants grown under reduced light intensities had significantly lower aloin and b-polysaccharides concentrations...|$|R

After screening to resolve study eligibility, baseline (wk 0) insulin sensitivity was measured on 32 obese, nondiabetic, and insulin-resistant subjects using a high-dose hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (insulin infusion of 120 mU(861 pmol) ⋅m− 2 ⋅min− 1). Serum inflammatory biomarkers and adiposity were measured at baseline. At {{the end of the}} study, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory biomarkers, and adiposity were reassessed. Participants were randomized to consume either a smoothie containing 22. 5 g blueberry <b>bioactives</b> (blueberry group, n = 15) or a smoothie of equal nutritional value without added blueberry <b>bioactives</b> (placebo group, n = 17) twice daily for 6 wk. Both groups were instructed to maintain their body weight by reducing ad libitum intake by an amount equal to the energy intake of the smoothies. Participants’ body weights were evaluated weekly and 3 -d food records were collected at baseline, the middle, and end of the study. The mean change in insulin sensitivity improved more in the blueberry group (1. 7 ± 0. 5 mg⋅kg FFM− 1 ⋅min− 1) than in the placebo group (0. 4 ± 0. 4 mg⋅kg FFM− 1 ⋅min− 1) (P = 0. 04).
