25|$|Pickton's {{trial began}} on January 30, 2006 in New Westminster. Pickton {{pleaded not guilty}} to 27 charges of first-degree murder in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The voir dire phase of the trial took most of the year to {{determine}} what evidence might be admitted <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Reporters were not allowed to disclose any of the material presented in the arguments. On March 2, one of the 27 counts was rejected by Justice James Williams for lack of evidence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the weeks}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was seated, Darrow became {{increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} outcome of the trial and began negotiations for a plea bargain to spare the defendants' lives. During the weekend of November 19–20, 1911, he discussed with pro-labor journalist Lincoln Steffens and newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps the possibility of reaching out to the Times about the terms of a plea agreement. The prosecution had demands of its own, however, including an admission of guilt in open court and longer sentences than the defense proposed.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to save himself, Mariano had tried to warn Rotu tribe members Pascal English, Neleh Dannis, and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien about the Rotu Four {{alliance}} of John Carroll, Tammy Leitner, Zoe Zanidakis, and Robert DeCanio, but was unsuccessful although he successfully planted seeds of suspicion {{that would lead to}} the remaining Rotu members and all the Maraamu members teaming up to turn on the Rotu Four the following Tribal Council and he was voted out just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> phase of the game began. Prior to his elimination, he provided useful information to Vavrick-O'Brien about possible betrayal by former members of Rotu who were not switched during the tribal switch.|$|E
25|$|In {{his closing}} {{argument}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> on November 17, Baxley acknowledged that Chambliss {{was not the}} sole perpetrator in the bombing, before informing the jury of his regret that the state was unable to request {{the death penalty in}} this case, owing to the fact the death penalty in Alabama which had been in effect in 1963 had been repealed, and that the current death penalty within the state was only applicable in relation to crimes committed after its reinstatement. Noting that the day of the closing argument fell upon what would have been Carol Denise McNair's 26th birthday, and that she would have likely been a mother by this date, Baxley harked towards the testimony earlier delivered by Carol's father, Chris McNair, and requested that the jury return a verdict of guilty.|$|E
50|$|The second law {{reformed}} <b>the</b> procedure <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> of <b>the</b> Assizes. The existing 4 March 1831 law confined {{the determination}} of guilt or innocence to <b>the</b> <b>juries,</b> excluding <b>the</b> professional magistrates belonging to the Cour d'assises, and required a 2/3 majority (8 votes to 4) for a guilty verdict. The new law changed that to a simple majority (7 against 5), and was adopted on 20 August 1835 by 224 votes to 149.|$|R

25|$|News of {{the verdict}} drew {{widespread}} comment and criticism in the Scottish press. Such was the level of public and media interest {{in the outcome of}} the case, on 13 September 2007 the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament took the unusual step of allowing the then Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, to address parliament on the matter. The Lord Advocate read a prepared statement to the chamber setting out the narrative of the Crown case and explaining her reasoning for deciding to prosecute. She is recorded in the official transcript of her address as saying that she was 'disappointed' with the result, and that she 'was of the clear opinion that the evidence that was made available to the court was sufficient to put <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to allow it the opportunity to decide on the case against Sinclair'.|$|E
25|$|With the {{granting}} of full rights of citizenship to persons of Jewish descent under the Constitution of 1923, the League raided the Iași ghetto, led a group which petitioned the government in Bucharest (being received with indifference), and ultimately decided to assassinate Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu {{and other members of}} government. Codreanu also drafted the first of his several death lists, which contained the names of politicians who, he believed, had betrayed Romania. It included Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu, who held several offices in the Brătianu executive, and who was personally responsible for promoting the emancipation of Jews. In October 1923, he was betrayed by one of his associates, arrested and put on trial. He and the other plotters were soon acquitted, as Romanian legislation did not allow for prosecution of conspiracies that had not been assigned a definite date. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> ended deliberation, Moța shot the traitor and was given a prison sentence himself.|$|E
25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecutors}} at Collins' trial, William Delhey and Booker Williams, {{opted to}} charge Collins {{only with the}} murder of Karen Sue Beineman, with the state contending that she had been murdered by Collins {{in the basement of the}} Leik household. In his opening statement to the jury on July 20, Delhey outlined the prosecution's contention that the evidence to be presented would form a clear pattern indicating that Collins had been in the company of Karen Sue Beineman at the time she was last seen alive by Mrs. Joan Goshe and her assistant; that he had taken her to the home of his own uncle, where he had tortured and beaten the girl before strangling her to death at this location; and that he had then discarded her body, before attempting to persuade his roommate to provide him with a false alibi. The two primary questions <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> Delhey stated, would be the accuracy of eyewitnesses who would be called to testify and, ultimately, whether the more than 500 hair samples found upon Beineman's panties matched the hair clippings later recovered from the basement of Collins' uncle. Delhey also stated the prosecution's intent to prove that Collins had had sole access to his uncle's home and basement on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance, and although he had made concerted efforts to remove physical evidence from the crime scene, blood samples recovered from this location were a match for the blood type of the victim. Delhey formally closed his opening statement to the jury by requesting they return a verdict of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.|$|E

The district court held that information about the operations in which Noriega had played a part supposedly in return for payment from the U.S. was not relevant to his defense. It ruled that [...] "the tendency of such evidence to confuse the issues <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> substantially outweighed any probative value it might have had."
