For safety reasons, this requires more equipment than a usual daytime jump and in most jurisdictions, it requires both an advanced skydiving license (at least a B-License in the U.S.) and {{a meeting with the}} local safety official covering who will <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> on the load. A lit altimeter (preferably accompanied with an audible altimeter) is a must. Skydivers performing night jumps often take flashlights up with them so that they can check their canopies have properly deployed.|$|E

I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family.

Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E

6000|$|To avert so dire a sophism, and {{to rescue}} from logical {{annihilation}} so {{many millions of}} fellow-creatures, how many wings of geese have been plundered! what oceans of ink have been benevolently drained! and how many capacious heads of learned historians have been addled and for ever confounded! I pause with reverential awe when I contemplate the ponderous tomes in different languages, with which they have endeavored to solve this question, {{so important to the}} happiness of society, but so involved in clouds of impenetrable obscurity. Historian after historian has engaged in the endless circle of hypothetical argument, and, after leading us a weary chase through octavos, quartos, and folios, has let us {{out at the end of}} his work just as wise as we were at the beginning. It was doubtless some philosophical wild-goose chase of the kind that made the old poet Macrobius rail in such a passion at curiosity, which he anathematises most heartily as [...] "an irksome, agonising care, a superstitious industry about unprofitable things, an itching humor to see what is not to be seen, and to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> signifies nothing when it is done." [...] But to proceed.|$|E
6000|$|There are {{at least}} two ways in which Browning's work differs from that of other dramatists. When a trained playwright {{produces}} a drama his rule is, [...] "Action, more action, and still more action." [...] Moreover, he stands aside in order to permit his characters to reveal their quality by their own speech or action. For example, Shakespeare's plays are filled with movement, and he never tells you what he thinks of Portia or Rosalind or Macbeth, or what ought to become of them. He does not need to tell. But Browning often halts his story to inform you how this or that situation should be met, or what must come out of it. His theory {{is that it is not}} action but thought which determines human character; for a man may <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> appears to be a brave or generous deed, yet be craven or selfish at heart; or he may be engaged in some apparently sinful proceeding in obedience to a motive that we would acclaim as noble if the whole truth were known [...] "It is the soul and its thoughts that make the man," [...] says Browning, [...] "little else is worthy of study." [...] So he calls most of his works soul studies. If we label them now dramas, or dramatic monologues, or dramatic lyrics (the three classifications of his works), we are to remember that Browning is the one dramatist who deals with thoughts or motives rather than with action.|$|E
