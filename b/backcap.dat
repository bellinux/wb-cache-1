5000|$|There are 3 o-rings and {{two parts}} to the bolt kit: a bolt and <b>backcap.</b> Though more {{efficient}} than Proto's other markers, the SLG is also louder and has a bit more recoil. The SLG comes standard with Dye's Hyper3 regulator and wired eyes. Though the trigger frame is polymer, it is stronger than the PMR gripframe. The stock board can go to around 30 [...] and has NPPL, PSP 3-shot, Millinium, and NXL modes. The Dye Ultralite grip frame is not sold separately for this marker, though it comes stock in the new '09 Proto SLG.|$|E
5000|$|The SLG {{was made}} {{to compete with the}} Ion/Vibe/Epiphany/EOS markers which is a common {{misconception}} that the PMR has. The first SLG had an MSRP of around $150, and the 09 SLG has an MSRP of $200. The SLG does not have an ultralite frame but it comes with the ultralite trigger, {{the only way to get}} it is by getting the SLG UL which has an MSRP of $300, although the 09 SLG does, along with a Hyper 3 regulator. The standard SLG comes with a hyper3 regulator and composite grip frame, eye covers, and <b>backcap.</b> The stock barrel is 11" [...] and single piece. The stock board is able to 30(08 SLG) and 33(09 SLG) balls per second and comes with Semi-auto, PSP 3-shot, Millennium mode, and NXL full-auto. It weighs 2.2 lbs. Dye discontinued the SLG for 2010 letting the standard rail take its spot.|$|E
