5|$|<b>By</b> <b>Monday</b> May 8, {{the fire}} {{perimeter}} extended from west of Highway 154, {{in the hills}} burned in the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, across the front country of the Santa Ynez Mountains east through Mission Canyon, Rattlesnake Canyon, and into the hills above Montecito, reaching the area burned by the Gap Fire in July 2008 and the Tea Fire in November 2008. Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. The fire also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect the fire to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced to within a mile of Hetch Hetchy <b>by</b> <b>Monday,</b> August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Madlax and Margaret {{meet and}} {{embark on a}} search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who {{supposedly}} knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured <b>by</b> <b>Monday</b> who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.|$|E
5|$|Snow White {{is saved}} by seven dwarfs, each {{named after the}} days of the week and {{possessing}} the power to transform into a rainbow to move {{from one place to another}} (but are only capable if all seven dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided <b>by</b> <b>Monday,</b> who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E

Many friends of the victims, schoolmates and others went to the Bowie County Sheriff's Office to lend information. Atkins and the other girls from Booker's band talked to Gonzaullas and Presley for a long time. Atkins suggested that Booker should have a saxophone with her and since no saxophone had been found, it became a very important lead. The make and serial number were obtained and widely circulated to pawn shops and music dealers in many states, but her saxophone was not found until six months later. Suspects were continually questioned during the night, but <b>by</b> <b>Monday</b> morning, Gonzaullas said that although some progress had been made there were still many missing links.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{less than}} {{favorable}} forecast for Kennedy Space Center on Sunday that was not expected to improve <b>by</b> <b>Monday,</b> mission managers decided to call up Edwards Air Force Base {{for the first day}} of landing opportunities. There were two KSC opportunities, with two more opportunities for Edwards later in the day. If the first two opportunities at KSC were called off due to weather, Bryan Lunney, Entry Flight Director stated during the Mission Status Briefing that they would take the Edwards opportunities; the weather was not likely to improve, so there would be no reason to delay landing for a day. The forecast at KSC called for thunderstorms within 30 miles of the landing site, as well as high crosswinds, both conditions that would violate the weather constraints for landing.|$|E

25|$|Titanics {{sea trials}} began at 6a.m. on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, {{just two days}} after her fitting out was {{finished}} and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage. The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but <b>by</b> <b>Monday</b> morning it was clear and fair. Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on Titanic sea trials, Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators, and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked, and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.|$|E
25|$|The Danish National Bank {{estimates}} that the occupation had resulted in the printing press increasing the currency supply from the pre-war figure of 400 million kroner to 1,600 million, much of which {{ended up in the}} hands of war profiteers. In July 1945, two months after the liberation of Denmark, the Danish Parliament passed an emergency law initiating a currency reform, making all old banknotes void. A small number of employees at the National Bank had clandestinely begun the production of new banknotes in late 1943. The production of new notes happened without the knowledge of the German forces located at the bank, and by the spring of 1945 the bank's stock of notes was sufficient to initiate the exchange. The law required was passed hastily on Friday 20 July and published the same day; it also closed all shops for the weekend. <b>By</b> <b>Monday</b> 23 July, all old notes were officially outlawed as legal tender and any note not declared in a bank by 30 July would lose its value. This law allowed any Dane to exchange a total of 100 kroner to new notes, no questions asked. An amount up to 500 kroner would be exchanged, provided the owner signed a written statement explaining its origins. Any amount above this level would be deposited in an escrow account and only released or exchanged following scrutiny by tax officials examining the validity of the person's statement about the origins of this wealth. All existing bank accounts were also scrutinized. Multiple exchanges of cash by the same person were avoided by the requirement that currency would only be exchanged to anybody also handing in a specified ration stamp, previously issued in a different context, which had not yet been authorized for use. The exchange resulted in a significant drop in the currency supply, and around 20% of the 3,000 million kroner property declared had not previously been registered by the tax authorities. Estimates vary for the amounts of currency simply destroyed by its owners. All banknotes issued since the changeover date remain valid indefinitely; earlier ones are not valid.|$|E
500|$|Stivers led Kilroy by a 129,852–129,703 margin with 100% of the Election Day precincts counted, {{but before}} the {{provisional}} ballots were counted. On November 25, 2008, Madison and Union counties concluded their absentee, military, and provisional ballot counting and Stivers claimed a net gain resulting in a 594-vote lead. On December 5, 2008, Stivers' supporters won a ruling in the Ohio Supreme Court that the 1,000 provisional ballots that lacked signatures or had names and signatures in the wrong places be thrown out. On December 7, 2008, Franklin County Election Canvassers completed their final ballot count, which included absentee, military, and provisional ballots received within ten days of Election Day, giving Kilroy a victory margin of 2,311 votes over Stivers. This margin exceeds the automatic recount margin of 0.5%. Stivers conceded the race to Kilroy later on Sunday. [...] The late ballots that weighed on the election were of three types: military and overseas absentee ballots postmarked {{by the time the}} polls closed Tuesday November 4 and received by November 14; domestic absentee ballots postmarked <b>by</b> <b>Monday</b> November 3 that are received by November 14; absentee ballots with errors that voters correct by November 14.|$|E
