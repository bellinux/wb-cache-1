5|$|The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, {{the joint}} venture had not {{received}} a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved. The program was saved when Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and Flying Tigers chose the CFM56 to re-engine their DC-8s and shortly thereafter it was chosen to re-engine the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet of the U.S. Air Force. The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both these issues were resolved with engine modifications.|$|E

5000|$|On [...] a turbine <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> at Maanshan Unit 1 {{led to a}} {{fire and}} reactor trip. When the blades failed, the {{resulting}} turbine imbalance allowed hydrogen and seal oil {{to escape from the}} generator. It took approximately 2 hours for the fire to be extinguished, but no systems critical to safe operation and shutdown were affected. The subsequent repairs were so extensive that Unit 1 did not come back on-line for 11 months. The natural frequency of torsional vibration was 120 Hz, approximately twice that of the electrical frequency, so the resulting resonant vibration led to <b>blade</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{tests and}} {{standard}} {{do not require}} that the engines continue to operate after the <b>blade</b> <b>failures,</b> only that no fragments penetrate the engine outer casing {{and that it does}} not vibrate badly enough during its shutdown that it will tear loose from the aircraft, barring other failures.|$|R
50|$|Turbine blades are {{subjected}} to very strenuous environments inside a gas turbine. They face high temperatures, high stresses, and a potential environment of high vibration. All three of these factors can lead to <b>blade</b> <b>failures,</b> potentially destroying the engine, therefore turbine blades are carefully designed to resist these conditions.|$|R
40|$|Blade faults and <b>blade</b> <b>failures</b> {{are ranked}} among the most {{frequent}} causes of failures in turbomachinery. This paper provides a review on the condition monitoring techniques and the most suitable signal analysis methods to detect and diagnose the health condition of blades in turbomachinery. In this paper, blade faults are categorised into five types {{in accordance with their}} nature and characteristics, namely, blade rubbing, <b>blade</b> fatigue <b>failure,</b> <b>blade</b> deformations (twisting, creeping, corrosion, and erosion), blade fouling, and loose blade. Reviews on characteristics and the specific diagnostic methods to detect each type of blade faults are also presented. This paper also aims to provide a reference in selecting the most suitable approaches to monitor the health condition of blades in turbomachinery...|$|R

50|$|This narrows {{down the}} list of {{acceptable}} materials. Metals would be undesirable because of their vulnerability to fatigue. Ceramics have low fracture toughness, which could result in early <b>blade</b> <b>failure.</b> Traditional polymers are not stiff enough to be useful, and wood has problems with repeatability, especially considering the length of the blade. That leaves fiber-reinforced composites, which have high strength and stiffness and low density, as a very attractive class of materials for the design of wind turbines.|$|E
25|$|After {{the engine}} and {{aircraft}} were in production there were several incidents where {{one or two of}} the high pressure turbine blades failed, forcing the aircraft to make emergency landings. An investigation revealed that the turbine section was suffering from a vibration resonance problem, leading to the turbine <b>blade</b> <b>failures.</b> The <b>blades</b> were strengthened and modified to dampen the vibrations. The engine, and the aircraft, returned to service in 1990.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotor blades}} are snubbered. 'Snubbers' are protuberances that stick out {{at right angles}} to the fan {{aerofoil}} at mid to 2/3 span. At speed, the snubbers on adjacent fan blades butt-up against each other to prevent <b>blade</b> <b>failures</b> due to flutter. This particular aspect of the design, together with the second-stage inlet guide vanes in the outer half of the duct, is visible when looking into the engine intake.|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} an {{important}} element in the US strategy for mitigating our dependence on non-domestic oil. Wind energy has emerged as a viable and commercially successful renewable energy source. This is the impetus for the 20 % wind energy by 2030 initiative in the US. Furthermore, wind energy is important on to enable a global economy. This is the impetus for such rapid, recent growth. Wind turbine blades are a major structural element of a wind turbine blade. Wind turbine blades have near aerospace quality demands at commodity prices; often two orders of magnitude less cost than a comparable aerospace structure. <b>Blade</b> <b>failures</b> are currently as the second most critical concern for wind turbine reliability. Early <b>blade</b> <b>failures</b> typically occur at manufacturing defects. There is a need to understand how to quantify, disposition, and mitigate manufacturing defects to protect the current wind turbine fleet, and for the future. This report is an overview of the needs, approaches, and strategies for addressing the effect of defects in wind turbine blades. The overall goal is to provide the wind turbine industry with a hierarchical procedure for addressing blade manufacturing defects relative to wind turbine reliability...|$|R
50|$|Pan American World Airways Flight 202 was a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser {{aircraft}} which {{crashed in}} the Amazon Basin about 220 nmi km southwest of Carolina, Brazil on April 28, 1952. All 50 {{people on board}} {{were killed in the}} worst-ever accident involving the Boeing 377. The investigation took place under exceptionally unfavourable conditions, and the cause of the crash was not established. But the Stratocruiser's engines were known to be temperamental, and it was theorised that an engine had separated in flight after propeller <b>blade</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ceramic turbine. Conventional {{high-pressure}} turbine blades (and vanes) {{are made from}} nickel based alloys and often utilise intricate internal air-cooling passages to prevent the metal from overheating. In recent years, experimental ceramic blades have been manufactured and tested in gas turbines, {{with a view to}} increasing rotor inlet temperatures and/or, possibly, eliminating air cooling. Ceramic blades are more brittle than their metallic counterparts, and carry a greater risk of catastrophic <b>blade</b> <b>failure.</b> This has tended to limit their use in jet engines and gas turbines to the stator (stationary) blades.|$|E
5000|$|Shrouded turbine. Many {{turbine rotor}} blades have {{shrouding}} at the top, which interlocks {{with that of}} adjacent blades, to increase damping and thereby reduce blade flutter. In large land-based electricity generation steam turbines, the shrouding is often complemented, especially in the long blades of a low-pressure turbine, with lacing wires. These wires pass through holes drilled in the blades at suitable distances from the blade root and are usually brazed to the blades {{at the point where}} they pass through. Lacing wires reduce blade flutter in {{the central part of the}} blades. The introduction of lacing wires substantially reduces the instances of <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> in large or low-pressure turbines.|$|E
50|$|In Escape Plan, {{the player}} {{controls}} two characters, Lil and Laarg, {{through a series}} of booby-trapped rooms using the PlayStation Vita's front and rear multitouch panels and motion controls. The gesture-based control system requires players to trace paths for the characters and tap obstacles to move them {{out of the way and}} clear a path for them. Traps range from a single brick lying on the floor to enormous rotating fan <b>blades.</b> <b>Failure</b> to guide Lil and Laarg to safety usually results in a gruesome death.|$|R
50|$|When the {{aircraft}} reached operational squadrons, many shortcomings were discovered. Testing of modifications by the 6510th TS included modifications of the low-altitude range of {{the aircraft}}, which it was discovered to be well short of its proposed maximum un-refueled range of 7455 miles. The modifications increased the {{range of the}} aircraft from 1,300 nautical miles to over 3,000. Other modifications tested were problems with the terrain-following radar system, defensive avionics systems, fuel leaks, Central Integrated Test System, and F101 engine turbofan <b>blade</b> <b>failures,</b> which caused the grounding of the aircraft in December 1990.|$|R
5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the <b>failure</b> of fan <b>blades.</b> This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan <b>blade</b> <b>failures</b> under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|R
50|$|Although the No. 2 {{engine and}} its {{propeller}} were not found, {{evidence on the}} port wing root, the No. 2 engine nacelle, {{the leading edge of}} the vertical stabilizer, and the horizontal stabilizer led investigators to believe that the engine and/or propeller failed in flight. The Stratocruiser's engines and propellers were notoriously temperamental; there had been numerous recorded instances of Boeing 367 and 377 engines separating in flight after propeller <b>blade</b> <b>failure.</b> In this case, investigators hypothesized that the propeller failure caused the engine to experience highly unbalanced loads and eventually separate from the aircraft, precipitating an in-flight breakup. Debris from the propeller and engine may have contributed to the breakup by damaging control surfaces after being flung from the port wing during the failure.|$|E
50|$|The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, {{the joint}} venture had not {{received}} a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved.

The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail.

50|$|On 8 January 1989, British Midland Flight BD092 {{crashed on}} {{approach}} to East Midlands Airport, killing 47 people. The Boeing 737 aircraft {{had developed a}} fan <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> {{in one of the}} two engines while en route from London Heathrow to Belfast and a decision was made to divert to East Midlands. The crew mistakenly shut down the functioning engine, causing the aircraft to lose power and crash on the embankment of the M1 Motorway just short of the runway. No one on the ground was injured despite the aircraft crashing on the embankment of one of the busiest sections of motorway in the UK. The investigation into the Kegworth air disaster, as the incident became known, led to considerable improvements in aircraft safety and emergency instructions for passengers. The official report into the disaster made 31 safety recommendations.|$|E
50|$|Four {{pilots were}} killed in Cropmasters. In 1961 at Deniliquin, Ralph Dennis ran a tank dry in Marshall's VH-MSS and spun in. In 1964 John Waddell pranged VH-BAQ near Boorowa while doing low level aerobatics. In 1965 Air-Culture's VH-CXQ, with Richard Adams flying, struck a tree whilst {{entering}} a spray run at Highbury near Narrogin. Also in 1965 Bill Pearson flying Bender's VH-RPB at Kempton went in from a hundred feet or so, just after lift-off. Non-fatal misadventures included wire strike, jammed elevators after fence strike, getting trapped in a blind gully, Hartzell propeller <b>blade</b> <b>failures</b> and nose-overs.|$|R

50|$|Later in 1943 the 004B version {{suffered}} turbine <b>blade</b> <b>failures</b> {{which were}} not understood by the Junkers team. They focussed on areas such as material defects, grain size and surface roughness. Eventually, in December, blade-vibration specialist Max Bentele was once again brought in during {{a meeting at the}} RLM headquarters. He identified that the failures were caused by one of the blades' natural frequencies being in the engine running range. His solution was to raise the frequency, by increasing the blade taper and shortening them by 1 millimeter, and to reduce the operating speed of the engine from 9,000 to 8,700 rpm.|$|R
40|$|In recent year, many {{failures}} in marine propeller blades of Ni-A l-Bronze for motor car carriers were occurred.

This paper presents the systematical investigations of the main factors affecting a <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> of propeller for a chemical tanker, which seldom occurred in the past time. A few factors were extracted from many causes based on the examinations of the conditions of the <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> and the hull.

40|$|So far {{an impact}} force of {{driftwood}} or high fluctuating stress induced by hydrodynamic force have {{been regarded as}} the main causes of <b>blade</b> <b>failure</b> of propellers.
