5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E
5|$|Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), {{portrayed as}} Steller and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A {{fight on the}} shore is ended when the Prince (Phil Nibbelink), a large and monstrous {{elephant}} seal, appears and warns the two groups that, should there <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a shark lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing {{to fall in love}} with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince.|$|E

25|$|The Nation of Islam, a black {{religious}} and political group, expressed several anti-Semitic pronouncements in the late 20th century. The group's founder, Elijah Muhammad, targeted whites in general, and he also asserted that whites—as well as Jews—are devils, implicated {{in the history of}} racism against blacks. But he did not consider Jews to <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> corrupt or oppressive than other whites.|$|E
25|$|Springtails (Collembola) {{form the}} largest of the three {{lineages}} of modern hexapods that are no longer considered insects (the other two are the Protura and Diplura). Although the three orders are sometimes grouped together in a class called Entognatha because they have internal mouthparts, they do not appear to <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> closely related to one another than they all are to insects, which have external mouthparts.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Semitism, {{like all}} forms of racism, distorts the truth {{in order to put}} a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the {{historical}} objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> violence against any other human being.|$|E

25|$|On November 21, 1896, {{he married}} Júlia Maria de Noronha, only {{daughter}} of the 3rd Count of Parati in the parish of Encarnação, with King D. Carlos acting as best-man. He had quickly been propelled into the higher echelons of the social class: a prestigious military hero, linked to the Royal House of Portugal, married to a noble House, and an intimate of D. Isabel de Sousa Botelho (her mother-in-law), {{who was a member}} of high society that circled the King. Their relationship could not <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> magnanimous: Paiva Couceiro fashioned himself the Nun'Álvares de Magul, while his wife remained at home and occupied herself with the faith.|$|E
25|$|Amon began 1969 {{with success}} driving the Dino engined Ferrari 246T in the Tasman Series that {{included}} winning both the New Zealand and Australian Grands Prix. He would ultimately win the seven race Tasman Series, finishing with four wins, two thirds and one retirement, but in Formula One his poor luck continued. Despite six starts from top-six positions, {{he was only}} able to achieve a third-place at the Dutch GP. Ferrari's F1 V12 engine was too unreliable and although its replacement had proven very fast in testing, it had suffered many mechanical breakages. Amon {{had no reason to}} believe it would <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> dependable than the V12, so although the new engine was clearly more powerful, he decided to leave Ferrari for a Cosworth DFV powered team. Ironically, the new flat-12 engine would become one of the best Formula One engines of the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Wolowelsky {{wrote that}} {{although}} the Talmud appears to have an iron-clad rule that a Kohen should always be called to the Torah first and early practice gave precedence to Torah scholars, the Magen Avraham proposed the then-novel idea that individuals observing special occasions, such as a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, should have precedence. The Magen Avraham's view eventually prevailed, and subsequent commentators, including Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, developed his ideas {{to the point of}} creating various exceptions under which a Yisrael observing a special occasion could sometimes be called first even if a Kohen is present and refuses to waive the first aliyah. Observing {{that it is important to}} be able to tell whether a new approach can be considered a legitimate effort to develop the tradition or an illegitimate attempt to manipulate it, he suggested that changes in traditional concepts of respect involved in the idea of sometimes calling a woman to the Torah based on the Magen Avraham's ideas, may not necessarily <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> radical or threatening to the tradition, from a hashkfic (outlook or worldview) point of view, than the changes involved in developments leading to sometimes not calling a Kohen first.|$|E

500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's not going to <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> from him".

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the first}} episode in which Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon filmed scenes {{together}} and met on-screen. Rheon {{said that he had}} always wanted to film scenes with Jon Snow: [...] "Anyone who has asked me, 'Who would you like Ramsay to meet?' My answer has always been, 'Jon Snow.' He's the antithesis of Ramsay. They're almost a yin and a yang. They both come from such a similar place yet they're so different. And even though they're enemies, they've both risen so far as bastards, which is almost incomprehensible, and now they're both here facing each other. They couldn't <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> different, yet more similar." [...] In an interview, Harington talked about the fight scene with Rheon: [...] "I actually did punch Iwan in the face twice by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it." [...] According to Rheon, [...] "The way I see it, if you don't get hit a couple of times doing that, you're not doing it properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E

500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky, spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online and I read your story, and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E
