40|$|This {{invention}} {{provides a}} toy vehicle incorporating actuators {{made from a}} shape memory alloy material. These actuators {{may be in the}} form of a spring, wire or similar form that has a mechanical response upon the application or removal of heat. In particular, wires may be connected about hinges for doors, hoods, convertible roofs and other such items which, upon the application of heat to the wire of shape memory alloy, causes contraction of the wire and rotation about the hinged joint of the body part. As such shape memory alloy actuators are generally only operably in a single direction, they may be provided in pairs or in opposition to another <b>biasing</b> <b>means</b> to cause the opposed rotation about the joint when desired. The preferred source of heat to the shape memory alloy actuators is through the provision of electrical energy to the wire to create heat through the resistance of the shape memory alloy actuator itself.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of display characteristics on the bias of estimates of whisker length of {{two different types of}} box-and-whisker plots. To test the hypothesis that the <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> of estimates of whisker length were significantly different for the experimental and control groups, a 2. 234 mixed design was utilized. Notched box-and-whisker plots and regular box-and-whisker plots were levels of the between-subjects factor, while within-subjects factors were the interquartile spread, whisker length, and spatial orientation of the graphs. Results indicate that although {{there was no significant difference}} in the <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> associated with the two types of plots, bias seems to be the product of a three-way interaction between spatial orientation, interquartile spread, and whisker!spread ratio.

Four different sources of nitrous acid were considered in the study: gas-phase reactions, direct emissions, a heterogeneous reaction, and a surface photolysis reaction. When only gas-phase reactions were considered in the model, the diurnally averaged <b>mean</b> <b>bias,</b> the normalized <b>mean</b> <b>bias,</b> the root <b>mean</b> square error, and the normalized mean error of the model were 1. 01 ppbv, 98 %, 1. 05 ppbv, and 98 %, respectively.

Model {{results suggest that the}} heterogeneous reaction and the surface photolysis reaction are the most important sources of nitrous acid in the atmosphere, accounting for about 86 % of the predicted nitrous acid. Emissions and the gas-phase reactions were relatively minor sources and accounted for only 14 % of the predicted nitrous acid. Model predictions suggest that the heterogeneous reaction is the most significant source of nitrous acid at night, while the surface photolysis reaction is the most significant source during the day.
