40|$|Through the {{motivation}} of the recent discovery of dispersionless regions in the band structure of the delafossites, a model density of states of free fermions including a discontinuity as analytical anomaly is studied. The resulting temperature dependence of the chemical potential is obtained both exactly and by different approximation schemes which are then discussed thoroughly. This includes the introduction of an approximation of the polylogarithm difference which is capable of accessing a parameter range neither covered by Sommerfeld expansion nor <b>by</b> <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation.</b> It is found that the Fermi temperature and several other temperature scales may be very low, giving rise to experimentally observable behaviours differing from the one described by Fermi liquid theory. In particular, two kinds of apparent Fermi liquid behaviour emerge at intermediate temperatures. This behaviour is related to recent transport data reported for CuCr(1 -x) MgxO 2 [A. Maignan et. al, Solid State Commun. 149, 962 (2009) ] and CuRh(1 -x) MgxO 2 [A. Maignan et. al, Phys. Rev. B 80, 115103 (2009) ] {{by means of the}} temperature independent correlation functions ratio approximation. In this way an effective density of states as well as the effective charge carrier density of these materials are determined. Furthermore, conclusions about the specific heat of the latter material are drawn which presents particular effects of the analytical anomaly. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

Equilibrium fluctuations of flat interfaces are also studied. The fluctuations are empirically observed to be classical, decaying like the inverse square of wavenumber and obeying qualitatively the equipartition of surface energy...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} to employ thermal lattice gas models to {{describe}} non-equilibrium phenomena.

Within the Lattice <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation,</b> we then derive general expressions for the usual transport coefficients of such models, in terms of the derivatives of their equilibrium distribution functions. To illustrate potential applications, we choose a model obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, and simulate Rayleigh-Bénard convection with a forcing term and a temperature gradient, both of which are continuously variable.

40|$|A lattice gas {{model for}} Schloegl's second {{chemical}} reaction is described and analyzed. Because the lattice gas does not obey a semi-detailed-balance condition, the equilibria are non-Gibbsian. In spite of this, a self-consistent set of equations for the exact homogeneous equilibria are described, using a generalized cluster-expansion scheme. These equations are solved in the two-particle BBGKY approximation, {{and the results}} are compared to numerical experiment. It is found that this approximation describes the equilibria far more accurately than the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation.</b> It is also found, however, that spurious solutions to the equilibrium equations appear which can only be removed by including effects due to three-particle correlations.

40|$|Electronic {{devices are}} vital for our modern life. Semiconductor devices {{are at the}} core of them. Semiconductor devices are governed by the {{transport}} and behavior of electrons and holes which in turn are controlled by Fermi-Level or the Quasi-Fermi Level. The most frequently used approximation for the population of electrons and holes based on the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> of Fermi-Dirac distribution. However when the Fermi-level is closer to the majority carrier band edge, by less than 3 kT, it causes significant errors in the number of the carriers. This in turn causes errors in currents and other quantities of interest. In heavily doped semiconductors, it is desirable to use Fermi-Dirac Integral itself. However this is a tabulated function and therefore approximations are developed. Most of the approximation are mathematically cumbersome and complicated and they are not easily differentiable and integrable. Although several approximations have been developed, some with very high precision, these are not simple nor are they sufficiently useful in semiconductor device applications. In this thesis after exploring and critiquing these approximations, a new set of approximations is developed for the Fermi-Dirac integrals of the order 1 / 2. This analytical expression can be differentiated and integrated, still maintaining high accuracy. These new approximation {{is in the form of}} an exponential series with few terms using Prony’s method. Application of this approximation for semiconductor device calculations are discussed. Substantial errors in carrier densities and Einstein relation are shown when compared with <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation.</b> The efficacy of the approximation in the calculation of Junctionless transistor quantities is demonstrated as an example...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{switchgear}} industry {{dealing with}} {{transmission and distribution}} of power is strongly affected by the changing dynamics of climate control. Their main contribution to the global warming is through SF 6 gas, having a GWP of 23500 (times of CO 2). SF 6 {{plays an important role}} in providing electrical insulation for these high voltage systems. So, there is a need to find an alternative ‘green’ insulation system. The search is hindered because of lack of design criteria for dielectric withstand in highly inhomogeneous fields, as seen typically in gas- insulated switchgears (GIS). This needs a physical understanding of charge transport and dynamics under such electric fields. Additionally, the replacement gases are characterized by lower dielectric withstand performance and hence needs solid insulation together with gaseous insulation to enhance the electrical properties. This raises a need to develop combined gas-solid physical framework for charge transport and interaction in such systems. This includes initiation and propagation of electrical discharges in gas phase, interactions of produced gas discharge plasma with solid dielectric surfaces, charge transport though solid material, etc. The thesis focuses on developing a numerical simulation framework of discharge initiation and propagation, incorporating various charge generation processes for different insulation systems under highly inhomogeneous electric fields. The mathematical model of non-thermal electrical discharges in the present thesis is composed of a set of time dependent highly non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) describing charge transport by drift and diffusion under the influence of electric field incorporating various reactions (electron impact ionization, electron attachment, recombination, etc.). The reaction rate coefficients are calculated <b>by</b> two term <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> of electron energy distribution function. Another coupled set of PDEs for radiative transport process (photoionization), provides additional reaction sources. Solid insulation modelling includes additional PDEs for electron and hole transport inside the solid insulation. Charge injection from gaseous medium together with charge accumulation at the solid-gas interface is accounted for. The PDEs are solved by custom finite element logarithmic weak formulation with Petrov- Galerkin stabilization. This method is implemented in commercial code (COMSOL- Mathematical module). Adaptive mesh refinement techniques are used to speed up the calculation time. The developed method is validated against reference experimental data (nanosecond resolved) and published cases. Later, non-axial discharges, 3 d branching, hybrid insulation study cases are presented...|$|R
