The unsteady pressure response resulting from a single vortex interaction is then presented to provide a frame of reference for the twin vortex results. A series of twin vortex interaction cases are then presented and analyzed. It is shown that the unsteady blade pressures and forces are very sensitive to the inclination angle and separation distance of the vortex pair. When the vortex cores lie almost parallel to the <b>blade</b> <b>chord,</b> the interaction is characterized by a two-stage response associated with the sequential passage of the two cores.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{optimizing}} the blade design of miniature centrifugal flow fans for application in processor cooling solutions of portable power electronics. The design parameter varied is the <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> length {{and the resulting}} fan performance is gauged by examining flow rate, pressure rise and power consumption characteristics. The former two of these are measured using a BS 848 fan characterization rig and the latter by directly measuring the power consumed. These characteristics are studied for three sets of scaled fans with diameters of 15 mm, 24 mm and 30 mm, and each set considers six individual <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> lengths. A novel theory is put forward to explain the anticipated effect of changing this parameter {{and the results are}} analyzed in terms of the relevant dimensionless parameters: Reynolds number; chord length to diameter of fan ratio; flow coefficient; pressure coefficient and power coefficient. When these characteristic parameters are plotted against Reynolds number, similar trends are observed as the chord length is varied in all sets of scaled fans. The results show that the flow coefficient for all the miniature fans degrade at low Re values but the onset of this degradation was observed at higher Re values for longer <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> designs. Conversely, {{it was found that the}} pressure coefficient is elevated at low Re and the onset Re for this phenomenon correlates well with the drop off in flow coefficient. Finally, the trend in power coefficient data appears to be identical to that for the flow coefficient. The derived theory is used to correlate this data for which all data points fall within 6 % of the correlation. Overall, the findings reported herein provide a good understanding of how changing the <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> length affects the performance of miniature centrifugal fans and provides guidelines for designers to aid in selecting the optimum fan design for a specific application.

Three sizes of tip clearance (TC) were tested: those sizes were 1 mm (0. 55 % of <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> length at blade tip), 2 mm (1. 11 % of <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> length at blade tip) and 4 mm (2. 22 % of <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> length at blade tip), and those were shown as TC= 1 mm, TC= 2 mm and TC= 4 mm, respectively.

In case of TC= 4 mm, the tip leakage vortex was outflow to downstream of rotor was not confirmed at the small and reference flow-rate conditions. Only at the large flow-rate condition, its outflow to downstream of rotor existed. In case of TC= 2 mm, overall vortex behaviors were almost the same ones in case of TC= 4 mm.

The VGs on the outboard span of the blade were more effective than those on inner sections. For the case of full span coverage, the energy yearly output increased almost 6 % at a site with a mean wind speed of 16 mph. The VGs did reduce the performance loss caused by leading edge roughness. An increase in blade pitch angle has an effect on the power curve similar to the addition of VGs.

40|$|Wind Turbine {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful non-conventional energy sources in today’s energy crisis scenario. But the initial cost of the Wind Turbine plant is very high. The {{manufacturing}} cost of the Wind Turbine blade is about 15 - 20 % of the Wind Turbine plant cost. So it is likely to reduce the investment cost of the Wind Turbine blade by maximizing the service life of the Wind Turbine blades. Different types of loads acting on the Wind Turbine blade and consequential stresses developed in blade are studied. The Finite Element model of Wind Turbine blade is analyzed by using ANSYS software. Fatigue stresses are developed on the Wind Turbine blade due to change in wind speed. The maximum wind speed range (from cut-in to cut-out wind speed) is considered for design of blade as well as predicting the fatigue life of the blade. Morrow’s equation is used for calculating the fatigue life of wind turbine blade. The parameters which govern the fatigue life of the <b>blade</b> are the <b>chord</b> length; <b>blade</b> length and the twist angle. For optimizing the fatigue life of the Wing Turbine blade, the length of <b>blade,</b> the <b>chord</b> length and the twist angle, these parameters are varied.

40|$|During {{the life}} of any gas turbine, blade erosion is present, {{especially}} for those units that are exposed to unfiltered air, such as aviation turbofan engines. The effect of this erosion {{is to reduce the}} <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> progressively from the midspan to the tip region and to roughen and distort the blade surface. The effects of roughness on rotor performance have been documented by Suder et al. and Roberts. These papers indicate that the penalty for leading-edge roughness and erosion can be significant. Turbofan operators, therefore, restore chord length at routine maintenance intervals to regain performance before deterioration is too severe to salvage blades. As the rotor blades erode, the leading edge becomes rough - blunt and distorted from the nominal shape - and the aerodynamic performance suffers. Nominal performance can be recovered by recontouring the leading edges. This process, which inherently shortens the <b>blade</b> <b>chord,</b> can be used until the <b>blade</b> <b>chord</b> erodes to the stall limit. Below this chord length, which varies among engine-compressor types, a decrease of stall margin is likely. After compressor blade rework that includes leading edge recontouring, the blades have different chord lengths, ranging from blades that are near nominal chord length down to those near the stall chord limit. Furthermore, as blades erode below the stall limit, they must be replaced with new blades that have the full nominal chord length. Consequently, a set of compressor blades with varying chord lengths will be installed into each turbofan engine that goes through a complete maintenance cycle. The question arises, "Does fan or compressor performance depend on the order in which mixed-chord blades are installed into a fan or compressor disk?...|$|E

The reason for such a growing interest in this type of power {{can be explained by the}} significant benefits in size and efficiency of power cycles, which use S-CO 2 as a working fluid, as compared to conventional steam power generation. Many areas of application such as nuclear, solar, waste heat, energy storage, and clean coal combustion, are being studied for S-CO 2 power production. Most of the publications discussing S-CO 2 are concentrated on optimization of the cycle’s thermodynamic characteristics, topping and bottoming and have been conceptualized based on the heat source.
