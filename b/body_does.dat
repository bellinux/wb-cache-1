5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the <b>body</b> <b>does</b> not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the <b>body</b> <b>does</b> not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

40|$|O 2 {{consumption}} (VO 2) of anesthetized whole mammals {{is independent}} of O 2 delivery (DO 2) until DO 2 declines to a critical value (DO 2 c). Below this value, VO 2 becomes O 2 supply dependent. We assessed the influence of whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 redistribution among organs {{with respect to the}} commencement of O 2 supply dependency. We measured DO 2, VO 2, and DO 2 c of whole body, liver, intestine, kidney, and remaining carcass in eight mongrel dogs during graded progressive hemorrhage. Whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 was redistributed such that the organ-to-whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 ratio declined for liver and kidney and increased for carcass. We then created a mathematical model wherein each organ-to-whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 ratio remained approximately constant at all values of whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 and assigned organ VO 2 to predicted organ DO 2 by interpolation and extrapolation of observed VO 2 -DO 2 plots. The model predicted that O 2 supply dependency without redistribution would have commenced at a higher value of whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 for whole body (8. 11 +/- 0. 89 vs. 6. 98 +/- 1. 16 ml. kg- 1. min- 1, P less than 0. 05) and carcass (6. 83 +/- 1. 16 vs. 5. 06 +/- 1. 15 ml. kg- 1. min- 1, P less than 0. 01) and at a lower value of whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 for liver (6. 33 +/- 1. 86 vs. 7. 59 +/- 1. 95, ml. kg- 1. min- 1, P less than 0. 02) and kidney (1. 25 +/- 0. 64 vs. 4. 54 +/- 1. 29 ml. kg- 1. min- 1, P less than 0. 01). We conclude that redistribution of whole <b>body</b> <b>DO</b> 2 among organs facilitates whole body O 2 regulation...|$|R

The thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here in part from a serious attendance to the principle that there can be only one truth. Consistency with science, logic, philosophy, and faith remained a high priority for centuries, and a university doctorate in theology generally included the entire science curriculum as a prerequisite. This doctrine is not universally accepted by Christians today. Many believe that one's immortal soul goes directly to Heaven upon death of the body.|$|E
25|$|Nonketotic hyperosmolar {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome) {{is a rare}} but extremely serious complication of untreated canine diabetes, which is a medical emergency. It shares the symptoms of extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration, and lethargy with ketoacidosis; because there is some insulin in the system, the <b>body</b> <b>does</b> not begin to turn to using fat as its energy source {{and there is no}} ketone production. There is not sufficient insulin available to the body for proper uptake of glucose, but there is enough to prevent ketone formation. The problem of dehydration in NHS is more profound than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Seizures and coma are possible. Treatment {{is similar to that of}} ketoacidosis, with the exceptions being that NHS requires that the blood glucose levels and rehydration be normalized at a slower rate than for DKA; cerebral edema is possible if the treatment progresses too rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the churches}} in the Liberal Catholic movement, only the {{original}} church, the Liberal Catholic Church under Bishop Graham Wale, does not ordain women. The position held by the Liberal Catholic Church is that the Church, even if it wanted to ordain women, {{does not have the}} authority to do so and {{that it would not be}} possible for a woman to become a priest even if she went through the ordination ceremony. The reasoning behind this belief is that the female <b>body</b> <b>does</b> not effectively channel the masculine energies of Christ, the true minister of all the sacraments. The priest has to be able to channel Christ's energies to validly confect the sacrament; therefore priests must be male. When discussing the sacrament of Holy Orders in his book Science of the Sacraments, Second Presiding Bishop Leadbeater confirmed that women could not be ordained; he noted that Christ left no indication that women can become priests and that only Christ can change this arrangement.|$|E

25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the <b>body</b> <b>does</b> not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.|$|E
