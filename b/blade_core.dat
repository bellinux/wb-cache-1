50|$|In 2000 and 2001 {{he worked}} at the Gault site in Texas, a site which has {{produced}} the greatest density of buried Clovis artifacts in North America. The Texas A&M team recovered more than 74,000 pieces of debitage and more than 1,300 artifacts, the majority of which originated from Clovis. These included fluted projectile points, bifaces, <b>blade</b> <b>cores,</b> <b>blades,</b> <b>core</b> tablets, end scrapers, and other tools. At this site geoarchaeological methods uncovered a complex stratigraphy of channel, bar, and floodplain sediments and buried paleosols, or soil preserved by burial under new sediments.

These finds were deemed especially important due to their direct association with mammoth sp. and the extinct Bison antiquus. The in situ finds of 1936 and 1937 included most of four stone Clovis points, two long bone points with impact damage, stone blades, a portion of a Clovis <b>blade</b> <b>core,</b> and several cutting tools made on stone flakes. Clovis sites have since been identified throughout much, but not all, of the contiguous United States, as well as Mexico and Central America, and even into northern South America.|$|E
40|$|Bifaces, used as {{specialized}} {{tools and}} as cores, were a primary {{component of the}} mobile toolkits employed by prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups in North America. In some toolkits, however, particularly those in the American Arctic, prepared blade cores were also common. The use of <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> technologies has generally been explained in cultural historical terms (e. g., Paleoindian versus Paleo-Arctic) or in. terms of a simple functional argument-blade cores offer a more efficient means of utilizing lithic raw materials. Through analysis of debitage assemblages produced from bifacial and prepared <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> reduction experiments, we show that blade cores and bifacial cores are both efficient means of utilizing lithic raw materials, yet they differ {{in a variety of}} other ways. These differences are discussed in terms of the costs and benefits presented to prehistoric toolmakers and users. Given this set of costs and benefits, the technological choices favored by prehistoric people· may shed light on the situational and organizational contexts in which these technologies were used.

40|$|Circular saws are {{widespread}} {{tools for}} machining metal, wood or even ceramics. Due to the thin blade and excitation by the workpiece contact of the cutting edges, circular saws {{are prone to}} vibration and intense noise emission. Damping the blade will lower the hearing protection requirements of the users and possibly increase precision. Therefore a new damping concept for circular saw blades is presented in this paper. It is based on negative capacitance shunted piezoelectric transducers which are applied to the saw <b>blade</b> <b>core.</b> The required energy for the electronics is harvested from the rotation by a generator, so that no change of the machine tool is required. All components are integrated into an autonomous saw tool. Finally, the system is experimentally investigated without rotation, in idling and in cutting condition in a circular saw test stand in the Institute for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (IWF) at TU Braunschweig. The experimental investigation shows a good reduction of the vibration amplitude over a wide frequency range in the non-rotating condition. When rotating, the damping effect is lower and limited to some narrow frequency bands. The proposed reason for the reduced damping effect in rotating condition consists in the saturation of the electronic circuits due to the limited supply voltage capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Test {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} at Site 41 CK 193 {{by members of}} the cultural resources staff at the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT). The excavation was completed between November 17 and 19, 1986, as part of a road improvement project along SH 158 in northwestern Coke County. A few cutting implements and a <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> were found by Wayne C. Young of the SDHPT in a general surface collection which he made in September of 1986. Subsequently, four 1 by 1 meter test units and a single 2 by 2 meter test unit were excavated by hand to depths of between 10 and 30 cm below the present surface. The large unit revealed a hearth feature, part of which was visible on the surface. The other test units resulted in the recovery of only a few flakes of chert and no other features were found. No artifacts were recovered with which to assign a firm date to the site. Road maintenance such as scraping along the right-of-way may have removed the upper portion of the site. However, the overall lack of material and features suggests that the site was an ephemeral campsite of limited function.

40|$|A techno-typological {{analysis}} of the chipped stone assemblage from Tor al-Tareeq (WHS 1065), an Epipaleolithic site in Wadi Hasa, west-central Jordan, suggests that significant typological and technological changes occurred during the occupation of this site.

The overlying, undated levels are associated with wide, short, geometric microliths, bi- and multi-directional flake and <b>blade</b> <b>cores,</b> and absence of the microburin technique.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation was performed into the damage mechanisms and failure loads in skinstiffener sections. In the experimental investigation, thin strips {{consisting of a}} skin and single stiffener were cut {{from a range of}} various fuselage-representative panels. There were seven panel designs, which involved changes in geometry, lay-up, material, stiffener shape and the use of co-curing or secondary bonding to join the skin and stiffener. A total of 203 thin strip sections were cut from these panels and tested to failure. The sections were loaded in two test rigs that aimed to simulate the various symmetric and antisymmetric loads on skin-stiffener interfaces in a postbuckling panel. Five failure modes were observed, corresponding to the first damage event occurring at different locations: stiffener bend, stiffener <b>blade,</b> <b>core</b> region under the stiffener, flange edge, and skin. In general, there was good repeatability of the experimental results, particularly when classified according to failure mode, though there was a significant degree of variability in some results. For the numerical analysis, two-dimensional finite element models were analysed, and strength criteria applied in order to predict the initiation of interlaminar damage. In general, the numerical predictions gave good comparison with the experiment in terms of the critical damage locations and initiation loads, which were within the experimental scatter. Discussion is given on the sensitivity of the specimen designs, and how the twodimensional analysis approach has been applied to large fuselage-representative structures...|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} a {{comparative}} analysis of technology of blade {{production in the}} late Mesolithic Janislavice culture and early Neolithic Linear Pottery culture is presented. In earlier literature {{attempts were made to}} indicate genetic connections of int production of both cultures based on similarities of blade cores and blades morphology. The conducted characteristics of micromorphology of these <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> parts, which play an active part in the production process, is illustrated by different ways of half – raw material production. Two methods of preparation of percussion point on cores: 1. Janislavician cores bear traces of abrasion of core processing edge, 2. „linear” cores have abraded but facetted edges. Both ways were connected with different methods of blade production, and as a result blades of different proportions were formed. Differences between cores of both units are also visible in the shape of aking the surfaces of blade cores. What is especially distinct is the convexity which reects itself in the thickness and width of the blades. To conclude, morphological similarities between cores of both cultures seem to be apparent. In actual fact, both units used two different conceptions of blade production. An additional prerequisite for such a statement is a clearly different strategy of halfraw material use, coming from the exploitation of blade cores. In other words – the basic types of tools in the Janislavice culture (microliths, side scrapers) and in the Linear Pottery culture (truncated blades, harvesting knives, end scrapers) needed other forms of half-raw material...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The Quartz Mountain Obsidian Quarry {{is located}} in the Southeast corner of the Bend Fort Rock Ranger District in central Oregon, {{approximately}} forty-five miles southeast of Bend, Oregon. The research of the Quartz Mountain Obsidian Quarry began with a literature search of other quarry sites in the area and the use of aerial photos to determine the survey area. After the survey area was established a ground survey was conducted. Following the survey several key areas were chosen for surface collections that could answer key questions: What types of core reductions were being used on Quartz Mountain?; and What types of materials were being utilized? (red/black obsidian found in rhyolite veins, red/black obsidian found in fist sized and larger nodule form, or large block black obsidian). In order to answer these questions three collection units were established. The lithic material from the units was collected and analyzed and the information placed into a database, which was then grouped for statistical analysis, and generated into charts and tables. The resulting data was then compared to the information found from an extensive literature search to see how the material that I collected compared to those found at other quarry sites. From this information I was able to determine that two different core reduction methods were being used on Quartz Mountain: <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> and bifacial core. Along with the different core reduction methods a mobility strategy also came into play. In this thesis I will use the data gathered to determine the different core reduction methods and the mobility strategies that are associated with them...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} an obsidian cache offering excavated {{near the}} corner of a Postclassic Maya platform structure in Nojpeten, on the island of Flores, Guatemala. The cache consists of approximately 190 obsidian prismatic blade cores and core fragments, but the original number of cores placed in the cache likely fell between 173 and 182, with a best estimate of 177, 178, or 180. The cores were found about 20 cm southwest of the structure in a circular concentration measuring approximately 35 cm north-south by 30 cm east-west and 16 cm deep. The cache is analyzed through a lithic technology framework that focused on three phases: procurement, manufacture, and deposition. Data collection for the procurement phase consisted of sourcing the obsidian using a portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and obsidians from three sources in the Guatemalan highlands were found: Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal. For the manufacture phase, data collection consisted of documenting core dimensions, degree and type of rejuvenation techniques, and the number and variability of platforms, blade terminations, and blade scars. This information was used to examine the prismatic blade-core technology responsible for creating this assemblage as well as to situate Nojpeten blade-core manufacturing within what is postulated for the greater Petén lakes region during the Postclassic period. To address the deposition phase, this paper examined the archaeological context of the cache by exploring the relationship the cores had with the adjacent structure, and the caching behaviors that resulted in this offering's deposition based on comparison with geographically, temporally, and compositionally similar caches. Analysis of this cache provides information on obsidian source utilization, exchange networks, prismatic <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> manufacturing practices, and caching behavior of the Itza Maya inhabitants of Nojpeten during the Postclassic...|$|E
40|$|The site of Rietputs 15 {{which is}} part of the Rietputs Formation, Windsorton, South Africa has yielded the first early Acheulean {{collection}} in southern Africa to have an absolute date. Cosmogenic burial dating has provided the site with an age of ca 1. 60 ± 0. 36 Ma, with the collection’s individual age of 1. 43 ± 0. 23 Ma (Gibbon et al. 2008). These dates indicate that Rietputs 15 artefacts are some of the oldest Acheulean artefacts in South Africa and places it firmly in the early Acheulean. In addition to the diagnostic bifaces such as handaxes and cleavers, the collection contains a number of highly “organised” cores. Out of all the cores in the collection approximately 5 % display a number of features which demonstrate hominids were controlling the working of the core in order to exploit the largest surface, often for a preferential removal. The most common form of organisation is asymmetrical control in which the underside is worked pyramidally so that the larger top surface may be exploited. However, should the largest face be a side of the core accessible with minimal effort, the hominids focused flaking there, producing a single platform core with elongated removals somewhat similar to a <b>blade</b> <b>core.</b> These cores tend to be worked much less on the platform and other sides, suggesting that the blank was carefully selected for its shape. Such early forms of organisation may stem from two factors. First, the hornfels that is most often used is a fine-grained and uniform material which makes for high quality knapping results. Secondly, the hornfels is typically found in “blocky” forms. Such blanks have a number of faces and angles which may assist and even influence the core organisation. Such evidence supports the claim that organized flaking strategies of cores in the early Acheulean needs to be re-evaluated. The reason that these patterns have been recognized in the South African early Acheulean is because of the large sample of provenience-controlled and dated artefacts provided by the Rietputs 15 site. The collection also contains a large number of bifaces that now provide a substantial sample of these diagnostic tool types for a more detailed understanding of the early Acheulean in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|The {{areas of}} {{south-east}} Poland, lying {{within the boundaries}} of today Podkarpackie voivodeship belong to those Polish areas where the Palaeolithic settlement is still poorly recognized. The research on the Older Stone Age has here, admittedly, a long, but very poor history. Therefore, the researchers noticed a large opportunity for understanding the settlements preceding the agricultural peoples in the areas of Podkarpacie after conducting field studies along the eastern section of A 4 motorway construction. However, field work carried out here yielded no breakthroughs. The researchers discovered a few sites where the traces of settlement coming from the earliest period of prehistory were recorded. They registered in general very poor residue remains of the Final Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic groups recorded in a single, specific finds or rare collections. They were usually uncovered beyond their original context, often in decidedly younger fills of features, coming from other prehistoric periods. As examples we ought to mention the Sviderian <b>blade</b> <b>core</b> found in the fill of much younger prehistoric pit (Borek Wielki, site 18), or single tanged point within the cultural layer (Białobrzegi, site 8; Budy Łańcuckie, site 7). The researchers found also other categories of artefacts next to them, which cultural and chronological classification was less clear, though, generally with high probability, we can affiliate them with the Final Upper Palaeolithic Period, which in most cases means their relationship with the Sviderian culture. Such a classi fication is proposed primarily for flint forms bearing clear traces of the production technique; {{in the case of the}} Sviderian blades, it is possible to recognize mainly clear traces of the opposed platform core techniques. They were found for examples at the sites such as Łąka site 1 + 27 or Terliczka site 3. Another group of sites constitute those ones where flint artefacts were discovered, and considered probably as the Palaeolithic forms, and which are so poorly characteristic that their chronological and cultural affiliation is not possible (e. g. Terliczka, site 3). Similar image is shaped with regards to the finds belonging to the Mesolithic Period: they are represented in majority by single finds or their small collections of distinctive characteristics – mainly microlith forms (Terliczka, site 3; Kozodrza, site 6; Bratkowice, site 45). Some of the artefacts regarded as the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic forms occurred within the same site. On the other hand, the region around Trzebownisko village near Rzeszów should be assessed differently. During the excava- tions, the researchers have discovered here three large and rich in artefacts sites of the Stone Age, constituting the multicultural complex of sites: Terliczka, site 4; Terliczka, site 5, Łąka site 11 – 16. These three sites have provided rich inventories of flint lying partly in clusters corresponding to their original deposition. At all these three sites it is possible to isolated flint artefacts belonging to more than one cultural unit among the rich collection of more than 1, 000 finds uncovered within each site. What is more, there are numerous forms which affiliation to the Palaeolithic Period is undoubted. The site Terliczka 4 is situated in the valley of the Wisłok River, and it takes the area of a few hectares in total, but the materials of flint occurred on the surface of only 7 ares. Flint inventories belonging to different cultures classified as the Paleolithic and Mesolithic artefacts were re-moved by natural post-depositional processes, and partly due to destruction made by later, prehistoric settlements. These disorders, although they led to a partial mixing of materials, however, they were so small that it was possible to identify the presence of spatial layout of flints, forming two or three concentrations, partially damaged and distorted nowadays in relation to the primary set. Flint inventories are non-homogeneous. There are four chronological-cultural horizons differentiated: – the youngest one, affiliated to the Mesolithic period without any particular cultural belonging. However, on the basis of the presence of characteristic trapezoidal-shaped inserts, it is linked with a younger phase of that period (the Atlantic period, i. e. about 6000 B. P.); – the Sviderian culture, identified primarily not only on the base of the occurrence of classic tanged points, but also characteristic blades; – the Tarnowiański circle / the Tarnów circle, represented by a small collection of flint, which is composed of two unusual curved backed blades and short end scrapers made on flakes as well as burins; – and the most significant discovery – the Gravettian culture, represented by the cores for blades and also other characte- ristic tools: large backed blades made on blades and samples of smaller dimensions, splintered cores (also called knives of Kostienki type), truncated blades and also common forms such as and scrapers and burins. Another important site and rich in inventory is the site 5 in Terliczka. There were approximately a thousand flint artefacts, out of which around 200 ones should be affiliated with the Palaeolithic Period, very few (several examples) with the Mesolithic Period – probably the Komornica culture and perhaps the Janisławice culture. Flint collection occurred in a limited space. Although the researchers gathered them from the area of 119 ares, but they observed the presence of distinctive assemblages within a smaller space. The most obvious products are those which have distinctive features of the Swiderian technology noticeable primarily in the form of a beautiful collection of typical blade cores with a characteristic way of preparing the material for knapping and knapping itself, and a series of tanged points. The complex of Łąka sites 11 – 16 also provided a series of significant flint materials, out of which it was possible to identified quantitatively dominant Swiderian implements (tanged points) and Magdalenian ones (at least one core and the distinctive burin associated with Lacan burins). What is more, it is worth mentioning that the Palaeolithic sites have not been discovered along the section of the motorway, which runs through the loess areas. Several-meter-deep trenches excavated through the hills have revealed a significant part of the loess profiles, but none of them contained artefacts. Taking into account, that the Palaeolithic settlements were very rare, as well as they were under the influence of numerous destructing processes, and finally it is extremely difficult to find them in the field, the discussed issue should not be surprising. On the other hand, it leaves some disappointment because a great chance of cutting loess has not brought the desired result. However, this does not negate the possibility of the presence of settlement traces in these areas. Coming into conclusion, it is worth indicating that although the conducted research along the route of the A 4 motorway has not yielded many spectacular discoveries, but it has led to a number of important findings. With regards to the dominant character of the settlements of the Final Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Periods, it was identified as poor and short, but on the other hand the results of the discovery of new sites will constitute an important point on the map of Palaeolithic settlement of south-eastern Poland. These findings not only indicate the existence of camps in various episodes of settlement but also provide additional data for the study of the Palaeolithic hunters’ routes as well as the relationship among the various areas of our country and our part of Europe.

Nagytevel is a {{small village}} in West-Central Transdanubia close {{to the city of}} Pápa (Fig. 1). It is {{situated}} along the north-western fringes of the Bakony Mountains facing the Kisalföld (Little Hungarian Plain). To the south of the village centre we find the Tevel hill, a calcareous block mountain within the Northern Bakony. It is built up of Upper Senonian limestone with large siliceous nodules. This locality is the only source of flint in the strict sense within Hungary and probably also within the Carpathian Basin. This flint became known during the geological mapping of the area. Fortunately, the mapping geologist, Dániel Bihari had a good eye for archaeology. He collected some worked flakes from the W 3 sandy sediments around the outcrop. In course of the systematic field survey of prehistoric lithic raw materials in the early 1980 -ies by the Hungarian Geological Institute several surveys were made in the area, though at that time it was difficult to access because Tevel hill was a military ground for Russian troops. After 1989, the environs of Tevel hill became accessible. During the research of the exploitation areas in the Bakony Mountains we paid regular visits to the site. From 2000 onwards, the investigation of the Tevel quarry became more topical as we were excavating the Neolithic settlement at Kup, some 10 kms to the south of the flint outcrop where about half of the chipped stone artefacts were made of Tevel flint. Kup was known to have the most spectacular conical cores, made naturally of Tevel flint in Transdanubia. Results of the Kup excavations were published in a preliminary study as well as a local exhibition. The next step in the analysis of the quarry was a geodetic survey and analysis of archaeological distribution data followed by an analysis of the Bakony workshop districts. Excavations at Nagytevel. Tevel flint crops out in an abandoned village quarry (for limestone) on the north-western side of the Tevel hill facing the village (Fig. 2). As the former Russian military exercise ground was situated immediately over the modern quarry, it was not evident, in spite of the frequent occurrence of worked flint flakes in the sandy slopes that any traces of prehistoric mining were preserved. The intensive study of the area was started with a geophysical survey by Sándor Puszta and his team. The survey involved two rectangular areas yielding characteristic patterns of low and high magnetic signals (Figs 3 – 5). To get an overview of the situation as well as to interpret the geophysical survey results correctly, a 30 × 30 m large area was cleared and appearing features mapped, right over the modern quarry at area (excavation area “A”; Figs 6 – 7). By cleaning, intact bedrock, prehistoric mining debris and argillaceous sediment filling the pits could be observed. It was noted, that bedrock (limestone with more or less flint nodules) corresponds to low magnetic values (blue, under – 5 nT) and argillaceous fill gave the high values (orange and red, over 5 nT). We started to excavate in squares of 5 × 5 meters. Ten squares were started and excavated at least till the surface of the mining debris. We reached the bottom only in two squares. Altogether seven features were identified. The finds comprised large amount of flaked flint, some of them very large and flint nodules/precores rejected. There were occasional hammerstones and a few antler fragments in very bad state of preservation. We believe that we hit the most intensively exploited area of the mine at least among the existing evidence because it is certain that the modern (limestone) quarry destroyed {{a large part of the}} prehistoric mining field. Unfortunately we had to cover the cleaned surface by the end of the excavation, and could not finish all mining pits observed. Next year we sampled the area “B” with less frequent magnetic anomalies. We were planning exploring trenches on the exact spot (line) of positive anomalies and could transect six new mining features (Figs 8. 1, 9, 16). The mining pits at this spot were obviously more shallow and less complex. The method of exploring trenches and sections planted along observed features enabled us to excavate the features completely. In the 2006 pits, shards of the Lengyel culture were also found. In 2007, we returned to the “A” territory. To the south of the area explored we planted a new exploring trench in the length of 25 meters. Five new pits were observed (Fig. 8. 2). In the last year, a new geophysical survey was made. The area covered about 50, 000 square meters, incorporating part of former area “B” and new territories allowed by surface visibility and vegetation, to the south and south-east of the former rectangular square. The newly surveyed territories were not controlled by new excavations, the 2008 trenches and sections remained within the confines of the former geophysical survey, both on territory A and B, respectively. The new trenches (30 m and 15 m long, respectively) were planted almost adjacent to the 2006 – 2007 trenches on the line of observed positive anomalies. Six new features were observed. Two features in trench 2008 / 1 and 2008 / 2, respectively, were sampled for OSL (Figs 14, 18). Since 2007, the area is protected in the framework of “Natura 2000 ” project. Though there are obviously wide possibilities for further excavations, the work was stopped to evaluate existing finds and make strategic decisions about the site. Mining features and finds. The basic units for flint extraction at Nagytevel were simple pits. They were rather shallow at most of the observed parts (an average of 80 – 120 cm), deeper only towards the central parts of the quarry where the pits were deepened below 2 m. At the central parts of the quarry the mining features were more complex, too, involving longer trenches and ridges in between. No sign of shafts or more complex array was observed as yet. The bedrock, wherever it was preserved, started almost immediately under the surface (10 – 30 cms below present surface). Mining debris was deposited in most of the left-over pits. The miners utilised cracks and tectonic inhomogeneities of the rocks. In several cases, a monolith-like columnar object was observed across the pits or cuts which can be related to mining technique. Traces of fire is suspected as a means for facilitating extraction, documented by remains of greyish lilac ash and compact lime. The structure of the mine is best seen on the geophysical map: croissant-form blocks of bedrock were left among the pits and ridges, probably to support sediments and prevent slide on the steep slope. Most of the finds are naturally flint debris, partly worked. Some of the flakes are of very large size like the pieces found in Feature 2005 / 2 (Fig. 15). Many of the pieces can be refitted, though not all of the refittings can be considered intentional flaking. The mining tools are relatively scarcely represented; mainly hammerstones and very few and badly deteriorated antler pics, also recovered from the deepest part of the flint mine excavated so far, i. e. Feature 2005 / 2. Few but very important Late Neolithic shards were found in Features 2006 / 1 and 2007 / 1. Chipping floors were identified in some of the large features filled with argillaceous sediments over the barren debris. This is interpreted as a secondary use of the abandoned mining pits. Worked flakes are frequent in the sand and the surface surrounding the quarry area, though not in their original position. The most likely form of the Tevel quarry products was precore or core (<b>blade</b> <b>core),</b> but a lot more analysis is needed to specify the work-flow on the site. The minimal extent of the mining field, according to the geophysical survey, can be estimated at 10 hectares. The maximal extent can be estimated on the basis of the geological mapping data as 1 – 3 km 2 (Fig. 19), i. e. the distribution of the flint-bearing layers. Dating the mining features. The mining features are very difficult to date. The flaking is not really characteristic chronologically and we have very little dateable evidence. Prior to the excavations, the known distribution data and the evidence of the most significant settlement where Tevel flint was used and procured in large quantities (Kup-Egyes) indicated a peak in production, and, probably, exploitation during the Transdanubian LBC and the Lengyel cultures. The most evident proofs of prehistoric mining activity are the Neolithic shards found in some of the trenches and extraction pits. So far, only Late Neolithic shards were found probably belonging to the Lengyel Culture. In the last year of the excavations, samples were taken for OSL dating (Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dating). This method can measure the last time the sediments were irradiated by natural light. The underlying principles are similar to the better known TL dating. OSL is widely used now to date sandy layers and sediments. The results were presented on the conference of Mineralogy and Petrology, Budapest (Thamó-Bozsó–Biró 2009, Table 1). The dates obtained are consistent with the indirect evidence of flint distribution data and the scanty evidence of pottery found in the mining features. Distribution data. Tevel flint is an important regional raw material. It contributes to the chipped stone raw material stock of Transdanubia at least 5...|$|E

It is important to note that <b>blade</b> <b>cores</b> appear and are different from regular flaking cores, as each core's conchoidal nature is suited for different types of flaking. Blades are created using stones that have a cryptocrystalline [...] structure and easily be fractured into a smooth piece without fracturing. Blades became the favored technology of the Upper Palaeolithic era, although they are occasionally found in earlier periods. Different techniques are also required for blade creation; a soft punch or hammerstone is necessary for creating a blade.|$|R
50|$|A blade {{is defined}} as a flake with {{parallel}} or subparallel margins that is usually at least twice {{as long as it is}} wide. There are numerous specialized types of blade flakes. Channel flakes are characteristic flakes caused by the fluting of certain Paleo-Indian projectile points; such fluting produced grooves in the projectile points which may have facilitated hafting. Prismatic blades are long, narrow specialized blades with parallel margins which may be removed from polyhedral <b>blade</b> <b>cores,</b> another common lithic feature of Paleo-Indian lithic culture. Prismatic blades are often triangular in cross section with several facets or flake scars on the dorsal surface.

50|$|Flint {{was known}} and {{exploited}} by {{the inhabitants of}} the Indus Valley Civilization by the 3rd millennium BCE. P. Biagi and M. Cremaschi of Milan University discovered a number of Harappan quarries in archaeological excavations dating between 1985-1986. Biagi (2008) describes the quarries: 'From the surface the quarries consisted of almost circular empty areas, representing the quarry-pits, filled with aeolian sand, blown from the Thar Desert dunes, and heaps of limestone block, deriving from the prehistoric mining activity. All around these structures flint workshops were noticed, represented by scatters of flint flakes and blades among which typical Harappan-elongated <b>blade</b> <b>cores</b> and characteristic bullet cores with very narrow bladelet detachments.' Between 1995 and 1998, Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating of Zyzyphus cf. nummularia charcoal found in the quarries has yielded evidence that the activity continued into 1870-1800 BCE.|$|R
