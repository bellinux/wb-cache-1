5|$|Humans host {{three species}} of louse, the head louse, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> and the pubic louse. The <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> has the {{smallest}} genome of any known insect; {{it has been}} used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 the Harvard medical {{researcher}} Hans Zinsser {{wrote the}} book Rats, Lice and History, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern view is that only the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> can transmit the disease.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> Pediculus humanus humanus has (2010) the {{smallest}} insect genome known. This louse can transmit certain diseases while the human head louse (P. h. capitis), {{to which it}} is closely related, cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head <b>lice</b> and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> live on clothing and feed on the <b>body.</b> Because <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{status of}} the head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> of humans has been debated for more than 200 yr. To clarify the specific status of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> we sequenced 524 base pairs (bp) of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of 28 head and 28 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from nine countries. Ten haplotypes that differed by 1 - 5 bp at II nucleotide positions were identified. A phylogeny of these sequences indicates that these head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are not from reciprocally monophyletic lineages. Indeed, head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> share three of the 10 haplotypes we found. F-ST values and exact tests of haplotype frequencies showed significant differences between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> However, the same tests also showed significant differences among lice from different countries. Indeed, more of the variation in haplotype frequencies was explained by differences among lice from different countries than by differences between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> Our results indicate the following: (1) bead and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> do not represent reciprocally monophyletic lineages and are conspecific; (2) gene flow among populations of lice from different countries is limited; and (3) frequencies of COI haplotypes can be used to study maternal gene flow among populations of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> and thus transmission of lice among their human hosts...|$|R
40|$|Homeless {{persons in}} San Francisco, California, USA,have {{been shown to}} have head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> infestations and Bartonella quintana infections. We {{surveyed}} a self selected population of homeless persons in San Francisco to assess infestations of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> risks of having <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and presence of B. quintana in lice. A total of 203 persons who reported itching were surveyed during 2008 - 2010 and 2012 : 60 (30 %) had <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> 10 (4. 9 %) had head lice, and 6 (3. 0 %) had both. B. quintana was detected in 10 (15. 9 %) of 63 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> pools and in 6 (37. 5 %) of 16 head lice pools. Variables significantly associated(p< 0. 05) with having <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> in this homeless population included male sex, African-American ethnicity, and sleeping outdoors. Our study findings suggest that specific segments of the homeless population would benefit from information on preventing <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> infestations and louse borne diseases...|$|R
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
25|$|Epidemic typhus {{is a form}} of typhus {{so named}} because the disease often causes {{epidemics}} following wars and natural disasters. The causative organism is Rickettsia prowazekii, transmitted by the human <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus).|$|E
25|$|Head lice (especially in children) have been, {{and still}} are, subject to various {{eradication}} campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice {{are not the}} vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, {{and they have been}} regarded by some as essentially a cosmetic rather than a medical problem. Head lice infestations might be beneficial in helping to foster a natural immune response against lice which helps humans in defense against the far more dangerous <b>body</b> <b>louse,</b> which is capable of transmission of dangerous diseases.|$|E
40|$|Using {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} and sequencing, we investigated the prevalence of Rickettsia prowazekii, Bartonella quintana, and Borrelia recurrentis in 841 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> collected from various countries. We detected R. prowazekii in <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from Burundi in 1997 and in lice from Burundi and Rwanda in 2001; B. quintana infections of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> were widespread.

40|$|Reciprocal {{selective}} effects between coevolving {{species are}} often influenced by {{interactions with the}} broader ecological community. Community-level interactions may also influence macroevolutionary patterns of coevolution, such as cospeciation, but this hypothesis has received little attention. We studied two groups of ecologically similar feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that differ in their patterns of association with a single group of hosts. The two groups, “body lice” and “wing lice,” are both parasites of pigeons and doves (Columbiformes). <b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> are more host-specific and show greater population genetic structure than wing lice. The macroevolutionary history of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> also parallels that of their columbiform hosts more closely than does the evolutionary history of wing lice. The closer association of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> with hosts, compared with wing lice, can be explained if <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are less capable of switching hosts than wing lice. Wing lice sometimes disperse phoretically on parasitic flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), but <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> seldom engage in this behavior. We tested the hypothesis that wing lice switch host species more often than <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and that the difference is governed by phoresis. Our results show that, where flies are present, wing lice switch to novel host species in sufficient numbers to establish viable populations on the new host. <b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> do not switch hosts, even where flies are present. Thus, differences in the coevolutionary history of wing and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> {{can be explained by}} differences in host-switching, mediated {{by a member of the}} broader parasite community...|$|R
40|$|Genomic and {{transcriptomics}} analyses {{have revealed}} human head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> {{to be almost}} genetically identical; although con-specific, they nevertheless occupy distinct ecological niches and have differing feeding patterns. Most importantly, while head lice are not known to be vector competent, <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> can transmit three serious bacterial diseases; epidemictyphus, trench fever, and relapsing fever. In order to gain insights into the molecular bases for these differences, we analyzed alternative splicing (AS) using next-generation sequencing data for one strain of head lice and one strain of <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> We identified a total of 3, 598 AS events which were head or <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> specific. Exon skipping AS events were overrepresented among both head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> whereas intron retention events were underrepresented in both. However, both the enrichment of exon skipping and the underrepresentation of intron retention are significantly stronger in <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> compared with head <b>lice.</b> Genes containing <b>body</b> louse-specific AS events {{were found to be}} significantly enriched for functions associated with development of the nervous system, salivary gland, trachea, and ovarian follicle cells, as well as regulation of transcription. In contrast, no functional categories were overrepresented among genes with head louse-specific AS events. Together, our results constitute the first evidence for transcript pool differences in head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> providing insights into molecular adaptations that enabled human lice to adapt to clothing, and representing a powerful illustration of the pivotal role AS can play in functional adaptation...|$|R
25|$|The nondisease-carrying {{head louse}} {{differs from the}} related disease-carrying <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two {{subspecies}} are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed, although they will do so in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies, they {{are thought to have}} diverged as subspecies about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing. A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis), also infests humans. It is visually different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. Lice infestation of any part of the body is known as pediculosis.|$|E

50|$|Pigeons and doves are {{parasitised}} by {{two major}} groups of lice; wing <b>lice</b> and <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> Most birds are host to both groups, which eat the downy parts of feathers that {{are close to}} the <b>body.</b> <b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> {{have been found to be}} more likely to be host specific than wing lice, possibly due to their host ecology where terrestrial pigeons feeding on the ground may create an easier transfer of lice and therefore be more likely to carry host specific <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> than arboreal birds.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{population}} genetics of the louse infestations of humans. We used microsatellite DNA to study 11 double infestations, that is, hosts infested with head <b>lice</b> and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> simultaneously. We tested for population structure on a host, and for population structure among seven hosts that shared sleeping quarters. We also sought evidence of migration among louse populations. Our results showed that: (i) the head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> on these individual hosts were two genetically distinct populations; (ii) each host had their own populations of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> that were genetically distinct to those on other hosts; and (iii) lice had migrated from head to head, and from body to body, but not between heads and bodies.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the presence of}} Bartonella quintana in head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from persons in different locations in Ethiopia, we used molecular methods. B. quintana was found in 19 (7 %) genotype C head lice and in 76 (18 %) genotype A <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> B. quintana in head lice was positively linked to altitude (p = 0. 014). Head (Pediculus humanus capitis de Geer) and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus Linnaeus) have been parasites of humans {{for thousands of years}} (1). Genetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have found 3 phylotypes of P. humanus (2, 3). Clade A is the most common genotype with worldwide distribution and is found among both head and <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> Clade B comprises only head lice and has been found in South America, Europe, and Australia, whereas clade C comprises only head lice from Ethiopia and Nepal (2, 4, 5).

However, B. quintana has been identified in head lice from homeless children in Nepal (7), in head lice from homeless adults in San Francisco, California, USA (8), and recently in head lice nits from a homeless man in Marseille, France (9).

40|$|Objective: Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that parasites evolve increased host specialization over time. Host specificity, which describes {{the number of}} host species parasitized, is one aspect of host specialization. Recent studies of vertebrate parasites indicate that highly host-specific parasite lineages are not, in fact, evolutionary dead ends; host generalists can evolve from host specialists. Methods:Using phylogenetic reconstructionmethods, we evaluate these patterns in the <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> (Insecta: Phthiraptera) of pigeons and doves, which are permanent ectoparasites that complete their entire life cycle {{on the body of}} the host. Results:We find that species of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> that parasitize more than one species of host (generalists) are invariably derived from lice parasitizing only one species of host (specialists). A previous study of the wing lice of pigeons and doves also found that generalists were derived from specialists, and that these changes were correlated with the presence of a potentially competing species of wing louse on the same host. For body licewe did not find such a correlation with competition. Instead, the evolution of host generalists in <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> was correlated with host ecology. When we compared <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> that parasitize terrestrial versus arboreal hosts, we found that the evolution of host generalists was associated with terrestrial hosts. In contrast, wing lice showed no correlation between the evolution of generalists and host ecology. Conclusion: The correlation in <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> {{suggests that}} dispersal between host species may occur via the ground. This, in turn, suggests that <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> may fall to the ground more often than wing lice. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a...|$|R
