He appears to live life in his own dream world where his family is stereotypical- his wife is faithful, his son is normal, his daughter is straight and doing well at school, and Brighton is the perfect escape from London.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the public health relevance of the prevalence of dental fear in Kuwait and the resultant barrier that it creates regarding access to dental care. The study analysis demonstrated a high prevalence of dental fear and anxiety in the Kuwaiti population and a perceived need for anesthesia services by dental care providers. The telephone survey of the general population showed nearly 35 % of respondents reported <b>being</b> somewhat <b>nervous,</b> <b>very</b> <b>nervous,</b> or terrified about going to the dentist. In addition, about 36 % of the population postponed their dental treatment because of fear. Respondents showed a preference to receive sedation and anesthesia services as a means of anxiety relief, and they were willing to go to the dentist more often when such services were available. People with high fear and anxiety preferred to receive some type of medication to relieve their anxiety. In conclusion, the significance and importance of the need for anesthesia services to enhance the public health of dental patients in Kuwait has been demonstrated, and improvements are needed in anesthesia and sedation training of Kuwaiti dental care providers...|$|R

5000|$|According to Stephen Parker, who {{reviewed}} Brecht's {{writings and}} unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, {{which led to}} an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and Sydenham's chorea. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding aortic knob and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as <b>being</b> <b>very</b> <b>nervous,</b> and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with emotional lability, personality changes, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. [...] "What is remarkable," [...] wrote Parker, [...] "is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama." ...|$|E
