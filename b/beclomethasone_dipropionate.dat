A separate group of five patients was found to respond to increasing doses of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> by increasing their forced expiratory volume in the first second. The results suggest that increased doses of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> may provide additional benefit while continuing to avoid unwanted systemic side effects...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLung {{deposition}} {{is crucial}} for asthma treatment. However, there is no study comparing the potential role of lung co-deposition of combination therapy (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β 2 agonist) in the same inhaler. In moderate to severe asthmatics, an extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane combination of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and formoterol given via a single pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) was compared with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) pMDI and formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) given via separate inhalers. MethodsIn a double-blind, double-dummy, 24 -week randomised clinical trial, 645 patients with moderate to severe asthma uncontrolled by regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids received regular treatment with extra-fine fixed combination <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 200 μg/formoterol 12 μg bid, or <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (500 μg bid) via CFC pMDI and formoterol (12 μg bid) via DPI, or <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (500 μg bid) via CFC pMDI. The primary outcome was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Secondary outcomes included lung function measured at clinic, asthma symptoms and control, exacerbations. ResultsBeclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol combination via single inhaler or via separate inhalers improved morning PEF. However, the combination via single inhaler was more effective than given via separate inhalers for asthma control. Both combination treatments were superior to <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> alone in improving lung function and asthma control. All treatments were well tolerated. InterpretationIn patients with moderate to severe asthma, beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol in a single inhaler was as effective as <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> plus formoterol and superior to <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> alone in improving lung function. For {{the first time with}} a single inhaler, beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol was significantly superior to separate components for asthma control.

40|$|We {{wanted to}} compare the {{efficacy}} and safety of fluticasone propionate, a new topically active inhaled corticosteroid, to that of high dose <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> in severe adult asthma. Patients currently receiving between 1. 5 - 2. 0 mg. day- 1 of an inhaled corticosteroid were treated for six weeks in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study with 1 mg. day- 1 fluticasone propionate (n= 82), or 2 mg. day- 1 <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (n= 72). Mean morning peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) increased from 303 to 321 l. min- 1 with fluticasone propionate, and from 294 to 319 1. min- 1 with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> There {{was an increase in}} evening PEFR, asthma symptoms improved, and rescue beta 2 -agonist use decreased for both treatment groups. None of these differences between treatments were statistically significant However, diurnal variation was significantly reduced with fluticasone propionate, when compared with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (difference = 7 l. min- 1; p= 0. 038). Clinic lung function also improved with both treatments and, apart from % predicted PEFR, which showed no difference after <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> but increased from 73 to 78 % with fluticasone propionate, there were no differences between treatments. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) increased with both treatments. The geometric mean plasma cortisol concentration rose after treatment with fluticasone propionate (from 293 to 309 nmol. l- 1) and fell after <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (from 256 to 224 nmol. l- 1); the difference between treatments was significant. The incidence of adverse events was low in both treatment groups. In conclusion, 1 mg-day- 1 fluticasone propionate was as effective as 2 mg-day- 1 <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in the control of severe asthma. However, adrenal function was affected less by fluticasone propionate, which gives it a better overall safety profile. This study, therefore, demonstrates the increased therapeutic potential of fluticasone propionate over <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in severe asthma...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the efficacy and safety of a new inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate at a total daily dose of 200 micrograms, with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 400 micrograms/day in childhood asthma. A total of 398 asthmatic children (aged 4 - 19 years) were randomised to receive either fluticasone propionate 200 micrograms daily or <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 400 micrograms daily for six weeks inhaled via a spacer device from a metered dose inhaler. During the study the patients recorded morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), symptom scores, and use of beta 2 agonist rescue medication. In addition, clinic visit PEFR and forced expiratory volume in one second were measured. Safety was assessed by recording all adverse events and by performing routine biochemistry and haematology screens including plasma cortisol concentration before and after treatment. For the purposes of analysis the diary card data were grouped into three periods: week 3 (days 15 - 21), week 6 (days 36 - 42), and weeks 1 - 6 (days 1 - 42). The results showed no significant difference between treatments on most efficacy parameters. However, there were significant differences in changes from baseline in favour of fluticasone propionate for % predicted morning PEFR both at week 3 (fluticasone propionate 6. 1 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 3. 9 %) and at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 8. 3 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 5. 9 %) and % predicted evening PEFR at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 7. 3 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 4. 9 % and over weeks 1 - 6 (fluticasone propionate 5. 5 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 3. 6 %. Comparison between groups showed that the group receiving fluticasone propionate had a lower % of days with symptom-free exercise at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 87 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 81 %) and % days without rescue medication at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 87 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 80 %) and over weeks 1 - 6 (fluticasone propionate 80 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 73 %). Except for a higher incidence of sore throat in the fluticasone propionate group, the two treatments did not differ with regard to safety. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression with either treatment. In conclusion, fluticasone propionate 200 microgram daily ws at least as effective and as well tolerated as <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 400 microgram daily in childhood asthma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Steroids, the {{mainstay}} of Crohn's disease treatment, {{have been associated with}} systemic side effects. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> for maintaining remission induced by a short course of systemic steroids in patients with Crohn's ileitis with or without right colonic involvement. Methods: Patients (n = 84) with active Crohn's disease who achieved remission during a 2 -week prednisone run-in period were randomised to receive <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> for 24 weeks or continue prednisone for a further 2 weeks followed by placebo for 22 weeks. The primary outcome was relapse rate (Crohn's Disease Activity Index score > 150 and an increase of >= 60 points from baseline) or withdrawal due to disease deterioration. Results: The relapse rate was 23. 3 % and 53. 8 % in <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0. 027). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative relapse rate was 38. 0 % in the <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> group and 56. 0 % in the placebo group (p = 0. 025). Six percent and 1. 7 % of all adverse events in the <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and placebo groups, respectively, were endocrine-related. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> significantly reduces the relapse rate in post-active Crohn's ileitis patients compared with placebo after induction of remission with a short course of systemic steroids, and is well tolerate...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] It {{is common}} for inhaled steroids to be {{delivered}} through a large volume spacer device. Comparatively {{little is known about}} how this practice affects the dose of drug received by patients compared with drug delivered directly from a metered dose inhaler. METHODS [...] The amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> contained in particles of various size, available for inhalation from a 750 ml polycarbonate spacer (Volumatic) was determined by impinger measurement and high performance liquid chromatography. Three strengths of metered dose inhalers were studied (50 micrograms, 100 micrograms, and 250 micrograms/actuation). The effect of multiple actuations of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> into a Volumatic spacer, and increasing residence times of drug within the spacer before inhalation, on the amount of drug available to the patient for inhalation was determined. RESULTS [...] The amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in particles < 5 microns when delivered by a spacer device or directly from a metered dose inhaler was similar. The total amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> available for inhalation per actuation decreased by 20 micrograms with the 50 micrograms inhaler, 48 micrograms with the 100 micrograms inhaler, and 161 micrograms with the 250 micrograms inhaler, when given via the spacer compared with delivery directly from a metered dose inhaler. There was a progressive decrease in drug available for inhalation per actuation as the number of actuations into the spacer increased, for all strengths of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> tested. A progressive decrease in drug recovered per actuation was also seen with increasing residence times of drug within the spacer before inhalation. CONCLUSIONS [...] Use of the spacer device significantly reduced the amount of nonrespirable <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> available for inhalation. The amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> within respirable particles decreased considerably following multiple actuations into the spacer and with increasing residence times within the spacer before inhalation. When given via a spacer device <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> should be inhaled immediately after actuation and multiple actuations into the device should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a daily dose of 400 μg <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> aerosol intranasally has been {{investigated}} in a double-blind cross-over trial in 29 patients with hay fever.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Fluticasone {{propionate}} {{is a new}} {{inhaled corticosteroid}} with a 2 : 1 efficacy ratio compared with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> with regard to lung function and symptom scores, without increased systemic activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether this was also the case for bronchial hyperresponsiveness, assessed by both a direct (histamine) and an indirect (ultrasonically nebulised distilled water (UNDW)) provocation test. METHODS [...] Fluticasone propionate, 750 micrograms/day, and <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> 1500 micrograms/day, were compared in a randomised, double blind, crossover study consisting of two six week treatment periods, each preceded by a three week single blind placebo period. Twenty one non-smoking asthmatics (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 74. 7 % predicted, mean PC 20 histamine 0. 36 mg/ml) completed the study. RESULTS [...] Fluticasone propionate and <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> improved FEV 1, peak flow rates, asthma symptoms, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to the same extent. Both fluticasone propionate and <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> caused an increase in PC 20 histamine (mean 2. 29 [95 % confidence interval 1. 45 to 3. 13] and 1. 95 [1. 07 to 2. 84] doubling doses, respectively) and in PD 20 UNDW (1. 12 [0. 55 to 1. 70] and 1. 28 [0. 88 to 1. 70] doubling doses, respectively). Neither treatment changed morning serum cortisol levels, but fluticasone propionate decreased the number of peripheral blood eosinophils less than <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> indicating smaller systemic effects of fluticasone propionate. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings show that fluticasone propionate is as effective as twice the dose of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, assessed by provocation with both histamine and UNDW, without increased systemic activity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} biochemical markers of bone metabolism and statural growth, and their suitability as surrogate markers of inhaled corticosteroid induced growth suppression. DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled comparison of inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 200 micrograms twice daily as dry powder for six months. SETTING: Southampton. OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum osteocalcin, urinary deoxypyridinoline, and statural growth. SUBJECTS: 7 to 9 year old children with recurrent wheeze. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} in serum osteocalcin between the <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and placebo group measured at baseline or after three and six months' treatment, while deoxy-pyridinoline was significantly higher in the placebo treated children after three months. Growth was significantly decreased in the <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> group over the course of the study. Growth over the six months, both in those receiving <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and those receiving placebo, was significantly correlated with serum osteocalcin measured at three months and six months. CONCLUSION: Although serum osteocalcin shows excellent correlation with growth, it is a poor marker for decreased growth associated with use of inhaled corticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effects}} of high doses of two inhaled corticosteroids, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and budesonide, on biochemical indices of bone turnover (urinary hydroxyproline:creatine and calcium:creatinine ratios, plasma alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone). Twelve healthy male doctors, aged 25 - 36 (mean 30) years, were studied. After a week's run in period eight subjects inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 2000 micrograms/day and eight inhaled budesonide 1800 micrograms/day for 28 days; this was followed by a week without any treatment. During treatment with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> there was a significant increase in the hydroxyproline:creatinine ratio (a 46 % increase at 28 days), and a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase activity (a 7. 4 % fall at 28 days). There were no significant changes during budesonide treatment. Thus high dose inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> increased biochemical markers of bone resorption and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone mineralisation. A prospective study in asthmatic patients is indicated to assess the long term effects of high dose inhaled corticosteroids on bone mass...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen {{children}} {{suffering from}} hay fever {{were treated with}} intra-nasal <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (400 mug/day) and an identical placebo aerosol in a double-blind cross-over trial. 17 of the children preferred the intranasal <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> one had no preference, none preferred the placebo. The effect on the nasal symptoms was impressive. Symptom scores decreased, on average, to 12 % {{and the number of}} antihistamine tablets taken to 18 % of the pretreatment amount. Some beneficial effect on eye symptoms was also discernible, possibly due to an indirect influence from the nasal mucosa via the nasolacrimal reflex. Adrenal function was not affected.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To assess {{bone and}} {{collagen}} turnover in asthmatic children treated with dry powder budesonide from the Turbuhaler and dry powder <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> from the Diskhaler in {{a dose of}} 800 micrograms/day. SUBJECTS [...] Thirteen prepubertal children with asthma. DESIGN [...] Open crossover study with two treatment periods and treatment free run-in and wash-out periods. All periods were of two weeks' duration. At day 14 in each period blood samples were taken for assessment of serum osteocalcin, the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen (PICP), and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP). At the same time urine was collected for assessment of creatinine corrected pyridinoline (uPYR/cr) and deoxypyridinoline (udPYR/cr) crosslinks. RESULTS [...] Osteocalcin concentrations were not influenced {{by any of the}} treatments. During budesonide treatment mean (SEM) PICP was reduced by 18 % (8 %) (p = 0. 03), PIIINP by 24 % (3 %) (p = 0. 0002), uPYR/cr by 16 % (6 %) (p = 0. 03), and udPYR/cr by 21 % (13 %) (p = 0. 12). During treatment with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> mean (SEM) PICP was reduced by 20 % (6 %) (p = 0. 01), PIIINP by 36 % (3 %) (p = 0. 0002), uPYR/cr by 18 % (4 %) (p = 0. 004), and udPYR by 13 % (5 %) (p = 0. 02). The suppressive effect of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> on PIIINP was more marked than that of budesonide (p = 0. 001). CONCLUSION [...] Treatment with dry powder budesonide and <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 800 micrograms/day is associated with suppression of bone and collagen turnover. The suppression seems to be more marked during treatment with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> Long term effects and effects of lower doses of budesonide and <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> on bone and collagen markers needs further study...|$|E
40|$|Inhaled steroids improve {{pulmonary}} {{function and}} bronchial responsiveness in older asthmatics. Data from studies using subjective outcome measures {{to determine the}} effectiveness of inhaled steroids in infants with recurrent wheezing are equivocal. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> improves pulmonary function, including bronchial responsiveness to histamine, in recurrently wheezy infants. The study was double blind, placebo controlled lasting nine weeks. After the first baseline week, pulmonary function was measured using the rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique and bronchial responsiveness assessed with a histamine challenge test. Infants were then randomly allocated to receive doses of placebo or <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (100 micrograms/puff) from metered aerosols. Two puffs of test aerosol were administered twice daily for eight weeks via a large volume spacer fitted with a facemask. Symptoms were recorded daily and pulmonary function and bronchial responsiveness assessed {{at the end of}} the treatment period; 50 infants, median age 12 months (range 5 to 18 months), were recruited. Twenty three in the <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> group and 15 in the placebo group completed the study and had pairs of pulmonary function measurements. Three were probable treatment failures (one <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> two placebo), three were possible treatment failures (placebo), and others were non-compliant with study protocol. Baseline variables were not significantly different between those infants who completed the study and those who did not. <b>Beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and placebo groups were similar in all respects at baseline. Lung function and symptoms improved for both groups of infants during the study. Bronchial responsiveness increased significantly in the placebo group but there were not statistically significant differences between groups for any of the other outcome measures. It is concluded that <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (400 microgram daily) via a large volume spacer does not significantly improve lung function or symptoms in recurrently wheezy infants but might hav a beneficial effect on bronchial responsiveness...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The effects of inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (BDP) on asthma {{symptoms}} and infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by inflammatory cells were investigated {{in an open}} study of 10 patients with mild-to-moderate nonatopic bronchial asthma. Asthma scores were recorded in an asthma diary. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), PEF diurnal variation (PEF%), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 %), methacholine airway hypersensitivity (minimum dose of methacholine) (Dmin) were measured. Biopsy of the bronchial mucosa was performed before and after 8 weeks of treatment with BDP (400 µg·day- 1). The following inflammatory cells were immunostained: eosinophils with anti-EG 2; mast cells with AA 1; neutrophils with NP 57; T-lymphocytes with anti-CD 3, CD 4, and CD 8; and activated T-lymphocytes with anti-CD 25. There was a significant improvement in the asthma symptom score, PEF%, FEV 1 %, and Dmin after BDP therapy {{and the number of}} EG 2 -, AA 1 -, CD 3 -, CD 4 -, and CD 25 -positive cells decreased significantly. We conclude that inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration of airway tissue and that associated with this there was an improvement of symptoms in this open study of inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in a group of nonatopic asthmatic subjects...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Childhood asthma {{generally}} responds well to inhaled corticosteroids {{within the}} dosage range {{recommended by the}} manufacturers, but it is sometimes necessary to use higher doses [...] that is, above 400 micrograms/day [...] a practice which has become more widespread recently. Whereas the lack of adrenal suppression in children given inhaled corticosteroids in normal doses is well documented, {{little is known about}} the effects of higher doses. METHODS [...] The effects on adrenal function of high dose (above 400 micrograms/day) inhaled corticosteroids were evaluated by measuring cortisol concentration in the morning and performing a short tetracosactrin test in 49 children taking budesonide (mean age 9. 2 years (range 4 to 16 years) and 28 children taking <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (10. 2 years (5 to 13 years)). Twenty three non-asthmatic children (8. 9 years (4. 9 to 13 years)) who were under investigation for short stature served as controls for the study. RESULTS [...] Compared with controls mean basal cortisol concentration was lower in children taking budesonide and <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (control 401 (26. 8) nmol/l, budesonide 284 (22) nmol/l, <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 279 (23. 2) nmol/l). Sixteen of the 49 children taking budesonide had subnormal basal cortisol concentrations compared with seven of the 28 taking <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> Mean stimulated cortisol concentrations were lower in children taking inhaled corticosteroids than in controls, with no difference between those taking budesonide or <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Adrenal suppression occurs in some children who are given inhaled corticosteroids in doses greater than 400 micrograms/day.

40|$|Bloodspot cortisol, where finger pricked {{blood is}} applied to {{blotting}} paper, is suitable for repeated measurements in the home environment. The use of bloodspot cortisol measurements in children with asthma {{and the effect of}} inhaled corticosteroids on daytime cortisol concentrations were assessed. Twenty children with mild asthma were randomised to receive double blind either placebo or <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 200 micrograms twice daily. Blood was taken by finger prick at home on waking, and treatment administered. Blood was then taken one hour after treatment, at lunchtime, and in the evening. The area under the curve (AUC) for the four time points was calculated as a composite index of daytime cortisol.

40|$|Inhaled {{glucocorticoids}} such as <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> {{which are}} used in the treatment of asthma, may be associated with systemic adverse effects. To determine whether any systemic absorption following the inhalation of beclomethasone was a result of drug being absorbed from the lung (inhaled fraction) or the gastrointestinal tract (swallowed fraction), we studied normal subjects after the inhalation or swallowing of 2 mg <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> Systemic activity was assessed using early morning cortisol suppression. Both inhaled and swallowed fractions produced significant systemic activity, the degree of which depended on the inhaler device used. Systemic activity was greater using a dry powder inhaler (52 %) than using a metered dose inhaler with a large volume spacer (28 %). These findings suggest that to limit potential adverse effects from high-dose <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> it is better to use a metered dose aerosol with large volume spacer than a dry powder...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Glucocorticosteroids {{are widely}} used as drugs of first choice in the {{treatment}} of moderate to severe asthma. The effects of inhaled steroids in high doses have been compared with oral prednisone in asthmatic patients in a double blind crossover study. METHODS [...] The trial consisted of a two week run in period followed by two four week treatment periods separated by a four week washout. During the treatment period patients took either 1000 micrograms <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> twice daily and placebo tablets once daily, or 10 mg prednisone daily in one morning dose and placebo inhaler twice daily. The effects of treatment on the provocative dose of histamine producing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 histamine), peak flow measurements at home, and spirometric measurements in the clinic, {{as well as on the}} basal and stimulated plasma cortisol levels were measured. RESULTS [...] Seventeen patients with asthma completed the study. After four weeks of treatment <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> showed a significantly better effect on morning peak expiratory flow rate than prednisone. There was a trend to a greater improvement in the PC 20 histamine in patients receiving <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> than in those receiving prednisone. There were no significant differences in spirometric values, symptom scores, or basal and stimulated cortisol levels between the treatments. The within treatment analysis showed a significant effect of prednisone on stimulated cortisol levels but not of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 1000 micrograms twice daily has a slightly greater therapeutic effect in this population of asthmatic patients than 10 mg of prednisone once a day with less effect on adrenocortical function...|$|E

After nebulisation of 3 ml (150 micrograms) <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> the amount of drug in particles less than 5 microns was 16 micrograms (GSD 1. 1) with the Pari Inhalierboy, and 27 micrograms (1. 4) with the Medix Traveller with cirrhus nebuliser. This was less than the amount in particles less than 5 microns after three metered dose inhaler actuations (150 micrograms) from the Nebuhaler (58. 2 (1) micrograms) or the Volumatic spacer (46. 5 (1) micrograms).

40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of {{corticosteroids}} on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a randomised, double dummy, single blind crossover study was performed in 18 subjects with chronic asthma, comparing {{the effect of}} three weeks' treatment with inhaled <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> 1200 micrograms daily, and oral prednisone 12. 5 mg daily. The 12 week study began with a three week run in period of baseline treatment, which was continued unchanged throughout the study, and the two treatment periods were separated by a three week washout period. Patients kept daily Airflometer readings and attended the laboratory every three weeks for spirometry and a histamine inhalation test for determining the provocative dose of histamine causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20). The mean FEV 1 at the start was 1. 9 litres (56 % predicted). There was no significant change in PD 20 with prednisone treatment, the mean PD 20 being 0. 56 and 0. 59 mumol before and after treatment. There was, however, a significant improvement in PD 20 with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> treatment, the geometric mean PD 20 being 0. 38 and 1. 01 mumol before and after treatment (p less than 0. 001).

40|$|SummaryFew {{studies on}} the {{concomitant}} effects of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and asthma-related factors on the growth of prepubertal asthmatic children have been published to date. In this prospective long-term ‘real-life’ cohort study we recruited 82 prepubertal steroid-naïve asthmatic patients aged 3  + years, excluding those with birth weight lower than 2500  g, malnutrition, and other concurrent chronic diseases. Height/age and weight/age Z scores were calculated every three months. Random effects multivariate longitudinal data {{analysis was used to}} adjust height/age and weight/age Z scores with independent variables. Among the studied patients, 63. 4 % were male, aged 4. 7  ±  1. 5 years, 68. 3 % suffered from severe persistent asthma and had normal values for height/age and weight/age Z scores at enrolment. They were followed for 5. 2 years (range 2. 3 – 6. 1) and used a mean daily <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> dose of 351. 8  mcg (range 137. 3 – 1140. 0). Height/age and weight/age Z scores were not affected by either duration of treatment or doses of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> up to 500  mcg, 750  mcg and higher than 750  mcg (p-values >  0. 17). The multivariate analysis final model showed that severe persistent asthma was associated to lower height for age Z score (p =  0. 04), whereas hospitalizations because of acute asthma (before and during follow-up) were associated (p =  0. 02) to lower weight for age Z score.

40|$|Serial saliva {{cortisol}} {{measurements were}} used to assess pituitary-adrenal function in a group of asthmatic children treated with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (400 micrograms daily). Asthmatic children who were not being treated with steroids and normal children were also studied for comparison. A diurnal cortisol rhythm was observed in all three groups. Early morning cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in the group treated with <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> than in the normal children; this may indicate a stress induced response to decreased morning peak expiratory flow. In both groups, plasma and salivary cortisol responses after adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test were normal but peak cortisol concentrations showed a 7 fold increase over basal values in saliva compared with a three fold increase in plasma. <b>Beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> does not suppress pituitary-adrenal function in children when used in recommended doses.

40|$|ACKGROUND [...] Systemic {{absorption}} of inhaled corticosteroids may adversely influence {{the function of}} the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone metabolism, and circulating leucocytes. These changes can be used to assess the safety of different types and modes of administration of these drugs. METHODS [...] The study was a randomised, double dummy, crossover design with nine healthy adults. It compared the effects of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and budesonide (given by metered dose aerosols with and without their respective large volume spacers (Volumatic and Nebuhaler) attached) on serum cortisol, 24 hour urinary free cortisol, and plasma osteocalcin concentrations, and circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes. Subjects inhaled the drug (1 mg) and matching placebo at 0900 and 2200 hours on each of six study days. Blood samples were taken hourly for six hours after the morning dose {{and at the end of}} the study period. RESULTS [...] All results were within the reference ranges. Both drugs caused similar reductions in serum cortisol four to six hours after inhalation. These changes were not affected by the use of a large spacer and did not persist at 24 hours. Use of spacers tended to increase the haematological effects of the steroids. <b>Beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> inhaled through a Volumatic provoked a rise in circulating neutrophils compared with placebo although lymphocyte numbers were unaffected. Budesonide did not influence neutrophil numbers but did reduce circulating lymphocytes, numbers of which were further reduced when the Nebuhaler was used. There were no significant changes in plasma osteocalcin concentration or 24 hour urinary free cortisol excretion with budesonide, with or without a spacer. <b>Beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> inhaled without a spacer reduced urinary cortisol and plasma osteocalcin at 24 hours; however, use of the Volumatic protected against these effects. CONCLUSIONS [...] Attaching a Volumatic reduces the systemic effects of 2 mg aerosol <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and circulating osteocalcin concentrations. This study did not establish whether the Nebuhaler reduces the systemic effects of budesonide. When large spacers are used, 2 mg per day of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and budesonide seem to be equivalent in terms of unwanted effects...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] There is {{evidence}} that patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and asthma who take inhaled steroids have a low bone density. As most of a drug given from a metered dose inhaler is actually swallowed, the possibility that swallowed <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> acts topically in the gut to impair calcium absorption was investigated. Such an effect, if sustained, may be a causative factor of long term bone loss. METHODS [...] A two week randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial was performed in 12 normal volunteers. Subjects were randomly allocated to swallow <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> capsules (500 micrograms twice a day) or placebo for one week. The alternate capsule was given throughout the second week. At {{the end of each}} week, calcium absorption was assessed by a strontium absorption test. Serum parathyroid hormone, plasma calcium, and plasma phosphate concentrations were determined on the last two days of each week. Twenty four hour urinary calcium, hydroxyproline, and cortisol concentrations were measured for four successive days in each week. RESULTS [...] All subjects completed the study. There was a 12 % reduction in strontium absorption during the <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> ingestion week. There was also a 23 % reduction in 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion during the same week. CONCLUSIONS [...] Calcium absorption (measured by a strontium absorption test) was reduced by oral administration of <b>beclomethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> for one week. Decreased calcium absorption due to swallowed corticosteroid may contribute to side effects of inhaled steroids and further long term studies are needed...|$|E
