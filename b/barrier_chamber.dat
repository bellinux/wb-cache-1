In a preferred embodiment for transport across tissue, the microneedles are formed of a biodegradable polymer. Methods of making these devices, which can include hollow and/or porous microneedles, are also provided. A preferred method for making a microneedle includes forming a micromold having sidewalls which define the outer surface of the microneedle, electroplating the sidewalls to form the hollow microneedle, and then removing the micromold from the microneedle.

The method uses a solid ink printer, chromatography paper and a heating source.

This results in hydrophobic barriers capable of guiding fluid movement through the paper. The paper provides a detailed study of process parameters critical to this fabrication process. It discusses the selection of the optimum line width, melting temperature and melting time required to generate impermeable hydrophobic barriers.

Zirconia cell technology with an integrated heater will provide the foundation for the sensor structure. Proven materials and packaging technology will help to ensure a cost-effective approach to the manufacture of this sensor. The electronics technique and interface is considered to be an area where new strategies need to be employed to produce higher S/N ratios of the NOx signal with emphasis on signal stability over time for robustness and durability Both continuous mode and pulse mode control techniques are being evaluated. Packaging the electronics requires careful design and circuit partitioning so that only the necessary signal conditioning electronics are coupled directly in the wiring harness, while the remainder is situated within the ECM for durability and costs reasons. This task {{continues to}} be on hold due to the limitation that the definition of the interface electronics was unavailable until very late in the project. The sense element is based on the amperometric method utilizing integrated alumina and zirconia ceramics. Precious metal electrodes are used to form the integrated heater, the cell electrodes and leads. Inside the actual sense cell structure, it is first necessary to separate NOx from the remaining oxygen constituents of the exhaust, without reducing the NOx. Once separated, the NOx will be measured using a measurement cell.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine whether neurons in culture can serve as targets for immunologic attack mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which recognize Class I antigens. Allogeneic C 3 H/He primary neuronal cultures were quickly destroyed after CTL addition, while syngeneic C 57 BL/ 6 J neurons were not lysed. Alterations {{in the distribution of}} chromatin were the first ultrastructural changes that occurred, followed by loss of nuclear morphology, cytosolic changes, and eventually fragmentation of both the nucleus and cytosol. With Campenot chambers, it was possible to separate the membrane and nuclear lesions. CTLs exposed to neurites, but separated from the cell body by the <b>chamber</b> <b>barrier,</b> caused degeneration of neurites but did not cause lysis and cell death. Neuronal lysis mediated by antibody and complement appeared to be distinct from CTL-mediated lysis. These experiments demonstrate that neurons in culture are targets for MHC-specific CTLs, and therefore probably express functional levels of Class I antigens. The signal for killing by CTLs is not retrogradely transported from the neurite to the cell body, and morphologic events following CTL-neuron interaction resemble those that occur in dividing tumor target cell populations...|$|R

40|$|The role of electroosmosis was studied {{directly}} in Nitella. The cells were mounted in a water-tight <b>barrier</b> between two <b>chambers</b> containing reversible electrodes {{for the application}} of potentials, and fitted with calibrated capillaries to measure water movement. No water movement was found when small existing bioelectric potentials were short-circuited through an external connection, nor when external potentials up to 1 or 2 volts were applied (producing currents up to 5 µa). Higher potentials (up to 10 volts) caused small movements of water, toward the negative pole. Larger and often irreversible water movements were produced by potentials up to 20 volts—sometimes persisting after current flow. A variety of evidence suggests that the effects are caused by injury at the cathodal end of the cell, allowing water to be attracted osmotically at the intact end and forced out at the injured end (transosmosis). This injury is reversible under small applied potentials, irreversible after large ones (100 to 200 times the natural bioelectric values). Such water flows persist in low salt concentrations (up to 0. 09 M NaCl) but almost completely vanish in isotonic (0. 26 M) mannitol. This confirms the osmotic, rather than the electroosmotic nature of the water movement. It is estimated that electroosmosis cannot account for more than 1 per cent of the water movement (or turgor) in Nitella cells. The dead cellulose walls display a small electroosmotic water flow at very high current densities (under 20 volts applied potential) ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the safety and {{environmental}} (S and E) aspects of the HYLIFE-II inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant design have used simplistic assumptions in order to estimate radioactivity releases under accident conditions. Conservatisms associated with these traditional analyses can mask the actual behavior of the plant and have revealed {{the need for more}} accurate modeling and analysis of accident conditions and radioactivity mobilization mechanisms. In the present work a set of computer codes traditionally used for magnetic fusion safety analyses (CHEMCON, MELCOR) has been applied for simulating accident conditions in a simple model of the HYLIFE-II IFE design. Here the authors consider a severe lost of coolant accident (LOCA) producing simultaneous failures of the beam tubes (providing a pathway for radioactivity release from the vacuum vessel towards the containment) and of the two <b>barriers</b> surrounding the <b>chamber</b> (inner shielding and containment building it self). Even though containment failure would be a very unlikely event it would be needed in order to produce significant off-site doses. CHEMCON code allows calculation of long-term temperature transients in fusion reactor first wall, blanket, and shield structures resulting from decay heating. MELCOR is used to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena including thermal-hydraulics, heat transfer, aerosol physics and fusion product release and transport. The results of these calculations show that the estimated off-site dose is less than 6 mSv (0. 6 rem), which is well below the value of 10 mSv (1 rem) given by the DOE Fusion Safety Standards for protection of the public from exposure to radiation during off-normal conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the mathematical}} properties of some unusual quantum {{states that are}} constructed by inserting an impenetrable <b>barrier</b> into a <b>chamber</b> confining a single particle. If the barrier is inserted at a fixed node of the wave function, then {{the energy of the}} system is conserved. After barrier insertion, a measurement is made {{on one side of the}} chamber to determine if the particle is physically present. The measurement causes the wave function to collapse, and the energy that was contained in the subchamber in which the particle is now absent transfers instantaneously to the other subchamber in which the particle now exists. This thought experiment constitutes an elementary example of an EPR experiment based on energy conservation rather than momentum or angular momentum conservation. A more interesting situation arises when one inserts the barrier at a point that is not a fixed node of the wave function because this process changes the energy of the system; the faster the barrier is inserted, the greater the change in the energy. At the point of a sudden insertion the energy density becomes infinite; this energy instantly propagates across the subchamber and causes the wave function to become fractal. If an energy measurement is carried out on such a fractal wave function, the resulting mixed state has finite nonzero entropy. Fractal mixed states having unbounded entropy are also constructed and their properties are discussed. For an adiabatic insertion of the barrier, Landauer’s principle is shown to be insufficient to resolve the apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics that arises when a Maxwell daemon is present. This problem is resolved by calculating the energy required to insert the barrier...|$|R
40|$|Open-circuit {{respiration}} chambers {{can be used}} {{to measure}} gas exchange and to calculate heat production (Q) of humans and animals. When studying short-term changes in Q, the size of the respiration chamber in relation to the subject of study is a point of concern. The washout time of a chamber, defined as the proportion of the chamber size to the rate of ventilation, needs to be minimised for accurate measurement of short term changes in Q. To date, most respiration chambers have a fixed size, limiting their use for different species, sizes and number of subjects, thus hampering studying the short term dynamics of Q. This chapter presents various approaches to the design, construction and testing of respiration chambers, adjustable to the metabolic mass inside. As investment costs for constructing respiration chambers are high, flexibility in the use of chambers can contribute substantially to an efficient use of resources. Furthermore, an outline is given to sensor criteria and calibration and finally, the validation of a whole indirect-calorimetric system is described. Air leak tolerance is defined and attention is paid to caretaking of animals, excreta collection and animal and personnel welfare and safety. Respiration facilities, recently constructed at Wageningen University are presented as an example. Briefly, four 45 m 2 climate chambers can be used, e. g. for heat or cold stress experiments, to incubate eggs or as a hygiene <b>barrier.</b> Within each <b>chamber,</b> one or two smaller airtight, size adaptable respiration rooms, can be built in where ambient temperature, humidity and ventilation rate can be controlled independently.

40|$|Ozone gas (O 3) is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} bleaching agent due to its strong oxidising properties and less harmful to the environment. The most feasible method to generate O 3 is to connect high-voltage of several kV, high-frequency of about tens of kHz power supply across a Dielectric <b>Barrier</b> Discharge (DBD) <b>chamber.</b> Commonly, a resonant power supply with the ferrite transformer is used. However, {{the presence of the}} transformer increases the cost and footprint, while reduces the efficiency of the ozone generator. To overcome these deficiencies, this work proposes a design and implementation of an ozone power supply based on transformerless resonant converter. A standard full-bridge inverter is coupled to a resonant tank circuit, i. e. LC and LCL to achieve the required high voltage. The LCL exhibits a double resonance phenomenon resulting in very high voltage gain (above 150). Consequently, the power supply is capable of delivering sufficient potential to the chamber, even if the source voltage is below 20 V. Experimental measurements show that the efficiency of the proposed generator is 92 %, while the maximum ozone concentration achieved 8. 0 g/m 3 at a flow rate of 1. 0 L/min. This performance is much higher than the existing transformer based resonant converters. This thesis also introduces the concept of ozone generation using multiple chambers. The objective is to maintain a high O 3 concentration at high flow rates. To realise the idea, the same LCL transformerless ozone generator is used to drive three ozone chambers in parallel. The results indicate that the achieved ozone concentration is three times higher than the output of a single chamber. Furthermore, a closed loop regulation to maintain a stable and constant chamber’s output voltage is designed. Another contribution of this work is the introduction of a simple and effective method to characterise the DBD chamber parameters. Traditionally, Lissajous figures are employed to estimate the values of the chamber’s resistor and capacitor. However, this method proves unsatisfactory at high frequencies. Using the proposed method, the chamber parameters can be determined accurately at various frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Accidental {{analyses}} {{are essential for}} the safety assessment of future fusion nuclear plants. These analyses rely {{on the availability of}} validated numerical codes able to provide robust and credible results for the main safety issues relevant for the plant licensing such as the accidents that may lead to the loss of containment integrity and to their potential consequences. Fusion plants differ from fission ones mainly from the ultra-high vacuum operating conditions of the first containment <b>barrier</b> (the plasma <b>chamber),</b> and for the high amount and volatility of tritium. In nuclear fission and fusion context, the Enel Code for Analysis of Radionuclide Transport (ECART) has been employed in several safety analyses and validated by means of “ad hoc” experimental data [1]. The same occurs for the Accident Source Term Evaluation Code (ASTEC) currently developed by the Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN), but mainly applied in nuclear fission plants safety analysis. Compared to ECART, ASTEC benefited to limited validation efforts on fusion reactor accident analyses. As a consequence, the confidence on ASTEC simulation may gain from benchmarking activities against other codes, and notably to ECART. The goal of the present analysis is to compare the results of the two mentioned codes referring to a specific accidental sequence, previously investigated in detail by ECART during the design phases that followed the ITER Generic Site Safety Report (GSSR). The considered Postulated Initiating Event (PIE) is an in-vessel LOCA initiated by a double break in the divertor cooling loop. Then, the consequent dusts and tritium gas transport from the Vacuum Vessel (VV) to the Neutral Beam Injector (NBI) box, contaminating the NBI internal volume. The focus of this code-to-code comparison is to analyze the similarities and the differences between ASTEC and ECART on the prediction of the pressurization of the VV and the connected relief volumes, and on the transport of dusts (Tungsten (W), Beryllium (Be)) and tritium gas eventually mobilized towards the NBI-BOX...|$|R
40|$|Short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFA) {{synthesized}} in the rumen from carbohydrate fermentation are an essential energy source for ruminants. Current literature supports that SCFA are absorbed across the rumen epithelium via passive diffusion or protein-mediated transport, however, the rate and {{degree to which}} these pathways adapt {{to a change in}} diet fermentability is unknown. Furthermore, Na+ flux is partially determined by SCFA absorption, and thus is a key indicator of functional changes in the rumen epithelium. The objectives of this study were to determine the time required for a change in SCFA and Na+ absorption across the bovine rumen epithelium and to evaluate the rate and degree to which absorption pathways adapt to an increase in diet fermentability relative to changes in surface area. Twenty-five weaned Holstein steer calves were blocked by body weight and randomly assigned to either the control diet (CON; 91. 5 % hay and 8. 5 % vitamin/mineral supplement) or a moderately fermentable diet (50 % hay; 41. 5 % barley grain, and 8. 5 % vitamin/mineral supplement) fed for 3 (G 3), 7 (G 7), 14 (G 14), or 21 d (G 21). All calves were fed at 2. 25 % BW at 0800 h. Reticular pH was recorded every 5 min for 48 h prior to killing (1000 h). Ruminal tissue was collected for Ussing <b>chamber,</b> <b>barrier</b> function, surface area measurements, and gene expression. Net 22 Na+ flux (JNET-Na; 80 kBq/ 15 mL), the rate and pathway of mucosal to serosal 3 H-acetate (JMS-acetate; 37 kBq/ 15 mL) and 14 C-butyrate (JMS-butyrate; 74 kBq/ 15 mL) flux, and serosal to mucosal flux of 3 H-mannitol (JSM-mannitol; 74 KBq/ 15 mL) and tissue conductance were measured. Half of the chambers assigned to measure JMS-acetate and JMS-butyrate were further assigned to 1 of 2 acetate and butyrate concentration treatments: 10 mM (Low) and 50 mM (High). Furthermore, JSM-mannitol flux was also measured during an acidotic and hyperosmotic challenge (CHAL) and recovery (REC) to measure barrier function of ruminal tissue. Mean reticular pH, which was positively correlated with ruminal pH (R 2 = 0. 5477), decreased from 6. 90 for CON to 6. 59 for G 7 then increased. Net Na+ flux increased 125 % within 7 d. Total JMS-acetate and JMS-butyrate increased from CON to G 21, where passive diffusion was the primary SCFA absorption pathway. Total JMS-acetate and JMS-butyrate were greater when incubated in High vs. Low. Effective surface area of the ruminal epithelium was not affected by dietary treatment. Increased JSM-mannitol, tissue conductance, and increased expression of IL- 1 β and TLR 2 (tendencies) with increased days fed the moderate grain diet indicated reduced rumen epithelium barrier function. Furthermore, the CHAL treatment reduced barrier function, which was not reversible during REC. This study indicates that a moderate increase in diet fermentability increases rumen epithelium absorptive function in the absence of increased SA, but reduces barrier function. Data from this study also suggests that absorption and barrier function follow different timelines, posing a challenge for ruminant diet adaptation to moderately to highly fermentable diets...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Obesity is a {{condition}} with increasing prevalence that leads to morbidity, decreased {{quality of life and}} reduced life expectancy. The only effective evidence-based treatment is bariatric surgery. The most well documented procedure; Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) results in a substantial and sustainable weight loss and an improved metabolic state. The mechanisms of action have not yet been fully elucidated but recent research has indicated that the proximal alimentary tract has a profound influence on central aspects of the body’s metabolism such as appetite regulation and hepatic glucose production. Aim: The general aim of this thesis was to explore alterations to the proximal small intestinal mucosa induced by RYGB, and thereby link functional aspects of the small intestine in the context of obesity and obesity related morbidity with the effects of RYGB surgery. Method: Jejunal mucosal samples from patients were obtained during RYGB surgery and 6 months post-operatively via endoscopy. A proteomic analysis using 2 -D gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy was then performed using a paired samples setting. The results from this exploratory proteomic analysis were then used as starting points for further in depth analysis of aspects of intestinal function such as barrier integrity, calcium uptake and lipid metabolism. For these studies additional human mucosal tissue samples were collected and analyzed with western blot, immunohistochemistry and in Ussing chambers. Also, previously collected bone densitometric data from a RCT comparing RYGB to vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) were analyzed. Animal experiments using C 57 bl 6 mice and cell culture experiments using Caco- 2 cell lines were performed as well. Results: The proteomic analysis identified several proteins in the jejunal mucosa with markedly altered expression levels after RYGB surgery. Among these were cytokeratin (CK) 8, Heat-shock protein (HSP) 90 β and HMGCS 2 that were considered of particular interest. CK 8 has been reported to be of importance for intestinal mucosal barrier function. Further analysis with western blot revealed profound alterations in the expression levels of several proteins involved in tight junctions that are important in maintaining <b>barrier</b> integrity. Ussing <b>chamber</b> experiments linked an increase in Claudin- 3 expression after RYGB to a decrease in intestinal permeability as reflected by reduced electrical resistance. HSP 90 β has been reported to be a co-activator of vitamin-D in the small intestine. Additional western blot analysis suggested a decreased vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity in the small intestine after RYGB. VDR mediates active calcium uptake in the small intestine and analysis of DEXA data from patients that had undergone RYGB or VBG show that RYGB induced a weight loss independent decrease in bone mineral density. Finally, analyses of human mucosal samples and animal experiments indicated that the production of ketone bodies in the proximal small intestinal mucosa could be induced by diet composition, and that this effect may be reversed by RYGB surgery indicating that lipid metabolism in the proximal small intestine is altered in obesity and in response to RYGB. Conclusion: In our study, RYGB induces several changes to the proteome of the small intestinal mucosa indicating alterations in central aspects of small intestinal function such as barrier integrity, calcium absorption and lipid metabolism. These alterations could be of importance for linking the clinical effects of RYGB surgery to the largely unexplained pathophysiological mechanisms that link obesity with morbidity...|$|R
