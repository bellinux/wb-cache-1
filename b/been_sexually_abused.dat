Masson is a veganism advocate and has written about animal rights. Most of his books since 1997 are about animals.|$|E
25|$|Dysmenorrhea is {{estimated}} to affect approximately 25% of women. Reports of dysmenorrhea are greatest among individuals {{in their late teens}} and 20s, with reports usually declining with age. The prevalence in adolescent females has been reported to be 67.2% by one study and 90% by another. It has been stated that there is no significant difference in prevalence or incidence between races. Yet, a study of Hispanic adolescent females indicated a high prevalence and impact in this group. Another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 36.4% of participants, and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea, but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in nulliparous women with primary dysmenorrhea, the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40. A questionnaire concluded that menstrual problems, including dysmenorrhea, were more common in females who had <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} vulnerability or resilience to inter-generational sexual abuse. The sample included 196 Afri-can American {{mothers and their}} children of which 96 <b>were</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> and 100 had no reported incidents of abuse. Four groups were formed based on maternal report {{of a history of}} childhood sexual abuse and the child’s <b>abuse</b> status: (a) <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> mothers of children who <b>were</b> not <b>sexually</b> <b>abused,</b> (b) <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> mothers whose child <b>was</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused,</b> (c) mothers with no history of sexual abuse whose children had no history of sexual abuse, and (d) mothers with no history of sexual abuse who had a <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> child. The findings indicate that mothers who break the cycle of abuse were functioning as well as the nonsexually abused mothers in the study. Furthermore, <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> mothers with abused children evidenced significantly more disturbed functioning than the other three groups of mothers, particularly in their attachment relationships...|$|R

25|$|In December 2001, {{allegations}} were raised that, {{during his time}} as Archbishop of Brisbane, Hollingworth had failed to deal appropriately with sex abuse allegations made against a church teacher at Toowoomba Preparatory School. That month, the Brisbane Anglican diocese was ordered to pay $834,800 damages {{to the woman who}} had been found to have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused.</b> Hetty Johnston, an advocate for child sex abuse victims, instigated a campaign calling for Hollingworth to resign. Hollingworth told the Australian media that, as a newly appointed archbishop at the time, he lacked the experience to handle the matter. He also said he had not believed that the case involved sexual abuse, but conceded he had not done enough to stop abuses occurring. Hollingworth subsequently apologised to the Toowoomba victim and released a formal statement condemning child sexual abuse but by February 2002, the Labor Opposition was calling for Hollingworth to be dismissed. Hollingworth stepped down from his positions as the Brisbane Lions' No 1 ticket holder, patron of Barnardos, Kids First Foundation and the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.|$|E

40|$|MSW (Forensic Practice), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Sexual {{abuse of}} {{children}} {{is a major problem}} in South Africa. There is an increasing number of orphans in urban but also in rural areas of children and orphans who <b>are</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused.</b> The researcher experienced in her daily work as social worker in the rural area of the Oliver Tambo district Municipality children and orphans who <b>are</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the risks factors contributing to the vulnerability of orphans towards sexual abuse. Purposive sampling was conducted among social workers who have experience with orphans who <b>were</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> in the Ngqeleni and Port St Johns areas of the Oliver Tambo District in the Eastern Cape. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by the researcher with the social workers as well as document analysis from the files of orphans who <b>were</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> from the caseloads of these social workers. From the data received it has been confirmed that family members where orphans grew up fail often to accept and to treat them like their own children, especially when they are not sharing the same clan name with the children. Orphans do not always get full support and protection like other children in the family. This situation makes it even more difficult for them to talk freely about their challenges. Lack of knowledge also plays a role to these children as they fail to report to government departments and community leaders. Looking at the vulnerability of orphans in the Oliver Tambo District, there is a definite need for social workers to empower orphans and their caregivers with knowledge in preventing orphans from being <b>sexually</b> <b>abused.</b> There <b>is</b> also a need for forensic social workers to help with the assessment of orphans who <b>are</b> <b>sexually</b> <b>abused</b> in order to assure more successful prosecutions of alleged perpetrators.
