5000|$|On August 19, 1989, a Cessna A185E Skywagon {{registered}} N95KW crashed {{shortly after}} a <b>balked</b> <b>landing</b> at Coastal Airport, located near Myrtle Grove, Florida. The pilot's seat latch {{slipped on the}} railing, causing the pilot to unintentionally stall the aircraft. The pilot and the two passengers on board were all severely injured. The resulting product liability trial, concluding twelve years later, resulted in a $480 million judgement against Cessna. The case was later settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum. This accident also brought about a series of airworthiness directives that affected all small Cessnas ever built.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} a series of recent analytical studies conducted to investigate one-engine-inoperative (OEI) optimal control strategies and the associated optimal trajectories for a twin engine helicopter in Category-A terminal-area operations. These studies also examine the associated heliport size requirements and the maximum gross weight capability of the helicopter. Using an eight states, two controls, augmented point-mass model representative of the study helicopter, continued takeoff (CTO), rejected takeoff (RTO), <b>balked</b> <b>landing</b> (BL), and continued landing (CL) are investigated for both vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) and short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) terminal-area operations. The formulation of the non-linear optimal control problems with considerations for realistic constraints, solution methods for the two-point boundary-value problem, a new real-time generation method for the optimal OEI trajectories, and the main results of this series of trajector optimization studies are presented. In particular, a new balanced-weight concept for determining the takeoff decision point for VTOL Category-A operations is proposed, extending the balanced-field length concept used for STOL operations...|$|E
40|$|Engine failure {{represents}} a major safety concern to helicopter operations, {{especially in the}} critical flight phases of takeoff and landing from/to small, confined areas. As a result, the JAA and FAA both certificate a transport helicopter as either Category-A or Category-B according {{to the ability to}} continue its operations following engine failures. A Category-B helicopter must be able to land safely in the event of one or all engine failures. There is no requirement, however, for continued flight capability. In contrast, Category-A certification, which applies to multi-engine transport helicopters with independent engine systems, requires that they continue the flight with one engine inoperative (OEI). These stringent requirements, while permitting its operations from rooftops and oil rigs and flight to areas where no emergency landing sites are available, restrict the payload of a Category-A transport helicopter to a value safe for continued flight as well as for landing with one engine inoperative. The current certification process involves extensive flight tests, which are potentially dangerous, costly, and time consuming. These tests require the pilot to simulate engine failures at increasingly critical conditions, Flight manuals based on these tests tend to provide very conservative recommendations with regard to maximum takeoff weight or required runway length. There are very few theoretical studies on this subject to identify the fundamental parameters and tradeoff factors involved. Furthermore, a capability for real-time generation of OEI optimal trajectories is very desirable for providing timely cockpit display guidance to assist the pilot in reducing his workload and to increase safety in a consistent and reliable manner. A joint research program involving NASA Ames Research Center, the FAA, and the University of Minnesota is being conducted to determine OEI optimal control strategies and the associated optimal,trajectories for continued takeoff (CTO), rejected takeoff (RTO), <b>balked</b> <b>landing</b> (BL), and continued landing (CL) for a twin engine helicopter in both VTOL and STOL terminal-area operations. This proposed paper will present the problem formulation, the optimal control solution methods, and the key results of the trajectory optimization studies for both STOL and VTOL OEI operations. In addition, new results concerning the recently developed methodology, which enable a real-time generation of optimal OEI trajectories, will be presented in the paper. This new real-time capability was developed to support the second piloted simulator investigation on cockpit displays for Category-A operations being scheduled for the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator in June-August of 1995. The first VMS simulation was conducted in 1994 and reported...|$|E
50|$|Trinity {{is located}} near Zuccotti Park, the {{location}} of the Occupy Wall Street protest. It offered both moral and practical support to the demonstrators but <b>balked</b> when church-owned <b>land</b> adjoining Juan Pablo Duarte Square was demanded for an encampment. For withholding this property the church hierarchy were criticized by others within the Anglican movement, most notably Archbishop Desmond Tutu. On December 17, 2011, occupiers, accompanied by a few clergy, attempted to occupy the land (known as LentSpace), which is surrounded by a chain-link fence. After demonstrating in Duarte Park and marching on the streets surrounding the park, occupiers climbed over and under the fence. Police responded by arresting about 50 demonstrators, including at least three Episcopal clergymen and a Roman Catholic nun.|$|R
40|$|Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.) {{extremely}} spreads on uncultivated {{agricultural land}} and expands to arable land. Three sites were chosen {{in the local}} area of Uherské Hradiště: field (arable <b>land),</b> <b>balk</b> (adjacent to arable land) and rubble heap (distant from arable land). At each site, 50 plants were selected from which mature achenes were collected in 2002 and 2003. The achenes germinated in a laboratory at a room temperature and were subjected to various germination conditions. A part of them was exposed to the temperature of – 20  °C in a freezer, the other part was stored at a room temperature. The germination was carried out either on filter paper in Petri dishes or in 30  mm layer of siliceous sand. One part of the achenes germinated in daylight, the other part in Petri dishes in the dark. The achenes cultivated in siliceous sand were covered with a 5  mm layer of the sand. The results were statistically assessed using Unistat software, analysis of variance and methods of least significant differences (LSD). Total average germinability of mugwort achenes was 67, 7  %. The differences in germinability of frozen (66, 7  %) and non-frozen (72, 6  %) achenes were not statistically significant. Germinability of the achenes that matured in 2003 (69, 9  %) was highly significantly {{higher than that of}} the achenes matured in 2002 (65, 4  %). The achenes germinated highly significantly more (77, 9  %) in daylight as compared with those germinated in the dark (57, 4  %). Germinability of the achenes that germinated in siliceous sand was highly significantly higher (70, 7  %) than of those that germinated in Petri dishes (64, 7  %). Germinability of the achenes matured in the field (64, 1  %) was significantly lower in comparison with the germinability of the achenes from a balk (69, 7  %) and rubble heap (69, 2  %). The results of germinability of the achenes that matured in a rubble heap and balk did not significantly differ...|$|R
