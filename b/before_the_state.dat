5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> {{acceptance}} trials were completed, the Council of Ministers ordered the aircraft into production in December 1946. 50 aircraft {{were to be}} built between January and April 1947, equally split between single-seat aircraft and two-seat trainers, armed with only a single cannon. The trainer ran into serious development difficulties and all the aircraft of the first batch were single-seaters. Fifty of these participated in the May Day flypast in Moscow in 1947. A total of 280 Yak-15s were produced {{through the end of}} the year, exclusive of prototypes. The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers. The aircraft's manoeuvrability led it to be used by a number of informal acrobatic display teams throughout the late 1940s.|$|E

Beyond the intersection with MD472 (North Sandgates Road), MD235 passes through Oakville, where another old alignment, Oakville Road, splits to the north before the main road intersects MD247 (Loveville Road). Mt. Zion Church Road, yet another old alignment, splits to the north in the hamlet of Laurel Grove before MD235 intersects the eastern terminus of MD6 (New Market–Turner Road) and Morganza–Turner Road in Oraville. The final old alignment of MD235, Harpers Corner Road, splits to the west shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> highway reaches its northern terminus at MD5 near Mechanicsville. MD5 heads southwest as two-lane Point Lookout Road toward Leonardtown. Northbound MD5 continues straight on the divided highway as Three Notch Road toward Charlotte Hall and Waldorf.|$|E

5|$|This {{was not the}} end of the controversy. A letter {{campaign}} led to {{the name}} of the park being changed to Whirls End State Forest Park in 1936; opponents of the new name launched another letter-writing campaign to revert the name to Worlds End State Forest Park. This matter was brought <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Geographic Board, which supervised the official naming of places. The board ruled that the name be changed once again to Worlds End State Forest Park in 1943. The word Forest was dropped on November 11, 1954, when the park was officially named Worlds End State Park by the Pennsylvania Geographic Board. This has been the official name ever since, but the names Whirls End and Whirls Glen are still used, and are synonymous with Worlds End.|$|E
