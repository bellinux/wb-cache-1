50|$|The {{cause is}} usually a {{bacterial}} infection and rarely a fungal infection. It may occur via spread from the blood or from surrounding tissue.

40|$|Background: Allogeneic bone {{transplantation}} {{is at risk}} of infection, {{and established}} disinfection methods typically compromise bone quality. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is well established for disinfection in food technology, and also it does protect biomechanical and biological properties of bone. This study is the first investigation of HHP regarding disinfection of <b>bone</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Materials and methods: <b>Bone</b> <b>biopsies</b> of 34 patients with chronic infections were subjected to HHP and assessed for persisting bacterial growth. In series 1, <b>bone</b> <b>biopsies</b> were proceeded directly to HHP (10 min; maximal pressure P-max 600 MPa). In series 2, HHP was applied after 5 -day incubation in growth media (10 min or 2 x 30 min; P-max 600 MPa). Furthermore, HHP-induced changes of bacterial morphology on artificially infected bone samples were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: For series 1, 71 % of the bone samples were sterilised by HHP (n = 17), compared to 38 % of the untreated control samples, which were obtained during the same surgery (n = 8). For series 2, after prior incubation, HHP disinfected 7 % of the bone specimens (n = 55), all control samples showed bacterial growth (n = 33). Destruction of cell wall integrity of Gram-negative strains was observed by SEM. Conclusion: The effectiveness of HHP for bone disinfection should be improved by optimising treatment parameters. Infections with barosensitive Gram-negative bacteria or yeast might represent possible clinical indications. ...|$|R

5000|$|Renal {{osteodystrophy}} {{is usually}} diagnosed after treatment for end-stage kidney disease begins; however the CKD-MBD starts {{early in the}} course of CKD. [...] In advanced stages, blood tests will indicate decreased calcium and calcitriol (vitamin D) and increased phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels. In earlier stages, serum calcium, phosphate levels are normal at the expense of high parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 levels. X-rays will also show bone features of renal osteodystrophy (subperiostic bone resorption, chondrocalcinosis at the knees and pubic symphysis, osteopenia and bone fractures) but may be difficult to differentiate from other conditions. Since the diagnosis of these bone abnormalities cannot be obtained correctly by current clinical, biochemical, and imaging methods (including measurement of bone-mineral density), <b>bone</b> <b>biopsy</b> has been, and still remains, the gold standard analysis for assessing the exact type of renal osteodystrophy.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} hour and forty minutes {{following}} the accident, Kelley had been incoherent, and had gone through waves of intense vomiting and retching. He then stabilized, was able to once again converse normally, {{and was able to}} have his pulse taken and his blood drawn. The blood draw indicated that Kelley had been exposed to approximately 9 Gy from fast neutrons and 27 Gy from gamma rays, for a total of 36 Gy. For an adult human, exposure to 2 Gy from an unfocused radiation source such as an excursion will cause radiation sickness but is not considered definitely lethal; 2.4-3.4 Gy is the median lethal dose; a dose of 5 Gy almost always kills. Kelley had received more than seven times the adult human lethal dose. Although the medical staff in the emergency room took steps to ease his pain with Demerol and morphine, previous research on radiation exposure in animals indicated Kelley's death was inevitable. Within six hours his lymphocytes were all but gone. A <b>bone</b> <b>biopsy</b> performed 24 hours after the incident produced bone marrow that was watery and contained no red blood cells. Numerous blood transfusions had no lasting helpful effect: 35 hours following his initial exposure and after a final bout of intense restlessness, agitation, sweating, becoming ashen-skinned, and having an irregular pulse, Cecil Kelley died of heart failure.|$|E
