30|$|A HESS {{plays an}} {{important}} role in DC microgrids. Its charging and discharging powers exhibit large fluctuations and high peaks. Moreover, since the number of times the batteries can be cycled is limited, and overly frequent charging and discharging may reduce the life span of batteries, the power allocation to an HESS is especially important. In view of this, ultra-capacitors have an important role in buffering the frequent fluctuating component of P hess, based on their high power density, fast response and long cycle life. At the same time, <b>batteries</b> <b>handle</b> the more slowly varying component of P hess and avoid frequent charging and discharging operations, using their large capacity and providing the more economical form of energy storage.|$|R

40|$|In the {{following}} thesis, {{we focused on}} waste <b>battery</b> collection and <b>handling.</b> Since <b>batteries</b> {{are known for their}} possible containing of dangerous substances, it seems sensible to collect and reuse them - not only from the perspective of economy, but also when it comes to regaining some valuable raw materials. That is why the battery issue is not only topical, but also in need of thorough analysis and discussion. Wrongly disposed batterries are a huge environmental issue, since they pollute groundwater and eventually our drinking water. In case they are burned or disposed along with other waste materials onto agricultural areas, they also represent immense environmental hazards. Batteries are being used on a daily basis by everyone, however, people are still not familiar with all of their characterics and their proper use. To improve the current situation, we concentrated on some basic facts (sorts, types, structure, characteristics and functioning of batteries) throughout this final thesis. Moreover, we presented directives and decrees concerning waste <b>battery</b> <b>handling,</b> and described dangerous substances and their negative influences on the environment. There is a presentation of already existing waste battery collecting, selecting and recycling processes {{in some parts of the}} world.

The paper is aimed at providing automatic charging device that will be more convenient in application. This was achieved by incorporating three relays that ensured accurate functionality of the various protection circuits in the charger.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{assembly}} of <b>battery</b> cells, <b>handling</b> of the single sheet electrodes is a critical task. The electrodes have to be handled with high accuracy, low mechanical loads and low chemical contamination of the electrodes {{as well as the}} production environment. Especially lifting of electrodes with state-of-the-art area vacuum grippers causes immense mechanical stress which may lead to structural damage of the electrodes. This will ultimately lead to lowered performance of the cell or even in total failure of the whole cell. One way to overcome this problem is the use of grippers based on the Bernoulli principle which can lift grippers from a certain distance without direct contact but blow off their exhaust air into the production environment which has to be prevented in the dry room environment. This paper presents a concept to overcome this problem to enable the use of Bernoulli-grippers for the <b>handling</b> <b>battery</b> electrodes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a model for the electrical components that are involved in charging and discharging of an electric vehicle (EV). This will enable testing differ-ent energy management strategies that improve energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and ener-gy availability. Furthermore, the model will enable the investigation of vehicle to grid (V 2 G), thermal preconditioning of vehicles, and an economic analysis and optimization. In order to achieve the above goals, the effects that determine the performance of the infra-structure, rectifier, and battery are investigated and included as a second step in a parameter-ized model. Implementing an open loop control enables sample times of one minute and, by simplifying the process for a low runtime, multiple EVs can be included in the simulation of a smart grid. The structure is designed in a way as to support both uncontrolled and controlled charging with variable charging power and variable charging current.

These regulations include requirements of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and regulations pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Energy Policy Act. If the market share of electric vehicles increases {{in response to these}} initiatives, corresponding growth will occur in quantities of spent electric vehicle batteries for disposal. Electric vehicle battery recycling infrastructure must be adequate to support collection, transportation, recovery, and disposal stages of waste <b>battery</b> <b>handling.</b> For some <b>battery</b> types, such as lead-acid, a recycling infrastructure is well established; for others, little exists. This paper examines implications of increasing electric vehicle use for lead recovery infrastructure. Secondary lead recovery facilities can be expected to have adequate capacity to accommodate lead-acid electric vehicle battery recycling. However, they face stringent environmental constraints that may curtail capacity use or new capacity installation. Advanced technologies help address these environmental constraints. For example, this paper describes using backup power to avoid air emissions that could occur if electric utility power outages disable emissions control equipment. This approach has been implemented by GNB Technologies, a major manufacturer and recycler of lead-acid batteries. Secondary lead recovery facilities appear to have adequate capacity to accommodate lead waste from electric vehicles, but growth in that capacity could be constrained by environmental regulations. Advances in lead recovery technologies may alleviate possible environmental constraints on capacity growth...|$|R
