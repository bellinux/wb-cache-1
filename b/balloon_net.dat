50|$|At {{a meeting}} of Pro Juventute on 6 June 1968, four gas {{balloons}} were launched from a meadow at Donauturm. While three of them floated past the tower, the fourth was driven against the tower, where it was initially hung on the security grills, at an height of approx. 150 m. The <b>balloon</b> <b>net</b> tore and the balloon envelope broke free. The remnants of the net and the basket fell to the ground. The American balloonist Francis Shields died, along with two Austrian passengers: a higher official of the Austrian Post and Telegraph Management, Guntram Pammer, and journalist Dieter Kasper of the Austrian Press agency.|$|E
25|$|When {{flying at}} high altitudes, {{spotting}} migrating butterflies or moths can be hard. Low flying species are easily spotted or caught using a light trap. When individuals fly {{too high for}} these methods, air <b>balloons</b> equipped with <b>nets</b> are used at times. Alternatively, radar is used to monitor migration.|$|R
50|$|Multiple vendors {{will fill}} {{the market at}} night. The night market tends to attract {{people to come to}} a {{gathering}} in the market these days {{to have a good time}} since it comprises all beer and skittles such as late-night snakes, entertainment, and shopping. Tourists can also bargain with locals for handicrafts, clothing, shoes and accessories. A lot of students love to try out the new mini toy crane machine when they visit the night market as well. At the night market, people can experience the traditional carnival games such as <b>balloon</b> shooting, <b>net</b> fish, shooting marbles, and a collection of mini games. Due to the popularity, it has developed a business climate here, which is always full and packed. Especially during the weekends, the crowds seem to be able to fill the entire market and it is already a popular success.|$|R
50|$|Hot Slots is an eroge, a {{video game}} that rewards game progress, persistence, or {{performance}} with images that are sexually explicit or suggestive. Each slot machine {{is accompanied by a}} scantily-clad hostess, who appears at intervals when the player's winnings surpass a certain threshold. When the player nets a profit of $210, the game displays a full-screen cartoon image of the partially clothed hostess with a caption or speech <b>balloon.</b> At a <b>net</b> profit of $300, she loses more of her clothing; at $450, she appears nude.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to food, night markets feature {{various forms of}} entertainment {{and a lot of}} shopping. Numerous products for sale include clothes, bags, shoes, trinkets, kitchen items, etc. Some night markets will have areas that are dedicated to certain products such as clothes, which are sold both by street vendors in the 100 to 300 NTD (≈$3-$10 USD) range and in the small storefronts lining the streets usually priced slightly higher in the 300 to 500 NTD range. These shops are often open during the day as well, especially during the afternoon before the evening rush. Carnival-style games are typically available to play {{for the price of a}} few coins. The night market in Tamsui is especially well known for featuring traditional carnival games such as <b>balloon</b> shooting, <b>net</b> fish, shooting marbles, and an assortment of mini games that could only have otherwise been seen many years ago.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{were well}} aware that American fortifications existed {{on both sides of}} the Canal. On the Atlantic, the large coastal {{artillery}} batteries of Fort Sherman had a range of 30,000 yards (17 mi), preventing enemy ships from getting near enough to shell the locks. In the months following the attack on Pearl Harbor, air and sea patrols had been strengthened around both entrances, and barrage <b>balloons</b> and anti-submarine <b>nets</b> erected. In August 1942, the 88th Coast (Anti-Aircraft) Artillery unit was added to help defend against aerial attacks.|$|R
5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 14 June 1936, {{when she was}} placed in reserve. Her name was reused for the new battleship Strasbourg, so the old cruiser was renamed Strassbourg II. The cruiser was subsequently used as a barracks ship in Lorient until 1944, when she was seized by the Germans and scuttled in the harbor to protect the U-boat pens in the harbor from torpedo attack. Barrage <b>balloons</b> and anti-torpedo <b>nets</b> were attached to the ship to strengthen the defenses of the U-boat pens. Her wreck remains in the harbor, and is visible at low tide.|$|R
40|$|John Ducey’s fish {{store is}} {{located near the}} {{shoreline}} in Keels, close to where the trap skiffs and other boats are drawn {{up out of the}} water. It was built in the early to mid- 1950 s by Reg Chapman and Isaac Penny, who used the space for net mending. The Ducey family purchased the store in the early 1980 s. The building’s primary function at the moment is as a storage facility [...] housing dip <b>nets,</b> gill <b>nets,</b> <b>balloons,</b> squid jiggers, lump gear, graples, buoy ropes, boat motors, flakes, furniture, and a slide for hauling wood. John also occasionally uses the space as a workshop when he repairs motors...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Psychological SciencesMichael YoungWhen making decisions, the {{probability}} {{and magnitude of}} errors can {{play a major role}} in changing preferences. Electroencephalography (EEG) research examining the error-related negativity (ERN) and the associated feedback-related negativity (FRN) has indicated that the amplitude of each component may predict subsequent behavioral change. The current study used a version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) that involves outcomes that are dynamically changing over time. As the balloon grows, more points are available but {{the probability}} of the <b>balloon</b> popping (<b>netting</b> zero points) is higher; the participant decides when to stop the balloon’s expansion to maximize points. The BART was adapted to facilitate the study of the FRN in dynamic environments. The purpose of Experiment 1 was to determine the effect of error magnitude on FRN amplitude during popped (incorrect) trials, whereas Experiment 2 was aimed at determining the effect of error magnitude on FRN amplitude during cashed-in (correct) trials. It was hypothesized that larger errors (i. e., the balloon popping after waiting a long time to cash-in) would result in a larger FRN than smaller errors. In Experiment 1, error magnitude did not contribute to the amplitude of the FRN. In Experiment 2, the masked points possible condition was a replication of Experiment 1. In the unmasked points possible condition, the number of points that could have been earned for each balloon was presented before participants found out how many points were earned. It was expected that there would be a larger FRN magnitude after cashed-in trials in the unmasked points possible condition compared to the masked points possible condition based on the magnitude of the error. In Experiment 2, the amplitude of the FRN was affected by the magnitude of the error on cashed-in trials in the unmasked condition, but not the masked condition. These results are seemingly at odds, and cannot be assimilated into any currently extant model of the FRN. An explanation relying on the motivational importance of errors is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for 21 October 1940, the Taranto raid was delayed until 11 November {{to allow for}} key reinforcements to arrive and other commitments to be met. The aerial attack started with an initial volley of flares being deployed by Swordfish aircraft to illuminate the harbour, after which, the Swordfish formation commenced bombing and torpedo runs. Due {{to the presence of}} barrage <b>balloons</b> and torpedo <b>nets</b> restricting the number of suitable torpedo-dropping positions, many of the Swordfish had been armed with bombs and made a synchronised attack upon the cruisers and destroyers instead. The six torpedo-armed Swordfish succeeded at heavily damaging three of the battleships. In addition, two cruisers, two destroyers and other vessels were damaged or sunk. The high manoeuvrability of the Swordfish was attributed with enabling the aircraft to successfully evade intense anti-aircraft fire and deliver accurate strikes upon the Italian ships. The Battle of Taranto firmly established that naval aircraft were independently capable of immobilising an entire fleet and were an effective means of altering the balance of power. In the aftermath, the Japanese naval attaché to Berlin visited Taranto to view the consequences of the attack; he later briefed the staff who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|R
40|$|Ten healthy {{volunteers and}} 13 {{patients}} with oesophageal motility disorders whose primary presenting complaint was chest pain were studied by distending an intraoesophageal balloon in 1 ml {{steps to the}} point of a sensation of discomfort. The <b>net</b> <b>balloon</b> pressure (intra-balloon pressure when inflated within the oesophagus minus the pressure recorded at the same volume outside the patient) was measured at each volume increment and the distension volume at the perception of discomfort was noted. The measurements were repeated after intravenous injection of edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg) and again after 1. 2 mg intravenous atropine. Oesophageal wall compliance was similar in patients and controls, and the two groups showed a similar effect of decreased compliance with edrophonium and increased compliance after atropine. There {{were no significant differences between}} patients and controls of distending volume at perception of discomfort. Edrophonium, however, resulted in a significant reduction in distension threshold for pain (p less than 0. 03) in patients. A similar though non-significant trend was seen in controls. In both controls and patients, distension volume for pain production after atropine was significantly (p less than 0. 01) higher than after edrophonium. From these results and other published data, we suggest that the pain receptor for noxious stretch and after edrophonium challenge is likely to be an 'in series' mechanoreceptor located in oesophageal longitudinal muscle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{straightforward}} way {{to improve}} the payload capacity and flight duration of a multirotor aerial vehicle is by combining it with a balloon filled with a lifting gas, such as helium or hydrogen. The <b>balloon</b> provides a <b>net</b> aerostatic lift that is oriented contrary to the vehicle weight, thus reducing the equivalent load supported by the multirotor airframe. The present work {{is concerned with the}} dynamic modeling as well as the design of position and attitude control laws for a balloon-multirotor vehicle consisting of an oblate spheroid helium balloon coupled with a hexacopter structure. A six-degrees-of-freedom nonlinear dynamic model is derived for the balloon-hexacopter using the Newton-Euler approach and considering, among other common efforts, a restoration torque due to the displacement of the balloon's center of buoyancy above the vehicle's center of mass. In order to capture the contact flexibility between the balloon and the airframe, the center of buoyancy is supposed to oscillate with a second-order dynamics with respect to the airframe. Under the assumption of time-scale separation between the translational and rotational dynamics, the attitude and position control laws are designed separately from each other. Both the attitude and position control laws are proportional-derivative actions plus nonlinear feedforward terms for feedback linearization combined with control input saturation within appropriate parallelepipedal sets. These constraint sets are carefully chosen in order to satisfy torque, force and inclination design bounds. A parametric probabilistic approach where temperature and pressure are modeled as uniform-distributed random variables, and propagation of uncertainties is computed via Monte Carlo method, is employed to assess the overall system performance. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance and investigate some properties of the proposed balloon-hexacopter control system...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Excimer laser {{coronary}} angioplasty {{is reported to}} give excellent procedural results for treatment of complex coronary lesions, but this method has not been compared with balloon angioplasty in a randomised trial. METHODS: Patients (n = 308) with stable angina and coronary lesions longer than 10 mm on visual assessment were included. 151 patients (158 lesions) were assigned randomly to laser angioplasty and 157 (167 lesions) to balloon angioplasty. The primary clinical endpoints were death, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, or repeat {{coronary angioplasty}} of the randomised segment during 6 months of follow-up. The primary angiographic endpoint was the minimal lumen diameter at follow-up {{in relation to the}} baseline value (net gain), as determined by quantitative coronary angiography. FINDINGS: Laser angioplasty was followed by balloon angioplasty in 98 % of procedures. The angiographic success rate was 80 % in patients treated with laser angioplasty compared with 79 % in patients treated with balloon angioplasty. There were no deaths. Myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, and repeat angioplasty occurred in 4. 6 %, 10. 6 %, and 21. 2 %, respectively, of the patients in the laser angioplasty group compared with 5. 7 %, 10. 8 %, and 18. 5 % of the <b>balloon</b> angioplasty group. <b>Net</b> mean (SD) gain in minimal lumen diameter was 0. 40 (0. 69) mm in patients treated with laser angioplasty and 0. 48 (0. 66) mm in those treated with balloon angioplasty (p = 0. 34). The restenosis rate (> 50 % diameter stenosis) was 51. 6 % in the laser angioplasty group versus 41. 3 % in the balloon angioplasty group (p = 0. 13). INTERPRETATION: Excimer laser angioplasty followed by balloon angioplasty provides no benefit additional to balloon angioplasty alone with respect to the initial and long-term clinical and angiographic outcome in the treatment of obstructive coronary artery diseas...|$|R
