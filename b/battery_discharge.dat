50|$|In a {{recharging}} battery, or an electrolytic cell, the anode is {{the positive}} terminal, which receives current from an external generator.

50|$|A {{programmable}} load {{is a type}} of {{test equipment}} or instrument which emulates DC or AC resistance loads normally required to perform functional tests of batteries, power supplies or solar cells. By virtue of being programmable, tests like load regulation, <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> curve measurement and transient tests can be fully automated and load changes for these tests can be made without introducing switching transient that might change the measurement or operation of the power source under test.|$|E
50|$|Fully {{charging}} a NiFe cell consists of seven {{hours at the}} normal cell rate. In service the amount of charge given is governed by {{the extent of the}} previous discharge. For example, a <b>battery</b> <b>discharged</b> one-half, allows a 3.5 hour normal rate charge. Overcharging wastes current and causes rapid evaporation of the water in the electrolyte.|$|R
50|$|LEDs {{generally}} {{must have}} some kind of control to limit current through the diode. Flashlights using one or two disposable 1.5 volt cells require a boost converter to provide the higher voltage required by a white LED, which need around 3.4 volts to function. Flashlights using three or more dry cells may only use a resistor to limit current. Some flashlights electronically regulate the current through the LEDs to stabilize light output as the <b>batteries</b> <b>discharge.</b> LEDs maintain nearly constant color temperature regardless of input voltage or current, while the color temperature of an incandescent bulb rapidly declines as the <b>battery</b> <b>discharges,</b> becoming redder and less visible. Regulated LED flashlights may also have user-selectable levels of output appropriate to a task, for example, low light for reading a map and high output for checking a road sign. This would be difficult to do with a single incandescent bulb since efficacy of the lamp drops rapidly at low output.|$|R
30|$|Motivated to {{fill this}} {{research}} gap, this paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) of off-board PEV chargers with photovoltaic (PV) integration using two-level four-leg inverter topology. The charger operates in four quadrants in the active-reactive power planes to achieve multiple functions (i.e. PEV battery charging, PEV <b>battery</b> <b>discharging</b> for load leveling, providing reactive power support and acquiring maximum PV power generation). The control of the four quadrant modes is realized by incorporating both direct power and current MPC that dynamically controls the decoupled active-reactive power flow in a smart grid environment as well as controlling the PEV <b>battery</b> charging and <b>discharging</b> reliably.|$|R

The motors drive a 63 in wooden two-bladed propeller via a 3:1 bicycle-chain reduction gear. The propeller turns at a maximum of 1,100 rpm, decreasing with <b>battery</b> <b>discharge.</b> Power is controlled with a simple on/off switch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>discharge</b> {{profiles}} {{are often}} {{described in terms}} of a factor of battery capacity. For example, a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current - and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio - but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding energy-to-weight ratio and cell temperature. This relationship is known as Peukert's law.|$|E
50|$|Another charge-depleting {{strategy}} is called blended mode, {{in which the}} engine supplements the battery during medium to heavy loads. Although this strategy does not include a purely all-electric mode, early NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) simulations indicate that similar fuel savings as compared to conventional plug-in hybrid <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> and charge strategies. One advantage of a blended mode {{is that it may}} afford the vehicle designer the opportunity to use a smaller and less costly battery pack and traction motor.|$|E

50|$|In batteries, {{the cut-off}} (final) voltage is the {{prescribed}} lower-limit voltage at which <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> is considered complete. The cut-off voltage is usually chosen {{so that the}} maximum useful capacity of the battery is achieved. The cut-off voltage is different from one battery {{to the other and}} it is highly dependent on the type of battery and the kind of service in which the battery is used. When testing the capacity of a NiMH or NiCd battery a cut-off voltage of 1.0 V per cell is normally used, whereas 0.9 V is normally used as the cut-off voltage of an alkaline cell. Devices that have too high cut-off voltages may stop operating while the battery still has significant capacity remaining.|$|E
50|$|This {{model is}} {{different}} from the other models discovered because it relies only on knowledge of the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> voltage curve and access to battery voltage sensor which is available in all modern Smartphones. The basic idea for this model technique is to use battery state of discharge with running training software programs to control phone component power and activity states. Each individual Smartphone component is held in a specific state for a significant period of time and the change in battery state of discharge is captured using built-in battery voltage sensors. The first challenging idea is to convert battery voltage readings into power consumption. This is determined by state of discharge (which is total consumed energy by battery) variation within a testing interval captured by voltage sensors that will eventually drive the following equation.|$|E
5000|$|In the end, {{all that}} had been {{launched}} was the escape rocket. However, the fully fueled and powered-up Redstone was now sitting on LC-5 with nothing securing it to the pad. Various other dangers existed as well such as the capsule's retrorocket package and the range safety destruct charges. Furthermore, the capsule's main and reserve parachutes were hanging {{down the side of}} the rocket, threatening to tip it over if they caught enough wind. Fortunately, the weather conditions were favorable. Amid the panicked atmosphere in the control room, the launch team was unable to come up with quick and viable options to rectify the situation. Flight director Chris Kraft rejected several unsafe interventions, including using a rifle to shoot holes in the booster's propellant tanks to depressurize them. He eventually took the advice of one of the test engineers to simply wait out the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> and let the oxidizer boil off. [...] This early test failure and subsequent panic led Kraft to declare [...] "That is the first rule of flight control. If you don't know what to do, don't do anything." [...] Technicians therefore waited until the next morning, when the flight batteries in the rocket and capsule had run down and the Redstone's liquid oxygen had boiled off, before they could work on the rocket and render it safe.|$|E
