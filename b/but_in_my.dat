500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this is not}} nearly as bad an episode as many people are making it out to be, but it’s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and wound up with a 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and not much else. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, it’s better than 'Lord of the Flies'." ...|$|E

After performing a few shows and recording demos, Seefeel signed to the Too Pure Records label in late 1992. Too Pure's co-owner Richard Roberts stated that upon hearing Seefeel's demo [...] "there was no obvious song for radio, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion it felt good. As we viewed ourselves as an experimental label that didn't {{want to be}} tied to a sound or a scene, it seemed to make sense to release something with the band." [...] Seefeel chose Too Pure as they felt the label had respect for its artists, despite the low budget given to them to record Quique.|$|E

The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile.

According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E

Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there {{is no doubt in my}} mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

Theko reacted over a second after the gun fired to signal the start of the heat, although she improved her personal best time by over seven seconds. She ranked behind heat winner Nafissatou Moussa Adamou of Niger (37.29 seconds) and Togo's Adzo Kpossi (37.55 seconds). Theko finished 73rd (and last) of all swimmers overall, and did not advance to the semi-finals because her time was 17.07 seconds slower than the slowest athlete who progressed to the later stages.|$|E

500|$|Robert Christgau gave a {{positive}} review, calling the song {{one of the}} [...] "impossibly touching" [...] tracks on Shades of Purple that [...] "sets the standard" [...] {{for the rest of}} the album. Chuck Taylor from Billboard said the song would appeal to both the young and mature listeners as it [...] "neatly walks the line between pure pop and the cusp of the adult top 40". He added the song was [...] "Absolutely enchanting in its youthful vocal and meaty series of hooks". Michael Paoletta, also from Billboard, called the song an [...] "infectious pop rocker", adding that [...] "what's most dazzling about the track is the vocal verve of the girls' harmonizing." [...] Heather Phares from AllMusic referred to the song as [...] "sweet yet down-to-earth pop". Marius Lillelien, the director of the Norwegian radio station NRK P3, said [...] "It's a very well-written, well-produced pop song, they're young and potentially the largest Norwegian pop success ever. The song is best suited to an audience aged 10–16, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion it won't scare away older listeners".

500|$|When 20th Century Fox {{acquired}} the film rights to Watchmen, the comic's writer Alan Moore was initially {{excited about the}} film adaptation. In a 1987 edition of Comics Interview, he revealed Sam Hamm, who was attached to write, visited him in Northampton for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic's spirit. Ultimately, Hamm's script altered the ending, having Adrian Veidt die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation. As a result, the remaining characters are teleported {{to the real world}} created as a result of time travel. In an interview with Varietys Danny Graydon, during Warner Bros.'s first possession of feature film rights for Watchmen, Moore changed his mind, adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book. Moore felt that, contrary to others’ opinion, the comic book was not cinematic. When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book, Moore stated that he [...] "didn't think it was filmable". Moore clarified for Graydon, [...] "I didn't design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics, which are there, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart I feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E

[...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that force you to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If your partner has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives you both share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer". GameTrailers praised the game's gameplay and the diversity of the levels, while Giant Bomb claimed, [...] "Retro recaptures most of Donkey Kong's venerated platforming roots in this fine Wii sequel." ...|$|E
