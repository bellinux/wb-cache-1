50|$|A <b>blood</b> <b>blister</b> {{is a type}} of blister {{that forms}} when subdermal tissues and blood vessels are damaged without {{piercing}} the skin. It consists of a pool of lymph, blood and other body fluids trapped beneath the skin. If punctured, it suppurates a dark fluid. Sometimes the fluids are cut {{off from the rest of}} the body and dry up, leaving behind dead cell material inside the blister with a texture like putty. Some blood blisters can be extremely painful due to bruising where the blister occurred.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>blisters</b> are {{commonly}} caused by accidents {{in which the}} skin is pinched by a tool, mechanism, or heavy weight without protective gear. <b>Blood</b> <b>blisters</b> can also arise from forcible human contact, including grappling.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>blisters</b> {{also may}} occur with {{friction}} caused by constant rubbing of skin against a surface.

Because {{there is no clear}} aneurysmal sac to treat they re-main challenging lesions to manage whether the approach is endovascular or surgical. Although the management of intracranial cerebral aneu-rysms has changed subsequent to the results published by the ISAT trial, there still exist groups of aneurysms which do not lend them-selves to endovascular management. There are recent reports of successful endovascular man-agement using flow diverting approaches but ex-perience is limited and relying on flow change may be insufficient to prevent re-rupture.

40|$|Various {{differential}} diagnoses {{pertaining to}} angina bullosa haemorrhagica (ABH) {{have been reported}} in the dental literature; these differential diagnoses include mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, bullous lichen planus, epidermolysis bullosa, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease, and oral amyloidosis. ABH is characterized by a solitary <b>blood</b> <b>blister</b> in the palate and may worsen progressively, leading to multiple lesions in other areas. The bullae usually rupture spontaneously and the sites heal uneventfully. Possible etiological factors include trauma, long-term use of steroids, diabetes, and hereditary predilection. Pathological studies have yielded nonspecific findings and the underlying etiopathology remains ill-defined. This article describes a case of ABH following the use of a 0. 12 % chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse and presents a concise review of the literature pertaining to ABH and differential diagnoses. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} monkeys (Macacus rhesus) {{were found to}} be {{infected}} with a nematode which gave rise to several types of skin lesions, subcutaneous nodules, edema about the joints, and elongated serpiginous blisters of the palms and soles. In the subcutaneous nodules were found larval forms of the nematode and possibly adult male forms. The reaction about these worms consisted of proliferation of fixed cells, and invasion of eosinophils, with subsequent presence of giant cells, young blood vessels, and finally capsule formation; eventually the worms were killed, eliminated, and the nodule disappeared. In the skin of the palms and soles the adult female worm burrowed in the epidermis, producing an elongated serpiginous <b>blood</b> <b>blister</b> that eventually became purulent. In this blister the worm laid her eggs; and by the bursting of the blister the eggs were discharged into the outer world and placed in a position to infect new hosts. The reaction in the epidermis was evidently not severe enough to interfere seriously with the health of the host or with the continuation of the egg-bearing period of the female parasite. This condition of almost perfect parasitism is an ideal one for the continuation of the life of this species of nematode. In so far as we are able to determine this is the first description of a nematode that lays its eggs in the epidermis. The provisional name of the parasite is Trichosoma cutaneum, 1922...|$|E
40|$|Background: To date, real-life data on non-surgical {{correction}} of Dupuytren’s contracture with collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection (CCH, Xiapex) are limited. Methods and results: In an open-label non-interventional study in in Germany (mean age 65. 1 ± 9. 8 years, 79. 3 % males), patients were followed up until 1 year after injection. 63 (73. 3 %) received the injection at the MCP joint, and 23 (26. 7 %) at the PIP. The mean grade of contracture in the presently treated finger at baseline {{was for the}} MCP joint 32. 4 °± 25. 1, for the PIP° 29. 2 ± 31. 5, and for the DIP° 0. 5 ± 2. 0. At days 30 / 360 compared to baseline, the degree of contracture of the MCP joint was reduced by 28. 2 °± 24. 6 / 30. 8 °± 25. 0, of the PIP by 20. 0 °± 24. 7 / 8. 5 °± 29. 6, and of the DIP by 0. 01 °± 1. 9 / 0. 7 ± 2. 3. Improvement of hand function at day 30 / 360 was rated by physicians as very good in 69. 5 / 60. 9 %, as good in 23. 2 / 28. 3 %, and as poor in 7. 3 / 8. 7 %, and none in 0. 0 / 2. 2 %. No serious adverse drug reactions (SADR) occurred. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) were noted within injection in 64 patients (74. 4 %), mostly contusion/swelling, pain, <b>blood</b> <b>blister</b> or other bleeding at the injection site, or ecchymosis. In an overall assessment, at day 30 / 360, 73. 5 %/ 95. 7 % of the physicians rated tolerability of CCH in their patients as very good, 22. 9 %/ 2. 2 % as good, and 3. 6 %/ 2. 2 % as moderate. On the EQ- 5 D Visual Analog Scale the mean score improved from 79. 5 ± 17. 9 to 83. 8 ± 15. 8 at day 30, and to 85. 4 ± 14. 1 at day 360. On the Michigan Hand Questionnaire, the total score was 67. 5 points at baseline, at day 30 and 75. 2 points at day 360. Conclusions: Overall, treatment with CCH under clinical practice conditions was effective and well tolerated. Quality of life and hand function improved substantially. No unknown safety issues were identified during the study...|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} {{in the mouth of}} haemorrhagic petechiae, ecchymoses or <b>blood</b> <b>blisters</b> with spontaneous bleeding is suggestive of a haemorrhagic disorder that may be caused either by functional impairment of platelets or of blood vessel walls, by an abnormal {{decrease in the number of}} circulating platelets (thrombocytopaenia), or by defects in the blood clotting mechanism. Thrombocytopaenia from decreased production or increased destruction of platelets may be caused by multiple factors including immune mediated mechanisms, drugs or infections. A diagnosis of thrombocytopaenic purpura can be made when any other disease entity that might be causing the purpura is excluded on the basis of the medical history, the physical examination, a complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear. In this paper, we outline the clinical features of oral thrombocytopaenic purpura and briefly discuss some aspects of its aetiopathogenesis and treatment...|$|R

5000|$|Because B. insularis is {{only found}} in an area {{uninhabited}} by humans, {{there has never been}} an official report of a human being bitten by one, but other lanceheads are responsible for more human mortality than any other group of snakes in either North or South America. Ludwig Trutnau reports four human envenomations, three of which were fatal. The mortality rate for lancehead envenomations is 0.5-3% if the patient receives treatment and 7% if the patient does not receive treatment. [...] The effects of envenomations by lanceheads include swelling, local pain, nausea and vomiting, <b>blood</b> <b>blisters,</b> bruising, <b>blood</b> in the vomit and urine, intestinal bleeding, kidney failure, hemorrhage in the brain and severe necrosis of muscular tissue. Chemical analysis of the venom of B. insularis suggests that it is five times as potent as that of B. jararaca and is the fastest acting venom in the genus Bothrops. They have hemotoxic venom that eats away at flesh and tissue to digest the prey item before they swallow it. Bothrops insularis also have some neurotoxic venom that kills the prey item.|$|R

40|$|Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is now {{established}} {{as an effective}} and safe option to treat patients with a single joint affected with Dupuytren's contracture. We have extended its use to natatory and combined cords. In a prospective consecutive series of 298 cords in 237 patients, the mean total extension loss improved in cords crossing the metacarpophalangeal joint from 46 ° to 1 °, in cords crossing the proximal interphalangeal joint from 56 ° to 7 °, in natatory cords from 130 ° to 25 ° and in combined cords from 102 ° to 16 °. The immediate correction of combined cords and natatory cords was less reliable than that obtained in cords crossing the metacarpophalangeal joint or proximal interphalangeal joint. Less severe pre-intervention contractures tended to correct better. We found a high complication rate, which may cause alarm. A total of 21 % developed skin splits, with the risk of skin splits generally increasing with more severe pre-injection deformity. <b>Blood</b> <b>blisters</b> were only encountered after manipulation of the more severe contractures.
