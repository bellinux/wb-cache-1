500|$|Two filmed {{scenes were}} {{cut from the}} final version of the episode. Both {{featured}} Tim Ransom as Scully's boyfriend Ethan Minette.

The addition of Scully's <b>boyfriend</b> <b>was</b> an attempt by the Fox executives to create the romantic interest that they felt was not there between Mulder and Scully. Chris Carter ultimately found that it was [...] "very easy" [...] to remove the character from the episode, both because his appearances seemed to slow down the scenes in which Mulder and Scully are together and due to the fact that Carter found Scully's relationship with her FBI partner to actually be more interesting and exciting than her relationship with her boyfriend.|$|E

[...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former <b>boyfriend</b> <b>was</b> more in love with himself than with her.
