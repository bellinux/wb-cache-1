On 17 October, Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis steamed to İğneada. Two days later, the two battleships bombarded Bulgarian artillery positions near Varna. On 30 October, Barbaros Hayreddin was <b>back</b> <b>outside</b> Varna to blockade the port along with the destroyer Nümune-i Hamiyet. On 17 November, Barbaros Hayreddin and Mesûdiye bombarded Bulgarian positions in support of the I Corps, with the aid of artillery observers ashore. The battleships' gunnery was poor, though it provided a morale boost for the defending Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. From 15 to 20 November, the ship was stationed at Büyükçekmece along with her sister ship and several other warships, but they saw no action against the small Bulgarian navy.|$|E

When Triple H attempted to use his sledgehammer against Austin, Vince McMahon grabbed it from him. They spent seven minutes of the match outside the ring, where Austin used a steel fence, trashcan, and microphone as weapons. Once in the ring, both men attempted to end the match by utilizing their finishing maneuvers. <b>Back</b> <b>outside</b> of the ring, Austin threw Triple H into both the steel ring stairs and the announce table, causing him to bleed profusely.

25|$|In 1982, the International Skating Union {{enacted a}} rule stating that a skater may perform {{each type of}} triple only once, or twice {{if one of them}} is {{incorporated}} into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a combination, each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the <b>back</b> <b>outside</b> edge of the landing foot, or skating leg. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a back inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump sequences are sets of jumps which may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops. Sequences are worth 80% of what the same jumps executed in combination would be worth.|$|E

Christian then leaped off Edge over the top rope onto Storm and Awesome. As Christian was on the top turnbuckle, Awesome tripped Christian, and attacked his <b>back</b> <b>outside.</b> Back in the ring, Storm and Awesome dominated Christian after Storm threw Christian's gut into the ringpost. Christian fought back with a crossbody, but Awesome tagged in, and performed a flapjack spinebuster. Storm and Awesome dominated Christian until Christian performed a back body drop to Awesome from the top rope. Edge and Storm tagged in, and Edge performed an Edge-O-Matic to Storm. Storm performed a jawbreaker, and attempted a double belly-to-back suplex with Awesome. Edge landed on his feet, and Christian performed a flying clothesline to both Storm and Awesome. Edge performed a spear to Awesome. Storm attempted a superkick to Christian, but Edge shoved Christian, and took the kick himself.

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{describe}} the match-play demands of professional rugby union players competing in Super 14 matches during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Design The movements of 20 players from Super 14 rugby union team during the 2008 and 2009 seasons were video recorded. Methods Using time-motion analysis (TMA), five players from four positional groups (front-row forwards, back-row forwards, inside <b>backs</b> and <b>outside</b> <b>backs)</b> were assessed. Results Players covered between 4218 m and 6389 m during the games. The maximum distances covered in a game by the four groups were: front row forwards (5139 m), back row forwards, (5422 m), inside <b>backs</b> (6389111) and <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> (5489 m). The back row forwards spent the greatest amount of time in high-intensity exercise (1190 s), followed by the front row forwards (1015 s), the inside backs (876 s) and the <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> (570 s). Average distances covered in individual sprint efforts were: front row forwards (16 m), back row forwards (14 m), inside backs (17 in) and <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> (18 m). Work to rest ratios of 1 : 4, 1 : 4, 1 : 5, and 1 : 6 were found for the front row and back row forwards, and inside and <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> respectively. Conclusion The Super 14 competition during 2008 and 2009, have resulted in an increase in total high-intensity activities, sprint frequency, and work to rest ratios across all playing positions. For players and teams to remain competitive in Super 14 rugby, training (including recovery practices) should reflect these current demands. (C) 2011 Sports Medicine Australia.

25|$|The {{main event}} was between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship. In this match, the {{stipulation}} {{was that if}} Edge got disqualified, he would lose the title to Cena. During the match, Cena used several blows and slams on Edge. He also performed a belly-to-belly suplex on Edge and {{kept an eye on}} Edge's valet, the WWE Women's Champion Lita. Edge took advantage and connected with chokeholds and a flying clothesline, but Cena was able to recover. Lita tried to interfere, but Edge warned her not to get him disqualified. Lita threw a steel chair into the ring, but Edge threw it <b>back</b> <b>outside</b> the ring, and Cena took advantage. Cena then applied the STFU on Edge. Lita tried to interfere again, but Edge warned her once again. Edge made it to the ropes, and while the referee told Cena to break the hold, Lita handed Edge a pair of brass knuckles. As Cena broke the hold, Cena put Edge on his shoulders again for the FU, but this time Lita jumped on Edge's back when Cena had Edge set up for the FU, and Lita was the recipient of the FU instead of Edge. Edge then jumped off of Cena's back and hit Cena {{in the back of the}} head with the brass knuckles to win the match and retain his championship.|$|E

500|$|When {{the agents}} track down Chantara, whose face is pixelated, {{she claims that}} her pimp {{attacked}} Ricky and fears that he will kill her. She pleads with the agents for protection.

Though other deputies express skepticism, Mulder finds flattened bullets; indicating they physically impacted something, though no trace is found of what they struck. Mulder formulates a theory that the entity changes its form to correspond with its victims' worst fears. Wetzel, Ricky, and Chantara all expressed fear shortly before their run-ins with the entity; it was visible to them, but not to others. The agents think that Steve and Edy may be the entity's next target because they were in the vicinity of Ricky's attack. They head to their house, only to find the couple {{in the middle of an}} argument. After Edy expresses fear of a separation from Steve, the couple reconciles.

Six players were chosen at random from each of four groups: props and locks, back row forwards, inside <b>backs,</b> <b>outside</b> <b>backs.</b> Heart rate records were classified based on percent time spent in four zones (> 95 %, 85 - 95 %, 75 - 84 %, < 75 % HR m ax). Blood lactate concentration was measured periodically throughout each match, with movements being classified as standing, walking, jogging, cruising, sprinting, utility, rucking/mauling and scrummaging. The heart rate data indicated that props and locks (58. 4 %) and back row forwards (56. 2 %) spent significantly more time in high exertion (85 - 95 % HR m ax) than inside backs (40. 5 %) and <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> (33. 9 %) (P < 0. 001). Inside backs (36. 5 %) and <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> (38. 5 %) spent significantly more time in moderate exertion (75 - 84 % HR m ax) than props and locks (22. 6 %) and back row forwards (19. 8 %) (P < 0. 05). <b>Outside</b> <b>backs</b> (20. 1 %) spent significantly more time in low exertion (< 75 % HR m ax) than props and locks (5. 8 %) and back row forwards (5. 6 %) (P < 0. 05). Mean blood lactate concentration did not differ significantly between groups (range: 4. 67 mmol. l - 1 for <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> to 7. 22 mmol. l - 1 for back row forwards; P < 0. 05). The motion analysis data indicated that <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> (5750 m) covered a significantly greater total distance than either props and locks or back row forwards (4400 and 4080 m, respectively; P < 0. 05). Inside <b>backs</b> and <b>outside</b> <b>backs</b> covered significantly greater distances walking (1740 and 1780 m, respectively; P < 0. 001), in utility movements (417 and 475 m, respectively; P < 0. 001) and sprinting (208 and 340 m, respectively; P < 0. 001) than either props and locks or back row forwards (walking: 1000 and 991 m; utility movements: 106 and 154 m; sprinting: 72 and 94 m, respectively). <b>Outside</b> <b>backs</b> covered a significantly greater distance sprinting than inside backs (208 and 340 m, respectively; P < 0. 001). Forwards maintained a higher level of exertion than backs, due to more constant motion and a large involvement in static high-intensity activities. A mean blood lactate concentration of 4. 8 - 7. 2 mmol. l - 1 indicated a need for 'lactate tolerance' training to improve hydrogen ion buffering and facilitate removal following high-intensity efforts. Furthermore, the large distances (4. 2 - 5. 6 km) covered during, and intermittent nature of, match-play indicated a need for sound aerobic conditioning in all groups (particularly backs) to minimize fatigue and facilitate recovery between high-intensity efforts...|$|R
