500|$|A fireman named O. H. Bush {{and several}} other men crawled through a broken window of the {{farmhouse}} in search of survivors. When they determined {{that no one was}} in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up an armful of explosives and handed it to one of the men. As Kehoe left his burning farm and house in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire, [...] "Boys, you're my friends. You <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here. You better head down to the school", and drove off.|$|E
500|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} Sidney J. Howell {{testified that}} after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying [...] "Boys, you are my friends, you <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here, you better {{go down to the}} school." [...] Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there. He swerved his truck and {{stopped in front of the}} building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. [...] Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up his truck.|$|E
500|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{initially}} hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. [...] "Somebody was {{keeping an eye on}} me when I thought I'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of that bush..." [...] he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied Italian partisans; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid for a while longer before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, took him in, but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.|$|E

6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] said Robert. [...] "You <b>better</b> <b>get</b> home <b>out</b> of {{the night}} air. It's damp. You'll hardly be worth killing to-morrow on account of your rheumatism. Think it'll be a clear day, Bushrod?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "People {{laying down}} were saying, 'please help me'. I {{went over to}} one lady who was {{unconscious}} and said {{are you all right}} and someone said 'you just get away from them', then I thought with the other fellas on the road, you know, I <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here. There was two cars that had pulled up so I knew that there was help on its way, I just didn’t leave them stranded." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead at 1:00p.m. CST, the official announcement would not come until {{more than half an}} hour later. [...] After receiving word of the president's death, acting White House press secretary Malcolm Kilduff entered the hospital room where Vice President Johnson—who would be sworn in as the new President on Air Force one later that day—and his wife were sitting. Kilduff approached them and said to Johnson, [...] "Mr. President, I have to announce the death of President Kennedy. Is it OK with you that the announcement be made now?" [...] Johnson ordered that the announcement be made only after he left the hospital. When asking that the announcement be delayed, Johnson told Kilduff: [...] "I think I had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here.[...]before you announce it. We don't know whether this is a worldwide conspiracy, whether they are after me as well as they were after President Kennedy, or whether they are after Speaker (John W.) McCormack, or Senator (Carl) Hayden. We just don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, General," [...] said Jonas. [...] "Though, stop a moment, Oliver; {{perhaps we}} had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and walk, or the sleigh may upset." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I know they're talking nonsense,' Alice {{thought to}} herself: 'and it's foolish to cry about it.' So she brushed away her tears, {{and went on}} as cheerfully as she could. 'At any rate I'd <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of the wood, for really it's coming on very dark. Do you think it's going to rain?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never did}} {{see such a}} addle-headed old creetur!' exclaimed Sam irritably; 'Old Baileys, and Solvent Courts, and alleybis, and ev'ry species o' gammon alvays a-runnin' through his brain.

6000|$|... 'I {{thought the}} house was empty then. Your aunt always let us use that short cut. Ha-hadn't we <b>better</b> <b>get</b> this <b>out</b> into the passage? It'll all {{have to come out}} anyhow. You take the other side.' They began to lift a heavyish table.

6000|$|... (Man-servant enters, goes to tea-table, looks it over, {{and makes}} slight rearrangements.) (Lowering his voice.) He will make himself a {{laughing}} stock.

6000|$|... 'You should <b>get</b> <b>better</b> coals <b>out</b> of your contractors,' {{said the}} apothecary's deputy, {{breaking}} a lump {{on the top}} of the fire with the rusty poker; 'these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you, Dick; and you know, {{we have had}} several looks at the French lines, {{from the roof of}} the church. Their {{batteries}} are chiefly {{on this side of the}} town; but most of their troops are encamped on the other side, so as to be in readiness to meet any attempt of Wellington to succour the place; and also to show the garrison that there is no chance, whatever, of their being able to draw off. We agreed that the chances would be much <b>better</b> of <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> on this side than on the other." ...|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{drawing on}} Linebarger's own {{expertise}} {{in the field of}} psychological warfare, it is a study of the personality of a U.S. operative (Major Michael Dugan) who has little in common with James Bond except his extreme resourcefulness under cover and in danger. A man of many identities who sees himself to some extent as a blank sheet, he goes from calling himself [...] "Comrade Nobody" [...] to saying [...] "I'm anybody". The novel also has an underlying, albeit devious and ambiguous, message of peace. As one character says, learning to like people is [...] "the only way to win wars, or even <b>better,</b> to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Boulte {{looked up}} the road, and at the hills. 'Nothing,' said he quietly; 'what's the use? It's too ghastly for anything. We must let the old life go on.
