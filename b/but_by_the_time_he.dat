5|$|A {{few days}} before fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigates a murder in a {{suburban}} home, in which occult paraphernalia has been {{laid out in a}} disorganized manner. Watts contacts Black for help with the case. However, Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> can investigate, Sammael is gone.|$|E
5|$|<b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> {{captured}} the position, {{the rest of}} his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|The friends {{decide to}} watch the video, {{although}} Ross objects to everyone seeing the tape. On the video, Rachel's date, Chip Matthews, has not arrived, and Monica refuses {{to go to the}} prom without her. Mrs. Geller convinces Ross to wear his father's tuxedo and take Rachel to the prom himself. Ross reluctantly agrees, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> is dressed and ready to go, Chip has arrived and the girls leave. The video ends with Ross looking disappointed and dejected. Rachel, touched by Ross's gesture, gets up and kisses Ross, forgiving him for what happened between them. Monica later watches the video alone which features her and her father, Jack, dancing. The video then shows Monica and Ross's parents in bed, which disgusts her.|$|E

5|$|Wayne {{originally}} intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against the Indians and to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated. He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force. Logan flatly refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him {{an officer in the}} federal army on July 1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation. When he joined Wayne at Fort Jefferson on October 21, 1793, he had only been able to raise 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Few records exist of Thomas Coke's early years, {{although}} {{it is known that}} he was educated in Longford, Derbyshire, before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French refugees. In 1765 he was sent to Eton College, where he was joined by William Windham, a close friend in his later life. Coke was apparently happy at Eton, and was excellent at field sports; on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in his room, and on another he narrowly avoiding being punished for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Park. He was not particularly interested in his academic studies, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class, and practical skills to deal with his future estates. After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, financed by his father and his great-aunt (who offered him £500 not to go to a university, regarding them as dens of vice). Coke visited France and Italy, where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke, preferring the similarly-aged Englishman to her 52-year-old alcoholic husband.|$|E
5|$|Rowley {{first learned}} of the {{operations}} off Grand Port on 22 August, when Windham arrived off Saint Paul. Eager to support Pym's attack, Rowley immediately set sail in his frigate HMS Boadicea, with the transport Bombay following with two companies of the 86th Regiment of Foot to provide a garrison on any territory seized in the operation. The headwinds were strong {{and it was not}} until 29 August that Rowley arrived off Grand Port, having been notified of the situation there by Magiciennes launch the previous day. Sighting a cluster of frigates around Île de la Passe, Rowley closed with the island before turning sharply when Vénus and Manche raised their colours and gave chase. Rowley repeatedly feinted towards the French ships and then pulled away, hoping to draw them away from Grand Port in the hope that Bombay might board the now unprotected Iphigenia and capture her. Bombay was thwarted by the reappearance of Astrée and Entreprenant and Rowley was chased by Vénus and Manche back to Saint Denis, anchoring there on 30 August. Rowley attempted a second time to rescue Iphigenia from Grand Port the following week, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> returned Bellone and Minerve had been refloated and the French force was far too strong for Rowley's flagship to attack alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy {{in the summer of}} 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time {{it seemed as if the}} cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E

Asquith was universally accepted as the natural successor. King Edward, who was on holiday in Biarritz, sent for Asquith, who took the boat train to France and kissed hands as prime minister in the Hôtel du Palais, Biarritz on 7 April.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} back to the {{passenger}} side of the Corolla as Hall attempted to climb over to the driver's seat. Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her.

He grabbed his rifle, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW.

His ministers from Upatissagama then governed the kingdom for a year, while awaiting a reply. Meanwhile, in Sinhapura, Sumitta had become the king, and had three sons. His queen was a daughter of the king of Madda (possibly Madra). When Vijaya's messengers arrived, he was himself very old. So, he requested one of his sons to depart for Lanka. His youngest son, Panduvasdeva, volunteered to go. Panduvasdeva and 32 sons of Sumitta's ministers reached Lanka, where Panduvasdeva became the new ruler.|$|E

Finding his income inadequate to support himself and his family, he left the university and took up a post producing and writing for the BBC. He remained with the BBC until after the Second World War, when he became a freelance writer, and remained so {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no record}} of Liston's birth. His family's home state of Arkansas did not make birth {{certificates}} mandatory until 1965. His family, but not Sonny Liston, {{can be found in}} the 1930 census, and in the 1940 census he was listed as 10 years old. It has been suggested Liston himself may not have known what year he was born, as he was not precise on the matter. He finally settled on a date of birth of May 8, 1932 for official purposes <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> won the world title an aged appearance added credence to rumors that he was actually several years older. One writer concluded that Liston's most plausible date of birth was July 22, 1930, citing census records and statements from his mother during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{who loved}} {{lingering}} in her bath spent unusually much time there on 28 April.

Conrad wanted to return home, but two men ambushed and stabbed him in a narrow street. Most sources agree that they were sent by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, head of the Assassins. While dying, Conrad ordered Isabella not to give Tyre to anyone but Richard of England or to the new king of Jerusalem. When Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, who was Philip of France's lieutenant in the Holy Land, urged Isabella to deliver Tyre to him, she shut herself up in the fortress and refused to open its gates.|$|E
