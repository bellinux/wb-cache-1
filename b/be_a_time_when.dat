500|$|Writers on Deep Space Nine had {{previously}} hinted at a potential same-sex {{relationship in the}} [...] episode [...] "", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax's previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in {{a situation in which}} it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in [...] "Rejoined". Allen Kwan has argued that Deep Space Nine is the only series of Star Trek that resists the heteronormativity typical of the franchise, citing both [...] "Rejoined" [...] and the Mirror Universe episodes as examples, even if the presented bisexuality is problematized.|$|E

She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care if I have a nice day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> people will sincerely intend it.|$|E

60|$|Such may be {{laid down}} as a very general rule; and few women should allow {{themselves}} to deviate from it, and then only on rare occasions. But if there <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> a woman may let her hair to the winds, when she may loose her arms, and scream out trumpet-tongued to the ears of men, it is when nature calls out within her not for her own wants, but for the wants of those whom her womb has borne, whom her breasts have suckled, for those who look to her for their daily bread as naturally as man looks to his Creator.|$|E
60|$|Let the diversions or pleasures in {{question}} {{be what they}} will, and how innocent soever they are in themselves, they are not so to him, because they interrupt or interfere with his business, which is his immediate duty.

There is a visible difference between the things which we may do, and the things which we must do. Pleasures at certain seasons are allowed, and we may give ourselves some loose to them; but business, I mean to the man of business, is that needful thing, {{of which it is}} not to be said it may, but it must be done.|$|E

6000|$|The clergyman {{shook his}} head, {{with a great}} concern in his face, when I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, said, [...] "If that be his case, you may assure him {{it is not too}} late; Christ will give him repentance. But pray," [...] says he, [...] "explain this to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of his passion, {{procuring}} divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> provoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear; but that 'tis never too late for men to ask mercy; and we that are Christ's servants are commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent: so that 'tis never too late to repent." ...|$|E
6000|$|He says: “The Greek words, εις, τους αιώνας των αιώνων, here {{translated}} ‘everlasting,’ signify literally ‘unto {{the ages}} of ages,’ αιει ων, ‘always being,’ that is, everlasting, ceaseless existence. Plato uses the word in this sense when he says, ‘The gods that live forever.’ But I must also admit that this word is used several times in a limited extent—as for instance, ‘The everlasting hills.’ Of course {{this does not mean}} that there never will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the hills will cease to stand; the expression here is evidently figurative, but it implies eternity. The hills shall remain as long as the earth lasts, and no hand has power to remove them but that Eternal One which first called them into being; so the state of the soul remains the same after death as long as the soul exists, and no one has power to alter it. The same word is often applied to denote the existence of God—‘the Eternal God.’ Can we limit the word when applied to him? Because occasionally used in a limited sense, we must not infer it is always so. ‘Everlasting’ plainly means in Scripture ‘without end;’ it is only to be explained figuratively when it is evident it cannot be interpreted in any other way.” ...|$|E

So are the convicts at Portland. They never suffer from indigestion. I knew a doctor once who prescribed for a patient two years' penal servitude as the only thing likely to do him permanent good. Your stomach won't let you smoke. It won't let you drink--not when you are thirsty.

6000|$|Isabel {{held the}} {{telegram}} to her lips. She {{seemed to be}} kissing Philip. [...] "Dear, dear husband, I knew, I knew," [...] she softly murmured. The {{rest of the day}} she wandered about the garden, almost in an ecstacy of expectation. Something seemed to tell her that Philip was safe, that she would hear from him. But evening shadows fell without a personal word from the North. She was obliged to content herself by reading the evening papers, which were beginning to contradict certain overwhelming statements of days back. The hotel that had totally collapsed was now known to have been poorly built and was not the St. Francis, as formerly stated. Iron frames of many buildings had withstood the earthquake to go down at last before dynamite. Still, the list of dead and wounded would be a long one. Nothing could be definitely settled until after flames had ceased to lick through deserted streets. Suffering was intense on every side. Children had first seen the world under its open sky. Women, without beds to lie upon, had given birth in the open. Yet it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the best part of human nature revealed a noble side. Already hope was beginning to stir in camps where ruined families clung lovingly together. Isabel's eyes grew moist as she read a thrilling story of heroism and courage.|$|E
6000|$|Terence, meanwhile, read a novel {{which some}} {{one else had}} written, a process which he found {{essential}} to the composition of his own. For a considerable time nothing was to be heard but the ticking of the clock and the fitful scratch of Rachel's pen, as she produced phrases which bore a considerable likeness to those which she had condemned. She was struck by it herself, for she stopped writing and looked up; looked at Terence deep in the arm-chair, looked at the different pieces of furniture, at her bed in the corner, at the window-pane which showed {{the branches of a}} tree filled in with sky, heard the clock ticking, and was amazed at the gulf which lay between all that and her sheet of paper. Would there ever <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the world was one and indivisible? Even with Terence himself--how far apart they could be, how little she knew what was passing in his brain now! She then finished her sentence, which was awkward and ugly, and stated that they were [...] "both very happy, and going to be married in the autumn probably and hope to live in London, where we hope you will come and see us when we get back." [...] Choosing [...] "affectionately," [...] after some further speculation, rather than sincerely, she signed the letter and was doggedly beginning on another when Terence remarked, quoting from his book: ...|$|E
60|$|Sect. 66. But {{though there}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> a child {{comes to be}} as free from {{subjection}} to the will and command of his father, as the father himself is free from subjection {{to the will of}} any body else, and they are each under no other restraint, but that which is common to them both, whether it be the law of nature, or municipal law of their country; yet this freedom exempts not a son from that honour which he ought, by the law of God and nature, to pay his parents. God having made the parents instruments in his great design of continuing the race of mankind, and the occasions of life to their children; as he hath laid on them an obligation to nourish, preserve, and bring up their offspring; so he has laid on the children a perpetual obligation of honouring their parents, which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be shewn by all outward expressions, ties up the child from any thing that may ever injure or affront, disturb or endanger, the happiness or life of those from whom he received his; and engages him in all actions of defence, relief, assistance and comfort of those, by whose means he entered into being, and has been made capable of any enjoyments of life: from this obligation no state, no freedom can absolve children. But this is very far from giving parents a power of command over their children, or an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their lives or liberties. It is one thing to owe honour, respect, gratitude and assistance; another to require an absolute obedience and submission. The honour due to parents, a monarch in his throne owes his mother; and yet this lessens not his authority, nor subjects him to her government.|$|E

60|$|But Lucy had {{troubles}} {{of her own}} {{in reference to the}} family at Queen's Gate, which did, in fact, make it almost impossible to visit her sister for some weeks. Sir Thomas had given an unwilling but a frank consent to his son's marriage,--and then expected simply to be told that it would take place at such and such a time, when money would be required. Lady Tringle had given her consent,--but not quite frankly. She still would fain have forbidden the banns, had any power of forbidding remained in her hands. Augusta was still hot against the marriage, and still resolute to prevent it. That proposed journey upstairs after the scrap-book at Glenbogie, that real journey {{up to the top of}} St. Peter's, still rankled in her heart. That Tom should make Ayala a future baronet's wife; that Tom should endow Ayala with the greatest share of the Tringle wealth; that Ayala should become powerful in Queen's Gate, and dominant probably at Merle Park and Glenbogie,--was wormwood to her. She was conscious that Ayala was pretty and witty, though she could affect to despise the wit and the prettiness. By instigating her mother, and by inducing Mr. Traffick to interfere when Mr. Traffick should be a member of the family, she thought that she might prevail. With her mother she did in part prevail. Her future husband was at present too much engaged with Supply and Demand to be able to give his thoughts to Tom's affairs. But there would soon <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he naturally would be compelled to divide his thoughts. Then there was Gertrude. Gertrude's own affairs had not as yet been smiled upon, and the want of smiles she attributed very much to Augusta. Why should Augusta have her way and not she, Gertrude, nor her brother Tom? She therefore leagued herself with Tom, and declared herself quite prepared to receive Ayala into the house. In this way the family was very much divided.|$|E
6000|$|At this, the clergyman {{shook his}} head, [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "pray {{tell him it}} is not too late; Christ will give him repentance, if he has {{recourse}} to the merit of his passion. Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine mercy? There may indeed <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> provoked mercy will no longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this world." [...] I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we discoursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in religious matters; yet all of them promised to do their endeavours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon which promises the priest married the three couple. But as Atkins was the only sincere convert and of more sense than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him: [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "let us walk out of this labyrinth, & I dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife already." [...] And indeed we found it true; for coming {{to the edge of the}} wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse; he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to himself, to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we could perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his hands; at which the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfortune was, we could not hear one word that passed between them. Another time he would embrace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of joy did this confirm in my young priest, that he could scarcely contain himself: And a little after this, we observed by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying them on her breast, that she was mightily affected with his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight.|$|E
