6000|$|We {{have said}} that General McClellan's volume is rather a plea in {{abatement}} of judgment than a report. It was perfectly proper that he should endeavor to put everything in its true light, {{and he would be}} sure of the sympathy of all right-minded men in so doing; but an ex parte statement at once rouses and justifies adverse criticism. He has omitted many documents essential to the formation of a just opinion; and it is only when we have read these also, in the Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, that we feel the full weight of the cumulative evidence going to show the hearty support in men and confidence that he received from the Administration, and, when there were no more men to be sent, and confidence began to yield before irresistible facts, the prolonged forbearance with which he was still favored. Nothing can be kinder or more cordial than the despatches and letters both of the President and Mr. Stanton, down to the time when General McClellan wrote the following sentences {{at the end of an}} official communication addressed to the latter: [...] "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you, or to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army." [...] (28th June, 1862.) We shall seek no epithet to characterize language like this. All but the most bigoted partisans will qualify it as it deserves. We have here a glaring example of that warping of good sense and good feeling which the consciousness of having a political stake at risk will produce in a gallant soldier and a courteous gentleman. Can General McClellan, after a year to grow cool in, either himself believe, or expect any one else to <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Secretary of War would [...] "do their best to sacrifice" [...] an army of a hundred and fifty thousand brave men, in order to lessen his possible chances as a candidate for the Presidency? It was of vastly more importance to them than to him that he should succeed. The dignified good temper of Mr. Lincoln's answer to this wanton insult does him honor: [...] "I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements; I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I could. I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself." [...] Mr. Stanton could only be silent; and whatever criticisms may be made on some traits of his character, he is quite safe in leaving the rebuke of such an imputation to whoever feels that earnestness, devotion, and unflagging purpose are high qualities in a public officer.|$|E

40|$|When an Article III court decides a case, and the President {{disagrees with}} the outcome, what can he do about it? Existing {{scholarship}} generally takes two views.

Others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has an unqualified duty to obey court judgments no matter what. This Article challenges both of those views. Drawing on conventional constitutional history {{as well as the}} private law of judgments, this Article defends a new view of the Judiciary’s “Judgment Power. ” Judgments are binding on the President, who must enforce them even if he {{disagrees with the}}m. However, the President is entitled to ignore a judgment if the issuing court lacked jurisdiction over the case in question.

40|$|The {{range and}} {{quantity}} of government activity has grown exponentially {{over the course of}} this century. In response, an "institutional Presidency" has developed. Today’s President is at the locus of a network of relationships designed to increase his capacity to influence the flow of events. This paper examines a small sample of those relationships: His relationship with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), a division of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that reviews regulations. OIRA was one of the key instruments used by the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations to limit regulation. The operational question of this paper is: What happened to the OIRA-White House relationship when there was a change in party and policy preferences in the White House in 1993 ? That is, how does a relatively pro-regulatory White House use OIRA? To answer this question, this paper examines panel data on the policy preferences and social interaction patterns of OIRA members, time series data on the disposition of reviewed regulations, and structured interviews with members of OIRA. Analysis of these data indicates that the review process institutionalizes conflict between the OMB and agencies, resulting in appeals to the President when actors <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> will support their views. Thus, the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton Administrations economized on their limited ability to monitor the Executive Branch by focusing their attention and political support on members of OIRA with compatible viewpoints...|$|E

Evidence of this semi-presidential attitude was the minority government of Toivo M. Kivimäki, which survived for 3 years and 10 months (December 1932-October 1936). Svinhufvud strongly supported it, because he <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> it could effectively fight the Great Depression (which it did, generally speaking), he <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Kivimäki had a strong personality like himself, and possibly because he hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Agrarians and Swedish People's Party would let the Kivimäki government remain in office as a lesser evil, the greater evil being an Agrarian-Social Democratic government.|$|R
