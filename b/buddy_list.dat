From 2004 to 2006, Ask the Audience was sponsored by AOL, which allowed users of its Instant Messenger to add the screen name MillionaireIM to their <b>buddy</b> <b>list</b> and receive an instant message with the question and the four possible answers, to which the users replied with their choices. In addition, the Ask the Expert lifeline was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds.|$|E

Other Players can also be invited to games using the <b>buddy</b> <b>list.</b> Custom games do not have much XP to gain as opposed to Ranked matches.|$|E
50|$|Originally the <b>buddy</b> <b>list</b> was {{designed}} as a separate system, not necessarily related to chat rooms. Users signed into the <b>buddy</b> <b>list</b> using an email address and password. The clients are now used at vpchat.com The system creates the <b>buddy</b> <b>list</b> name automatically by appending “@buddy” to the user’s chat name and they share the same password.

50|$|The data {{management}} {{aspects of the}} chat service are handled with an SQL database. Individual chatters have a chat name and password. There is optional profile information which is saved on the server. Avatars and <b>buddy</b> <b>lists</b> are saved on the client side, and uploaded to a cache on the server when a chatter sign in. This works for scaling up {{the size of the}} system, but is a drawback when a chatter uses different computers as his avatars and <b>buddy</b> <b>lists</b> are not readily available.|$|R

50|$|AIM is {{different}} from other clients, such as Yahoo! Messenger, in {{that it does not}} require approval from one buddy to be added to another's <b>buddy</b> <b>list.</b> As a result, it is possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their <b>buddy</b> <b>list</b> to see when they are online, read their status and away messages, and read their profiles. In fact, there is a Web API to display one's status and away message as a widget on one's Web page. However, one can block another user from communicating and seeing one's status, but this does not prevent the user from creating a new account that is not blocked and therefore can still track the first user's status. A more complete privacy option is to select a menu option allowing communication only with those on one's buddy list; this causes blocking (thus appearing offline to) all users who are not on one's <b>buddy</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

As explained on the AIM Fight Web page, the score cannot increase by adding people to that user's <b>buddy</b> <b>list,</b> but rather having other people add the user to their <b>buddy</b> <b>list.</b> Depending on how well-connected these people are, the increase in the score can vary.|$|E
