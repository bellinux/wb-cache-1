5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego. Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal to revoke the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR54 since the existing roads including Jamacha Boulevard would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the projected traffic load; this would allow the unused land to be sold.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases and would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property {{and the lack of}} public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the I-94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul {{did not include the}} right-side ramps that eliminate weaving. The ramp from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid weaving across I-94 east. This project was done because the old Spaghetti Junction at the east split of I-35E and I-94 would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the extra load from the completed I-35E parkway.|$|E

5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
5|$|Peggy starts dating {{businessman}} George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), {{unaware that}} he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) when she discovers he is HIV positive and begins a feud with his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a lumpectomy. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a mastectomy, but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently row over the running of the pub. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), so she shames them by reading Frank's Dear Jane letter to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes depressed and begins to rely heavily on tranquillisers. When Frank's daughter, Janine (Charlie Brooks), taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a baseball bat. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.|$|E
