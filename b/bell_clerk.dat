50|$|The BBC {{television}} series Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes, was a fictionalised account of Doyle's time as <b>Bell's</b> <b>clerk.</b> The series may have exaggerated Bell's criminal investigations, {{as well as}} the degree to which Holmes was based on Bell (played by Ian Richardson), and positioned Doyle in the role of a Dr. Watson to Bell's Holmes. The original one-off production - which led to the later series - was released on DVD and VHS in the US in 2003, titled Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes.|$|R

60|$|He wandered {{about the}} wharf {{until it became}} dark. Then he went in and took supper with the clerk. As the latter spoke Dutch only, there was no {{possibility}} of conversation. Cyril was thinking of going up to his bed {{when there was a}} ring at the <b>bell.</b> The <b>clerk</b> went to answer it, leaving the door open as he went out, and Cyril heard a voice ask, in English, if Herr Schweindorf was in. The clerk said something in Dutch.|$|R
60|$|Even {{the humble}} beings {{who work in}} hotels are {{responsive}} to unusual disturbances in the ether. At the Barnstable, a gala note prevailed: <b>bell</b> boys, porters, <b>clerk,</b> and cashier, proud of their sudden wisdom, were wreathed in smiles. A new automobile, in Chiltern's colours, with his crest on the panel, was panting beside the curb.|$|R
2500|$|A {{series of}} investigative {{articles}} {{published by the}} Times in July 2010 revealed that several city officials in Bell were being paid salaries significantly higher than those in other cities. In a press release issued through the <b>Bell</b> City <b>Clerk's</b> office, Mayor Oscar Hernandez claimed that [...] "salaries of the City Manager and other top city staff have been in line with similar positions over the period of their tenure," [...] and then accused the Times of having a [...] "skewed view of the facts." [...] Hernandez later apologized {{for what he called}} the city's [...] "indefensible administrative salaries". He was later recalled, arrested, and indicted for fraud and other charges.|$|R
5000|$|Hugh MacDiarmid {{once wrote}} a poem which {{contained}} the line: [...] "Scotland small? Our multiform, our infinite Scotland small ?" [...] Over the past dozen years, Robert Crawford has devoted much industry to soothing MacDiarmid's incredulity. Crawford specialises in poems about Scottish places and people, eulogising not only literary figures but scientists and engineers, such as Henry <b>Bell,</b> James <b>Clerk</b> Maxwell and John Logie Baird, men associated with railways, steam and primitive {{models of the}} television. The native genius blends with native chippiness in lines such as: [...] "When World War II ended / Baird equipment broadcast victory in the Savoy / But not one diner said cheerio when you faded".|$|R

50|$|The {{funds to}} pay for the new bells and their hanging at the church was raised by Alderman Dr Andrew Parmley, Parish <b>Clerk.</b> <b>Bells</b> were {{sponsored}} by the Vintners’ Company, the Dyers’ Company, the Glass-Sellers’ Company, Charles Bettinson, Joanna Warrand, Tony Stockwell and Tony Kassimiotis, Andrew and Wendy Parmley. Each of the sponsors chose an inscription including a dedication on each bell. Each also displays the Royal Arms (by permission of Buckingham Palace) and the name of {{a senior member of the}} Royal Family.|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Starbottle {{leaned over}} Mr. Dumphy's desk and coolly rung his <b>bell.</b> Mr. Dumphy's <b>clerk</b> {{instantly}} {{appeared at the}} door. [...] "I wish--" [...] said the Colonel, addressing himself to the astounded employé as he stood loftily over Mr. Dumphy's chair--"I have--er--in fact sent for you, to withdraw the offensive epithets I addressed to you, and the threats--of er--of er--personal violence! The offence--is not, yours--but--er--rests with your employer, for whose apology I am--er--now waiting. Nevertheless I am ready, sir, to hold myself at your service--that is--er--of course--after my responsibility--er--with your master--er--ceases!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{primary group}} {{organized}} {{against the city}} is the Bell Association to Stop the Abuse (BASTA); Basta means [...] "enough" [...] in Spanish. BASTA consists of community members who are motivating the community to become educated and to learn where and how their tax dollars are spent. BASTA organized a march on July 25, 2010. [...] Some of the marchers wore T-shirts with the words [...] "My city is more corrupt than your city". BASTA is {{supported in part by}} the Bell Police Officers Association. The Police Officers Association has opposed the contracting of services of the Police Department or consolidation of police services into a joint powers authority and has criticized the posting of salaries on the <b>Bell</b> City <b>Clerk's</b> website, calling them [...] "deceptive" [...] due to the inclusion of overtime. BASTA collected enough signatures to force the recall election in March for the four City Council members facing corruption charges. Organizers with BASTA began the recall process in August after unsuccessfully calling for the resignation of Mayor Oscar Hernandez and council members Luis Artiga, Teresa Jacobo and George Mirabal. Artiga has since resigned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tradition}} was begun in 1934 by Hugh Thomson Kerr who ministered in the Shadyside Presbyterian Church. [...] "Davitt S. <b>Bell</b> (the late <b>Clerk</b> of Session and church historian at Shadyside) recalled that Dr. Kerr first conceived {{the notion of}} World Communion Sunday during his year as moderator of the General Assembly (1930). Dr. Kerr’s younger son, the Rev. Dr. Donald Craig Kerr, who is pastor emeritus of the Roland Park Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, was sixteen in 1933. He has related that World Communion Sunday {{grew out of the}} Division of Stewardship at Shadyside. It was their attempt to bring churches together in a service of Christian unity—in which everyone might receive both inspiration and information, and above all, to know how important the Church of Jesus Christ is, and how each congregation is interconnected one with another." [...] It was then was adopted throughout the US Presbyterian Church in 1936, and subsequently spread to other denominations. In 1940, the Federal Council of Churches (now the National Council of Churches), led by Jesse Moren Bader, endorsed World Communion Sunday and began to promote it to Christian churches worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{increasing}} number of foreign visitors in the U. S. incites the hotel industry to be more competitive, hotels need to expand services to meet the foreign guest 2 ̆ 7 s needs and wants in order to stay in the business. Most often foreign guest complaints occur when the hotel services can not satisfy the guests. Misunderstandings and communication barriers occur when the hotel staff is not familiar with foreign guest 2 ̆ 7 s culture and does not speak the guest 2 ̆ 7 s language. This research was done to help hotel management explore the various cultural characteristics, identify the most frequent complaints of foreign guests, and discern the interpersonal and communication skills needed when interacting with culturally different guests. In addition to the library research, most data on guest complaints was collected by telephone and personal interviews of hotel employees and travel agencies such as front desk <b>clerks,</b> <b>bell</b> personnel, waiters /waitresses, and travel tour guides. The frequent complaints of foreign guests were listed to identify the various needs of several different ethnic groups. An analysis of the cultural characteristics of Japanese, Chinese, French, and German visitors was done and specific examples of cultural differentiae were noted...|$|R
