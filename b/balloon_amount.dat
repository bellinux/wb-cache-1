40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Conventional {{techniques}} for hemostasis during thyroidectomy rely on knot tying, clips, and electrocoagulation. Recently, the Harmonic FOCUS Shear (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc, Cincinnati, OH) {{was developed for}} thyroidectomy. METHODS: Between December 2007 and March 2008, 62 consecutive patients (45 women, 17 men; mean age 50. 9 years) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomized into 2 groups: group A, where the FOCUS was used, and group B, where electrocoagulation and clamp-and-tie technique were used. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in terms of age, sex ratio, indication for surgery, and thyroid volume. Operative time was significantly shorter in group A. Significantly fewer clips and ties were used, and postoperative pain and suction <b>balloon</b> <b>amount</b> were also significantly lower in the FOCUS group. The only postoperative complication was a patient with transient hypocalcemia in group B. CONCLUSIONS: FOCUS is a reliable and safe tool for thyroidectomy. Its utilization {{is associated with a}} shorter operative time, less blood loss, and less postoperative pain. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Placement {{and removal}} of the intragastric balloon for obesity are {{performed}} endoscopically often under general anesthesia. We propose a safer and faster technique for endoscopic {{removal of the}} intragastric balloon using standard sedation. METHODS: In 87 obese patients, we performed 3 removal techniques: 1) standard gastroscope and foreign body forceps, 2) standard gastroscope and retrieval snare, 3) double-channel gastroscope and foreign body forceps plus symmetrical "shark model" polypectomy snare. Balloon retrieval time, number of times the grasping devices lost the <b>balloon,</b> <b>amount</b> of antispasmodic drug, symptoms cumulative score and VAS score for discomfort were evaluated. RESULTS: The technique by double-channel gastroscope and foreign body forceps plus symmetrical polypectomy shark retrieval snare showed a significantly lower balloon retrieval time, number of lost balloons, total number of ampoules used, symptoms cumulative score and VAS score {{compared to the other}} two techniques (Dunn's P< 0. 05). Number of lost balloons was positively associated with number of antispasmodic ampoules used, balloon retrieval time and VAS score. CONCLUSIONS: Technique by double-channel gastroscope and foreign body forceps plus symmetrical polypectomy shark retrieval snare, allows balloon removal safely, quickly and easily, avoiding loss of the balloon, with good patient endurance...|$|E

30|$|During each PEEP level, we {{inflated}} the esophageal <b>balloon</b> {{with increasing}} <b>amount</b> of air (from 0.2 to 2 ml). For each injected volume, we performed an end-inspiratory occlusion maneuver {{followed by an}} occlusion test by applying manual chest compression during an end-expiratory airway occlusion maneuver. We measured the ratio between airway pressure variation and esophageal pressure variation (ΔPaw/ΔPes ratio) during the occlusion test, end-expiratory esophageal pressure (Pes,e), end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Pl,e), chest wall compliance (CplCW), lung compliance (CplL), elastance-derived transpulmonary plateau pressure (ΔPl,i). The optimal calibration volume (defined as the injected volume at which ΔPaw/ΔPes ratio was closer to 1) was identified for each PEEP group (VCLPEEP for lowPEEP, VCMPEEP for mediumPEEP, VCHPEEP for highPEEP). Effect of PEEP on derived parameters was assessed by comparing at PEEP medium and high values obtained at the VCLPEEP against values obtained with the optimal VC at each PEEP.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A low-aspect-ratio quasi-omnigeneous (QO) {{stellarator}} could {{combine the}} disruption immunity and low recycled power of currentless high-aspect-ratio stellarators with the low aspect ratio and good performance of high-current tokamaks. The QO approach approximately aligns bounce-averaged drift orbits with magnetic surfaces, which reduces energetic particle losses and neoclassical energy transport, and aims at a bootstrap current ~ 1 / 10 {{that in a}} comparable tokamak, which should lead to configurations that are relatively insensitive to b and robust against current-driven modes. QO-optimized configurations with field periods Nfp = 3 and 4 and plasma aspect ratio Ap = R 0 /ap from 3 to 4. 8 were optimized with respect to trapped particle confinement, <b>ballooning</b> b limits, <b>amount</b> of self-consistent bootstrap current, magnetic field ripple, outer surface curvature, and i (r). Development of improved QO configurations is due to incorporation of fast calculations of the self-consistent bootstrap current and the ballooning stability limit within the iterative optimization procedure. The reference Nfp = 3, Ap » 3. 6 QOS plasma configuration features a large helical axis excursion, high rotational transform, a mirror component of the magnetic field that varies strongly with radius, and low bootstrap current, which leads to good neoclassical confinement and a ballooning stability b limit of 3 - 4 %...|$|R
50|$|Currently {{there are}} three FDA {{approved}} balloons in the USA. These approved devices are placed via the esophagus using endoscopy. This {{can be done in}} an outpatient setting under sedation. Once in place the balloon is filled with saline and remains as a free floating object in the stomach cavity, too big to pass through the pylorus. In addition to saline, the balloon that is made from silicone may contain some radio-opaque material as a radiographic marker and a dye such as methylene blue to alert the patient when the balloon would leak. Studies have suggested that fluid is superior to air for distending gastric balloons. Inflated balloons reduce the operative volume capacity of the stomach. While the typical gastric volume is about 900 ml, an inflated balloon may take up most of the space, about 700 (+/-100) ml. Thus the <b>balloon</b> limits the <b>amount</b> of food the stomach can hold and creates thereby an early feeling of fullness and satiety. Less intake of food will result in weight loss. After a maximum of up to six months, the device is removed using endoscopy again. Longer stay of a balloon is not advised because of the danger of damage to the tissue wall and degradation of the balloon. The use of the balloon is complemented with counseling and nutritional support or advice.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. Our {{goal was}} to provide the range of cost savings {{associated}} with various catheter reuse strategies. Background. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty catheters are commonly reused in several countries outside the United States. However, the cost-effectiveness of such reuse strategies has not been evaluated. Methods. Three theoretical models of catheter reuse were constructed using the actual costs for treating patients with coronary angioplasty at the Cleveland Clinic. Costs were calculated {{based on the number}} of <b>balloon</b> catheters, the <b>amount</b> of contrast agent used and the rates for urgent revascularization that were observed in a prospective Canadian study on catheter reuse. Results. The median cost to treat a lesion by means of coronary angioplasty using new catheters was $ 8, 800 per patient. In reuse models, the potential to reduce cost depended on the number of balloon catheters used and the rates of urgent revascularization. The “best case” scenario offered a potential savings of $ 480 (5. 5 % of total in-hospital cost), whereas the “worst case” scenario resulted in an increased cost of $ 1, 075 (12. 2 % of total in-hospital cost) compared with the single-use strategy. Cost of the “likely case” scenario was similar to that of the single-use strategy. Sensitivity analyses identified the different rates of revascularization and cost of balloon catheters required to offset potential savings in each strategy. Conclusions. Although reusing coronary angioplasty catheters may reduce total in-hospital costs, even a modest increase in complications requiring urgent revascularization may offset any potential savings. However, if an increase in complications and procedure time can be avoided, the reuse strategy has significant economic potential and, ultimately, may be extended to other percutaneous coronary interventional equipment...|$|R
40|$|The recent Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) {{proposal}} {{incorporates a}} montgolfiere (hot air balloon) {{as part of}} its architecture. Standard montgolfiere balloons generate lift through heating of the atmospheric gases inside the envelope, and use a vent valve for altitude control. A Titan aerobot (robotic aerial vehicle) would have to use radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for electric power, and the excess heat generated can be used to provide thermal lift for a montgolfiere. A hybrid montgolfiere design could have propellers mounted on the gondola to generate horizontal thrust; in spite of the unfavorable aerodynamic drag caused by the shape of the <b>balloon,</b> a limited <b>amount</b> of lateral controllability could be achieved. In planning an aerial mission at Titan, it is extremely important to assess how the moon-wide wind field can be used to extend the navigation capabilities of an aerobot and thereby enhance the scientific return of the mission. In this paper we explore what guidance, navigation and control capabilities can be achieved by a vehicle that uses the Titan wind field. The control planning approach is based on passive wind field riding. The aerobot would use vertical control to select wind layers that would lead it towards a predefined science target, adding horizontal propulsion if available. The work presented in this paper is based on aerodynamic models that characterize balloon performance at Titan, and on TitanWRF (Weather Research and Forecasting), a model that incorporates heat convection, circulation, radiation, Titan haze properties, Saturn's tidal forcing, and other planetary phenomena. Our results show that a simple unpropelled montgolfiere without horizontal actuation will be able to reach a broad array of science targets within the constraints of the wind field. The study also indicates that even a small amount of horizontal thrust allows the balloon to reach any area of interest on Titan, and to do so in a fraction of the time needed by the unpropelled balloon. The results show that using the Titan wind field allows an aerobot to significantly extend its scientific reach, and that a montgolfiere (unpropelled or propelled) is a highly desirable architecture that can very significantly enhance the scientific return of a future Titan mission...|$|R
