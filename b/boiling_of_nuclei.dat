Variables were egg yolk protein, phenol total and flavonoids, and to find out the best treatment <b>of</b> addition <b>of</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid on the salty egg. The method used an experiment with a complete randomized design, 5 treatments and 4 replication. The treatment were P 0 (control), P 1 (5 % addition <b>of</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid), P 2 (10 % addition <b>of</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid), P 3 (15 % addition <b>of</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid), P 4 (20 % addition <b>of</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid). The research results showed that <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid gave a significant different result in increasing the content of total phenols and flavonoid as for the egg yolk protein give effect not different real. 20 % addition <b>of</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid was the best treatment reviewed from egg yolk protein 17. 88 ± 1. 70 phenol total 0. 064 ± 0. 003 and flavonoids 92. 62 ± 1. 92 suggestion from this research was salted egg added <b>boiled</b> <b>of</b> bay leaf liquid with higher concentration to know the physical quality of salted eggs...|$|R
