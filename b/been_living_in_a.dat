5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who have <b>been</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is {{at the level of}} xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E

25|$|Duncan MacLeod and Tessa Noel have <b>been</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{city in the}} Pacific North West {{for several}} years, where they run an {{antiques}} store. One night, a young street punk called Richie Ryan breaks into the shop whilst they are celebrating Tessa's birthday but is caught by MacLeod, who threatens to cut off {{his head with a}} sword. Stunned by MacLeod's seeming over-reaction, Richie watches as another man jumps in through the skylight and challenges the antiques dealer, only to be disconcerted by the appearance of a third man with a Japanese sword, who is in turn hunting him. The intruder is Slan Quince, who is hunting Duncan, unaware that he is himself the target of Duncan's kinsman, Connor MacLeod. Intrigued, the kid follows the MacLeods, only to see first Connor, then Duncan, fight Slan. He sees Connor defeated but escape, leaving Duncan to behead Quince. Amazed, he watches Duncan caught at the centre of lightning and explosions as he witnesses, for the first time, a Quickening. Before he leaves, Connor tells Duncan that he must watch Richie, which Duncan does by taking in the boy, who has no family, and employing him in the antiques store. MacLeod also tells Richie the truth about himself and the others - that he is 400 years old and he, like them, is Immortal. As the series progressed, MacLeod encountered Immortals like Howard Crowley whom he killed in revenge for killing an Immortal friend of his and framing an innocent man for it, Kiem Sun and taking in an Immortal student Felice Martens. He even saves Tessa from Immortals like survivalist Caleb Cole (for the only time in the series, Tessa sees Duncan caught in the power of a Quickening) and Andrew Ballin, who wanted to kill her after she witnessed him killing his former lover. Alexei Voshin, with whom he has an old score to settle, and Walter Reinhardt, another immortal he had crossed paths with before.|$|E
500|$|In the VH1 special Madonna Speaks, {{the artist}} further {{clarified}} that the theme behind [...] "Hollywood", {{as well as}} [...] "American Life" [...] And [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from the album, was about her [...] "wanting to shout from the rooftops that we have all <b>been</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream.

Furthermore, according to a 2003 Rolling Stone report, he had never secured a divorce; but Marley later disputed this and made public to a blog a 1996 divorce document from Haiti.

500|$|The most {{outstanding}} ideological {{authority of the}} movement in Stuttgart, {{during the time of}} Rau's political involvement there, was however Clara Zetkin.

She had <b>been</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Stuttgart suburb since 1891 and, since then, been gathering a circle of Württemberg Marxists around her, among them Rau's friend Hoernle, who had been editing with her the magazine Die Gleichheit. Her house, built in 1903 in Sillenbuch (now a part of Stuttgart), had become a meeting place of leading national and local left-wing and communist activists. It was also visited by international communist leaders like Vladimir Lenin, who stayed there overnight in 1907. In 1920, when Zetkin was elected to the Reichstag in Berlin, Hoernle and Rau moved to Berlin as well.|$|E
500|$|Beth Hardie for the Daily Mirror {{wrote that}} the remix came as a shock, because of how Brown [...] "beat her {{virtually}} senseless in a car three years ago just before the Grammys," [...] and noted that Rihanna would face harsh criticism from journalists and fans alike for not setting a good example to younger girls. Hardie continued to state that although the collaboration came as a surprise, [...] "We have to admit, it’s a pretty amazing stroke of genius in terms of publicity and messing with people’s minds." [...] Regarding the collaboration on the remix Jo Usmar from Daily Mirror compared the collaboration to the physical altercation between Rihanna and Brown at the 2009 Grammy Awards, writing [...] "In case you've <b>been</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cave {{for the last two}} years this is extraordinarily controversial as Brown was convicted of assaulting Rihanna in 2009 and there was a restraining order issued against him."

2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} the Israelites' encounter with Sihon in [...] and [...] Noting {{the report of}} [...] that [...] "Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: ‘Let me pass through your land,'" [...] the Midrash taught that the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon {{just as they had}} to Edom to inform the Edomites that the Israelites would not cause Edom any damage. Noting the report of [...] that the Israelites offered Sihon, [...] "You shall sell me food for money [...] [...] [...] and give me water for money," [...] the Midrash noted that water is generally given away for free, but the Israelites offered to pay for it. The Midrash noted that in [...] the Israelites offered, [...] "We will go by the king's highway," [...] but in [...] the Israelites admitted that they would go [...] "until [...] shall pass over the Jordan," [...] thus admitting {{that they were going to}} conquer Canaan. The Midrash compared the matter to a watchman who received wages to watch a vineyard, and to whom a visitor came and asked the watchman to go away so that the visitor could cut off the grapes from the vineyard. The watchman replied that the sole reason that the watchman stood guard was because of the visitor. The Midrash explained that the same was true of Sihon, as all the kings of Canaan paid Sihon money from their taxes, since Sihon appointed them as kings. The Midrash interpreted [...] which says, [...] "Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan," [...] to teach that Sihon and Og were the equal of all the other kings of Canaan. So the Israelites asked Sihon to let them pass through Sihon's land to conquer the kings of Canaan, and Sihon replied that the sole reason that he was there was to protect the kings of Canaan from the Israelites. Interpreting the words of [...] "and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together," [...] the Midrash taught that God brought this about designedly so as to deliver Sihon into the Israelites' hands without trouble. The Midrash {{interpreted the}} words of [...] "Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon," [...] to say that if Heshbon had been full of mosquitoes, no person could have conquered it, and if Sihon had <b>been</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plain, no person could have prevailed over him. The Midrash taught that Sihon thus would have been invincible, as he was powerful and dwelt in a fortified city. Interpreting the words, [...] "Who dwelt at Heshbon," [...] the Midrash taught that had Sihon and his armies remained in different towns, the Israelites would have worn themselves out conquering them all. But God assembled them in one place to deliver them into the Israelites' hands without trouble. In the same vein, in [...] God said, [...] "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon [...] [...] [...] before you," [...] and [...] says, [...] "Sihon gathered all his people together," [...] and [...] reports, [...] "And Israel took all these cities." ...|$|E
