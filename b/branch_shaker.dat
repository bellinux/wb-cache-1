40|$|Jatropha curcas {{has been}} {{considered}} as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Today, Jatropha curcas planthas been widely planted for its fruits {{in order to produce}} biodiesel. Jatropha curcas is a species of Euphorbiaceae. The plantis a perennial shrub, which can grow approximately five to eight meters in height and it can be grown anywhere and eitherfrom seed or cutting. It seems that jatropha has a great potential to replace the fuel derived from petroleum as well as oil palm. Unfortunately, the cost of jatropha production for biodiesel is still high, especially the labor costs for harvesting. Presently,jatropha fruits are mainly harvested by hand. However, this current harvesting method is costly, as the cost of labor constitutesabout 80 % of the total production costs. The harvesting of the jatropha fruits is a difficult process due to the ripeningcharacteristics of the jatropha fruits. Earlier harvesting machinery has been modified for use in jatropha, but was foundunsuitable. This study involves designing and developing a <b>branch</b> <b>shaker</b> harvester. The research project aimed at alleviatingproblem of high production cost during harvesting by finding the vibration frequency and force needed to dislodgeonly the ripe jatropha fruits...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Olive (Oleo europaea) {{includes}} about 20 {{species of}} small trees from Oleaceae family. This point {{should be considered}} that Iran has allocated only a small universal market to its olive products in spite of having high production potentials; so that about 23 provinces of this country can produce olive products. Therefore mechanizing of olive production and encouraging to develop olive trade are among the effective methods for development of this market. On the basis of IOOC report, the production of olive oil in 2008 - 2009 in Iran {{and all over the}} world has been 3 and 2866. 5 thousand tons, respectively. Currently, harvesting olive product is done by hand in Iran. The expensiveness of work force and providing the needed workers are considered as the biggest problem in olive harvesting. While harvesting the tall trees, the workers use beating method by wood sticks which causes the fruits to be damaged and their quality to be decreased. The harvesting method which {{the quality and quantity of}} the olive final products is under its effect and also high expenses of harvesting by hand are considered as the two important factors in developing the mechanical harvesting of olive. For this purpose, the mechanized harvesting of olive should be considered for producing olive conserve and olive oil and decreasing expenses of harvesting. Considering the conducted studies on one hand and shortage of informational resources in the country on the other hand, a research was designed and performed with the following purposes: Designing and fabricating of a portable pneumatic branch shaking system. Determining the best frequency and oscillation duration for harvesting olive by the constructed system. Materials and Methods The branch shaking system is made of two general parts: (a) The set of <b>branch</b> <b>shaker</b> driving unit. (b) The portable vibration arm. For constructing the set of vibrating arm, two experiments “elasticity and inflectionˮ of tree branches were conducted and the maximum force of 362. 40 N was registered and it was considered as the base of computations. Then a double-action pneumatic jack with the internal diameter of 32 mm and the rod diameter of 12 mm with the stroke length of 200 mm was selected. An electronic circuit was designed and developed for ordering the solenoid valve to control the flow. The system was transferred to one of the olive garden’s located in kilometer 5 of Sarvestan – Fasa road in Fars province in order to be evaluated. The effects of three oscillation frequencies of 12, 16 and 20 Hz and three oscillation durations of 5, 10 and 15 seconds at constant amplitude of 5 cm on detachment percentage of olive fruit was investigated through a factorial 3 × 3 experiment based on completely randomized design with four replications. Then the most suitable frequency and vibration duration was selected for harvesting olive by this system. For measuring the static detachment force of the fruits, a tensile force dynamometer system model FG- 5100 made by Lutron Company was used with the accuracy of 0. 1 N and a maximum capacity of 980 N. Results and Discussion The variance analysis of the investigated features on the basis of the factorial experiment based on completely randomized designs was conducted through using SPSS software. The results showed that both frequency of vibration and oscillation duration had significant effect on the shaker performance; with no significant interaction effects which implies the independence of the debated variables. Comparing the means by using Duncan test at 1...|$|E
