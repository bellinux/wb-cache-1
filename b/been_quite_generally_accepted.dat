40|$|In the {{differential}} diagnosis of Endamoeba histolytica and Enda-moeba coli infections, the morphology of the trophozoites, {{the features of the}} cysts, especially with reference to the number of nuclei present when fully developed, and the propensity of the trophozoites to ingest red blood corpuscles, <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> as essential criteria. In fact, the occurrence of trophozoites showing ingested red cells is doubtless often accepted without further study, as evidence of the presence of E. histolytica. In the absence of a qualified protozoologist, or when facilities for adequate investigation are lacking, such ready means of diagnosing amoebic dysentery from fresh preparations of the stool would be of great value if reliable. It would appear, from state-ments occurring in both text books and special articles, that E. his-tolytica is the only parasitic amoeba found in the human intestine which engulfs red blood corpuscles. Recently, however, Dobell (1936), having demonstrated the ingestion of red cells in vitro by a certain strain of E. coli which he was able to propagate in culture, has questioned the reliability of this phenomenon as a distinctive diag-nostic feature. Kellogg and Scott (1937) state that it is not always a safe criterion for identifying E. histolytica but offer no supporting observations or data. Previously, O'Connor (1919) stated that red cells were never ingested by E. coli when blood was present in stools of troops surveyed in Egypt for protozoa, but he did observe and figure red cells adhering to the surface of trophozoites of this species. Wenyon (1926) also saw "red blood-corpuscles adhering to the surface of motile Endamoeba coli, which, however, showed no tendency to engulf them.

40|$|In his Prefatio to Novella 6 (535), Justinian {{celebrated the}} {{achievement}} {{of what had been}} a development for more than two centuries: a Christian ideological system rooted in the Roman and Hellenistic past, binding the priesthood and the secular ruler {{for the benefit of the}} oikoumene/ecclesia. The strength of the empire was seen as necessarily supported by the unity of one exclusive faith, which required a perfect symphony between the secular arm and the Church hierarchy, between imperium and sacerdotium. The otherness of faith had become increasingly equal to enmity to the empire. Fundamentally, it was not simply a human affair, since the empire was ecclesia, subject to the awaited salvation from God. Heresy was danger both to the visible empire and to the kingdom in heaven, as it was diligently and beautifully said: "The unity of state and Church, the future salvation of the oikoumene, depends upon their partnership in orthodoxy. " [Haldon, Byzantium in the Seventh Century (London, 1997), 297]. Against this background, the paper tries to address a problem that has received little attention from scholars, regarding the position of Constantinople towards the Arianism of the 'barbarians' during Late Antiquity. What significance should we give to this matter when discussing the imperial foreign policy toward the West during the 5 th- 6 th century and beyond? Was this particular Arianism seen as a problem to the empire? If so, how was it answered? Was this otherness of belief employed as a diplomatic currency by the empire and by its 'partners'? Whilst the use of the otherness of belief as Mediterranean diplomatic currency <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> today for the case of Justinian's 'Reconquista', this is not the case for the pre-Justinianic period. Hence, the paper will try to survey chiefly this age from Theodosius' Cunctos Populos and the barbarization of the army to the fall of Rome to Justin I's open policy of intolerance toward the Arian heresy. The main question that is to be answered is whether there existed in the East during the 5 th- 6 th century a constant awareness of the heresy of the barbarian invaders, and to what degree this (un) acceptable otherness in terms of Christian belief triggered an imperial response. According to an image allowing this supposition (such as drawn, for instance, by historian Telemachos Lounghis), the emperors and other dignitaries might have kept in their mind all the time that the recovery of the lost roman territories from the heretical barbarians is a moral duty and a divine mission for an orthodox empire. After a time of ineffective reaction during the 5 th century, could Anastatius' open wars be considered a preparation for Justinians' 'Reconquista'?status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|However, various defects often {{exist in}} ZnO {{nanowires}} and these defects {{can affect the}} electrical and optical properties [10]. For example, ZnO nanowires with oxygen vacancies exhibit photocatalytic activity [11]. So far, there is still controversy of whether the oxygen vacancies or other native defects affect the properties of ZnO nanowires [12 – 14]. As for the photoluminescence (PL) property of ZnO nanowires, two PL peaks can be observed, one {{in the range of}} UV region, the other in the visible region (usually broad blue–green peaks). The UV emission originated from the excitonic recombination corresponding to the near-band-edge (NBE) emission [4], the visible luminescence, is generally referred to deep level (DL) emission; it <b>is</b> now <b>quite</b> <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> that the blue–green luminescence in ZnO arises from a radiative recombination involving an intrinsic defect, which is believed to be due to {{one or more of the}} following native defects: zinc vacancy (VZn), oxygen vacancy (VO), zinc interstitial (Zni), oxygen interstitial (Oi), or antisite oxygen (OZn) [11, 15 – 17]. However, there is no satisfactory consensus due to the complexity of the detailed microstructure of ZnO. Different hypotheses were proposed to explain the origin of DL emission; the commonly cited reason is that the recombination of a photogenerated hole with an electron occupying the oxygen vacancy [18]. It proved that high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with structure simulation is a powerful technique for investigating microstructure of nanowires, so do the defects in ZnO nanowires. However, to our best knowledge, previous studies did not associate HRTEM results with PL properties, which can provide favorable evidence of microstructure for origin of DL emission.|$|R

The aim is to give clarification to the correlation between the lemmas aA and wr and their interpretation. The study is not restricted to a specific time period, but regards linguistic developments as an important factor in the analysis. An important conclusion from this study is the clear, preferred use of wr as a qualifier for physical greatness, as opposed to aA which appears in contexts more related to metaphorical greatness. During Late Egyptian the opacity of the different uses of aA and wr increases and the differentiation becomes quite fuzzy...|$|R
40|$|The onset and {{development}} of both dynamically and convectively forced boundary layer rolls are studied with linear and nonlinear analyses of a truncated spectral model of shallow Boussinesq flow. Emphasis is given here on the energetics of the dominant roll modes, on the magnitudes of the roll-induced modifications of the initial basic state wind and temperature profiles, and on {{the sensitivity of the}} linear stability results to the use of modified profiles as basic states. It is demonstrated that the roll circulations can produce substantial changes to the cross-roll component of the initial wind profile and that significant changes in orientation angle estimates can result from use of a roll-modified profile in the stability analysis. These results demonstrate that roll contributions must be removed from observed background wind profiles before using them to investigate the mechanisms underlying actual secondary flows in the boundary layer. The model <b>is</b> developed <b>quite</b> <b>generally</b> to <b>accept</b> arbitrary basic state wind profiles as dynamic forcing. An Ekman profile is chosen here merely to provide a means for easy comparison with other theoretical boundary layer studies; the ultimate application of the model is to study observed boundary layer profiles. Results of the analytic stability analysis are validated by comparing them with results from a larger linear model. For an appropriate Ekman depth, a complete set of transition curves is given in forcing parameter space for roll modes driven both thermally and dynamically. Preferred orientation angles, horizontal wavelengths and propagation frequencies, as well as energetics and wind profile modifications, are all shown to agree rather well with results from studies on Ekman layers as well as with studies on near-neutral and convective atmospheric boundary layers...|$|R
