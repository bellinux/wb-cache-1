Thus, the <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> has been effectively halved. This leads to situations (described above) where a riposte is [...] "locked out".

The <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> after registering a hit was reduced from 0.75 seconds to 0.25 seconds, so a fast remise can 'time out' a slow riposte. The contact time required to score a hit was also increased to 15 milliseconds to make flick hits less likely to register. It has been observed that, after these changes, some straight hits are not registered by the apparatus. Thus, a pair of foil fencers may, upon finding their thrust have not landed, remain in lunge position and repeatedly remise hoping {{to be the first}} one to score a touch.|$|E

Twenty-six international competitions covering a 13 -year period (2000 - 2012) were analysed retrospectively. The data corresponded to a total of 1657 swimmers’ competition histories. A two-way ANOVA (sex x classification) was performed for each event and starting platform with the Bonferroni post-hoc test, and another two-way ANOVA for sex and starting platform (sex x starting platform). Pearson’s simple correlation coefficient was used to determine correlations between the <b>block</b> <b>time</b> and the final performance. Finally, a simple linear regression analysis was done between the final <b>time</b> and the <b>block</b> <b>time</b> for each sex and platform.

For 50 -m event, medalists had shorter <b>block</b> <b>times</b> than semi- finalists with the old starting platforms. <b>Block</b> <b>times</b> were directly related to performance with the old starting platforms. With the new starting platforms, however, the relationship was inverse, notably in the women’s 50 -m event.

50|$|As {{synchronous}} IPC {{blocks the}} first party until {{the other is}} ready, unrestricted use could easily lead to deadlocks. Furthermore, a client could easily mount a denial-of-service attack on a server by sending a request and never attempting to receive the reply. Therefore, synchronous IPC must provide a means to prevent indefinite blocking. Many microkernels provide timeouts on IPC calls, which limit the <b>blocking</b> <b>time.</b> In practice, choosing sensible timeout values is difficult, and systems almost inevitably use infinite timeouts for clients and zero timeouts for servers. As a consequence, the trend is towards not providing arbitrary timeouts, but only a flag which indicates that the IPC should fail immediately if the partner is not ready. This approach effectively provides a choice of the two timeout values of zero and infinity. Recent versions of L4 and MINIX have gone down this path (older versions of L4 used timeouts, as does QNX).|$|E

In this study, we aimed {{to compare the}} sensorial and motor block efficiency of isobaric bupivacaine, isobaric levobupivacaine and levobupivacaine added fentanyl. Material and Methods: 60 patients with ASA physical status I or III were randomly divided in three groups. Spinal anesthesia was achieved through L 4 - 5 interspace with 3 mL (15 mg) of bupivacaine 0. 5 % in Group BPV, with 3 ml (15 mg) of levobupivacaine 0. 5 % in Group LVB, with 0. 5 ml (25 µg) fentanyl added to 2. 5 ml (12. 5 mg) of levobupivacaine 0. 5 % in Group LVB+FNT. Sensorial <b>block</b> increment <b>time</b> of T 10, maximum level of sensorial block, total sensorial <b>block</b> <b>time,</b> maximum level of motor block and its formation <b>time,</b> total motor <b>block</b> <b>time,</b> pain degree with VAS, complications and side effects were recorded and tested. Results: Demographic data were similar between the groups (p> 0. 005). Maximum level of sensorial block was T 8 per three groups. Sensorial <b>block</b> increment <b>time</b> of T 10 was lower in Group BPV than Group LVB and Group LVB+FNT (p= 0. 004, p= 0. 017). Maximum level of motor block was higher and its formation time was lower in Group BPV than Group LVB and Group LVB+FNT (p= 0. 003, p= 0. 001). Total sensorial <b>block</b> <b>time</b> was similar in Group BPV and Group LVB+FNT and lower than Group LVB (p> 0. 005, p= 0. 001).

The formation time of sensorial and motor block were lower and level of motor block was higher with bupivacaine. Fentanyl addition to levobupivacaine increased sensorial <b>block</b> <b>time.</b> In TUR-P, motor block isn’t a requirement.

40|$|Contemporary {{railway traffic}} {{requires}} different train services {{share the same}} infrastructure. Capacity consumption together with the homogeneous level of train traffic gives {{a picture of the}} efficient use of infrastructure. Previous research suggests that the utilization is more efficient with a homogeneous operating program. During last decades, many researchers tried to describe and/or define the homogeneity of operating programs in rail service; however, no definition considered the infrastructure occupation. In addition, several methods were developed to evaluate the homogeneity in railway operation considering variations in speed, running time and headway. But, the occupancy of infrastructure has not been discussed in the existing methods. An extension of existing definitions is presented {{from the perspective of the}} infrastructure, which can be characterized by variations in <b>blocking</b> <b>time,</b> buffer time and running direction. The <b>blocking</b> <b>time,</b> buffer time and running direction describe the occupancy of train path on track sections based on the <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> model. Accordingly, the homogeneity of operating programs is evaluated through three parameters, namely the homogeneity of <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> (HBL), the homogeneity of buffer time (HBU) and the homogeneity of running direction (HRD). The overall homogeneity (OH) combined HBL; HBU and HRD to realize an integrity evaluation of homogeneity of operating programs. The results show that this new methodology can quantify the homogeneity of railway operations, not only for track sections but for an entire network, which contributes significantly to the efficient utilization of infrastructure. With the method developed in this thesis, the interrelationship between homogeneity of operating programs and operation quality were investigated quantitatively. Firstly, both the influence of each parameter of homogeneity and the overall homogeneity were analyzed. The operation quality (delay-coefficient) is evaluated for timetables with different train types, arrangements of buffer times and sequences of train runs. The results show that the operation quality deteriorates with less homogeneous timetables, in which the variation in buffer time has a more significant influence. Finally, the influence of homogeneity of operating programs is studied for different traffic flows. The low traffic flow is more sensitive to the homogeneity of buffer time and the homogeneity of <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> is more significant for high traffic flow...|$|E
