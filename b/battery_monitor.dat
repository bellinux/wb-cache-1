40|$|With {{the vastness}} of {{existing}} railroad infrastructure, there exist numerous road crossings which are lacking warning light systems and/or crossing gates due to their remoteness from existing electrical infrastructure. Along with lacking warning light systems, these areas also tend to lack distributed sensor networks used for railroad track health monitoring applications. With the power consumption required by these systems being minimal, extending electrical infrastructure into these areas {{would not be an}} economical use of resources. This motivated the development of an energy harvesting solution for remote railroad deployment. This thesis describes a computer simulation created to validate experimental on-track results for different mechanical prototypes designed for harvesting mechanical power from passing railcar traffic. Using the Winkler model for beam deflection as its basis, the simulation determines the maximum power potential for each type of prototype for various railcar loads and speeds. Along with calculating the maximum power potential of a single device, the simulation also calculates the optimal number and position of the devices needed to power a standard railroad crossing light signal. A control system was also designed to regulate power to a <b>battery,</b> <b>monitor</b> and record power production, and make adjustments to the duty cycle of the crossing lights accordingly. On-track test results are compared and contrasted with results from simulations, discrepancies between the two are examined and explained, and conclusions are drawn regarding suitability of arrays of such energy harvesting systems for powering high-efficiency LED lights at railroad crossings and powering track-health sensor networks.

40|$|Large Li-ion battery {{systems are}} being used in {{a growing number of}} applications. Due to lack of {{standards}} and various requirements, the battery systems have to be specifically designed for each application. This need for a specific design also affects the <b>battery</b> <b>monitoring</b> circuit. In order to reduce design effort, distributed <b>battery</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems integrated into the cells were proposed. Economies of scale allow these circuits to be produced at low cost per unit as they will be needed in every single battery cell. One of the major challenges of the distributed <b>battery</b> <b>monitoring</b> concept is the communication link for the monitoring circuits: it has to be robust, reliable, and easy to install. As a possible solution, a capacitively coupled data transmission link for a battery system consisting of up to 100 smart battery cells is investigated by simulation and experiment. Relevant influence factors of the physical implementation on a capacitive voltage divider determining the transmitted data signal are identified and evaluated, considering application specific constraints.

Hybrid PV-Genset system are developed to generate power {{as it can be}} fitted into its local geography and other condition according to specification. However, this does not guarantee that the hybrid system generates power optimally because weather conditions (solar insolation, temperature and others) changes periodically and influences the power generation and dispatch. Therefore, under these circumstances the hybrid system does not operate optimally and lead to over stress the system components resulting a higher maintenance cost due to frequent wear and tear. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is implemented into two non-linear optimisation areas such as the PV power tracker system and the power dispatch controller. The required bio-inspired algorithm searches the best potential optimal state for the maximum PV power generation as well as determining the suitable power dispatch arrangement of the small scale hybrid PV-Genset system.

For the purpose of this article, the term <b>battery</b> <b>monitoring</b> is defined as real time measurement of critical performance attributes of the battery.

For example, measuring the terminal voltage is a very simple and effective way to approximate the available energy in low (C rate) and constant drain battery applications, however, if the charge/discharge rate is dynamically changing, the voltage of the battery is also changing, and no longer correlates to available capacity.
