50|$|In a non-randomized, {{uncontrolled}} examination, 4 {{weeks of}} treatment with TP receptor antagonist AA-2414 significantly reduced <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> in asthmatic patients. A follow-up double-blind placebo contolled study of asthmatic patients found that TP receptor antagonist Seratrodast significantly reduced airway flow (i.e. FEV1), diurnal variation in FEV1, airway responsiveness to contractive stimulation, airway inflammation, and airway content of pro-allergic mediators (i.e. RANTES, CCL3, CCL7, and eotaxin).|$|E
5000|$|TP {{receptor}} activation contracts bronchial {{smooth muscle}} preparations obtained from animal models {{as well as}} humans and contracts airways in animal models. [...] In a mouse model of asthma (i.e. hypersensitivity to ovalabumin), a TP receptor antagonist decreased the number of eosinophils infiltrating lung as judged by their content in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in a mouse model of dust mite-induced astha, deletion of TBXA2R prevented the development of airways contraction and pulmonary eosinophilia responses to allergen. Another TP receptor agonists likewise reduced airway <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> to allergen as well as symptoms in volunteers with asthma. The TP receptor appears to play and essential role in the pro-asthmatic actions of leukotriene C4 (LTC4): in ovalbumin-sensitized mice, leukotriene C4 {{increased the number of}} eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and simultaneously decreased the percentages of eosinophils in blood but these responses did not occur in TBXA2R-deficient mice. LTC4 also stimulated lung expression of the pro-inflammatory intracellular adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by a TP receptor-dependent mechanism. These findings suggest that TP contributes to asthma in animal models at least in part by mediating the actions of LTC4. Further studies are required to determine if TP receptor antagonists might be useful for treating asthma and other airway constriction syndromes such as chronic obstructive lung diseases in humans.|$|E
40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} airway disease {{in which the}} {{pathological}} mechanisms are reversible airway obstruction, <b>bronchial</b> hyper <b>reactivity,</b> and constriction of the lower airways. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common arrhythmia which originates above the bundle of His and causing heart rates exceeding 150 beats/min. SVT patients present with palpitation, chest pain, chest discomfort, dyspnea, hyperventilation, and lightheadedness, occasionally.

50|$|Macrolide {{antibiotic}} {{treatment can}} improve asthma in a subgroup of patients {{that remains to}} be clearly defined. Macrolide benefits were first suggested in two observational trials and two randomized controlled trials of azithromycin treatment for asthma. One of these RCTs and another macrolide trial suggest that the treatment effect may be greatest in patients with severe, refractory asthma. These clinical results correlate with epidemiological evidence that C. pneumoniae is positively associated with asthma severity and laboratory evidence that C. pneumoniae infection creates steroid-resistance. A recent meta analysis of 12 RCTs of macrolides for the long term management of asthma found significant effects on asthma symptoms, quality of life, <b>bronchial</b> hyper <b>reactivity</b> and peak flow but not FEV1. Evidence from macrolide RCTs of patients with uncontrolled severe and refractory asthma will be critical in defining the role of macrolides in asthma.|$|R
40|$|Altered <b>bronchial</b> {{vascular}} <b>reactivity</b> and remodelling including angiogenesis {{are documented}} features of asthma and other chronic inflammatory airway diseases. Expansion of the bronchial vasculature {{under these conditions}} involves both functional (vasodilation, hyperperfusion, increased microvascular permeability, oedema formation, and inflammatory cell recruitment) and structural changes (tissue and vascular remodelling) in the airways. These changes in airway vascular reactivity and vascularisation have significant pathophysiological consequences, which are manifest in the clinical symptoms of airway disease. Airway vascular reactivity is regulated by {{a wide variety of}} neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators. Similarly, multiple growth factors are implicated in airway angiogenesis, with vascular endothelial growth factor amongst the most important. Increasing attention is focused on the complex interplay between angiogenic growth factors, airway smooth muscle and the various collagen-derived fragments that exhibit anti-angiogenic properties. The balance of these dynamic influences in airway neovascularisation processes and their therapeutic implications is just beginning to be elucidated. In this review article, we provide an account of recent developments in the areas of vascular reactivity and airway angiogenesis in chronic airway diseases...|$|R

At baseline, there was no cross-sectional association between absolute eCO levels and either forced expiratory volume (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC) or <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity.</b> However, in the longitudinal analysis within the placebo group, a rise in mean eCO was significantly associated with improvement in <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> (change in eCO (parts per million) per natural log unit change in bronchial hyperreactivity 0. 498, 95 % confidence interval 0. 071 to 0. 924, P= 0. 024).

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{prevalence}} of subsequent respiratory symptoms and the relation between atopic status and <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> in 200 index children and their controls 7 years after acute lower respiratory tract infections in infancy. Index children with recurrent symptoms differed from controls in respect of social and family characteristics and atopic background. Ventilatory function was diminished and <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> increased. Symptom free index children also came from poorer environmental backgrounds, but did not otherwise differ from controls. 'Atopic' index children differed significantly from controls in respect of subsequent symptoms and ventilatory function and similar adverse trends were observed in 'non-atopic' index children. A comparable proportion of 'atopic' and 'non-atopic' index children showed <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> (33. 5 % and 38. 9 % respectively). Index subgroups with and without <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> had increased cough and wheeziness compared with respective matched controls. The former included children with 'established' asthma and the latter those with 'established' bronchitis. Atopic backgrounds were similar in both subgroups, with no differences between cases and controls. These findings suggest that atopic background and <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> are not closely related but may contribute independently to the persistence of symptoms after respiratory infections in infancy. <b>Bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> {{may be a more}} useful basis than atopic status on which to separate children with episodic cough or wheeze, or both, into 'asthmatic' and 'bronchitic' subgroups...|$|E
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} a {{resident}} inflammatory cell of the airways, involved {{in both the}} innate and adaptive immune response. The relationship between mast cells and inflammatory phenotypes and treatment response of asthma is not clear. Clinical characteristics of subjects with stable asthma (n= 55), inflammatory cell counts and gene expression microarrays in induced sputum were analysed. Sputum mast cell subtypes were determined by molecular phenotyping based on expression of mast cell biomarkers (tryptase (TPSAB 1), chymase (CMA 1) and carboxypeptidase A 3 (CPA 3)). Effects of mast cell subtypes on steroid response were observed in a prospective cohort study (n= 50). MC T (n= 18) and MC T/CPA 3 (mRNA expression of TPSAB 1 and CPA 3; n= 29) subtypes were identified, {{as well as a}} group without mast cell gene expression (n= 8). The MC T/CPA 3 subtype had elevated exhaled nitric oxide fraction, sputum eosinophils, <b>bronchial</b> sensitivity and <b>reactivity,</b> and poorer asthma control. This was accompanied by upregulation of 13 genes. Multivariable logistic regression identified CPA 3 (OR 1. 21, p= 0. 004) rather than TPSAB 1 (OR 0. 92, p= 0. 502) as a determinant of eosinophilic asthma. The MC T/CPA 3 subtype had a better clinical response and reduced signature gene expression with corticosteroid treatment. Sputum mast cell subtypes of asthma can be defined by a molecular phenotyping approach.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intestinal or hepatic ischemia/reperfusion induces acute lung {{injury in}} animal models of {{multiple}} organ failure. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - alpha {{is involved in}} the underlying inflammatory mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the inflammatory cascade leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been extensively investigated, the mechanical components of acute respiratory distress syndrome are not fully understood. Our hypothesis is that splanchnic ischemia/reperfusion increases airway reactivity and serum TNF-alpha levels. OBJECTIVE: To assess <b>bronchial</b> smooth muscle <b>reactivity</b> under methacholine stimulation, and to measure serum TNF-alpha levels following intestinal and/or hepatic ischemia/reperfusion in rats. METHOD: Rats were subjected to 45 minutes of intestinal ischemia, or 20 minutes of hepatic ischemia, or to both (double ischemia), or sham procedures (control), followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. The animals were then sacrificed, and the bronchial response to increasing methacholine molar concentrations (10 - 7 to 3 x 10 - 4) was evaluated in an ex-vivo bronchial muscle preparation. Serum TNF-alpha was determined by the L 929 -cell bioassay. RESULTS: Bronchial response (g/ 100 mg tissue) showed increased reactivity to increasing methacholine concentrations in the intestinal ischemia and double ischemia groups, but not in the hepatic ischemia group. Similarly, serum TNF-alpha (pg/mL) concentration was increased in the intestinal ischemia and double ischemia groups, but not in the hepatic ischemia group. CONCLUSION: Intestinal ischemia, either isolated or associated with hepatic ischemia, increased <b>bronchial</b> smooth muscle <b>reactivity,</b> suggesting a possible role for bronchial constriction in respiratory dysfunction following splanchnic ischemia/reperfusion. This increase occurred in concomitance with serum TNF-alpha increase, but whether the increase in TNF-alpha caused this bronchial contractility remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Fine {{particulate}} matter {{has been linked}} to allergies by experimental and epidemiological data having used aggregated data or concentrations provided by fixed-site monitoring stations, which may have led to misclassification of individual exposure to air pollution. METHODS: A semi-individual design was employed to relate individual data on asthma and allergy of 5338 school children (10. 4 +/- 0. 7 years) attending 108 randomly chosen schools in 6 French cities to the concentrations of PM 2. 5 (fine particles with aerodynamic diameter 2. 5 microm) assessed in proximity of their homes. Children underwent a medical visit including skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced <b>bronchial</b> (EIB) <b>reactivity</b> and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. Their parents filled in a standardised health questionnaire. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders and NO 2 as a potential modifier, the odds of suffering from EIB and flexural dermatitis at the period of the survey, past year atopic asthma and SPT positivity to indoor allergens were significantly increased in residential settings with PM 2. 5 concentrations exceeding 10 microg/m 3 (WHO air quality limit values). The relationships were strengthened in long-term residents (current address for at least 8 years). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the hypothesis that changes in allergy prevalence observed in recent decades might be partly related to interactions between traffic-related air pollution and allergens. Further longitudinal investigations are needed to corroborate such results...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{a potent}} vasodilator, {{but it can also}} {{modulate}} contractile responses of the airway smooth muscle. Whether or not endothelial (e) NO synthase (NOS) contributes to the regulation of bronchial tone is unknown at present. Experiments were designed to investigate the isoforms of NOS that are expressed in murine airways and {{to determine whether or not}} the endogenous release of NO modulates bronchial tone in wild-type mice and in mice with targeted deletion of eNOS [eNOS(-/-) ]. The presence of neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and eNOS in murine trachea and lung parenchyma was assessed by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Airway resistance was measured in conscious unrestrained mice by means of a whole body plethysmography chamber. The three isoforms of NOS were constitutively present in lungs of wild-type mice, whereas only iNOS and nNOS were present in eNOS(-/-) mice. Labeling of nNOS was localized in submucosal airway nerves but was not consistently detected, and iNOS immunoreactivity was observed in tracheal and bronchiolar epithelial cells, whereas eNOS was expressed in endothelial cells. In wild-type mice, treatment with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, but not with aminoguanidine, potentiated the increase in airway resistance produced by inhalation of methacholine. eNOS(-/-) mice were hyperresponsive to inhaled methacholine and markedly less sensitive to N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.

40|$|Background: Cigarette smoke {{exposure}} is {{strongly associated with}} airway hyperreactivity (AHR) which is the main characteristic seen in asthma. The intracellular MAPK signaling pathways are suggested {{to be associated with}} the airway damage to the AHR. In the present study, we hypothesize that secondhand cigarette smoke (SHS) exposure upregulates the bronchial contractile receptors via activation of the Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings: Rats were exposed to SHS for 3 h daily for up to 8 weeks. The receptor agonists-induced <b>bronchial</b> contractile <b>reactivity</b> was analyzed with a sensitive myograph system. The mRNA transcription and protein translation of the target receptors and the kinases in Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway were investigated by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Compared with exposure to fresh air, SHS induced enhanced bronchial contractile responses mediated by the 5 -hydroxytryptamine 2 A (5 -HT 2 A) receptors as well as the endothelin type B (ETB) and type A (ETA) receptors. The response curves were shifted toward the left with an increased maximal contraction (Emax) demonstrating that SHS induced AHR. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of the 5 -HT 2 A, ETB and ETA receptors were increased. Furthermore, SHS exposure increased the phosphorylation of Raf- 1 and ERK 1 / 2, but it did not alter p 38 or JNK.

There was no difference in cats that received heartworm homogenate IV for 18 days from donor dogs treated with doxycycline for 1 month compared with cats given heartworm homogenate from untreated donor dogs. Cats did not develop clinical signs, and no radiographic changes were noted. Cats given SC heartworm homogenate at lower concentration than IV groups did not develop histologic changes. Cats that received IV heartworm homogenate for 18 days developed mild interstitial and peribronchial myofibrocyte proliferation and smooth muscle proliferation of the pulmonary arteries. Bronchial ring contractility in vitro was blunted in the IV homogenate cats to the agonists acetylcholine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Cats in the SC group had increased sensitivity to histamine at high concentrations but normal contractility and relaxation responses to other agonists. No increase in mast cells was noted in lung tissues of cats given homogenate. In the absence of bronchial wall remodeling, cats given IV homogenate had blunted responses to bronchial constriction, but normal relaxation to nitroprusside and substance P and increased sensitivity to histamine.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> in epidemiological studies {{has the advantage}} of quantifying an objective physiological feature of asthma. <b>Bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> was developed in a clinical setting and has been conventionally expressed as the dose of agonist producing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20). As PD 20 can be estimated for less than 20 % of subjects in general community surveys with the doses of agonist that are usually given, data from most subjects must be censored. Thus PD 20 alone is a poor index of <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> for epidemiological studies. Data from 809 aluminium smelter workers were used to evaluate alternative methods of analysing <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Dose-response relationships were analysed by four methods: (1) PD 20 by the conventional method of interpolating the dose on a logarithmic scale between the last two measurements of FEV 1; (2) PD 20 (with allowance for extrapolation), estimated by fitting an exponential curve to the dose-response data; (3) the linear regression slope between dose and FEV 1 when significant; (4) the dose-response slope obtained in all subjects as the % change in FEV 1 from baseline in response to total dose. When each of these measures was related to symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma, all differentiated between "asthmatic" and "non-asthmatic" subjects.

40|$|Background: Airway {{instrumentation}} {{in patients}} with bronchial hyperreactivity, may evoke life-threatening asthma attack and a good strategy {{for the prevention of}} bronchospasm"nhas not been defined. In a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled study, it was determined whether prophylaxis with either inhaled salbutamol-or combined inhaled salbutamol and oral methylprednisolone improves lung functions and prevents wheezing after intubation. Methods: Thirty one patients with partially reversible airway obstruction (airway resistance&gt; 180 %, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1] &lt; 70 % of predicted value, and FEV 1 increase&gt; 12 % after two puffs of salbutamol) were randomized to receive daily either 3 - 2 puffs (0. 2 mg) of salbutamol (n = 16) or 3 - 2 puffs (0. 2 mg) of salbutamol and 40 mg of methylprednisolone (n = 15) orally for 5 days. In all patients lung function was evaluated daily and wheezing changes was assessed before and 5 minutes after tracheal intubation. Results: Both salbutamol and combined inhaled salbutamol and oral methylprednisolone treatment significantly improved airway resistance and FEV 1 to a steady state, with no difference between groups. When a single-dose of salbutamol pre-induction or prolonged salbutamol treatment was employed, most patients (8 of 10 and 7 of 9) experienced wheezing after intubation. In contrast, only one patient of those who received both salbutamol and methylprednisolone experienced wheezing (P = 0. 0058). Conclusions: Pretreatment with either salbutamol or combined inhaled salbutamol and oral methylprednisolone significantly improves lung function and decreases the incidence of wheezing after tracheal intubation. Methylprednisolone decreases incidence of wheezing more than salbutamol. Therefore, {{in patients with}} <b>bronchial</b> hyper <b>reactivity,</b> preoperative treatment with both methylprednisolone and salbutamol minimizes intubation-evoked broncho-constriction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Respiratory viral infections (RVi) can be {{associated}} {{with a wide range of}} clinical manifestations. Aim: To investigate the frequency and clinical manifestations of RVi among adult patients during winter hospitalizations. Patients and Methods: All patients admitted to the hospital with flu like disease and those with fever or exacerbation of any underlying disease during hospitalization without an evident cause, were prospectively enrolled. A direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza A (IA) and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus, was performed. Epidemiological and clinical data were recorded. Results: Between May and September 2012, 975 adults were admitted to the Internal Medicine Unit of Puerto Montt Hospital and in 128 (13 %) patients, DIF was carried out. DIF was positive in 44 patients (34 %) aged 65 ± 20 years, 68. 2 % females, corresponding to 4. 5 % of total hospitalizations. Eighty six percent of the latter had at least one co-morbidity, mainly asthma and chronic respiratory diseases in 34. 1 %, diabetes in 29. 5 %, cardiac problems in 25 % and congestive heart failure in 20. 5 %. The most common RVi were RSV (n = 21, 48 %) and IA (n = 17, 39 %). Six patients had a nosocomial RVi. Patients infected with IA had a significantly higher frequency of fever and <b>bronchial</b> hyper <b>reactivity</b> than those infected with RSV. RVi were associated with exacerbation of underlying disease in 62 % of cases and pneumonia in 27 %. Two patients had a viral pericarditis. Conclusions: RVi are an important cause of adult morbidity and their detection should be routine in adult patients hospitalized during winter...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: Hormonal and {{metabolic}} status {{appears to}} influence lung health in women, {{and there are}} findings suggesting that early menarche {{may be related to}} asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates whether age of menarche was related to adult lung function and asthma. MEASUREMENTS: Among participants in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II, 3354 women aged 27 - 57 years from random population samples in 21 centers responded to a questionnaire concerning women's health (1998 - 2002). 2873 had lung function measurements, 2136 measurements of <b>bronchial</b> hyper <b>reactivity</b> (BHR) and 2743 IgE measurements. Logistic, linear and negative binomial regression analyses included adjustment for age, height, body mass index, education, smoking, family size and centre. MAIN RESULTS: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were lower and asthma more common in women with early menarche. Women reporting menarche >/= 10 years as compared with women with menarche at age 13 years (reference category) had lower FEV 1 (adjusted difference - 113 ml, 95 %CI - 196 to - 33) and FVC (- 126 ml [- 223 to - 28]); also lower FEV 1 in percent of predicted (- 3. 28 % [- 6. 25 to - 0. 30]) and FVC % predicted (- 3. 63 % [- 6. 64 to - 0. 62]). Women with early menarche more often had asthma symptoms (OR 1. 80, 95 %CI 1. 09 - 2. 97), asthma with BHR (2. 79 [1. 06 - 7. 34]) and higher asthma symptom score (mean ratio 1. 58, 95 %CI 1. 12 - 2. 21). CONCLUSIONS: Women with early menarche had lower lung function and more asthma in adulthood. This supports a role for metabolic and hormonal factors in womenas respiratory health...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{variations}} in airway caliber and in <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> have been described. The mechanisms underlying these variations are not known. The hypothesis that these variations can be diminished by calcium channel blockers was tested by giving 22 asthmatic children 10 mg of nifedipine or identical placebo {{three times a}} day for 4 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, crossover-designed study. Treatment with nifedipine did not diminish the diurnal {{variations in}} airway caliber, judged from peak expiratory flow rates, or in <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity,</b> judged from bronchodilator responsiveness. Group mean amplitude of the diurnal variation in airway caliber was 10. 5 % on nifedipine and 10. 6 % on placebo. Group mean amplitude of the diurnal variation in bronchodilator responsiveness was 75. 4 % on nifedipine and 69. 5 % on placebo. There were no differences in mean peak expiratory flow rate between nifedipine and placebo periods. This study did not find any evidence to support the hypothesis that the diurnal variations in airway caliber and in <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> can be diminished by calcium channel blockers...|$|E

There was a significant positive correlation between the size of the constrictor response to histamine and the dilator response to isoprenaline (r = + 0. 83; p less than 0. 01) as measured by changes in specific airway conductance.

40|$|The {{manner in}} which a {{cigarette}} is smoked varies considerably between individuals and {{may be an important}} determinant of the altered <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity</b> observed in cigarette smokers. Twenty smokers were examined to determine the relationship between cigarette smoke inhalation patterns and <b>bronchial</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Inhalation patterns were measured non-invasively with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph and these were related to the provocative concentration of histamine that caused a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC 20) and to the cough threshold for inhaled citric acid.

40|$|Non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness is a {{characteristic}} feature of <b>bronchial</b> asthma. Airway <b>reactivity</b> to cholinergics may change with age during childhood. The present paper describes tests {{to see if}} the airway responsiveness induced by acetylcholine (ACh) or capsaicin, which causes a release of endogenous tachykinins from the sensory nerve, changes with age in guinea pigs. Changes in lung resistance (RL) were measured to monitor airflow obstruction caused by intravenous ACh or capsaicin in anesthetized immature guinea pigs (aged 2 weeks), and to compare with those of adult guinea pigs (aged 11 weeks). It was shown that both ACh and capsaicin induced a rapid and dose-dependent increase in RL both in immature and adult animals. The two age groups had similar responsiveness to ACh or capsaicin in terms of potency or sensitivity. The response induced by capsaicin was not affected by atropine. In addition, capsaicin caused no extravasation of Evans Blue dye as an index of airway plasma exudation in both age groups. The airflow obstruction induced by i. v. capsaicin is mainly due to a cholinergic-unrelated smooth muscle contraction. These results suggest that airway smooth muscle responsiveness to cholinergics or capsaicin is comparable in both immature and adult guinea pigs in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA controlled, {{blind study}} was {{conducted}} to define the initial inflammatory response and lung damage associated with the death of precardiac stages of Dirofilaria immitis in cats as compared to adult heartworm infections and normal cats. Three groups of six cats each were used: UU: uninfected untreated controls; PreS I: infected with 100 D. immitis L 3 by subcutaneous injection and treated topically with selamectin 32 and 2 days pre-infection and once monthly for 8 months); IU: infected with 100 D. immitis L 3 and left untreated. Peripheral blood, serum, bronchial lavage, and thoracic radiographic images were collected from all cats on Days 0, 70, 110, 168, and 240. CT images were acquired on Days 0, 110, and 240. Cats were euthanized, and necropsies were conducted on Day 240 to determine the presence of heartworms. Bronchial rings were collected for in vitro reactivity. Lung, heart, brain, kidney, and liver tissues were collected for histopathology. Results were compared for changes within each group. Pearson and Spearman correlations were performed for association between histologic, radiographic, serologic, hematologic and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results. Infected cats treated with selamectin did not develop radiographically evident changes throughout the study, were heartworm antibody negative, and were free of adult heartworms and worm fragments at necropsy. Histologic lung scores and CT analysis were not significantly different between PreS I cats and UU controls. Subtle alveolar myofibrosis was noted in isolated areas of several PreS I cats and an eosinophilic BAL cytology was noted on Days 75 and 120. <b>Bronchial</b> ring <b>reactivity</b> was blunted in IU cats but was normal in PreS I and UU cats. The IU cats became antibody positive, and five cats developed adult heartworms. All cats with heartworms were antigen positive at one time point; but one cat was antibody positive, antigen negative, with viable adult females at necropsy. The CT revealed early involvement of all pulmonary arteries and a random pattern of parenchymal disease with severe lesions immediately adjacent to normal areas. Analysis of CT 3 D reconstruction and Hounsfield units demonstrated lung disease consistent with restrictive pulmonary fibrosis with an interstitial infiltrate, absence of air trapping, and decrease in total lung volume in Group IU as compared to Groups UU and PreS I. The clinical implications of this study are that cats pretreated with selamectin 1 month before D. immitis L 3 infection did not become serologically positive and did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertrophy and myofibrosis...|$|R
40|$|In {{allergic}} or asthmatic airways disease, {{upper and}} lower airways show a uniform eosinophilic inflammation of the mucosa, and bronchial hyperreactivity is a common finding. To study the co- variation of mucosal reactivity in {{upper and lower}} airways, histamine challenges of both sites were performed {{in a group of}} patients with allergic rhinitis during non-season. Upper airways were monitored during challenge by the use of rhinostereometry, an optical technique that non-invasively measures nasal mucosa swelling. An increased histamine response was found in both nose and bronchi, and a subgroup of patients with non-specific nasal complaints reacted more strongly to histamine than patients without such problems, indicating that some patients with allergic rhinitis develop a permanent nasal hyperreactivity. By contrast, in patients with nasal polyposis, the nasal mucosa was non-reactive to histamine and thus did not differ from healthy volunteers in that respect, even though asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity was a common finding. Hence, although upper and lower airways mostly seem to react uniformly in allergic or asthmatic airway disease, non-specific reactivity may differ between the two sites. However, airway hyperreactivity was not restricted to the eosinophilic type of inflammation. Also in healthy volunteers exposed to swine dust by weighing pigs for 3 hours in a swine confinement building, a procedure known to induce an intense neutrophilic airway inflammation (organic dust toxic syndrome), both nasal and <b>bronchial</b> histamine <b>reactivity</b> were found to increase. In swine dust induced inflammation, neutrophils were found to rapidly migrate into the upper airways as detected by nasal lavage. Hence, there was {{reason to believe that the}} endothelial cells might be activated in this condition, and that endothelial cells, known controllers of leukocyte subset migration, also might influence the induction of airway hyperreactivity. Additional studies on swine dust exposed subjects revealed signs of activation of neutrophil/endothelial cell responses, i. e. changes of soluble adhesion levels, IL- 8 and nitrate in peripheral blood. To further elucidate the role of endothelial cells in this type of inflammation, in vitro experiments were performed. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured and subsequently incubated with a swine dust extract. Cytokine secretion, expression of surface adhesion molecules and neutrophil adherence increased following swine dust stimulation, indicating that this dust directly induces neutrophil/endothelial cell interactions of importance for neutrophil accumulation in the airways...|$|R
