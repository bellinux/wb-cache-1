40|$|The Lucky Shot mine (61. 7789 oN, 149. 4069 oW) {{is located}} 50 {{miles north of}} Anchorage in the {{historic}} Willow Creek Mining district, in the southern Talkeetna mountains, which was the second largest lode gold producer in Alaska. Following the discovery of gold in the area by Robert Hatcher in 1906, an estimated 652, 080 ounces of gold were extracted from mines such as Independence, War Baby, Gold <b>Bullion</b> and Gold <b>Cord.</b> The Lucky Shot mine produced 250, 000 ounces of gold (Stevens, 2010) from 1918 until 1942, at an average ore grade of around 1 ounce per ton, according to historical records. The mines were closed during the war, as gold was {{not considered to be}} of strategic importance to the war effort. Placer mining is still carried out on a small scale in the Willow River and high gold prices has encouraged additional exploration in the area. Lucky Shot is currently being evaluated by Full Metal Minerals Ltd., with a view to resuming mining on a limited scale...|$|R
