500|$|In early August 2009, a {{call was}} {{received}} from Square Enix {{telling them that}} no payments were coming. Grin's founders considered suing, but {{had run out of}} money, leading them to stop production after six months of work. Furthermore, Grin ceased production on all of their other projects and declared bankruptcy due to Sweden's severe laws against operating businesses under a debt load. Magnus Ihrefors, one of the 3D artists who worked on the project, stated that he had only found out about the game's cancellation in August, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "punch in the belly; this was our last chance to get on track again." [...] The developer closed its offices on August 12, 2009, stating that delayed payments from [...] "too many publishers" [...] caused [...] "an unbearable cashflow situation," [...] and referred to Fortress in a farewell note as an [...] "unreleased masterpiece that [...] weren't allowed to finish." [...] According to the bankruptcy papers, Square Enix felt that the development goals for Fortress [...] "had not been met in a satisfactory way," [...] whereas Andersson claimed the contrary, arguing that the milestones initially set up with a producer from Square Enix had been met. Mraz stated that Grin seemed to have ignored Square Enix's requests for changes, and the Final Fantasy franchise was too important to overlook this behavior.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He told me in the strictest confidence, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> he wanted to get it off his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Pip" [...] is a {{relatively}} unpopular episode of the series. According to creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, it is [...] "probably {{one of the least}} popular episodes of South Park" [...] they have ever produced, and that [...] "most people [...] pretty much hated it." [...] In 2004, Stone said that he considers the episode [...] "really cool" [...] and [...] "really good". In a 2011 Entertainment Weekly feature, the two named what they consider the best 15 episodes of South Park, along with the 53 worst. [...] "Pip" [...] was number 49 on the [...] "Worst" [...] list (following the first 48 spots which collectively consisted of every episode from the first three seasons). Parker said that [...] "Everyone, including us, hates 'Pip'", and Stone said [...] "I don't hate it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Why did you guys do that?'" [...] The creators said that recreating Great Expectations in South Park style [...] "seemed like a decent enough idea, except that [...] kinda sucks", especially its ending. They have concluded that while they sometimes want to do an episode that is different in style and presentation to the other episodes, it is necessary to have it involve the regular characters, otherwise audiences will not like it.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{newspaper}} accounts, and {{a lengthy}} {{account of the}} game in the 1911 Michiganensian yearbook, the game was a scoreless tie late in the fourth quarter. [...] Michigan took possession at the forty-yard line with 60 yards to go for a touchdown. [...] The Michiganensian described the game-winning drive this way: [...] "With the sun already far down in the West, [...] [...] [...] and the ball in Michigan's possession, sixty yards from Minnesotaâ€™s goal, the unexpected did take place. [...] 'Shorty' McMillan signaled for a forward pass[...] [...] [...] 'Stan' (Wells) ran backwards and threw far and true to Borleske, who was thirty yards down the field before a Swede tackled him. [...] Minnesota was slightly worried. [...] Thirty yards on one play, and it seemed certain that Michigan would now try some old football. [...] Instead, 'Shorty' called for the same play and again Wells threw true to Borleske, who was tackled on the Gopher two yard line. [...] Minnesota, desperate, tried to check the onslaught, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> trying to turn a freshet from its course. [...] Wells hit the line but was thrown back. [...] Again the auburned lad struck the line. [...] Minnesota blocked his path. [...] 'Stan' twisted slightly and slipped between two men. [...] When the officials separated the men, the ball was {{on the far side of}} the Gopher goal line." ...|$|E
