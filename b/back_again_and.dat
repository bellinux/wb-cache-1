25|$|With {{regards to}} directionality, Siddhaṃ texts were usually read from left-to-right then top-to-bottom, as with Indic languages, but {{occasionally}} {{they were written}} in the traditional Chinese style, from top-to-bottom then right-to-left. Bilingual Siddhaṃ-Japanese texts show the manuscript turned 90 degrees clockwise and the Japanese is written from top-to-bottom, as is typical of Japanese, and then the manuscript is turned <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> the Siddhaṃ writing is continued from left-to-right (the resulting Japanese characters look sideways).|$|E
25|$|A corpse candle {{or light}} is a flame or ball of light, often blue, that {{is seen to}} travel just above the ground on the route from the {{cemetery}} to the dying person's house and <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> is particularly associated with Wales. A corpse fire is very similar as the name comes from lights appearing specifically within graveyards where it was believed the lights were an omen of death or coming tragedy and would mark the route of a future funeral, from the victim's house to the graveyard, where it would vanish into {{the ground at the}} site of the burial. The appearance was often said to be on the night before a death.|$|E

25|$|Here a {{throwing}} motion acts on the sample. The vertical throwing {{motion is}} overlaid {{with a slight}} circular motion which results in distribution of the sample amount over the whole sieving surface. The particles are accelerated in the vertical direction (are thrown upwards). In the air they carry out free rotations and interact with the openings in the mesh of the sieve when they fall back. If the particles are smaller than the openings, they pass through the sieve. If they are larger, they are thrown upwards again. The rotating motion while suspended increases {{the probability that the}} particles present a different orientation to the mesh when they fall <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> thus might eventually pass through the mesh.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1941, Axis forces under Rommel pushed the British back to Egypt except for the port of Tobruk, where the Siege of Tobruk took place until it was {{relieved}} during Operation Crusader. The Axis forces were forced to retire to where they had started {{by the end of}} the year. In 1942 Axis forces drove the British <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> captured Tobruk after the Battle of Gazala but failed to gain a decisive victory. On the final Axis push to Egypt, the British retreated to El Alamein, where at the Second Battle of El Alamein the Eighth Army defeated the Axis forces. They were driven out of Libya to Tunisia, where they were defeated in the Tunisian Campaign.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller {{is on her}} deathbed in a New Orleans {{hospital}} as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker {{in all of the}} South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see that the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could come <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> live their lives that were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Waterloo on the 16th, Milhaud's two {{divisions}} and the Imperial Guard light cavalry took {{position on the}} right flank, behind the I Corps. At 1:30 PM, Napoleon sent General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon's I Corps at the Anglo-Allied lines, supported by General of Brigade Étienne Jacques Travers' cuirassier brigade. The heavy cavalrymen enjoyed a quick success when they caught the Hanoverian Lüneburg Light Battalion in line formation behind La Haye Sainte and cut it to pieces. Soon after, the cuirassiers were attacked and routed by the British Household Cavalry Brigade. Later in the day, Marshal Michel Ney ordered Milhaud to send one brigade of cuirassiers to charge what he erroneously {{believed to be a}} retreating enemy. By some mistake, Delort's entire division moved to the attack followed {{by the rest of the}} IV Cavalry Corps as well as the Guard light cavalry. The unsupported French cavalry hurled itself at the Allied infantry squares, cannons, and cavalry but were beaten <b>back.</b> <b>Again</b> <b>and</b> again the cavalry returned to the attack but every charge was repelled. Soon the III Cavalry Corps and the Guard heavy cavalry joined in, but every charge failed. By 6:00 PM, the superb French reserve cavalry was ruined as a fighting force.|$|E
500|$|Years {{after its}} release, Stone {{said of the}} film that it [...] "was the {{beginning}} of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's also about the way we look at our recent history... It shifts from black and white to color, and then <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> views people from offbeat angles." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, The Monthly Film Bulletin described {{the film as}} a [...] "bizarre and grisly Italian effort" [...] that [...] "drags in everything from drug addiction to perpetual youth, crypts to skeletons, but has only a few moments which can claim to be genuinely macabre." [...] The review praised the special effects involving a transition between a young to aged woman and <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> concluded that [...] "if only story, treatment and performance... had been comparable, the film might have been really high in its class." [...] Variety described the film as an [...] "attempt at a horror film which doesn't quite come off {{with only a few}} moments in succeeding in being chilling." [...] The review concluded that the film was [...] "strictly for devotees of the genre" [...] In Italy, La Stampa noted the surprise that the film avoided being banned by Italian censors and that when the film takes on thriller motives, it achieves some effective moments.|$|E

500|$|During the Great Depression, crews {{from the}} Civilian Conservation Corps {{embarked}} on projects {{to improve and}} maintain the parks, which were still {{under the control of}} District authority at that time. At Fort Stanton, CCC members trimmed trees and cleared brush, as well as maintaining and constructing park buildings. Various non-park buildings were also discussed for the land. The City Department of Education proposed building a school on park land, while authorities from the local water utility suggested the construction of a water tower would be suitable for the tall hills of the park. The Second World War interrupted these plans, and post-war budget cuts instituted by President Harry S. Truman postponed the construction of the Fort Drive once more. Though land for the parks had mostly been purchased, construction of the ring road connecting them was pushed <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> again. Other projects managed to find funding, however. In 1949, President Truman approved a supplemental appropriation request of $175,000 to construct [...] "a swimming pool and associated facilities" [...] at Fort Stanton Park.|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> now do it nationwide-style".|$|E

500|$|With {{a second}} counter-thrust having been beaten <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> {{the loss of}} Sattelberg, Katagiri decided to fall back to the north, to form a {{defensive}} line around Wareo {{to wait for the}} Australians to follow up their victories with a further advance. By this time, Katagiri's forces were suffering from a manpower shortage {{due to a lack of}} reinforcements and the supply situation had still not been rectified. The Australian commander, Wootten, was keen to regain the initiative and he decided to resume the advance in the north with a view to securing the remainder of the Huon Peninsula. The first stage of Wootten's plan involved advancing north and securing a line along a ridge that ran between Gusika, on the coast, and Wareo, which was [...] inland. It was to take place in two main drives: the 26th Brigade, having secured Sattelberg, would advance to Wareo on the left, and the 24th Brigade would advance on the right, up the coast to secure Gusika and two large water features about [...] inland near the head of the Kalueng River, known collectively to the Australians as [...] "the Lakes". A third, minor advance would take place in the centre to Nongora and the Christmas Hills, responsibility for which was given to the 20th Brigade.|$|E
500|$|In {{his history}} of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin {{suggested}} that the church adopted Unitarian worship in 1722. This form of worship remained outlawed, as the Act of Toleration did not extend to nontrinitarianism. Unitarianism believed in the [...] "One God and Father of all", rather than the Trinity of God as three consubstantial persons. Writing a series on [...] "Baptists in Taunton" [...] for the Taunton Courier, H. J. Channon disagreed, placing the change in 1733. Both agreed that the zeal with which Jeffries preached helped to swell his congregation, although {{a history of the}} Baptist church in Wellington notes that Jeffries was obstructive regarding a Baptist church being built in that town. Toulmin himself served as the pastor of the chapel from 1764 until 1803, during which time he [...] "experienced unremitted insult and misrepresentation." [...] At one time, an effigy was burned at his door, and it was said that Toulmin could have suffered the same fate, but for assistance from his friends. During Toulmin's ministry, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge occasionally preached at the chapel while staying at Coleridge Cottage in Nether Stowey. In a letter, Coleridge wrote, [...] "I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin." [...] The Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 legalised Unitarian worship.|$|E

2500|$|Entrance to {{the north}} end of the park is via Taft Hill Road (which {{approaches}} the base of the cliff) and to the east end via Ulm-Vaughn Road (which leads to the visitor's center, the slope up the hill, and the summit of the cliffs). A [...] trail leads from the visitor's center to the cliff summit and <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> includes signage about the buffalo jump along the way as well as a tipi ring (a ring of stones which indicate that a tipi was once held in place there). There are drinking water facilities, garbage cans, and public restrooms throughout the park.|$|E
2500|$|In 1798, Toulmin's {{daughter}} Jane drowned. In {{the face}} of this hardship and his longtime political persecutions, he stood strong. For example, during his ministry in Taunton at the Mary Street Unitarian Chapel, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin, [...] "I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. [...] I suppose you must have heard that his daughter, (Jane, on 15 April 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere (sic. Beer). [...] These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian,— there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father." ...|$|E
