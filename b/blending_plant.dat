40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{grotesque}} originated in medieval Italy {{with the discovery of}} early-Christian period Roman artifacts that <b>blended</b> <b>plant,</b> human, and architectural forms into simultaneously comic and terrifying amalgams. By the 16 th century, European writers began applying these distortions to literary works. Early examples are found in Rabelais and Cervantes, and later in Sterne and Hugo. As a literary term, “grotesque” has come to indicate a confluence of incompatible contents that evoke an ambivalent reader response: half laughter, half revulsion. This capacity to comedically unsettle is perhaps one reason for its popularity among authors of the 20 th and 21 st centuries such as Beckett, Kafka, Pynchon, and Ballard. However, one aspect of the modern grotesque remains largely unexamined: distortions of syntactic and grammatical form, as opposed to those of character and imagery. This project looks therefore at the formal-grotesque quality of indeterminacy in one element of David Foster Wallace’s 1996 opus Infinite Jest. The novel presents anomalous anaphoric narrative breaks, wherein breaks in the text are immediately followed by incomplete sentences that lack the orienting information of traditional narration. Employing the theories of Bakhtin, Shklovsky, and Iser, this project aims to elucidate this grotesque formal indeterminacy...|$|R

50|$|Shell Oil {{first arrived}} {{in the form of}} the Asiatic Petroleum Company Ltd, a sales company formed by Royal Dutch Petroleum and the British company Shell Transport and Trading Company, prior to their merger as Royal Dutch Shell. A licence was {{obtained}} in 1912 to store petroleum at Shell Haven, in iron tanks, each containing not more than 4,000 tonnes. The maximum storage allowed for the whole site was 80,000 tonnes. Refinery operations began on a 40 hectare (100 acre) site in 1916 with a distillation plant which produced fuel oil for the Admiralty. In 1919 this unit was converted to manufacture road surfacing bitumen. In 1925, a bench still was erected for the manufacture of lubricating oils; the first high viscosity oils were produced in 1937.Other plants were erected before the outbreak of war, including a <b>blending</b> <b>plant</b> for producing horticultural chemical products.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The odor {{produced}} by a plant under herbivore attack is often used by parasitic wasps to locate hosts. Any type of surface damage commonly causes plant leaves to release so-called green leaf volatiles, whereas blends of inducible compounds are more specific for herbivore attack and can vary considerably among plant genotypes. We compared the responses of naı̈ve and experienced parasitoids of the species Cotesia marginiventris and Microplitis rufiventris to volatiles from maize leaves with fresh damage (mainly green leaf volatiles) vs. old damage (mainly terpenoids) in a six-arm olfactometer. These braconid wasps are both solitary endoparasitoids of lepidopteran larvae, but differ in geographical origin and host range. In choice experiments with odor <b>blends</b> from maize <b>plants</b> with fresh damage vs. <b>blends</b> from <b>plants</b> with old damage, inexperienced C. marginiventris showed a preference for the volatiles from freshly damaged leaves. No such preference was observed for inexperienced M. rufiventris. After an oviposition experi-ence in hosts feeding on maize plants, C. marginiventris females were mor...|$|R
40|$|Beneficial soil-borne microbes, such as {{mycorrhizal}} fungi or rhizobacteria, {{can affect}} the interactions of plants with aboveground insects at several trophic levels. While the mechanisms of interactions with herbivorous insects, that is, the second trophic level, are starting to be understood, it remains unknown how plants mediate the interactions between soil microbes and carnivorous insects, that is, the third trophic level. Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col- 0 and the aphid Myzus persicae, we evaluate here the underlying mechanisms involved in the plant-mediated interaction between the non-pathogenic rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae, by combining ecological, chemical and molecular approaches. Rhizobacterial colonization modifies {{the composition of the}} <b>blend</b> of herbivore-induced <b>plant</b> volatiles. The volatile blend from rhizobacteria-treated aphid-infested plants is less attractive to an aphid parasitoid, in terms of both olfactory preference behaviour and oviposition, than the volatile <b>blend</b> from aphid-infested <b>plants</b> without rhizobacteria. Importantly, the effect of rhizobacteria on both the emission of herbivore-induced volatiles and parasitoid response to aphid-infested plants is lost in an Arabidopsis mutant (aos/dde 2 - 2) that is impaired in jasmonic acid production. By modifying the <b>blend</b> of herbivore-induced <b>plant</b> volatiles that depend on the jasmonic acid-signalling pathway, root-colonizing microbes interfere with the attraction of parasitoids of leaf herbivores...|$|R

50|$|The Tema Oil Refinery in Ghana {{underwent}} {{the first}} phase of a major rehabilitation in 1989. The second phase began in April 1990 at an estimated cost of CN¥220.8 million or GH₵77.8 million (US$36 million). Once rehabilitation was completed, distribution of liquified petroleum gas was to be improved, and the quantity supplied was to rise from 28,000 to 34,000 barrels per day. Construction on the new Tema-Akosombo oil products pipeline, designed to improve the distribution system further, began in January 1992. The pipeline was to carry refined products from Tema to Akosombo Port, where they will be transported across Lake Volta to northern regions. Distribution continued to be uneven, however. Other measures to improve the situation included a CN¥171.7 million or GH₵60.5 million (US$28 million) project to set up a national network of storage depots in all regions. The Tema Lube Oil Company commissioned its new oil <b>blending</b> <b>plant,</b> designed to produce 25,000 tons of oil per year, in 1992. The plant was to satisfy both North Ghana and Ghana's requirements for motor and gear lubricants and 60% of the country's need for industrial lubricants, or, in all, 90% of Ghana's demand for lubricant products. Shareholders per equity included state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, and the 100% state-owned national insurance company, Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).|$|E
