40|$|In {{conventional}} beamhouse operations, {{the elimination}} of hyaluronic acid from hides {{takes place in the}} soaking stage {{in the presence of a}} neutral salt. The impact of sodium chloride and sodium silicate (sodium metasilicate salt) -cured hides along with green hides were investigated in terms of removal of hyaluronic acid. Throughout beamhouse operations, the opening up of fibre structure was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The residual hyaluronic acid in hide and pelt samples taken after each <b>beamhouse</b> <b>operation</b> was analysed through bio-chemical analysis assisted by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The interaction of residual hyaluronic acid with chromium (III) was investigated in terms of deposition of chromium(III) in cross-sectional layers of chrome-tanned leather through scanning electon microscope – energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The hydrothermal stability of chrome tanned leather was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that sodium chloride can remove hyaluronic acid completely in the soaking operation and facilitate good opening and splitting up of fibre structure, which enables good penetration and fixation of chromium(III) species with the purified collagen. In contrast, in the absence of a neutral salt, residual hyaluronic acid existed throughout the beamhouse operations which resulted in poor opening and splitting up of fibre bundles and later inhibited the penetration of chromium(III) species in cross-sectional layers. As a result, comparatively lower hydrothermal stability was observed. Sodium silicate-cured hides did not provide satisfactory results in terms of removing the hyaluronic acid present in the hide, poor opening and splitting up of fibre structure were observed and residual hyaluronic acid was identified even at pickle stage. As a result, the distribution of chromium(III) species at the cross-sectional layers varied widely and poor hydrothermal stability of tanned leather was observed after chrome tanning...|$|E

50|$|The {{steps in}} the {{production}} of leather between curing and tanning are collectively referred to as <b>beamhouse</b> <b>operations.</b> They include, in order, soaking, liming, removal of extraneous tissues (unhairing, scudding and fleshing), deliming, bating (including puering), drenching, and pickling.|$|R
50|$|Deliming {{operations}} of cattle hides usually last 2 hours and are generally {{associated with the}} alkaline phase of <b>beamhouse</b> <b>operations.</b> The progress of deliming in pelts is monitored by the checking of pH values of process liquors and in the cutting of a pelt cross-section. Phenolphthalein is used to monitor deliming pelt cross-sectional progress.|$|R
40|$|Various {{bacterial}} species including potential pathogens {{have been}} isolated from hides and skins. During conventional leather processing, {{due to the}} extreme environmental conditions, the probability of bacteria surviving on hides is reduced. Alternatively, total or partial replacement of the hazardous chemicals with nonhazardous chemicals during best available technologies (BAT) processes may provide suitable conditions for bacterial growth. The aim of the present work {{was to determine the}} effect of conventional and BAT <b>beamhouse</b> <b>operations</b> on certain bacterial species. Decontaminated calf skin samples were inoculated with a known bacterial species found in hides or skins. A conventional and BAT beamhouse processes was carried out with inoculated skin samples, and bacterial growth was determined at various stages of beamhouse through microbial analysis. Analysis of the bacteria during the <b>beamhouse</b> <b>operations</b> showed that some of the stages of the beamhouse process inhibited the bacterial growth whilst other stages promoted the growth of bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for the tanning industry. Considering the increasing necessity of the rational use of water by the mankind, {{the aim of this}} work was to make a diagnosis of water management in the tanneries with <b>beamhouse</b> <b>operations</b> in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, under the focus of the Cleaner Production (CP). The methodology included the elaboration and application of a survey, evaluating management parameters, through interviews in 9 (nine) tanneries. The data analysis resulted in a 'water management traffic light', which shows the overall degree of this management. Results showed that although some good practices were found in these tanneries, generally the water management under CP is incipient...|$|R
