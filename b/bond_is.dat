5|$|James <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> a British secret agent working for MI6 who also answers by his codename, 007. He has been portrayed on film by actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, in twenty-six productions. Only two films {{were not made}} by Eon Productions. Eon now holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> {{a very good}} shot and {{the best in the}} Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Bond in 1981 saw media {{reports on the}} more {{politically}} correct Bond and his choice of car—a Saab 900 Turbo; Gardner later {{put him in a}} Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. Gardner also updated Bond's firearm: under Gardner, <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> initially issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch VP70 and then a Heckler & Koch P7. <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War. Gardner updated Fleming's characters and used contemporary political leaders in his novels; he also used the high-tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films, although Jeremy Black observed that <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities. Gardner's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories.|$|E

50|$|Two atoms can <b>be</b> <b>bonded</b> {{by sharing}} {{more than one}} pair of electrons. The common <b>bonds</b> to carbon <b>are</b> single, double and triple <b>bonds.</b> Single <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> most common and are {{represented}} by a single, solid line between two atoms in a skeletal formula. Double <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> denoted by two parallel lines, and triple <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> shown by three parallel lines.|$|R
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
5|$|A reboot of the series, with Bond winning his 00 {{status in}} the pre-credits sequence. <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> {{instructed}} to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, {{and then on to}} financer Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's investments involve short-selling stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype Skyfleet airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd.|$|E

While investigating, <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> captured, but Gonzales is subsequently killed by Havelock's daughter Melina, and she and Bond escape. Bond identifies one of those present with Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque and so follows a lead to Italy and meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos. Kristatos tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner.|$|E

5|$|After an {{operation}} in Istanbul ends in disaster, <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> missing and {{presumed to be}} dead. In the aftermath, questions are raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes {{the subject of a}} government review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> sent to Shanghai and Macau in pursuit of a mercenary named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, he sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is mortally wounded. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from serious poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb (in From Russia, with Love) the MI6 agent James <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> sent by his superior, M, on an undemanding {{mission to the}} British colony of Jamaica. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in Kingston, and his secretary. <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a guano mine. The island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American National Audubon Society, two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Fleming's first book, Casino Royale, <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> already a 00 agent, having been given the {{position}} after killing two enemy agents, a Japanese spy on the thirty-sixth floor of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center in New York City and a Norwegian double agent who had betrayed two British agents; it is suggested by Bond scholar John Griswold that these were part of Bond's wartime service with Special Operations Executive, a British World War II covert military organisation. In 1954, according to the Soviet file on him in From Russia, With Love, <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} tax-exempt bonds, or private {{activity}} <b>bonds,</b> <b>is</b> to promote job creation and increase {{economic development in}} local areas; therefore, they {{are not limited to}} housing creation.
