5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch {{production in the}} Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E

5|$|The {{isolation}} of vanadium metal proved difficult.

Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> vanadium(II) chloride, VCl2, with hydrogen. In 1927, pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium.|$|E

5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
5|$|In {{hydrides}} and nitrides, protactinium {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4.

5|$|The Weinreb–Nahm ketone {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry to make carbon–carbon bonds. It {{was discovered in}} 1981 by Steven M. Weinreb and Steven Nahm as a method to synthesize ketones. The original reaction involved two subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitutions: the conversion of an acid chloride with N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine, to form a Weinreb–Nahm amide, and subsequent treatment of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent. Nahm and Weinreb also reported the synthesis of aldehydes <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the amide with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride (see amide reduction).|$|E

5|$|The first curium {{samples were}} barely visible, and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility {{was very close to}} that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was produced only in 1951 <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> CmF3 with barium.|$|E
5|$|The {{fluorides}} of tantalum can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0°C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4°C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained <b>by</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of americium and curium in 1944 was {{closely related to}} the Manhattan Project; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children Quiz Kids five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. After the {{discovery of}} americium isotopes 241Am and 242Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor. The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity.
