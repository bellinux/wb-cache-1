5|$|I {{advocate}} the industrial ballot alone when I address {{the workers in}} the textile industries of the East where a great majority are foreigners without political representation. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> speak to American workingmen in the West I advocate both the industrial and the political ballot.|$|E
5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
25|$|You're {{sitting in}} the stands {{and you can see}} he's a big guy, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> walked up to {{him for the first time}} face-to-face, I go, 'Wow, this is a big man.' He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a pretty good idea how to hit.|$|E

25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|Asashōryū {{referred}} to criticism for not showing hinkaku (dignity) as a yokozuna. [...] "Everybody talks about dignity, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{went into the}} ring, I felt fierce like a devil." [...] Asked what his most memorable bout was, he chose his first win over Musashimaru in May 2001, with his parents watching him.|$|E

500|$|Feldman was a late-season call-up in 2005. [...] "The night before, I didn’t sleep a minute. I didn’t {{know what}} to expect, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> walked in , I {{saw a lot of}} the guys I had seen on TV all these years, and was like, 'Holy cow, I’m in the big leagues'", he remembers.|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; I should have liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had finished, shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{responded to}} the foreign press {{regarding}} the Anschluss by saying: [...] "Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have {{in the course of}} my political struggle won much love from my people, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators." ...|$|E

500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Glasse {{explains}} in her note [...] "To the Reader" [...] {{that she has}} written simply, [...] "for my Intention is to instruct the lower Sort", giving the example of larding a chicken: she does not call for [...] "large Lardoons, they would not know what I meant: <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> say they must lard with little Pieces of Bacon, they know what I mean." [...] And she comments that [...] "the great Cooks have such a high way of expressing themselves, that the poor Girls are at a Loss {{to know what they}} mean." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{could give}} the Publick a great many Instances of the Gentlemen's Mismanagement and of Injuries done to the Company this Season in their Direction. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> affirm {{that they have no}} Experience, no Knowledge, no Capacity, For Gathering together, Forming, Entertaining, Governing, Privileging, and Keeping a Company of Comedians ... more than the being able to {{purchase}} the Patent [...] it is a Truth that if any one does not now believe, I am positive that they will in a very little Time be thoroughly convinced of.|$|E
60|$|We {{all three}} lay down {{as quietly as}} possible, and I could not <b>but</b> smile <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought of the literal {{correctness}} of my friend's quaint description of what we saw.|$|R

500|$|She [...] {{gave me a}} call, and she was like, [...] "I {{would love}} to do a duet with you. Come by the studio." [...] When I got there, she played the song for me. I didn't expect to record the song, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard it, I said, [...] "Man, there's no way I'm going to leave this studio without my voice being on that record." [...] Everything just {{happened}} so fast. I didn't expect for it to be a single or a video. Everything was just great.|$|E
500|$|Teles {{said she}} {{would be open to}} {{returning}} for a sequel; she feels the film was [...] "set [...] up very nicely for" [...] one, and claims [...] "verybody's wondering" [...] if there will be a follow-up. On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was over there , I started thinking, 'How would I do this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, so I thought that could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E
500|$|The rowing {{correspondent}} for The Times suggested that [...] "for Oxford {{it was a}} sad day, and for Cooper a tragedy", while for Cambridge it was [...] "a splendid victory". [...] Cambridge's stroke Hoffman said [...] "it was a tough race ... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw that one of the Oxford crew was in distress, I knew we could not help winning." [...] It was the third time since the war that Oxford had lost the event {{as a result of a}} crew member collapsing mid-race. [...] Oxford's bow Richard Bate confessed that he [...] "didn't even know anything had been wrong until after the race. [...] I only knew we were not at our best." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Gene Wilder said {{he chose}} not to see the film. [...] "The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like him very much ... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw little pieces in the {{promotion}} of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him." [...] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said [...] "I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult." [...] He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying [...] "I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she had trouble convincing {{executives}} at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, I had my first solo album. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E
