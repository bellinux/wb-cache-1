5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very {{important}} at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, <b>building</b> <b>foundations</b> and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or <b>building</b> <b>foundations,</b> and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in soils of higher pH. This can also happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or <b>building</b> <b>foundations,</b> and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E

5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} RAF Handforth are the government pay offices {{adjacent to the}} Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and <b>building</b> <b>foundations)</b> and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road. The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as married quarters and exist to this day.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{all that}} remains of Harshaw are a few houses, some <b>building</b> <b>foundations,</b> two small cemeteries, and {{dilapidated}} mine shafts. Most of the buildings were torn down by locals or by the Forest Service in the mid to late 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The glacial {{deposits}} {{have given}} rise to heavy, fertile soils which are suitable for both arable and livestock farming. The soils also contain many rounded boulders of varying sizes which, because of their hardness provide a valuable building material to augment the softer, easily worked sandstone. The larger boulders are frequently seen in use as <b>building</b> <b>foundations,</b> while the smaller cobbles are widely employed in the drystone field-walls which form another characteristic feature of the area.|$|E
25|$|Traces {{of these}} {{activities}} remain today, mainly as <b>building</b> <b>foundations</b> and pottery fragments. Waugh was also responsible for expanding the number of buildings on the island – creating the now ruined village of Maryland (named after Waugh's wife), as well as adding a new gatehouse and tower in the Tudor style. Waugh also paid {{for the construction of}} a new pier, adorned with castellated watch towers. Another large expenditure was the construction of St Mary's church, built in the Gothic style and also was named for his wife. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Harry Smith in 1853 and construction was completed a year later. Inside the church there is a monument to Waugh as well as the tomb of the late owner Charles van Raalte. Part of the church is dedicated to the Scouting movement and the flags of the Scout and Girl Guide movements line either side of the main altar.|$|E

25|$|Many of the Royal Dockyard's buildings, {{facilities}} and features {{have been lost}} or destroyed since its closure, and its waterways infilled. Henry VIII's Great Storehouse of 1513 was demolished in 1954 (its bricks were used for repairs to Hampton Court Palace); and demolition of the adjacent eighteenth-century Storehouse buildings followed likewise in 1984. A few buildings have survived, however, most notably the Master Shipwright's House of 1708 (built by Joseph Allin), the nearby Office Building of 1720 and (from a late period of the dockyard's existence) the prominent Olympia Warehouse of 1846. (This building, of distinctive iron construction, was originally a double shed, built over dual slipways alongside the main Basin to enable shipbuilding to take place under cover). Moreover, remains {{of many of the}} yard's core features, including the slipways, dry docks, basins, mast ponds and <b>building</b> <b>foundations,</b> still exist below ground level and have been studied in archaeological digs. The subterranean remains of the Tudor Great Storehouse are now a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E

500|$|Roman period {{settlements}} {{have been}} discovered all along the Norfolk Coast, notably the complex at Branodunum, which covered at least 23ha (57acres) near Brancaster. This site included a fort built on the castrum pattern enclosing 2.6ha (6.3acres) within its walls, 2.9m (10ft) wide. The fort had internal turrets at the corners and was backed by an earth rampart. Early Saxon sites are scarce close to the Norfolk coast, but a gold bracteate found near Blakeney Chapel was a rare and significant 6th-century find, {{and there is a}} somewhat later Saxon cemetery at Thornham. The Danelaw left few tangible traces within the SSSI, but place names such as Holkham ("ship town") reflect the Viking influence. Saxon <b>building</b> <b>foundations</b> were described as the ruins of [...] "Cley Chapel" [...] on a 1797 map, although {{it is more likely that}} they belonged to a barn.|$|E

500|$|The archaeological team {{performing}} the search discovered three new mass graves. The remains were reinterred {{out of respect}} for the victims. At the second dig the findings included yellow tiles stamped with a pierced mullet star resembling a Star of David, and <b>building</b> <b>foundations</b> with a wall. The star was soon identified as the logo of Polish ceramics factory manufacturing floor tiles, founded by Jan Dziewulski and brothers Józef and Władysław Lange (Dziewulski i Lange – D✡L since 1886), nationalised and renamed under communism after the war. As explained by forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls, the new evidence was important because the second gas chambers built at Treblinka were housed in the only brick building in the camp; Colls claimed that this provides the first physical evidence for their existence. In his memoir describing his stay in the camp, survivor Jankiel Wiernik says that the floor in the gas chambers (which he helped build) was made of similar tiles. The discoveries became a subject of the 2014 documentary by the Smithsonian Channel. [...] More forensic work has been planned.|$|E
500|$|The worst {{impact was}} {{confined}} to Bandera County. The impact in the county stemmed from flooding of the Medina River which, infused with high rainfall, produced a 500-year flood. In Bandera, the Medina turned into a [...] wall of water, which destroyed several of the trees along the river in addition to causing various items to litter the roads. In isolated areas, there was an odor from decaying livestock. Two people were witnessed clinging to a roof that was swept into the Medina. A further 100people were cut off due to the river flood. 10–15houses were washed away and the courthouse became an evacuation center {{by virtue of being}} the only area above the water. Electricity and all phone lines save the Sheriff Department line were knocked out in the city and several houses that were still standing had standing water inside them. At the riverfront Camp Bandina, eight people were reported killed while 100children escaped by staying at the church camp nearby. The Peaceful Valley Ranch was nearly decimated, with only the <b>building</b> <b>foundations</b> still remaining. Six people were killed by the floods while sleeping while 20guests and staff rode out the storm by clinging to trees and roofs for six hours. The town of Medina was rendered inaccessible by road after the Medina combined with the Sabinal River. There were also reports of looting in the county, but no arrests were made. One of the survivors of the flooding in this area was former Miss USA Kimberly Tomes, whose family was vacationing at a dude ranch in the area. After leaving and grabbing onto a tree, she witnessed cars and mobile homes passing by.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, a fire on Tintagel Island led to {{considerable}} {{erosion of}} the topsoil, and many more <b>building</b> <b>foundations</b> could be seen than those recorded by Ralegh Radford.
