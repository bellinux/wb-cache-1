5|$|The property's {{original}} {{area was}} 2acres (8,000 mÂ²), {{but this was}} reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, {{between the house and}} river. On May 31, 1860, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad opened with a train from Danville. This was the second railroad track in Northumberland, and ran <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The canal closed in 1902 and was later filled in. The modern railroad line approximates the canal's course through the front yard; the track <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> no longer exists.|$|E

Because of Gundamma's arrogance, Prabhakar and Padma leave for Bangalore. Durga steals {{the money in the}} locker, accuses Gundamma of robbery and locks her in a room <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Lakshmi and Anji visit Gundamma and become aware of her condition. Lakshmi and Gundamma coerce Durga and retrieve the money she stole. Bhoopati comes to Durga's rescue but is defeated by Anji in a duel and is hospitalised.|$|E
5|$|The gardens <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> may {{originally}} have {{resembled the}} gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which {{were laid out}} in the Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} {{surrounded}} by a deer park which was landscaped by Capability Brown from 1775. He established a winding path, known as Capability Brown path, through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A small garden <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is a flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E

In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and slides into the river <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E

50|$|Around 10 am on 2 January 1941, two {{bombs were}} dropped in Rathdown Park, Terenure. The first bomb, landed in soft ground <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> at <b>the</b> corner of Rathdown Park and Rathfarnham Road, {{creating}} a large crater but causing little other damage. <b>The</b> second landed <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> at 25 and 27 Rathdown Park, destroying both and damaging many neighbouring homes. Two other bombs were {{dropped on the}} corner of Lavarna Grove and Fortfield Road, close to the Kimmage Crossroads (KCR). Lavarna Grove was still under construction so the bomb fell on undeveloped ground, resulting in little damage, a single person injured and no loss of life.|$|R

5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E

5|$|Until the Parliament Act 1911, {{there was}} no way to resolve contradictions between the two houses of {{parliament}} except through the creation of additional peers by the monarch. Queen Anne had created 12 Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Reform Act 1832 was passed when the House of Lords dropped oppositionâWilliam IV had threatened to create 80 new peers by request of the prime minister, Earl Greyâcreating an informal convention that the Lords would give way when the public was <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons. For example, Irish disestablishment, which had been a major bone of contention between the two main parties since the 1830s, wasâfollowing intervention by the queenâpassed by the Lords in 1869 after W.E. Gladstone won the 1868 election on the issue. However, in practice, this gave the Lords a right to demand that such public support be present and to decide the timing of a general election.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they had imagined. At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> One of those killed was the fiancÃ© of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained in the house with the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall near the house. Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E
