5000|$|Hotchkiss-type drive; open {{propeller}} shaft. <b>Bevel</b> <b>driven</b> back axle with alternative ratios. Subtle changes to ratios were made {{according to the}} topography of each speed event: ...|$|R
50|$|Power was {{transmitted}} to the rear wheels with the usual Daimler fluid flywheel and self-changing gearbox but the final drive was now by spiral bevel. A pin roller-bearing propeller-shaft led to a half-floating spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>driven</b> back axle.|$|R
25|$|A minor {{evolution}} of the preceding One-O-Four, the Majestic, like all new Daimlers following 1937's New Fifteen, was designed around that same massive cruciform-braced box-section chassis equipped with André Girling's design of coil-sprung independent front suspension with a well-located hypoid <b>bevel</b> <b>driven</b> 'live' rear axle using semi-elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|After the 125 Bronco and Cadet/4, Ducati made {{no further}} {{refinements}} of the OHV pushrod singles line {{that had begun}} with the Ducati 85, focusing instead on the OHC <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> and desmo singles, and ultimately twins, that were to become integral with the Ducati image.|$|E
50|$|Early {{models of}} the {{permanent}} way maintenance ganger's Wickham trolley used a vee-twin JAP engine. This drove through a large flat flywheel and a friction drive.In the 1950s other Wickham trolley's used the 600 cc JAP engine and drove through a clutch, tail shaft and <b>bevel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|No.3 MTB (255) :A larger {{version of}} the engine, with 1.25-inch bore and 1-inch stroke. The <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> valve gear is enclosed. Casting number 255 on the crankcase. These {{appeared}} in about 1924 and were available for 10 years. They were also sold as stationary engines and would drive 120 to 150W output.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{the usual}} chain drive, the Century steamer {{employed}} shaft <b>drive</b> and a <b>bevel</b> gear <b>drive,</b> a very modern solution.|$|R
5000|$|All Ducati single-cylinder OHC {{motorcycle}} engines used a bevel shaft {{system to}} drive the camshaft. Some of their V-Twins also used <b>bevel</b> camshaft <b>drive.</b> The Kawasaki W650 (1999-2007) and its successor the Kawasaki W800 (2011-2016) [...] use a <b>bevel</b> shaft <b>drive</b> system for its overhead camshaft. The W800 is at this moment the only production engine to use a bevel gear and the [...] "Final Edition", released {{at the end of}} 2016, will mark the end of this distribution system ...|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Scott Rossiter {{purchased}} the company, renaming it the Lampin Corporation. In 1990, Lampin acquired MITRPAK, {{a line of}} spiral <b>bevel</b> gear <b>drives,</b> from Johnson & Bassett, a Worcester, Massachusetts company founded in 1870.|$|R
50|$|Final {{drive is}} via a shaft. Power is {{transferred}} via an enclosed splined driveshaft with one universal joint. The shaft drives a bevel gear {{to which the}} wheel is joined via a cush-drive, which absorbs and dampens driveline shocks and vibrations. The <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> spins in an oil bath, and a grease-nipple is provided for greasing the shaft bearing.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the takeover, due to its {{financial}} difficulties Ducati {{was in a state of}} suspended animation with regards to engineering development. By that time, the classic <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> V-twin, which was old and expensive to produce, had been replaced by the belt-drive Pantah, designed by Fabio Taglioni. The Pantah was already known to be a strong and capable engine, and known to deliver in the Ducati 750 F1.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, ABC {{introduced}} a motorcycle with a flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, and therefore with the crankshaft running longitudinally when referenced to the frame. To accommodate chain drive, the ABC used a <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> at the gearbox {{to change the}} direction of the drive through ninety degrees. The 1923 BMW R32 used a similar engine position with a drive shaft using bevel gears to power the rear axle.|$|E
5000|$|An {{entirely new}} design of four-speed gearbox {{provided}} four speeds (constant mesh third) and reverse with a single-plate dry clutch which sent power through a hypoid <b>bevel</b> final <b>drive</b> {{to the rear}} axle and its 21" [...] Rudge-Whitworth wire centre-lock wheels.|$|R
25|$|The rotor {{is turned}} by the wind, {{and through a}} <b>bevel</b> wheel <b>drives</b> a shaft inside the column (if used) or in {{the centre of the}} tower. At the lower end this drives a {{horizontal}} shaft through a gearbox, which typically drives three throw pump.|$|R
50|$|The AJS S3 V-twin was a British {{motorcycle}} {{designed and}} built by the Wolverhampton, England company A. J. Stevens & Co. Ltd. Launched in 1931, the AJS S3 was a 496 cc transverse V-twin tourer with shaft primary drive (but chain final <b>drive),</b> three speed <b>bevel</b> <b>driven</b> gearbox and alloy cylinder heads. The 50 degree V configuration was effective for air cooling and with a tank top 'dashboard' was conceived as a luxury cruiser. It had been expensive to develop and at £65 was {{more expensive than the}} 1000cc AJS of the same year, so the S3 did not sell in large numbers {{and by the end of}} 1931 AJS had gone into liquidation and been taken over by Matchless motorcycles who discontinued production.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{construction}} of aero bike {{started out as}} a styling project that featured an extended aerodynamic front with spoilers and advance guard bodywork in early 1985. In the same year, the first aero bike named [...] "Aero-D-Zero" [...] was constructed around a steel trellis frame and <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> Ducati motor of Mike Brosnan. The bike was first used in March 1987 BEARS speed trial. It latter won the 1988 and 1990 speed trials with speeds of 242.72 km/h and 247.80 km/h respectively.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{supplied}} with the Daimler Fluid Flywheel coupled to a 4-speed Wilson Pre-selector gearbox. The {{independent front suspension}} used coil springs, while the back axle was suspended using a traditional semi-elliptical set-up. The chassis was [...] "underslung" [...] at the rear with the main chassis members passing below the rear axle. In mid-1950 the restricted ground clearance was improved by {{the adoption of a}} conventional hypoid <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> to the rear axle replacing the traditional Daimler underslung worm drive which had hampered sales outside Britain.|$|E
50|$|Sun :The Sun was {{launched}} in 1927 as a direct replacement for the 1b MTB engine. Like the Star, the <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> was moved inside the crankcase, and banjo drive was used {{with a choice of}} either piston valve or slide valve. Bore and stroke were 0.75 inches. While the slide valve variant was only available as a kit, the piston valve version was available as a complete engine or kit. The Sun continued after the war as a piston valve kit only and last appeared in the Stuart catalogue in 1989/1990.|$|E
5000|$|In a side-valve engine, {{the valves}} are {{operated}} from the [...] "underhead" [...] cam without special valve gear. Overhead valve (OHV) engines have valves operated by pushrods. Single- and double-overhead camshaft (SOHC and DOHC, respectively) engines have overhead camshafts typically operated by chain, belt, gear train or <b>bevel</b> gear <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|H-drives {{do not use}} axles {{but rather}} {{individual}} wheel stations, usually carried on a punt chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis. At each wheel station a <b>bevel</b> box <b>drives</b> the half shaft out to the wheel.|$|R
50|$|An all new chassis {{with four}} speed gearbox, freewheel, {{automatic}} restart, bigger brakes, automatic clutch spiral <b>bevel</b> final <b>drive</b> {{and other facilities}} for the driver but bearing the same Pressed Steel body and, for the moment, the same engine was announced in July 1932. It was sold alongside the Family Ten for a 17 per cent premium.|$|R
50|$|Star :The {{aluminium}} bodied Star {{was introduced}} in 1926 (as was the Isis steam launch she powered). Although similar in design it was a completely new engine, and was only available as a finished item. It had 0.625-inch bore and stroke. It used the <b>bevel</b> <b>drive,</b> but this time enclosed within the crankcase. For the valve gear it used a banjo drive to a close fitting piston valve. This having significant advantages for 'flash' steam plant which could be very high pressure. This engine was produced until the 2nd World War.|$|E
50|$|The company {{produced}} {{a number of}} models which were sold widely in Europe and in the USA. In 1905 these ranged from 2.3 litres to the 8.1 litre 40/52 HP and by 1914 Minerva-built Knight sleeve valve engines replaced side-valve units in the larger cars. Post-1918 only sleeve valve engines were used. Citroën's chevron gears {{were used for the}} <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> rear axles from 1914 and a unique feature was the Mors patented clutch, which had a contracting band system which replaced the cone clutch used until 1903.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Josef Fritzenwenger {{presented}} a prototype using a PSA-Renault X-Type engine from a Peugeot 104. The engine, which {{was installed in}} the 104 at a 72° angle, was laid flat in the frame with the crankshaft on the right, running parallel to the centre line of the frame. This layout, for which BMW submitted a patent application, was well suited to BMW's traditional shaft drive, needing only one 90° <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> to transmit power to the rear wheel. Using shaft drive with the near-vertical transverse engine preferred by the Japanese manufacturers at the time would have needed two 90° bevel drives, doubling the power lost to the inefficiency of these units. The new layout also kept the bike's centre of gravity low, which improved the bike's handling, and made space behind the front wheel available for the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|Engine clutch and gearbox {{were held}} {{as a unit}} at three points. There was a single plate clutch, its housing cast in one piece with the gearbox, a four-speed gearbox and an {{enclosed}} drive shaft taking power to the spiral <b>bevel</b> final <b>drive.</b> The gear lever, adjustable for reach, was positioned by the driver's right hand.|$|R

5000|$|Under AMC {{ownership}} a {{much improved}} {{version of the}} Norton gearbox was developed, to be used on all the larger models of AJS, Matchless and Norton. Again, the major changes were for improved gear selection.In September 1955, a 600 cc Dominator 99 was launched.The 1946 to 1953 Long Stroke Manx Norton was 79.6 x 100 mm initially SOHC, the DOHC engine becoming available to favoured racers in 1949. The Short Stroke model (1953 to 1962) had bore and stroke of 86 x 85.6 mm. It used a dry sump 499 cc single-cylinder motor, with two valves operated by <b>bevel</b> <b>drive,</b> shaft driven twin overhead camshafts. Compression ratio was 11:1. It had an Amal GP carburettor, and a Lucas racing magneto. The 1962 500 cc Manx Nortons produced [...] at 6,780rpm, weighed 142 kg, and had {{a top speed of}} 209 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|By 1978 {{the bike}} looked identical, but several {{significant}} improvements {{had made their}} way into the motor making them more reliable and solving problems with engine cranks breaking. The electronics also improved as well as some minor timing tweaks making the bike run more efficiently. Most notable was a majorly redesigned gear shifter that made the bike a lot easier for owners to live with the bike. Most 1978 900 Super Sports also came with a dual seat and lockable tool box. The solo seat was available as an option. The 1978 model bike is considered to be the finest iteration of the <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> square case Super Sports. The 1978 900 and 1979 750s were the last to retain close links with the Imola racers and the last to come with the [...] "old fashioned" [...] spoke wheels. it was also in 1978 that the Isle of Man TT Formula 1 race was won by a 900 Super Sport, ridden by former World Champion Mike Hailwood in a popular comeback race.|$|E
5000|$|Owned by Dr. Bob Tebb, Blacolvesley is {{the oldest}} {{workable}} internal combustion locomotive in the world. It was built by Bassett-Lowke in 1909 utilising parts of Henry Greenly's Class 10 Atlantic locomotives. Originally, it was fitted with a NAG 12/14 h.p. engine, which was later replaced with an Austin 8 engine at Saltbur. However, the original transmission, gearbox and <b>bevel</b> <b>drive</b> all remain in use. It was built for Charles Bartholomew of Blakesley Hall, but the engine has had a varied history since leaving there in 1939. It was later named [...] "Elizabeth" [...] and was kept on the railways at Saltburn, Haswell Lodge and Lightwater Valley up until 1994, although had been inoperable since the mid-1970s. When it arrived at Ravenglass, it was successfully restarted and operated in August 1994. It is now painted in its original colours once again and operated at gala events. The locomotive celebrated its 100th birthday in 2009 and has been on static display at the Railway Museum at Cleethorpes from 2010 to present.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{errors in}} {{spiral bevel gear}} trains caused by the generation of nonconjugate surfaces, by axial displacements of the gears during assembly, and by eccentricity of the assembled gears were determined. One mathematical model corresponds to {{the motion of the}} contact ellipse across the tooth surface, (geometry I) and the other along the tooth surface (geometry II). The following results were obtained: (1) kinematic errors induced by errors of manufacture may be minimized by applying special machine settings, the original error may be reduced by order of magnitude, the procedure is most effective for geometry 2 gears, (2) when trying to adjust the bearing contact pattern between the gear teeth for geometry 1 gears, it is more desirable to shim the gear axially; for geometry II gears, shim the pinion axially; (3) the kinematic accuracy of spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>drives</b> are most sensitive to eccentricities of the gear and less sensitive to eccentricities of the pinion. The precision of mounting accuracy and manufacture are most crucial for the gear, and less so for the pinion...|$|R
