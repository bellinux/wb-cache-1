They generally rise about one-third of the height of the vault, and as they project forwards they lessen the span to be vaulted over.|$|R
5000|$|By October 1844 a bonding {{warehouse}} {{had been}} built in Manchester and the first cargo to arrive was announced {{in a letter to}} the Manchester Guardian, later printed in The Times: FIRST ARRIVAL IN THE PORT OF MANCHESTER OF A CARGO OF GOODS FOR BONDWe have great pleasure in recording the first arrival in the Port of Manchester of a vessel, with an entire cargo of wines and spirits removed in bond, and for bonding in Manchester. The vessel, a flat named the Express, was wholly laden with a valuable cargo of wines and spirits, in all about 40 tons weight, belonging to Mr. William Gibb, spirit merchant, of this town, whose active and long-continued exertions in the struggle to obtain the privilege of bonding for this great and important borough are about to be acknowledged in the form of a substantial mark of respect and gratitude by his fellow-townsmen. The Express arrived from Liverpool on Saturday evening; but it was yesterday morning before she began to unload. She is lying in the Bridgewater Canal, Knott Mill where the Duke's trustees have constructed a large <b>bonding</b> <b>vault,</b> which Mr. Gibb has taken and had licensed for the purpose, and we believe he is now removing his stock of wine and spirits from other ports to Manchester, for the greater convenience of sampling and sale. The lockers, gaugers, and other officers of Customs were in attendance, superintending the unloading of the vessel and thus have commenced the operations of the Manchester Custom-house. It is a gratifying circumstance that a gentleman who took so prominent a part in the struggle to obtain the boon of bonding for Manchester should be the first to enjoy the fruits of its success. We hope ere long to record the general operation of the system; though it will require a little time, perhaps, as it must have a beginning. - Manchester Guardian ...|$|R

40|$|Repair of {{historic}} masonry by Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) systems is being {{more and more}} used especially in seismic areas. A rather great deal of experimental research on the mechanical behaviour of the repaired masonry {{has been carried out}} but very small experimental work has been done on the durability of FRP repairs when masonry is exposed to aggressive environments Carbon FRP have been applied on the surface of both soldier course and running bond specimens respectively as <b>bonds</b> in thin <b>vaults</b> and in solid walls. A total number of 20 specimens have been prepared and tested. A RILEM pre-standard procedure was followed for the evaluation of resistance to sulphates of the specimens.

50|$|Gruber singles out Nakatomi {{executive}} Joseph Takagi, {{and says}} he intends to teach the corporation a lesson for its greed. Isolated from the hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault and reveals that his endgame is to attempt to steal $640 million in bearer <b>bonds</b> in the <b>vault,</b> with terrorism merely {{being used as a}} distraction. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is murdered by Gruber. McClane, who had been secretly watching, accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony. McClane manages to kill Tony, pocketing his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). As Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate, Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell arrives and is greeted by Eddie, who is posing as a concierge; he finds nothing strange about the building. As Powell turns to leave, McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car to get his attention. Powell summons the LAPD, who lays siege to the building. McClane steals Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) {{are gaining}} increasing popularity for upgrading, repairing and rehabilitation of existing structures thanks to many interesting advantages against traditional structural materials. Composite applications in civil engineering, {{that range from}} embedded non-metallic reinforcements to externally bonded strengthenings, are generally much more recent than other FRP applications, for this reason several questions regarding {{the assessment of the}} strengthening effectiveness as well as long term behaviour and durability of the application remain still unsolved. Elmi-Pandolfi building, an historical structure dated 1600 that was seriously damaged in the earthquake of 1997, has been repaired and retrofitted including carbon FRP (CFRP) strengthenings externally <b>bonded</b> to some <b>vaults</b> and walls. Since an innovative strengthening technique intended to lock-out the possible failure mechanisms with CFRP tapes was used for the vaults, its effectiveness has been experimentally proved trough dynamic testing. Furthermore a fibre optic monitorage network based on distributed Brillouin strain sensing was embedded in the CFRP strengthenings in order to evaluate the durability of the application especially in case of further seismic shocks. In this paper the dynamic tests carried out on the biggest of the repaired vaults and preliminary experimental tests characterizing the Brillouin distributed sensing performances are presented...|$|R

SW 3 Latitude: 37. 42. 16. 80 Longitude: 28. 42. 58. 86 Elevation: 509 mAxis: 70 degrees E/NEDimensions: W: 3. 95 m, L: 3. 85 m and 3. 75 m, pres. H: 3. 20 mDescription: Simple vaulted tomb, {{with some}} {{superstructure}} surviving and architectural blocks nearby (though these may come most recently from the Southwest Church, C 010). Two well preserved underground chambers, partially collapsed to east, {{and part of}} southern wall of superstructure; a slight mound rises above the eastern parts, while the field over the western parts are plowed. The two vaulted chambers, equal in terms of scale and workmanship, are aligned toward the east. Both are the same width (n-s 3. 95 m), while the first room is slightly longer than the second (eastern: e-w 3. 85 m; western: e-w 3. 75 m). The western room is cleared {{to a maximum of}} 3. 20 m below the vault. The entrance doorway and dromos are not preserved. The arched doorway between the two rooms is 0. 66 m wide and at least 1. 66 m high, and the wall between the rooms is 0. 68 m thick. A narrow ledge (0. 05 m) projects from the walls 2. 60 m below the vault and probably supported the cover slabs laid over built cists (none of the cist walls are visible). The ledge is visible on parts of all the walls in the western room (the eastern room is not cleared to this depth so cannot be confirmed). Two rectangular niches are in the western end wall (H: 0. 55 m, W: 0. 40 m, D: 0. 45 m), about 0. 95 m above the ledge. None of the cross walls are <b>bonded</b> with the <b>vault</b> walls, even below the ledge; the intrados of the vault is continuous over the dividing wall and the two end walls. The masonry throughout is careful and regular. The blocks tend to be split rather than carved, and on average are significantly longer an thinner than standard petit appareil blocks, up to 0. 80 long but only 0. 12 m high. The springing of the vault is nearly imperceptible, but the stones in the walls are thicker and shorter than in the vault. The arch over the doorway is built of tapered marble voussoirs, well finished with a point chisel (H: 0. 33 - 0. 34 m, W: 0. 06 to 0. 15 m; D: 0. 16 to 0. 31 m). The mortar beds are recessed by 0. 03 - 0. 07 m in the vault, while thicker and flush with the masonry below the ledge. Some of the courses are evened with shims. A 3. 85 m long ashlar wall at ground level is part of the superstructure of the tomb. The six blocks (L: 0. 44 to 1. 19 m) exactly parallel the southern wall of the eastern room and the southern face of the wall is approximately 0. 95 m south of the interior face of the chamber wall. Some architectural blocks that could be associated with the superstructure lie in the pit in front of the entrance. These include a fragment of a monolithic column of Yazır marble (pres H: 1. 77 m), a white marble corner frieze block with vertical fluting (H: 0. 30 m, L: 0. 90 m, D: 0. 72 m), and a large threshold block (L: 1. 60 m, D: 0. 50 m, H: 0. 30 m). In the surrounding field are many tile fragments and sherds including early and late Roman fine wares, though all of this, and the architectural blocks cold be more immediately associated with the Southwest Church immediately to the west...|$|R
