5|$|Many {{texts from}} the Roman Empire {{refer to the}} mysteries of Isis, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> source to {{describe}} them {{is a work of}} fiction, the novel Metamorphoses, written in the second century CE by Apuleius.

5|$|On 18 March 1970, taking {{advantage}} of a visit by Sihanouk to Moscow and Beijing, the prince was deposed by the National Assembly, who promptly announced the creation of the Khmer Republic. The real power, however, fell into the hands of Lon Nol. The general promptly issued an ultimatum to the North Vietnamese, ordering them out of the country, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> real result was that the Cambodian Army led a bloody pogrom against ethnic Vietnamese in the eastern provinces.|$|E

That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E

5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|As the {{expensive}} War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, {{so did the}} Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{developed}} {{very close to}} shore, it only briefly traveled west-northwest before making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico early on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz until dissipating over the mountains of San Luis Potosí late on June 29. Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60miles (95km) south of Tampico, were severely flooded, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reported fatalities were the two occupants of a car that was swept away by floodwaters in Naranjos.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp is {{sometimes}} known as Walter de Beauchamp of Elmley, to distinguish {{him from the}} members of the Beauchamp family of Bedford. He married the daughter of Urse d'Abetot, who is usually named Emeline, although her name is not given in contemporary records. Urse d'Abetot was the Sheriff of Worcestershire from around 1069 to around 1108. Beauchamp may have been a tenant of his father-in-law prior to his marriage. Nothing is known for sure of Beauchamp's background, and he first witnessed a royal charter sometime between 1108 and 1111. Some documents suggest that his father may have been named Peveral de Beauchamp and that he had a brother named William Peveral de Beauchamp, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> identifiable Peveral is younger than Walter.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E

5|$|Garrow had an {{irregular}} relationship with Sarah Dore, {{who had previously}} borne a son, William Arthur Dore Hill, by Arthur Hill, Viscount Fairford in 1778. Thomas Hague has suggested that Dore was an Irish noblewoman Garrow had seduced, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> intent of his writings was to disparage Garrow, {{and there is no}} evidence to support his claim. Their first child, David William Garrow, was born on 15 April 1781, and their second, Eliza Sophia Garrow, was born on 18 June 1784. Garrow and Dore finally married on 17 March 1793. Dore was noted as particularly elegant, and was actively involved in local matters in Ramsgate, where the family lived. Dore died on 30 June 1808 after a long illness, and was buried at the Church of St Margaret, Darenth. David William Garrow was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, earning the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and served as one of the Chaplains to the Prince of Wales. Eliza Sophia Garrow married Samuel Fothergill Lettsom; one of her children, also named William Garrow, served as the Consul-General of Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|Images of {{the black}} swan played only a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E
