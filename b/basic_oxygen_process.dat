40|$|Purpose: The basic {{purpose of}} this {{publication}} is to demonstrate the influence of variations in composition of the metallic charge in the <b>Basic</b> <b>Oxygen</b> Steelmaking <b>process</b> on the converter performance. One of the methods considered is in increase {{of the content of}} steel scrap. The preliminary results of the researches carried out demonstrate such a possibility and improvement of the liquid steel per melt ratio. Design/methodology/approach: The used research methodology consists in analytical simulation of variations in mass of liquid steel obtained from melts differing in steel scrap content in the metallic charge and statistical analyses of industrial results acquired from the corresponding process documentation (so called melt cards). Findings: Basing on the analytical and statistical analyses carried out we have determine resulting variations in the liquid steel per melt ratios depending on the content of steel scrap in the metallic charge.

By June 1949 VÖEST developed an adaptation of Durrer's process, the LD (Linz-Donawitz) process, (German: LD Verfahren; U.S. names: <b>Oxygen</b> Converter <b>Process,</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Oxygen</b> Furnace <b>Process,</b> BOP, OSM). In December 1949 the VÖEST and the ÖAMG committed to building their first 30-ton oxygen converters. They were put into operation in November 1952 and May 1953 and temporarily created a surge in steel-related research. 34 thousand businesspeople and engineers visited the VÖEST converter by 1963. The LD process reduced processing time and capital costs per ton of steel, contributing to the competitive advantage of Austrian steel. However, errors made by the VÖEST and the ÖAMG management in licensing their technology made control over its adoption elsewhere impossible {{and by the end}} of the 1950s the Austrians lost their competitive edge.|$|R

50|$|The big American {{steelmakers}} {{caught up}} late {{with the new}} technology; the first oxygen converters in the United States were launched {{at the end of}} 1954 by McLouth Steel in Trenton, Michigan, which accounted for less than 1 per cent of the national steel market. U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel introduced the oxygen process only in 1964. By 1970 half of the world's and 80% of Japan's steel output was produced in oxygen converters. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century use of basic oxygen converters for steel production was gradually partially replaced by the electric arc furnace using scrap steel/iron. In Japan the share of LD process decreased from 80% in 1970 to 70% in 2000; worldwide share of the <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>process</b> stabilized at 60%.|$|E

Comprehensive thermodynamic model of <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steel making pro-cess has been developed to predict the bath composition and temperature as well as de-carburization rate dynamically based on relevant blowing process parameters. One of the striking features of this developed model {{is the first time}} prediction of temperature vari-ation depending on evolving bath composition and generated heat from bath composition dependent feasible reactions and their extent. Moreover, this {{numerical model}} does not require off gas analysis to maintain its dynamic nature of prediction. A true attempt for the benefit of steel industry is made for predicting slopping initiation time for particular blowing condition based on correlation with model predicted decarburization rate and critical decarburization rate for bloating of metal droplet. In connection to that, formation of foamy slag and sloping possibility have been studied using thermodynamic modelling followed by multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation technique. The CFD simulation has been carried out taking different turbulence models along with vol-ume of fluid method (VOF) using ANSYS 15. 0 software.

The Bessemer process was so fast (10-20 minutes for a heat) that it allowed little time for chemical analysis or adjustment of the alloying elements in the steel. Bessemer converters did not remove phosphorus efficiently from the molten steel; as low-phosphorus ores became more expensive, conversion costs increased. The process permitted only limited amount of scrap steel to be charged, further increasing costs, especially when scrap was inexpensive. Use of electric arc furnace technology competed favourably with the Bessemer process resulting in its obsolescence.|$|R

40|$|Production of low {{phosphorus}} steel {{using the}} <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking <b>process</b> is conventionally achieved by maintaining a highly basic slag.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{understanding}} the thermodynamic principles influencing the phosphorus partition between slag and steel during steelmaking, particularly during refining of high-phosphorus hot metal using the <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking (BOS) <b>process.</b> Mapping of the slag path {{has been carried out}} using a mass balance model based on input conditions and off-gas analysis, which has been validated by intermediate measurements of slag and metal composition in an industrial <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace (BOF). The slag composition is found to vary over a wide range of basicity (%CaO/%SiO 2) and iron oxide content. The partition of phosphorus increases with progress of refining but reduces during the intermediate period, corresponding to a decrease in iron oxide concentration and formation of “dry slag”. The phosphorus partition ratio increases again {{towards the end of the}} process. The equilibrium partition ratios for such conditions have been theoretically estimated using slag “model(s) ”, based on the estimated slag compositions. It is seen that the partition ratio of phosphorus remains within 45 % – 60 % of the equilibrium value, showing a gradual decrease with progress of the refining process. Equilibrium phosphorus partition ratios for slags containing low concentrations of MnO and Al 2 O 3 have been experimentally determined, over the ranges of basicity and iron oxide concentration approximately corresponding to that observed in the typical BOS process. It is seen that the equilibrium phosphorus partition ratio is practically independent of basicity greater than 2. 5 – 2. 6, over the entire range of temperature and FeOx concentration studied. Variation of the activity of P 2 O 5 with basicity and FeOx concentration has been investigated to explain the trends observed in the variation of phosphorus partition ratio. It is seen that the activity coefficient of P 2 O 5 is lowest, and hence most conducive for removal of phosphorus from steel, over certain finite ranges of basicity and iron oxide concentration. It follows that the efficiency of dephosphorisation is likely to be maximum if the <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking <b>process</b> is operated within these ranges. Simultaneous with this work, mathematical correlations have been developed for estimation of P 2 O 5 activity coefficient and phosphorus partition ratio as functions of slag composition. The correlations are compared with those proposed by earlier workers and are found to result in better predictions over certain composition ranges. QC 2010062...|$|R

Specifically, it calculates, {{for a range of}} energy-intensive processes and products, the product price increases that would be required to maintain unit profits at present levels, based on likely values of allowance prices in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme up to 2020. For most of the energy- and carbon-intensive products considered here, an allowance price of € 20 per tonne of carbon dioxide would require price increases of between 0. 1 to 5 % to maintain profits, assuming full pass-through of the allowance price along the value chain. Doubling the allowance price to € 40 /tonne would double the required increase. The activities that risk being most challenged by the carbon constraint appear to be container glass production using virgin inputs, primary aluminium production, primary steel production based on the <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace <b>process,</b> and some basic chemicals production. However, the analysis has also shown that for many of these cases alternative production processes exist, based on recycled inputs, for example. The cement sector, although very energy- and carbon-intensive, is relatively little exposed to international competition. Indeed, the paper also investigates in how far it would be possible for the affected activities to pass through cost increases to their clients, by analysing their exposure to domestic and international competition. It concludes that the sectors analysed are typically relatively highly concentrated (sometimes even at the world level) and form parts of vertically integrated and locally-clustered value chains. This tends to increase market entry and exit barriers and, thus, {{to reduce the risk of}} large output losses and delocalisation. ...|$|R
