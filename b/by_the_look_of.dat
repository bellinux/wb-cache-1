25|$|In 1961 the XP-755 Mako Shark show car was {{designed}} by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> that very fast fish. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.|$|E

At the 63rd Academy Awards held on March 25, 1991, the song won an Oscar for Best Original Song, awarded to Sondheim. Madonna attended the ceremony along with singer Michael Jackson as her date, and performed [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] onstage, being inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> actress Marilyn Monroe. Madonna also performed the song at her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.|$|E

500|$|With the single's cover art and its {{accompanying}} music video, Madonna {{ushered in}} another image change, inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood actress Jean Harlow. The {{black and white}} video was directed by photographer Melodie McDaniel, who was chosen by the singer due to McDaniel's previous short films. It features Madonna as a singer in a nightclub in Harlem, New York. Interspersed with scenes of daily life in the neighborhood, the video ends with Madonna uniting with her lover and their supposed child. The video sparked academic discussions about what might constitute the lyrical secret of the song. Madonna performed [...] "Secret" [...] on tour {{for the first time}} during her 2001 Drowned World Tour. It was later performed at the Houston stop of her Sticky and Sweet Tour in November 2008 as a fan request, and on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} {{played by}} Vikram were spoofed by Vadivelu in the Tamil film Aaru (2005); the comedy sequence also features four {{songs from the}} film's soundtrack album. Aparichitudu, the film's Telugu version, was parodied by comedian Venu Madhav in the Telugu films Chatrapati (2005) and Seenugadu Chiranjeevi Fan (2005). It was also parodied, along with Chandramukhi, in the film Rajababu (2006). In the 2010 film Thamizh Padam, a full-length parody on stereotypical characters and clichéd sequences in Tamil cinema, the lead actor Shiva recreates the [...] "Anthakoopam" [...] punishment sequence to comic effect, where he tries to force a herd of buffaloes into stampeding a villain but fails in his attempt. Later, the comedy sequence was re-enacted by Allari Naresh in Sudigadu (2012), an official remake of Thamizh Padam. In the 2012 Kannada film Yaare Koogadali, a remake of the Tamil film Poraali (2011), the long and unkempt hair sported by Puneeth Rajkumar was reportedly inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Anniyan. The character Remo inspired Sivakarthikeyan's film to have a title of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|In 1844-5, when Marx was {{starting}} to settle his account with Hegel and the Young Hegelians in his writings, he critiqued the Young Hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique {{of the state and}} civil society as paramount. Indeed, in 1844, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Marx's writings in that period (most famous of which is the [...] "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844", a text that most explicitly elaborated his theory of alienation), Marx's thinking could have taken at least three possible courses: the study of law, religion, and the state; the study of natural philosophy; and the study of political economy.|$|E
