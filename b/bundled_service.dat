40|$|While {{there can}} be {{significant}} benefits for consumers who take broadband bundles, the complexity of communication offers and bundles has made {{it increasingly difficult to}} understand and compare service prices and characteristics. Bundling can provide both benefits and drawbacks to broadband customers. In general, <b>bundled</b> <b>services</b> are less expensive when purchased together and consumer surplus from one good in the bundle can help “subsidise” another less-valued element. Bundling also allows the integration of products in a way that benefits consumers. In other cases bundles can lead to situations where customers are worse off. Consumers may be required to purchase a bundle which contains one product they value and others they do not. Bundling also raises some significant concerns regarding transparency and consumer “lock in”. Bundles may make it difficult or impossible for subscribers to switch providers of certain <b>bundled</b> <b>services</b> and not others. An OECD data collection of over 2 000 offers of stand-alone and <b>bundled</b> <b>services</b> from 90 firms across 30 OECD countries reveals that broadband services in the OECD are overwhelmingly sold as mixed bundles, allowing users to choose among stand-alone offers or <b>bundled</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

Carriers are also acquiring cable infrastructure to complement their own copper ones and seeking cooperation with cable companies. These movements will help expand their business by adding programming and interactive television in the future. Verizon are investing more than $15 billion to upgrade network. Those investments are giving positive results: Verizon’s recent financial reports show it has added 263,000 new television customers and 262,000 net new Internet customers on its new fiber network. Simultaneously, it has grown consumer revenues by about 1 per cent in legacy telecommunications markets with its video and broadband services driving growth.

40|$|Aftermarket {{services}} are considered {{very important and}} are no longer an afterthought within companies. In fact, the aftermarket has turned into {{the main source of}} profit for companies. For OEMs to be able to upgrade and transform their aftermarket supply chains, they must understand what type of supply chain design that is appropriate given the performance requirements of the <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> offers they provide. The current aftermarket supply chain at the case company was not originally designed around the <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> offers, which puts pressure on the case company to adapt their aftermarket supply chain to be able to meet the challenges that the <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> offers put on them. The purpose of this thesis is to study the <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> offers in order to provide recommendations for adaptations of the aftermarket supply chain. In order to deliver the recommendations, an investigation of the key challenges with the aftermarket supply chain in regard to the <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> offers currently offered by the case company will be conducted, as well as a benchmarking study on what other companies identify as supply chain challenges in regard to aftermarket services. The scope of this thesis only includes <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> offers for Volvo Group Trucks in the Nordic market and {{the focus is on the}} offers that impact the aftermarket supply chain, the service contracts. There are three different types of service contracts provided by the case company; Blue, Silver and Gold. The content in the service contracts differs, which puts different demands on availability of spare parts. This thesis has contributed to the area of aftermarket supply chains when it comes to the understanding of how to achieve operational excellence through operationalization of service strategies. The conclusion is that from a physical handling perspective, the current aftermarket supply chain at the case company is considered sufficient, but some adaptations could be made to further improve it. Furthermore, the operational and organizational principles in terms of administrative handling of the current aftermarket supply chain can be improved. The recommendations consists of five areas of improvements. The first recommendation is prioritization of availability of critical spare parts according to service contract orders. This implies that the contract prioritization should be included in the current order classes, and the orders should be prioritized according to the service contracts. The second recommendation is prioritizing suppliers according to criticality, which means that suppliers supplying critical parts should be prioritized higher than the ones supplying less critical parts. The third recommendation is implementing local hubs close to the dealers, that serve more than one dealer in the area. This means that critical parts would be stored at the local hubs providing improved availability to meet the requirements of the service contracts. The fourth recommendation is to measure the total lead-time from order placed until delivered as a KPI to improve customer satisfaction. The last recommendation is improving internal information sharing between the functions sales and materials management when designing the service contracts, but also when supplying the spare parts...|$|E

Rice and Stanton (2003) estimate that payments revenue accounts for approximately 16 percent of operating revenue. According to Rice (2003), payments activities affect the value of the banking franchise and estimates of profit efficiency. A cross-section of bankers surveyed by Kellogg (2003) indicates four key concerns related to emerging payments technologies: changing delivery channels and safeguards, fraud, vendor oversight and operational risk measurement and reporting. Lemieux (2003) identifies network vulnerabilities as having resiliency implications. These five studies highlight how income from payments activities is becoming a significant portion of banks ’ revenue and show that the lines between banks and nonbanks are becoming increasingly blurred...|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of FM service {{delivery}} models ranging from in-house provision to total outsourcing, operating in the UK market. The portfolio of FM services and the range of options relating to the various combinations of service delivery have sparked many discussions and debates over the merits of certain modes of service delivery. Underpinning this circumstance, this research attempted to understand and explore how facilities management services in UK shopping centres have been managed and services delivered. This includes looking at how shopping centre managers determined the best options of FM service delivery in the shopping centres. As the research identified the dilemma of shopping centre managers, it aimed to develop an effective decision-making framework for assisting the shopping centre managers to select the best options of FM service delivery prior to the tendering process. This research adopted a quantitative approach to investigating facilities management services in UK shopping centres as well as determining the best options of FM service delivery. A questionnaire survey was used to investigate the current practiced of FM service delivery in UK shopping centres. Apart from that, it will also investigate shopping centres managers' perceptions towards the factors and criteria in assessing the best options of FM service delivery. Meanwhile, in developing the decision-making framework, this research introduced the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as an alternative decision-making model as providing a basis of methodological framework for the selection of the best options of FM service delivery in UK shopping centres which is known as Facilities Management Outsourcing Selection System (FMOSS). The implementation and validation of this decision-making framework has been carried through the series of evaluation by using the pair wise comparison in the Expert Choice system and evaluation form. Those evaluations have been carried out by the selected shopping centres managers. The main findings of this research have identified that in UK shopping centres the current provisions of FM services in the majority are practicing outsourcing. In the meantime, the current options available of FM service delivery being practiced are single service contracts and <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> contract. Based on FMOSS decision-making framework the results indicated that <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> contract is the best option of FM service delivery in UK shopping centres. This is because <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> contracts have resulted more in potential benefits and less in potential risks when compared to single service contracts. The factors that influenced the decision-making are favourable on cost and financial factors. Finally, this research has achieved the aim and the objectives of the study. This research has significance in helping the facilities management industry to understand more about the perceptions of shopping centres industry and theirs requirements towards FM services in shopping centres in order to deliver quality, innovative, cost effective and best in value services. A side of that, the FMOSS decision-making framework has significance in assisting the shopping centres managers in making the best selection of FM service delivery in shopping centres prior to tendering process; it is also provides the basis for a methodological framework for selecting the best options of FM service delivery in UK shopping centres and gives management of shopping centres an alternative approach to determine the best options of FM service delivery as well as improving their existing decision making process. This framework is identified as an original contribution of this research and would be beneficial to the shopping centres managers in making better decisions.

40|$|Although various {{emerging}} {{technologies have}} been launched, they present limitations {{as far as}} offering full-scale ubiquitous services independently is concerned. In view of this fact, service providers are likely to provide bundled services among possible combinations of services. Indeed, making a timely decision regarding the value maximization of <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> {{is directly related to}} service providers' future growth and success in the turbulent market environment. This paper aims to find the optimal service bundle among five emerging mobile services: T-DMB, S-DMB, WiBro, HSDPA, and Telematics. Considering what kinds of service features among the five emerging services offer differentiation to customers, we examine four attributes (TV, voice, portable wireless internet, and location-based services) using conjoint analysis to distinguish the service features. Our results show that TV service is the most favored among the attributes, followed by voice service in second position, and the internet and location-based service in third and fourth place respectively. Our result implies that mobile operators would be better off bundling HSDPA and S-DMB first, and then adding other services later, while fixed operators would be better off bundling WiBro and S-DMB first and other services later. ...|$|E

In particular, it examines the role of firms' strategies in affecting {{the intensity of}} usage {{and the degree of}} substitution/complementarity between VoIP and other communications means. It investigates the importance of firms' strategies and compares pure players with the network-based operators, in order to understand whether the existence of bundling offerings as opposed to very low prices may drive consumers of specific companies to use the service more intensively. The results show that, once the control for the characteristics of VoIP providers is included, the customers of telecom operators are more likely to use intensively VoIP services, suggesting that the subscription to <b>bundled</b> <b>service</b> can attract consumers to value added services. Furthermore, those who use frequently VoIP services exploit the PC-to-telephone and Phone-to-Phone functionality suggesting that usage intensity is associated with a higher sophistication of the users more than with the existence of local effects on PC-to-PC applications. Finally, age and work conditions also play a role with respect to the intensity of VoIP usage. Consumers' adoption Telecom operators' strategies VoIP services...|$|E
