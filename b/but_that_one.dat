This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle {{initially}} reacted angrily to {{news of the}} Royal Navy’s {{attack on}} the French fleet (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him “astonishingly objective” and acknowledging {{that it was the}} right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown “a splendid dignity”. In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the “pain and anger” caused by the attack and that it was a “hateful tragedy not a glorious battle”, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> day the enemy would have used the ships against England (sic) or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean “bondage forever” for France. “Our two ancient nations … remain bound to one another.

John Lindow is skeptical of there having been a belief in Eir as a goddess, stating that [...] "whether we should trust Snorri and imagine the existence of a goddess Eir is problematic". Rudolf Simek says that Eir may originally have been simply a valkyrie rather than a goddess, and lists the servant of Menglöð by the same name as a separate figure.|$|E
500|$|The story {{within a}} story drama The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) was Streep's first leading role. The film paired Streep with Jeremy Irons as {{contemporary}} actors, telling their modern story, {{as well as}} the Victorian era drama they were performing. Streep perfected an English accent for the part, but considered herself a misfit for the role: [...] " [...] I couldn't help wishing that I was more beautiful". A New York magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a [...] "chameleon", willing to play any type of role. Streep was awarded a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work. The following year, she reunited with Robert Benton for the psychological thriller, Still of the Night (1982), co-starring Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, noted that the film was an homage to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep [...] "is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough".|$|E

The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a [...] "family farewell,... almost like an English picnic", with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Kaddish, the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. Among those who gave eulogies were Terry Semel, Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate.

World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void.

500|$|Monday 10 May {{saw another}} day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to {{continue}} negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. At 5.00pm that afternoon Brown {{announced that he would}} step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to [...] "sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election." [...] The statement went on to say, [...] "I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post {{by the time of the}} Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate." [...] He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but many in the Party felt that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, [...] "I don't think it makes sense in the arithmetic–the numbers don't add up." [...] However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis – who participated in the talks – writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. [...] " [...] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences".|$|E
