40|$|Photograph of a Caterpillar Sixty {{snow plow}} {{clearing}} snow in Sequoia National Park, 1931. A dirt strip cleared of snow winds {{around the edge}} of a snow-covered mound on the right with the plow widening the strip at center. A large mound of snow still stands on the left with snow-dusted boulders further down {{along the side of the}} strip. Tall, thin spruce trees stand shade the snow in the background. Photoprint reads: "Received from Doyle. In beautiful Sequoia National Park, California, this 'Caterpillar' Sixty equipped with <b>back</b> <b>filler</b> blade is engaged in clearing snow from the roadways"...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a worker}} {{refueling}} a "Caterpiller" Sixty snow plow in Sequoia National Park, 1931. The plow stands is {{parked in the}} snow at center {{with a wave of}} snow caught in the bide blade in front. A man wearing work boots and gloves stands {{on the side of the}} plow holding the long gasoline tube which extends from the wooden station on the left. A massive tree stands on the right with relatively thin trees standing over the snow in the background. Photoprint reads: "Received from Doyle. In beautiful Sequoia National Park, California, this 'Caterpillar' Sixty equipped with <b>back</b> <b>filler</b> blade is engaged in clearing snow from the roadways. Here the Sixty takes on gasoline at a park station"...|$|E

50|$|Composite {{bearings}} can be customized to {{meet the}} individual requirements of many applications, such as wear- or high-temperature resistance. The weight of the composite bearing can vary depending on its backing. The PTFE liner can be applied on steel or aluminum <b>backing.</b> Through <b>filler</b> compounds, various properties of the composite bearing, such as resistance to creep, wear and electrical conductivity, can be optimized.|$|R
50|$|Dot first {{appeared}} in 1949 as a supporting feature in Sad Sack and by 1953 was given her own series, joining Harvey's growing cast of child-oriented comedy characters. The title lasted almost three decades between 1949 and 1982, and then sporadically until 1994. Dot introduced several other popular headliners (including Little Lotta and Richie Rich) as <b>back</b> page <b>fillers.</b> Another spinoff title which ran for thirteen years was Little Dot's Uncles & Aunts, about the adventures of Dot's impossibly extended family, each with an obsessive interest or quirky personality trait of their own.|$|R

This filler has been evaluated for mechanical properties such as tensile strength and four point bending strength, {{and it has been}} found best suitable for skin foam bonding. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the supply of micro flller from foreign sources was stopped. Causing a major set <b>back</b> alternate <b>filler,</b> therefore had to be found and to the project progress report presents the results on comparative evaluation of fie micro Vs an alternative indigenous available filler called Erosil...|$|R

Seal includes alumina <b>filler</b> <b>backed</b> by metal plate. Alumina-filled envelope is easily handled and installed, {{and can be used}} in high-temperature industrial processes like coal gasification and liquefaction...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of back {{pressure on the}} front cavity design of Muffler PSS- X 1 {{has been done by}} using the four microphones spectral decomposition method. The design consists of single perforated baffle design (SPB) and multiple perforated baffle (MPB) design. The test is did by using a tube test tool of impedance B&K 4206 and four microphones of B&K with type 4187 (2) and type 4189 (2). Those tools are connected to B&K multi-analyzer pulse by using computer control to get data of back pressure on the front cavity design of muffler PSS-X 1 at the frequency range 0 Hz – 6500 Hz. The result of research shows that configuration 6 with specific design of prototype 1, filler both cavity 1 and cavity 2 is the best work of back pressure. Design and configuration variation give great contribution on the different scores for the resulted <b>back</b> pressure. <b>Filler</b> contribution shows on the declining of back pressure score and the range of frequency of it gets wider with the low back pressure score. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{laboratory tests}} of arc-welded T-joints between equal width rectangular hollow sections (called “matched box connections” in ANSI/AWS D 1. 1 - 2000 Structural Welding Code). The brace and chord members were cold-formed with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa. The welds were laid using MMAW and GMAW processes without profiling the brace ends. The brace of each specimen was loaded in tension to failure with the chord supported continuously {{so as not}} to induce significant bending effects. The test results showed that the joint strength can be improved by using backing strips for the butt (or groove) welds, while <b>backing</b> rods (or <b>filler</b> rods) should not be used as they led to larger variation in joint strengths, and often, inferior strengths. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the IIW Recommendations and Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8. It is shown that for cold-formed tubes with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa (or above), a design check on the strength of the butt (or groove) weld is required in addition to the checks on the strengths of the chord and brace members specified in the current design guidelines. An equation is proposed for calculating the strength of the weld...|$|R
5000|$|All Star Fresh. As {{performer}} and producer {{he is very}} well known as KING BEE. With his second floor <b>filler</b> <b>Back</b> By Dope Demand he scored {{one of the biggest}} hiphop hits. In the Netherlands it resulted in a Top 3 position. Best Dance Product by The Edison Awards in the Netherlands. (The Edison Awards is an award by the Dutch Music Industry.) This also meant that with this title, he was the first black artist to win this award in the Netherlands. After that he appeared as supporting act for Madonnas show in the Netherlands. All Star Fresh kept entering the dance floors. The last titles mentioned were also worldwide hits, selling over 2.4 million copies. He didn't only work within projects like King Bee or Capella, but also was featuring famous production teams like Snap (I Got the Power). This teamwork resulted in the single Lets Get Busy (Clubland Quarts feat Snap [...] King Bee). This record ended up No 01 in the Billboard Dance Charts (United States). Other productions were Deepzone [...] "It's Gonna Be All right", a straight up club anthem even until today. Kellee- my love, Ty Holden- you're my Inspiration and His Royal Freshness- They don't understand are a couple of other productions in this line.|$|R
