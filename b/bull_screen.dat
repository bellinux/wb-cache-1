40|$|Aim: A {{serological}} {{survey for}} the detection of Foot and Mouth Disease virus antibodies in trade cattle was conducted todetermine the seroprevalence of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the Kwara state of Nigeria. Materials and Methods: Across-sectional study based on convenient sampling for bovine blood was carried out in 5 cattlemarkets (Offa, Bode Sadu, Ilesha baruba, Ilorin, Ajasse) across five local government areas in Kwara State amongst cattle withunknown history of FMD vaccination over a period of August-September-October, 2011. The sera obtained were screenedusing NS-Blocking ELISAkit (PRIOCHECKR). Results: Out of the 450 cattle (268 cows and 182 <b>bulls)</b> <b>screened</b> for FMD antibodies, sero-positivity was highest amongstcows 62. 13 %. Percentage distribution of sero-positive reactors by location showed Ilesha baruba, Ilorin and Offa had 27. 14 %, 23. 80 % and 13. 33 % respectively, while seropositivity amongst bulls was 37. 86 %, highest occurrence in Offa 30. 46 % andleast in Ilesha baruba 14. 84 %. FMD carriers according to breeds showed 77. 21 % white Fulani (Bunaji) was positive over theother breeds. The sex, location and breed was significant by chi square p< 0. 05. FMD seropositivity according to age indicatedyoung cattle within 6 months- 2 years group had the highest occurrence 75. 14 % over the adult group 24. 85 %. Conclusion: The occurrence thus confirms FMD endemicity and susceptibility of all sex, ages, and various breed ofunvaccinated trade cattle especially amongst white Fulani, young cows within the local markets and those from neighboringWest African countries. Thus, circulating FMDV strains responsible for this seropositivity should be established in order todesign appropriate control strategy to limit FMD effect...|$|R
40|$|Fertility {{traits are}} the most {{economically}} important traits in beef cattle {{and in spite of}} having low heritabilities they ought to be included in breeding programs. The genetic selection programs in Spain are based on improving growth traits, neglecting the fertility traits up to now. In this study, a first analysis of the calving interval between first and second parities (CI 12) was carried out to establish a suitable selection criterion. The selected breeds were two local breeds Avileña-Negra Ibérica (ANI) and Retinta (RT), raised in extensive production with natural mating. Two models including cow and bull effects were studied. –Systematic effects were herd-year-season of first calving, age of cow at first calving and age of bull at second calving and regressions on inbreeding coefficients for cows and bulls. Then, a full model (FULL) included additive genetic and permanent environmental components for bull and an additive genetic effect for cows. A reduced model (RED) was the same as FULL but with the additive genetic component for bull excluded. Both models provided similar estimates of systematic and cow additive genetic components. Inbreeding depression was found for bulls (0. 79 and 0. 83 days/ % inbreeding in ANI and RT, respectively) but nearly null regression coefficients on inbreeding were obtained for cows. In both breeds, heritability estimates were 0. 05 for cows. For FULL, heritability estimates for bull effects were larger than the cows heritability, 0. 08 for ANI and 0. 10 for RT. The bull permanent component was large, with values of 0. 20 and 0. 31 for ANI and RT, respectively. Herd fertility in these populations can be substantially improved by <b>bulls</b> <b>screening.</b> Genetic selection can be practiced but with low efficiency, as it is commonly the case for fertility trait...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High {{rates of}} genetic gain canbe {{achieved}} through (1) accurate predictions of breedingvalues (2) high intensities of selection and (3) shorter generation intervals. Reliabilities of ~ 60 % are currently achievable using genomic selection in dairy cattle. This breakthroughmeans that selection of animals can happen {{at a very}} early age (i. e. as soon as aDNAsample is available) and has opened opportunities to radically redesign breeding schemes. Most research over the past decade has focussed on the feasibility of genomic selection, especially how to increase the accuracy of genomic breeding values. More recently, how to apply genomic technology to breeding schemes has generated a lot of interest. Some of this research remains the intellectual property of breeding companies, but there are examples in the public domain. Here we review published research intobreeding schemedesignusinggenomic selection andevaluatewhichdesigns appear tobepromising (in termsof rates of genetic gain) and those that may have unfavourable side-effects (i. e. increasing the rate of inbreeding). The schemes range from fairly conservative designs where <b>bulls</b> are <b>screened</b> genomically to reduce numbers entering progeny testing, to schemes where very large numbers of <b>bull</b> calves are <b>screened</b> and used as sires as soon as they reach sexual maturity. More radical schemes that incorporate the use of reproductive technologies (in juveniles) and genomic selection in nucleus herds are alsodescribed. Themodels used are either deterministic andmore recently tend tobe stochastic, simulatingpopulationsof cattle. A key driver of the rate of genetic gain is the generation interval, which could range from being similar to that in conventional testing (~ 5 years), down to as little as 1. 5 years. Generally, the rate of genetic gain is between 12 % and 100...|$|R

40|$|Objective markers to {{identify}} higher fertility individuals {{are needed to}} maximize livestock breeding success. Two heparin-binding proteins, which are reflective of fertility in bulls, have been biochemically identified as fertility-associated antigen (FAA) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 2 (TIMP- 2). These four studies were designed to examine the importance of those proteins in relation to reproduction in bulls and other livestock species. In the first study, indirect immuno-fluorescent microscopy was performed to localize FAA and TIMP- 2 to livestock sperm. FAA was localized on spermatozoal acrosomes of bulls and rams, but no cross-reactivity was observed for stallions. TIMP- 2 labeling was observed on acrosomes and posterior heads, which was species dependent. Localization patterns for FAA and TIMP- 2 were further investigated during heparin-induced capacitation and acrosome reactions of bovine sperm. In study two, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to determine concentrations of FAA in bovine seminal plasma (SP). A commercially available TIMP- 2 ELISA was utilized to quantify TIMP- 2. Respective mean concentrations of FAA and TIMP- 2 in SP were 6. 66  1. 487 ug/ml and 1. 18  0. 045 mg/ml. Concentrations of FAA in SP did not correspond to bull fertility potential, however, older bulls with higher concentrations of TIMP- 2 in SP sired more calves. The third study evaluated utility of an amplified fragment length polymorphism with bovine TIMP- 2 gene specific primers to amplify a 700 bp genomic DNA (gDNA) product from sperm. From 53 <b>bulls</b> <b>screened,</b> 22. 6 % were negative for the 700 bp amplicon. There was a three-fold likelihood for 700 bp negative bulls to not sire a calf compared to 700 bp positive bulls. The product was cloned and sequenced, but no homology to TIMP- 2 was detected. Therefore, the product represented novel bovine gDNA sequence. The fourth study identified an equine homologue to the bovine FAA gene. Immuno-based diagnostics had not detected FAA in stallion semen. The equine DNA homologue was 88. 5 % identical in nucleotide and 86 % in amino acid sequences to bovine FAA. Subtle differences in the amino acid sequence are likely responsible for the inability to detect FAA in stallion semen with FAA antibodies to bovine FAA...|$|R

To do this Alocasia sanderiana <b>Bull.</b> was <b>screened</b> for qualitative phytochemical tests including thin layer chromatography. Aside from the crude extract from the Rotary evaporator three fractions from the plant were prepared using methanol dichloromethane DCM and hexane. The 4 solvent extracts were then evaluated for antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion method on 18 strains of organisms. About this study it was found out that triterpenes tannins and saponins are present during phytochemical screening. Zones of inhibitions during the antimicrobial tests were observed but did not reach the desired zone for antimicrobial activity. The DCM fraction produced 4 mm zone against Proteus mirabilis 3 mm for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 mm for Pectobacterium carotovorum and 1 mm for Candida albicans. The methanol fraction also produced a 1 mm zone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Materials and Methods: A total of 195 samples including 89 blood samples, 89 serum samples and 17 milk samples were collected and analysed by isolation and identification, Polymerase chain Reaction (PCR), Milk Ring Test (MRT), Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), Standard Tube Agglutination Test (STAT) and Enzyme Linked Immnuno-Sorbent assay ELISA). Results: On analysis, all the 89 blood and 17 milk samples turned out to be negative for culture and PCR. MRT and ELISA tests on all the 17 milk samples and STAT on all the 89 serum samples were also negative. The percent positives for Brucella antibodies in serum samples were 4. 5 and 6. 7 by RBPT and ELISA, respectively. Of the 17 vaccinated animals, 14 were negative by all the Brucella antigen and antibody diagnostic tests employed.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to detect new polymorphisms in the bovine ß-lactoglobulin (ß-LG) gene with {{significant}} effects on ß-LG protein concentration. Genomic DNA samples from 22 proven <b>bulls</b> were <b>screened</b> for polymorphisms in the coding and promoter regions of the ß-LG gene. In total, 50 polymorphisms were detected. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (g. 1772 G>A and g. 3054 C>T) lead to amino acid changes and are the causal genetic polymorphisms of ß-LG protein variants A and B. Forty-two polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with ß-LG protein variants A and B. Any of these 42 polymorphisms can {{be involved in the}} differential expression of the respective A and B alleles of the ß-LG gene. The eight polymorphisms not in complete LD with ß-LG protein variants A and B and the two polymorphisms causing the amino acid changes were genotyped in a set of 208 cows: 106 animals homozygous for ß-LG protein variant A and 102 animals homozygous for ß-LG protein variant B. Of these eight polymorphisms, six SNPs segregated only within the cows homozygous for ß-LG protein variant A and two SNPs segregated only within the cows homozygous for ß-LG protein variant B. One of the eight polymorphisms had a significant effect on ß-LG protein concentration. This SNP, g. - 731 G>A, segregated only within the 106 cows homozygous for ß-LG protein variant A.

40|$|The {{development}} of routine on-ranch bull testing coincided with technical advances in bull electro-ejaculation (EE) which permitted safe, relatively effective, semen collection of un-handled bulls. Approximately 50 years ago, the Rocky Mountain Society for the Study of Fertility in Bulls (RMSSFB) was formed "to share and disseminate the essentials {{for evaluation of}} beef bulls for fertility and to standardize procedures". A landmark report (Carroll et al 1963) on 10, 940 bulls examined showed that on-ranch bull "fertility " testing was feasible.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bovine genital campylobacteriosis (BGC) presents significant challenges, as traditional methods lack sensitivity when prolonged {{transport of samples}} is required. Assays of preputial samples by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provide good sensitivity and high throughput capabilities. However, there is limited information on the acceptable duration of transport and temperature during transport of samples. In addition, the use of pooled samples {{has proven to be}} a valuable strategy for the {{diagnosis of}} other venereal diseases in cattle. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effect of sample pooling and of transport time and temperature on the clinical sensitivity of a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis in preputial samples from beef bulls. Eight infected bulls and 176 virgin yearling bulls were used as the source of samples. The qPCR sensitivity was comparable for unpooled samples and pools of 5 samples, whereas sensitivity was decreased for pools of 10 samples. Sensitivity for the various pool sizes improved with repeated sampling. For shorter-term transport (2 and 48 h), sensitivity was greatest when the samples were stored at 4 °C and 30 °C, whereas for longer-term transport (96 h) sensitivity was greatest when the samples were stored at − 20 °C. The creation of pools of 5 samples is therefore a good option to decrease costs when <b>screening</b> <b>bulls</b> for BGC with the qPCR assay of direct preputial samples. Ideally the samples should be stored at 4 °C and arrive at the laboratory within 48 h of collection, but when that is not possible freezing at − 20 °C could minimize the loss of sensitivity. © 2015, Brazilian Statistical Association.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate a genomic breeding scheme in a small dairy cattle population that was intermediate in terms of using both young bulls (YB) and progeny-tested bulls (PB). This scheme was compared with a conventional progeny testing program without use of genomic information and, as the extreme case, a juvenile scheme with genomic information, where all bulls were used before progeny information was available. The population structure, cost, and breeding plan parameters were chosen to reflect the Danish Jersey cattle population, being representative for a small dairy cattle population. The population consisted of 68, 000 registered cows. Annually, 1, 500 <b>bull</b> dams were <b>screened</b> to produce the 500 genotyped bull calves from which 60 YB were selected to be progeny tested. Two unfavorably correlated traits were included in the breeding goal, a production trait (h 2 = 0. 30) and a functional trait (h 2 = 0. 04). An increase in reliability of 5 percentage points for each trait was used in the default genomic scenario. A deterministic approach was used to model the different breeding programs, where the primary evaluation criterion was annual monetary genetic gain (AMGG). Discounted profit was used as an indicator of the economic outcome. We investigated the effect of varying the following parameters: (1) increase in reliability due to genomic information, (2) number of genotyped bull calves, (3) proportion of bull dam sires that are young bulls, and (4) proportion of cow sires that are young bulls. The genomic breeding scheme was both genetically and economically superior to the conventional breeding scheme, even in a small dairy cattle population where genomic information causes a relatively low increase in reliability of breeding values. Assuming low reliabilities of genomic predictions, the optimal breeding scheme according to AMGG was characterized by mixed use of YB and PB as bull sires. Exclusive use of YB for production cows increased AMGG up to 3 percentage points. The results from this study supported our hypothesis that strong interaction effects exist. The strongest interaction effects were obtained between increased reliabilities of genomic estimated breeding values and more intensive use of YB. The juvenile scheme was genetically inferior when the increase in reliability was low (5 percentage points), but became genetically superior at higher reliabilities of genomic estimated breeding values. The juvenile scheme was always superior according to discounted profit because of the shorter generation interval and minimizing costs for housing and feeding waiting bulls...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Over 20 years ago, {{research}} was underway to develop methods for {{in vitro fertilization}} utilizing bovine sperm and eggs. Freshly ejaculated sperm cannot fertilize an egg. Those sperm must reside in the female reproductive tract for 6 - 8 h and become diluted from seminal fluid. That process is called capacitation because it allows sperm to acquire the “capacity” to fertilize an egg. The final change sperm cells undergo after capacitation involves a morphological remodeling with release of enzymes packaged in {{the tip of the}} sperm head’s acrosome. This irreversible remodeling is known as the acrosome reaction. All of these events had to be controlled in the lab to successfully fertilize eggs from cows. Proteins produced in the seminal vesicles, prostate, and Cowper’s glands convey the capacitating effects of heparin, a carbohydrate, to bull sperm. Those proteins are collectively referred to a heparin-binding proteins because they function as “docking’ molecules to allow heparin to physically attach to the sperm, causing capacitation. Heparin per se is not found in the female reproductive tract. However, several other heparin-like carbohydrates do exist, and heparin mimics their normal biological action. One specific heparin binding protein has been named fertility-associated antigen (FAA). For the past 13 years, research has focused specifically on FAA, its identity, the ability to detect it in semen, and field trials comparing fertility of bulls classified as FAA-positive or FAA-negative. Trials included multiple-sire pastures with or without parentage of calves being confirmed by DNA testing. Herds have utilized A. I. in some instances, and serving capacity was also evaluated one year before bulls were allocated to pastures. Field Trials Comparing Bulls Categorized as FAA-Positive or FAA-Negative Since 1992, field trials have been conducted in Texas, Nebraska and California to compare prolificacy of bulls that produced semen classified as FAA-positive or FAA-negative. Multiple-sire pastures: Table 1 contains data from 7 consecutive years of field trials at King Ranch. When bulls were 14 - 19 mo. of age, FAA status was determined after they passed a breeding soundness exam. All pastures contained 8 - 16 bulls for 60 d at a constant ratio of 1 bull per 25 cows. Overall, FAA-positive bulls were 19 percentage points more fertile than their FAA-negative herdmates. FAA was quantified in the Ax lab at the University of Arizona. Serving capacity and FAA: The ability of a bull to breed cows can be estimated as “serving capacity. ” This is ordinarily evaluated by placing a group of virgin bulls with heifers that were synchronized to be in heat. Mounts with penetration are scored for each bull over a period of 20 min. Bulls are then ranked as “high” or “low” in that social setting. FAA-positive bulls with high serving capacity impregnated 87 % of cows exposed to them for a 60 d breeding season. FAA positive bulls with low serving capacity only impregnated 69 % of the exposed cows. Bulls with semen lacking FAA but with high serving capacity impregnated 78 % of the cows pastured with them. Therefore, their libido was able to compensate for the absence of FAA, but they were inferior to herdmates with high serving capacity possessing seminal FAA (Table 2). FAA was measured in the University of Arizona Lab. A. I. outcomes: With A. I., serving capacity is not an issue because cows are inseminated when they are in estrus. Holstein heifers and range beef cows were inseminated once with semen from mixed breeds of beef bulls designated as FAA-positive (n= 18) or FAA-negative (n= 7). Overall, there was a 16 % higher fertility in females inseminated with FAA-positive semen (66 % pregnancy rate) compared to FAA-negative semen (50 % pregnancy rate, Table 3). The University of Arizona Lab analyzed semen for FAA content. Efficiency of the cow herd: What does selection for FAA-positive bulls do for the cow herd? Research obtained from 1992 through 1998 at King Ranch indicated that the distribution of calves born during the calving season shifted to births occurring earlier (Table 4). In the nucleus herd, cows were initially bred only to FAA-positive bulls. Their replacement daughters were also only bred to FAA-positive bulls in subsequent generations. By 1998, 22 % more calves were born in the first 20 days of the calving season from this FAA selection management practice (Table 4). Clearly, efficiency in the cow herd had improved. DNA parentage of calves: In a collaboration with Drs. Dave and Cindy Daley and Harris Ranches, FAA status of bulls was determined using a newly developed chute-side cassette. Those bulls were in multiple-sire pastures with cows for a 60 -day breeding season in 3 consecutive breeding years (2000, 2001, 2002). The trial was conducted to relate parentage of calves by DNA fingerprinting to growth and carcass traits of individual sires. Analysis of FAA status became a retrospective comparison to evaluate utility of the cassettes to analyze semen for FAA within 20 minutes. Results from this study are being analyzed. Overall, 12 out of 62 total bulls were found to be FAA-negative. This was close to the incidence found in a population of 914 <b>bulls</b> <b>screened</b> in 6 states in April, 2003. In those bulls, 26 % were FAA-negative using the same test cassette to quantify FAA in semen. With the Harris Ranch bulls, complete DNA profiles were achieved with 47 of the 62 bulls. Overall, as bulls got older, they sired more calves per bull (1. 1 as yearlings to 22. 2 as 5 -year old breeding bulls). Irrespective of age, FAA-positive bulls produced 5. 9 more calves in the 3 years (1. 9 calves/year) compared to FAA-negative herdmates. That translated into a 19 % higher calf production for FAA-positive bulls for the 3 -year duration of the trial (Table 5). There was clearly an age influence in terms of calf production in relation to FAA status of bulls. As yearlings and 5 -year olds, FAA status did not factor into calf yield. However, between the ages of 2 and 4, each FAA-positive bull averaged 35. 4 total calves, whereas his FAA-negative herdmates produced 27. 3 total calves in that period of time. Therefore, the FAA-negative bulls were 77 % as prolific as their FAA-positive contemporaries based upon those numbers. From ages 1 through 3 years, a higher proportion of FAA-negative bulls were more likely to not sire any calves compared to FAA-positive bulls. In other words, sterility of a bull in a given year corresponded to FAA status of bulls 3 years old or younger. CONCLUSION FAA is a good thing! Fertility data support that regardless of years, pasture, or breed, the FAA positive bulls resulted in a higher percentage of cows pregnant compared to FAA negative herdmates. A conservative estimate places pregnancy rates 15 % higher in heifers or cows bred to FAA positive bulls. The calving season should also tighten up if daughters are retained from FAA positive bulls and are bred to known FAA positive bulls. In tern, daughters in subsequent generations need to be bred to FAA positive bulls, and that practice should continue. FAA testing only takes 20 minutes and is based upon visible detection of a reddish-purple line on a plastic cassette that contains all the necessary chemicals to detect FAA if it is in a semen sample. The projected payback per cow in a herd from testing for FAA in bulls will be 16 to - 25 fold if net profit per calf is $ 50. 00. Obviously, if profit per cow exceeds $ 50. 00, then the value of testing for FAA increases substantially. For more information, pricing, and to order testing kits, contact: ReproTec, Inc.

40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} virus (LSDV), a {{poxvirus}} {{that belongs to}} the genus Capripoxvirus is an important pathogen that can be shed in the semen of infected <b>bulls.</b> The <b>screening</b> of semen for infectious virus prior to artificial insemination requires a sensitive diagnostic method. The isolation of the virus on cell cultures and/or the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are sensitive diagnostic tests {{which can be used}} to screen semen for LSD viral DNA prior to artificial insemination. Although cell culture is a sensitive method and detects infectious virus, its use has major limitations due to the toxic effect of semen on the cells. This study was therefore aimed at finding a method that decreases the toxic effect of semen on cell culture and enhances LSDV isolation. Secondly, the efficiency of this method in enhancing the isolation of LSDV in field samples was tested. In order to eliminate the toxic effect of semen on cell culture, a pilot study was conducted in which semen samples from LSDV sero-negative bulls were collected and infected with a field isolate of LSDV, strain 248 / 93 with a titre of 6. 5 log TCID 50. The semen samples were subjected to one of four different methods, viz centrifugation, serial dilution, filtration and chemical treatment with kaolin. The centrifugation, serial dilution, and filtration methods were supplemented with additional amounts of gentamycin. The toxic effects of semen on cell culture were completely eliminated when supernatants of semen samples, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1, 3 and 5 mins and serial diluted was used to inoculate confluent monolayers of bovine dermis cells. Semen diluted in MEM with or without additional antibiotics was the most sensitive method of demonstrating virus at higher dilutions, followed by pellets of samples centrifuged for 1 and 3 minutes. The toxicity recorded when the pellet fraction of semen samples were centrifuged for 5 mins at 2000 rpm was comparable to results obtained from serially diluted samples supplemented with gentamycin. The use of filtration and kaolin treatment of semen samples could not remove the toxic effect of semen on cells. To evaluate the presence of LSDV in semen of experimentally infected bulls, six seronegative post-pubertal bulls housed in an insect proof facility were infected with LSDV via the intravenous route. The experimentally infected bulls were monitored for clinical sign of the disease. Two bulls showed severe, two a mild and two an inapparent infection. Blood samples were collected for virus isolation and semen samples for virus isolation and PCR. Vesicular fluid and preputial washes were also investigated for the presence of LSD viral nucleic acid using PCR. The infectious titre of the virus shed in semen of these bulls was also calculated. The incubation period in infected bulls varied from 7 to 14 days. The length of viraemia varied between groups and did not correlate with the severity of clinical disease. The virus was isolated from blood samples of bulls in the severely infected group on several occasions. Bulls in the mildly infected group had the lowest rate of isolated virus when compared to those with inapparent infection. The use of supernatants of centrifuged serial diluted semen samples, as shown in the pilot study, have considerably reduced the toxic effect of semen on cell culture. This method was used to test field samples for its sensitivity to isolated LSDV in semen of experimentally infected bulls with PCR as a gold standard. In all the semen samples tested using supernatants of semen samples LSDV was isolated in 53. 1 % of the samples on cell culture while in the serial diluted samples, only 28. 1 % of samples were positive with a median time of detection on cell culture of 4 and 8 days, respectively. The use of the supernatant fraction was able to detect infectious LSDV in semen samples for prolonged periods with reduced time of development of cytopathic effect, than previously reported. In order to compare the sensitivity of PCR and virus isolation, PCR positive and a few negative samples were subjected to virus isolation using the centrifugation method developed in the pilot study. The PCR was able to detect LSD viral nucleic acids in some semen samples even when virus could not be isolated on cell culture. The PCR was also able to detect viral nucleic acid in vesicular fluid and preputial washes of infected bulls. The titre of the virus shed in the semen at a certain stage of the infection was calculated to be 3 log TCID 50. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of a complete reduction of the toxic effect of semen on cell culture and increase chances of LSDV isolation with reduced detection time when semen samples are processed using the centrifugation method as described in the pilot study. Furthermore, it showed PCR was more sensitive than virus isolation in the detection of LSD viral nucleic acid in semen samples and can be used for routine diagnosis. However, virus isolation must be used when the infective nature of virus shed in semen is desirable. This study provides the first evidence of the shedding of LSDV nucleic acid in vesicular fluid and preputial washes of experimentally infected bulls. It also represents the first report that a considerable amount of LSDV is shed in semen of experimentally infected bulls, which may be infective at certain stages of clinical disease. Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a poxvirus that belongs to the genus Capripoxvirus is an important pathogen that can be shed in the semen of infected <b>bulls.</b> The <b>screening</b> of semen for infectious virus prior to artificial insemination requires a sensitive diagnostic method. The isolation of the virus on cell cultures and/or the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are sensitive diagnostic tests which can be used to screen semen for LSD viral DNA prior to artificial insemination. Although cell culture is a sensitive method and detects infectious virus, its use has major limitations due to the toxic effect of semen on the cells. This study was therefore aimed at finding a method that decreases the toxic effect of semen on cell culture and enhances LSDV isolation. Secondly, the efficiency of this method in enhancing the isolation of LSDV in field samples was tested. In order to eliminate the toxic effect of semen on cell culture, a pilot study was conducted in which semen samples from LSDV sero-negative bulls were collected and infected with a field isolate of LSDV, strain 248 / 93 with a titre of 6. 5 log TCID 50. The semen samples were subjected to one of four different methods, viz centrifugation, serial dilution, filtration and chemical treatment with kaolin. The centrifugation, serial dilution, and filtration methods were supplemented with additional amounts of gentamycin. The toxic effects of semen on cell culture were completely eliminated when supernatants of semen samples, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1, 3 and 5 mins and serial diluted was used to inoculate confluent monolayers of bovine dermis cells. Semen diluted in MEM with or without additional antibiotics was the most sensitive method of demonstrating virus at higher dilutions, followed by pellets of samples centrifuged for 1 and 3 minutes. The toxicity recorded when the pellet fraction of semen samples were centrifuged for 5 mins at 2000 rpm was comparable to results obtained from serially diluted samples supplemented with gentamycin. The use of filtration and kaolin treatment of semen samples could not remove the toxic effect of semen on cells. To evaluate the presence of LSDV in semen of experimentally infected bulls, six seronegative post-pubertal bulls housed in an insect proof facility were infected with LSDV via the intravenous route. The experimentally infected bulls were monitored for clinical sign of the disease. Two bulls showed severe, two a mild and two an inapparent infection. Blood samples were collected for virus isolation and semen samples for virus isolation and PCR. Vesicular fluid and preputial washes were also investigated for the presence of LSD viral nucleic acid using PCR. The infectious titre of the virus shed in semen of these bulls was also calculated. The incubation period in infected bulls varied from 7 to 14 days. The length of viraemia varied between groups and did not correlate with the severity of clinical disease. The virus was isolated from blood samples of bulls in the severely infected group on several occasions. Bulls in the mildly infected group had the lowest rate of isolated virus when compared to those with inapparent infection.
