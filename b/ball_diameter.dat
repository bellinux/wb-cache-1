Hardness of the ball surfaces was analysed using Vickers indentation. Thermal stability of the nitrided <b>balls</b> (<b>diameter</b> 12. 0 mm) was studied using a furnace to heat them in air for 8 hours at temperatures up to 700. 0 °C and then, after cooling to room temperature, the surface hardness of the heated balls was re-measured.

30|$|For better {{understanding}} wood hardness, {{we developed a}} new hand-operated hardness tester that works with Brinell's method. With this tester we investigated the hardness distribution of wood minutely using a 2 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>ball</b> tip. The following results were obtained: (1) On preliminary examination with medium-density fiberboard, {{we found that the}} value of Brinell's hardness decreased with the increase in the tip <b>ball's</b> <b>diameter</b> but that it was almost constant with the indenting velocity. (2) By using a small diameter tip, the difference of the hardness became clearer between earlywood and latewood. (3) With radial and tangential sections, we obtained hardness distribution patterns similar to those of wood grain. It seems that the hardness distribution reflects the distribution of density on wood surfaces.|$|R

During wireline operations, a steel ball sits {{to the side of}} a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs {{in and out of the}} hole. If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been. The <b>ball's</b> <b>diameter</b> is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.|$|R

50|$|It {{was decided}} that the {{indenter}} shape should be capable of producing geometrically similar impressions, irrespective of size; the impression should have well-defined points of measurement; and the indenter should have high resistance to self-deformation. A diamond {{in the form of}} a square-based pyramid satisfied these conditions. It had been established that the ideal size of a Brinell impression was ⅜ of the <b>ball</b> <b>diameter.</b> As two tangents to the circle at the ends of a chord 3d/8 long intersect at 136°, it was decided to use this as the included angle of the indenter, giving an angle to the horizontal plane of 22° on each side. The angle was varied experimentally and it was found that the hardness value obtained on a homogeneous piece of material remained constant, irrespective of load. Accordingly, loads of various magnitudes are applied to a flat surface, depending on the hardness of the material to be measured. The HV number is then determined by the ratio F/A, where F is the force applied to the diamond in kilograms-force and A is the surface area of the resulting indentation in square millimeters. A can be determined by the formula.|$|E
5000|$|Regardless {{of table}} size, the WPA {{standard}} (sometimes informally called [...] "American-style") table has wide, angular pockets that funnel notably inward, generally 1.75 to 2.25 times as wide {{at the opening}} as {{the diameter of the}} -inch (57 mm) balls, wider at the side (middle) pockets than the corners. WEPF pool (sometimes informally called [...] "British-style" [...] or [...] "Commonwealth-style") is played with 2 to -in (51-54 mm) balls, and this type of table has smaller, narrow pockets (the width is calculated as the <b>ball</b> <b>diameter</b> multiplied by 1.6, and is consistent at all six pockets), with rounded entrances and nearly parallel sides, like those on a snooker table. One tactical consequence of this design difference is that the jaws of the WPA-type pocket are often used exactly like a horizontal version of the backboard of a basketball goal, to rebound the ball into the pocket; this technique does not work on blackball tables, and even shots down the cushion into a corner pocket are more difficult. The same also holds true of snooker and Russian pyramid tables, with similar [...] "tight" [...] pockets with rounded openings; all require more precise shots than WPA-style pool.|$|E
