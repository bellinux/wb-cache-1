50|$|The {{complete}} racing grid was 43 American-born drivers; {{including the}} last-place finisher Frank Warren who crashed on lap 11 {{out of the}} 492 laps {{that made up the}} advertised distance. Benny Parsons would return to the track after being a part of that lap 11 crash which destroyed the whole right side of his car. Travis Carter, his crew and volunteers, including Ralph Moody and his staff of 20 people managed to complete the repairs in an hour and eight minutes. They had to replace a rear axle, rear suspension, side bars, braking system and roll <b>bar</b> <b>cage.</b> Parsons would encounter some vibration issues on lap 308 that would knock him out of the race. Even with the DNF, he would slide into a comfortable 28th place finish.|$|E

The exhibit recreates the African savannah, and includes African painted dogs, African lions, cheetahs, Grant's zebras, hamadryas baboons, meerkats, radiated tortoises, Rothschild's giraffes, spotted hyaenas and southern white rhinoceroses. Visitors view the animals from a path that simulates a dry riverbed running through the savannah.|$|R

The park itself was founded by Carl Hagenbeck Jr. in 1907. It is known for being the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than <b>barred</b> <b>cages,</b> to better approximate animals' natural environments.|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the zoo {{was in a}} state of decay. The small prison-like brick and steel <b>bar</b> <b>cages</b> {{constructed}} by the WPA were no longer considered appropriate environments for many of the animals displayed in them. A study suggested that it should be closed down unless the city could make a major commitment to upgrade it. City government, local businesses, and private citizens rallied in support of it, and in 1975 the city's voters approved a measure to finance its rebuilding. Zoo grounds were expanded from 14 to 50 acres (57,000 to 200,000 m2). By the end of the decade, the Audubon Zoo was already well on its way to becoming one of the finest ones in the United States.|$|R

40|$|Precast {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) segments {{have been widely}} used to construct tunnels for mass rapid transit lines in Singapore. However, the reinforcement <b>bar</b> <b>cages</b> are labour intensive to fabricate and install in moulds. Then the cages must be adjusted in moulds to achieve minimum cover at critical locations such as bolt sockets and cover to external face. Supervision has to be tight to achieve good quality segments. However, with the use of steel fibre {{reinforced concrete}} (SFRC), steel reinforcement bars have been eliminated. Steel fibres are added during the batching of concrete. Concrete is then poured in moulds and compacted. Compaction is done by using external vibrators mounted on moulds. For downtown line stage 3 contract 933, SFRC segments were used as tunnel lining. C@nspecs Pte Ltd supervised the production of SFRC segments in the factory. This paper outlines the quality control tests done on the fresh and hardened concrete.

50|$|The old Lancaster County Jail {{is located}} in {{downtown}} Lancaster, {{on the north side}} of West Gay Street, between South French and South Catawba Streets. It is a three story masonry structure, built out of brick covered with stucco, with stone trim elements and a gabled roof. Its main facade faces east, with the entrance and first-floor windows set in round-arched recesses. Stone string courses separate the floors, and stone quoining is found at the building corners. The sills and lintels of the windows are also of stone. The interior of the first floor has a barrel-vaulted brick ceiling, and has a hallway down the center, separating the jailer's living quarters on one side from debtor's cells on the other. The doors are made of heavy wooden planking with three-foot hinges. A stairway leads to the second floor, which has a series of <b>barred</b> <b>cages</b> at its center. The stairway is protected by heavy doors at the top and bottom.|$|R

It became famous for its apes, including a gorilla named Bushman, until the Great Ape House opened. The Primate House's interior was heavily renovated in the early 1990s and it was re-opened as the Helen Brach Primate House in 1992 with eight diorama-style naturalistic exhibits simulating the swamps and rainforests of the animals' natural habitats in the wild, showcasing species such as black-and-white colobus monkeys, De Brazza's monkeys, Francois' langurs, pied tamarins, Allen's swamp monkeys and black howler monkeys. Perhaps its most notable residents are a family of northern white-cheeked gibbons that have a spacious room inside as well as an outdoor habitat for playing in the warm winter months. The zoo's male and female gibbons gave birth to baby Daxin on August 16, 2013.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of zoos today is to provide an {{immersive}} and educational experience for the visitor.

Modern zoos have come a long way from. the <b>barred</b> <b>cages</b> of a century ago. While direct contact is not possible with most animals, a more immersive, personal, experience is always achievable through good design. Today, visitors usually enjoy a more natural setting in which the animals are viewed. Often times, there are not even any visible barriers between the visitor and the animal. This new school of thought on how a zoo should look and act has given visitors a much more valuable experience by allowing them to view animals in a similar way in which they might see them in the wild. However, even today, there still exists a visitor-animal disconnect, resulting in the need for furthering the concepts of what an exhibit should be. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{epilogue}} skips {{forward a}} number of years. It is told {{from the perspective of}} a newcomer from Zakalon, a distant kingdom to the east of Bekla. This man, Siristrou, is the leader of the first embassy from Zakalon sent to reciprocate the first visit of a Beklan to their country. The formerly lawless border town is now the home of hundreds of orphans and refugees working together to build a better future. Kelderek is its mayor, widely regarded as a fair and wise leader, and is married to his love, Melathys. Kelderek takes the traveller into his home and tells him of the bear Shardik, now known as a great animal who taught the people of the land the meaning of both kindness and hardship. In the final passages, Siristrou stirs the logs in the fireplace and plays a game of spotting images in the flames: an island, a glowing knife, a <b>barred</b> <b>cage,</b> an old woman, a deep ravine, a shaggy bear; he recognises these images in turn, and finally remarks [...] "That's a beautiful fire." ...|$|R

50|$|Hulk Hogan {{continued}} his feud with Randy Savage. WWF financed {{a movie in}} 1989 titled No Holds Barred which starred Hogan as the lead character Rip and Tom Lister, Jr. acted as the villain Zeus. In the movie, Rip defeats Zeus. This movie led to a feud between Hogan and Zeus in the WWF because Zeus wanted to take revenge from Hogan of the movie in real-life. He was billed in the WWF as Zeus and he formed an alliance with Savage. Hogan's best friend Brutus Beefcake joined him in the war. This led to a tag team main event at SummerSlam, where Hogan and Beefcake defeated Zeus and Savage. The rivalry continued until the No Holds Barred pay-per-view, where Hogan and Beefcake beat Zeus and Savage in a steel cage match, thus ending the rivalry with Zeus. After the No Holds <b>Barred</b> <b>cage</b> match, Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan would meet one last time in a WrestleMania V rematch for the WWF Championship on the edition of February 23, 1990, of The Main Event. The pinfall was counted by new heavyweight boxing champion Buster Douglas, who then punched Savage out post-match after Savage slapped Douglas in the face.|$|R
