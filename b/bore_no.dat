5|$|Charles {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular and beloved kings of England, known as the Merry Monarch, in {{reference}} to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.|$|E
5|$|After a {{recommendation}} from high-ranking Dutch naval officers that the Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) be bolstered so any attacker {{would have to}} deploy {{a significant amount of}} their fleet to the East Indies, keeping it from other theaters of war, the Minister of Defense ordered the Navy to prepare designs for a two or three-member class of battlecruisers. As they had not previously designed a modern capitalship, and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane's Fighting Ships, the Dutch turned to Germany. This initially <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> results, as the two sides were unable to come to terms. During this time, a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance; completed on 11 July 1939, it was missing many of the post-First World War advances in warship technology. In particular, the armor protection was completely outmoded.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} {{the attacks on}} airfields in south-western England which they had started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the attacks on 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed to knock out these strips, and Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Bradley Torreano awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "Songs blur {{together}} but never get <b>boring,</b> <b>no</b> lyrics are actually sung, and few songs {{last longer than}} a minute. It also never takes itself seriously, a nice relief from Zorn's heavy-handed ambient collaborations. This {{would make a great}} introduction to the noise/jazz efforts that this group of musicians pioneered in the early 1990s." ...|$|R

5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E

25|$|The 1940 film Dark Command, {{based on}} a novel of the same name, is a fictionalized account of the events in {{much more of a}} classic B-movie western style. The film starred John Wayne, Roy Rogers, Gabby Hayes, and Walter Pidgeon, but <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> {{resemblance}} to the events of history.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Brando {{performed}} a screen test {{for an early}} Warner Brothers script for the novel Rebel Without a Cause (1944), which <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> relation to the film eventually produced in 1955.

25|$|The 1830s {{also saw}} a surge of {{activity}} from the reformist movement, whose main leader was José Antonio Saco, standing out for his criticism of Spanish despotism and the slave trade.

25|$|In 1994, {{the claim}} that Anna Anderson was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia was tested after her death using samples of her tissue that had been stored at a Charlottesville, Virginia {{hospital}} following a medical procedure.

25|$|Soviet Russia {{constructed}} two 2-8-8-4 locomotives at the Kolomna Locomotive Works. These {{were the}} P38 Class numbers P38.001 and P38.002.

Both engines had tenders with part bogie and part fixed frame similar to the American 'centipede' tenders.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, Catherine {{declared}} Jews to be officially foreigners, with foreigners’ rights. This re-established {{the separate}} identity that Judaism maintained in Russia throughout the Jewish Haskalah. Catherine’s decree also denied Jews {{the rights of}} an Orthodox or naturalised citizen of Russia. Taxes doubled again for those of Jewish descent in 1794, and Catherine officially declared that Jews <b>bore</b> <b>no</b> relation to Russians.|$|E
25|$|Haarmann is also {{strongly}} {{suspected of}} the murder of Hans Keimes, a 17-year-old Hanover youth who was reported missing on 17 March 1922 and whose nude, bound body was found in a canal on 6 May.

60|$|He {{had dropped}} into French in {{response}} to His Highness' remark, in order to express his thoughts more accurately. The Prince--a little <b>bored</b> <b>no</b> doubt--seemed disinclined to pursue the subject. Nevertheless, {{it seemed as if}} once again he made a decided effort not to show ill-humour. He even gave a knowing wink--a wink!--in the direction of his friend Blakeney and of Her Grace as if to beg them to set the ball of conversation rolling once more along a smoother--a less boring--path. He was obviously quite determined not to release M. de Kernogan from attendance near his royal person.|$|R
