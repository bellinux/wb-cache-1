The data consist of solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> monitored by a spacecraft. The output consists of ozone mixing ratio profiles complete with error bars throughout the atmosphere. The technique is based upon principles of nonlinear optimal estimation.

Satellite {{measurement}} of <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> will be {{the major source of}} long-term global information about total ozone and ozone profiles {{for the rest of this}} century. These measurements started with the BUV experiment flown on Nimbus 4 from 1970 to 1977 and are presently being continued with the Solar and Backscattered Ultraviolet/Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS) launched on Nimbus 7 in 1978. NOAA's improved version (SBUV/ 2) is to fly until sometime in the 1990 s and NASA plans to fly an SBUV/ 2 on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 1989.

In this work a spectral fitting sensitivity analysis is conducted on HCHO slant columns retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME- 2) instrument. Despite quite different spectral fitting approaches, the retrieved HCHO slant columns have geographic distributions that generally match expected HCHO sources, though the slant column magnitudes and corresponding uncertainties are particularly sensitive to the retrieval set-up. The choice of spectral fitting window, polynomial order, I 0 correction, and inclusion of minor absorbers tend to have the largest impact on the fit residuals. However, application of a reference sector correction using observations over the remote Pacific Ocean, is shown to largely homogenise the resulting HCHO vertical columns, thereby largely reducing any systematic erroneous spectral fitting...|$|E

This method uses jointly the usual analytical and Monte Carlo methods. Effects of the lower boundary of the atmosphere, cloud tops, and ground surface are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ratio of multiple to single scattering is determined, and its importance in ozone profile inversion of <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> solar <b>radiation</b> from the terrestrial atmosphere is evaluated.

40|$|An {{iterative}} {{method of estimating}} total atmospheric O₃ and SO₂ is developed for currently available satellite measurements of <b>backscattered</b> ultraviolet (<b>uv)</b> <b>radiation.</b> This method utilizes a direct inversion of the equation of radiative transfer by using a first order Taylor expansion of this equation {{with respect to a}} guessed combination of total O₃ and total SO₂. A new guess is made so as to minimize the difference between the measurements and theoretically calculated values. This method is able to model an atmosphere with molecular scattering or one with scattering by both molecules and particulates. A sensitivity analysis is presented and, {{in the case of a}} molecular atmosphere, the errors in retrieved total O₃ are on the order of 20 % and for total SO₂ are 25 %. Estimates can be performed for an atmosphere containing both molecular scatters and particulate scatters for scattering angles of 110 °- 150 °. In the case of volcanic ash and SO₂ mixed within the stratospheric eruption cloud, retrieval errors for these angles are within the same range as those of the molecular only atmosphere if: the index of refraction of the ash is known to within a factor of 1. 5 and the mean radius is also known to within a factor of 2. Application of this method to total ozone measuring spectrometer (TOMS) Nimbus 7 data for scans of a volcanic cloud show the total O₃ amount within the cloud to be noticeably lower than those of positions out of the cloud. This is consistent with the results of others...|$|R
40|$|Ozone within deep {{convective}} clouds {{is controlled}} by several factors involving photochemical reactions and transport. Gas-phase photochemical reactions and heterogeneous surface chemical reactions involving ice, water particles, and aerosols inside the clouds all contribute to the distribution and net production and loss of ozone. Ozone in clouds is also dependent on convective transport that carries low-troposphere/boundary-layer ozone and ozone precursors upward into the clouds. Characterizing ozone in thick clouds {{is an important step}} for quantifying relationships of ozone with tropospheric H 2 O, OH production, and cloud microphysics/transport properties. Although measuring ozone in deep convective clouds from either aircraft or balloon ozonesondes is largely impossible due to extreme meteorological conditions associated with these clouds, it is possible to estimate ozone in thick clouds using <b>backscattered</b> solar <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> measured by satellite instruments. Our study combines Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite measurements to generate a new research product of monthly-mean ozone concentrations in deep convective clouds between 30 ° S and 30 ° N for October 2004 –April 2016. These measurements represent mean ozone concentration primarily in the upper levels of thick clouds and reveal key features of cloud ozone including: persistent low ozone concentrations in the tropical Pacific of [*]∼[*] 10  ppbv or less; concentrations of up to 60  pphv or greater over landmass regions of South America, southern Africa, Australia, and India/east Asia; connections with tropical ENSO events; and intraseasonal/Madden–Julian oscillation variability.

The nature and magnitude of these lunar UV radiance enhancements are determined, and their potential use as a measure of nighttime ozone is considered. The data were grouped into five-day study intervals centered about each full moon sequence, and about each corresponding new moon interval. The analysis was performed in a magnetic frame of reference (McIlwain, 1961) in order to evaluate magnetospheric perturbation effects and to minimize the effects of charged energetic particle contamination or precipitation.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to obtain ozone vertical profile information given coincident satellite measurements of both cloud-top pressure and above-cloud column ozone. This method is denoted "cloud slicing". In this study information of cloud-top pressure is derived from Geostationary Orbital Earth Satellite (GOES) infrared data, while above-cloud column ozone is obtained from the Earth Probe total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) instrument. Several case examples are presented showing the feasibility of this technique as well as providing new geophysical results. Because the TOMS instrument measures <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> it does detect ozone lying below dense water vapor clouds. This opaque property of TOMS can be used directly in conjunction with co-located cloud-top pressure data to derive ozone profile information in the troposphere. The cloud slicing method is an extension of the "Convective Cloud Differential" (CCD) method. In the CCD method, tropospheric column ozone (i. e., the total vertical column of ozone lying in the troposphere) is computed by taking total column ozone with low reflectivity (R less than 0. 2) and subtracting from this a nearby measurement of above-cloud column ozone amount under conditions of high reflectivity (R greater than 0. 9). (High reflectivity away from snow/ice conditions coincides with strong convection and tropopause-level clouds). The key element in determining tropospheric ozone profile information from the cloud slicing method is to have simultaneous and co-located measurements of both above-cloud column ozone and cloud-top pressure...|$|E

Methods: This cross- sectional study was conducted on 12 clinical strains isolated from patients according to CLSI M 38 -P method. Initially, fungal suspensions were supplied with cell ranges of 0. 5 - 5 × 104 cfu/ml. Then, drug stocks of itraconazole and amphotericin B with serial dilution of 0. 03125 - 16 µg/mlas well as fluconazole of 0. 125 - 64 µg/ml were prepared. Drug susceptibility was scrutinized pre and post <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> after 1, 2, 5, 10, 60, 90 and 120 s of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation.</b> Results: The highest and lowest MICs were 64 µg/ml and 0. 5 µg/ml for amphotericin B and fluconazole pre <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> respectively. After <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> MICs gradually decreased so that after 10 s of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> MICs were < 0. 03125 which were considered 0.

Soon after the mid- 1980 s, it was rec-ognized that the stratospheric ozone content was declining over large areas of the globe. Because the stratospheric ozone layer protects life on Earth from harmful <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> this lead to concern about possible changes in the <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> due to anthropogenic activity. Initiated by this concern, many stations for monitoring of the surface <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> were founded in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. As a consequence, there is an apparent lack of information on <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> further in the past: measurements cannot tell us how the <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> levels have changed on time scales of, for instance, several decades. The aim of this thesis was to improve our understanding of past variations in the surface <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> by developing tech-niques for UV reconstruction. Such techniques utilize commonly available meteorological data together with measurements of the total ozone column for reconstructing, or estimating, the amount of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> reaching Earth's surface in the past.

40|$|This book {{discusses}} <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> {{its effects}} on ecosystems and the likely evolutionary consequences of changed <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> environments, past, present and future. The first two chapters examine {{the history of the}} <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> climate of earth and the factors that determine organismal and ecosystem exposure. Their purpose is to give the reader a physical perspective on <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> and an understanding of the constantly changing UV environment that ecosystems are exposed to over time. Variations in the <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> environment occur at the local level (such as boundary layer and plant canopy effects) through to global-scale changes (such as alterations in the column abundance of UV-B protecting ozone). <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> regimes also vary over temporal scales. These alterations occur on time scales of seconds (the movement of clouds and plant canopies) to literally billions of years (gross long-term changes in the composition of the Earth's atmosphere). In the chapters that follow five specific biological and ecological topics in photobiology are considered. They are effects of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> on amphibians, plants, corals, aquatic microbial ecosystems and Antarctic ecosystems that are exposed to the anthropogenically generated ozone 'hole'. These chapters consider <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> effects at a diversity of levels from the biochemical to the community.

The results of several investigations indicate that the outcome of plant competition can be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. However, those studies usually evaluate single factors. Since biotic and abiotic factors affect plant competition at the same time, {{it is important to understand}} the nature of their inter-relationships. In this dissertation I assessed the effects of ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>radiation</b> and mycorrhizal colonization on plant competition. The work presented in chapter two evaluates how arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis and <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> affect vegetative growth, morphology and allocation in seedlings of Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood), Salix nigra (black willow), and Betula nigra (river birch), three shade intolerant tree species. The results showed that <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> induced changes in leaf morphology and biomass allocation and that AM colonization resulted in the reduction of plant biomass. This work demonstrated that ambient levels of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> can reduce the rate of AM colonization and suggested that, in some species, AM colonization may help to overcome the detrimental effects of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> stress. Chapter three evaluates the effects of competition and <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> on early vegetative growth in seedlings of P. deltoides. The results showed that <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> affected growth and morphology of P. deltoides seedlings when seedlings were grown alone, but not when seedlings were grown in competition.

The UV-B radiation causes damage to the DNA in the nuclei of the skin cells and their eventual death. In many amphibian species there was found a negative influence of the UV-B radiation on the hatching success of tadpoles and their subsequent viability.

Although suppression of both the afferent and efferent phases of DTH were caused by similar wavebands within the ultraviolet region, the dose of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> that suppressed the efferent arm of DTH was 10 -fold higher than the dose that suppressed the afferent arm of the DTH reaction. ^ The DTH response of C 57 BL/ 6 mice was also suppressed by UV radiation; however the suppression was accomplished by exposure to significantly lower doses <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> compared to C 3 H mice. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, the dose of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> that suppressed the afferent phase of DTH was 5 -fold higher than the dose that suppressed the efferent phase. ^ Exposure of C 3 H mice to <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> before sensitization induced splenic suppressor T cells that upon transfer to normal recipients, impaired the induction of DTH to Candida. In contrast, the suppression caused by UV irradiation of mice after sensitization was not transferable. Spleen cells from sensitized mice exhibited altered homing patterns in animals that were exposed to <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> shortly before receiving cells, suggesting that UV-induced suppression of the efferent arm of DTH could result from an alteration in the distribution of effector cells. ^ <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> decreased the survival of Candida-infected mice; however, no correlation was found between suppression of the DTH response and the course of lethal infection. This suggested that DTH was not protective against lethal disease with this organism. <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> also changed the persistence of the organism in the internal organs. UV-irradiated, infected animals had increased numbers of Candida in their kidneys compared to non-irradiated mice. Sensitization prior to UV irradiation aided clearance of the organism from the kidneys of UV-irradiated mice. ^ These data show that <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> suppresses cell-mediated immunity to Candida albicans in mice and increases mortality of Candida-infected mice. Moreover, the data suggest that an increase in environmental <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> could increase the severity of pathogenic infections. ...|$|R
2500|$|All xenon short-arc lamps {{generate}} substantial ultraviolet radiation. Xenon {{has strong}} spectral {{lines in the}} UV bands, and these readily pass through the fused quartz lamp envelope. Unlike the borosilicate glass used in standard lamps, fused quartz readily passes <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> unless it is specially doped. The <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> released by a short-arc lamp can cause a secondary problem of ozone generation. The <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> strikes oxygen molecules in the air surrounding the lamp, causing them to ionize. [...] Some of the ionized molecules then recombine as O3, ozone.

However, {{the amount of}} UV exposure can be affected by surfaces that reflect <b>UV</b> <b>radiation.</b> Knowledge about reflected <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> from surfaces in the built environment is limited, especially from vertical or other non-horizontal surfaces and the resulting effects of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> reflection from these surfaces. The main aims {{of this research is}} comprised of (1) characterisation of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> reflection from a variety of urban building materials in vertical positions, (2) quantification of the biological effect of UV reflection from simulated structures on a human and (3) establishing relationships between <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement indicators and resulting biological effects. <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> reflection was investigated using spectral measurements made with portable spectrometers, and took into consideration factors that could influence the measurements including orientation, direction, solar zenith and azimuth angles and surface type. The biological effects due to reflection from vertical urban structures were investigated using dosimetry which enabled body site UV exposure analysis. Relationships from <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> reflection between different surface orientations (vertical, horizontal and inclined) were quantified. The UV Index was used to predict changes to UV exposure from certain vertical <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> reflective surfaces. Spectral reflection from vertical urban structures was found to be variable and for metallic surface types the variation appears to be predominantly controlled by solar zenith and solar azimuth angles, with man-made surfaces reflecting some radiation specularly. Hence, surface type and the coating on the surface type dictates the way <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> is reflected from a surface. Increases in UV exposure are observed during seasons with larger solar zenith angles, and decreases in seasons with predominantly lower solar zenith angles. This produces an observable seasonal effect, creating a potential problem in cooler seasons than in warmer seasons due to human behaviour, where personal UV protection can be overlooked compared to thermal comfort. This study has shown that UV reflection from certain vertical surfaces will substantially enhance UV exposure to an individual, and reduce the time for an outdoor worker to exceed recommended UV exposure limits...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Because {{studies suggest}} that {{ultraviolet}} (<b>UV)</b> <b>radiation</b> modulates the myositis phenotype and Mi- 2 autoantigen expression, we conducted a retrospective investigation to determine whether <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> may influence the relative prevalence of dermatomyositis and anti-Mi- 2 autoantibodies in the US. METHODS: We assessed the relationship between surface <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> intensity {{in the state of}} residence at the time of onset with the relative prevalence of dermatomyositis and myositis autoantibodies in 380 patients with myositis from referral centers in the US. Myositis autoantibodies were detected by validated immunoprecipitation assays. Surface <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> intensity was estimated from UV Index data collected by the US National Weather Service. RESULTS: <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> intensity was associated with the relative proportion of patients with dermatomyositis (odds ratio [OR] 2. 3, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0. 9 - 5. 8) and with the proportion of patients expressing anti-Mi- 2 autoantibodies (OR 6. 0, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 34. 1). Modeling of these data showed that these associations were confined to women (OR 3. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 11. 0 and OR 17. 3, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 162. 4, respectively) and suggests that sex influences the effects of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> on autoimmune disorders. Significant associations were not observed in men, nor were <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> levels related to the presence of antisynthetase or anti-signal recognition particle autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: This first study of the distribution of myositis phenotypes and <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure in the US showed that <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> may modulate the clinical and immunologic expression of autoimmune disease in women. Further investigation of the mechanisms by which these effects are produced may provide insights into pathogenesis and suggest therapeutic or preventative strategies...|$|R
40|$|Many alpine lakes {{have low}} {{concentrations}} of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-absorbing dissolved organic matter, yet receive higher <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> flux than low-elevation lakes. We tested whether ambient <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> affected periphyton {{development in a}} small alpine lake in Banff National Park, Canada. After 30 d, total periphytic biomass and chlorophyll accrual on artificial substrates were enhanced- 100 % (t-test, P < 0. 05) by removal of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> (~ 400 nm). The inhibitory effect of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> was species-specific, significantly suppressing (Bonferroni-adjusted t-test, P < 0. 05) Achnanthes minutissima Kiitzing but not other colonists. Although taxa apparently differed in their sensitivity to <b>UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> periphyton commu-nities remained dominated by early successional taxa, especially A. minutissima (75 % of total biovolume). In contrast, natural epilithic communities were dominated by cyanobacteria (Anabaena subcylindrica Borge, Calothrix sp.). These findings suggest hat ambient <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> at alpine sites can suppress periphyton development by inhibiting littoral diatom production during the short ice-free season (July-September). Future climatic change may affect the ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>radiation</b> environment in aquatic ecosystems. For ex-ample, a warmer and drier climate in central North Amer-ica has reduced inputs and increased in-lake removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the primary attenuator of <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> in lakes (Schindler et al. 1990, 1992; Jones 1992). Low concentrations of DOM allow UV ra-diation to penetrate to greater depths (Scully and Lean 1994; Kirk 1994) and may combine with absolute in-creases in UV-B (280 - 320 nm) radiation flux (Blumthaler and Ambach 1990) to adversely affect aquatic organisms (e. g. Williamson et al. 1994). Alpine lakes may offer insights into the long-term ef-fects of elevated <b>UV</b> <b>radiation</b> on aquatic organisms.
