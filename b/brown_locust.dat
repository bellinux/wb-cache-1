40|$|The gut {{bacterial}} {{community from}} four species of feral locusts and grasshoppers {{was determined by}} {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene fragments. The study revealed an effect of phase polymorphism on gut bacterial diversity in <b>brown</b> <b>locusts</b> from South Africa. A single bacterial phylotype, consistent with Citrobacter sp. dominated the gut microbiota of two sympatric populations of Moroccan and Italian locusts in Spain. There was evidence for Wollbachia sp. in the meadow grasshopper caught locally in the UK. Sequence analysis of DGGE products did not reveal evidence for unculturable bacteria and homologies suggested that bacterial species were principally Gammapoteobacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae similar to those recorded previously in laboratory reared locusts.

50|$|During phase 2, the oil {{formulation}} {{was tested}} {{in the field and}} shown to be effective. Field trials proved to be difficult to carry out on such highly mobile insects as grasshoppers and locusts. With locusts, fixed plots, unless several square kilometres in size, cannot be used, so it is necessary to follow hopper bands. Although there were many locust infestations during this phase, of both desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) and <b>brown</b> <b>locusts</b> (Locustana pardalina), the chemical treatment teams were also very active and little headway was therefore made in developing the techniques necessary to measure the effect of Metarhizium on unrestrained locusts. However, it was possible to scale up treatments against the variegated grasshopper (Zonocerus variegatus) in the forest zone and against Sahelian grasshoppers, especially the Senegalese grasshopper (Oedaleus senegalensis).|$|R
40|$|Two {{international}} organisations involved in controlling locust infestations in Africa {{have all but}} disappeared despite indications of a major upswing in locust populations. The Organisation to combat the African Migratory Locust (OICMA) was dissolved in February 1986 {{at a meeting of}} its Board of Directors in Bamako, Mali. Only three of its seventeen member countries were continuing to support it. The Dakar-based Joint Acridid and Bird Control Organisation (OCLALAV) is also in grave difficulty after having its funding withheld by France and the UN for refusing to undergo certain reforms. All of this is happening when, {{for the first time in}} years, there are signs of major locust swarms developing in the Sahel as well as in Saudi Arabia.

50|$|There {{was a major}} {{plague of}} the African migratory locust from 1891 to 1903, {{followed}} by one that lasted from 1928 to 1941. For many years after that, the African migratory locust was in recession, which perhaps lulled the authorities into {{a false sense of}} security. The Sahel region experienced several years of drought in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The rains and more normal weather returned in 1984, providing ideal conditions for the locusts to breed abundantly. As well as the African migratory locust, the Senegalese grasshopper, the red locust, the <b>brown</b> <b>locust</b> and the desert locust were flourishing {{in various parts of the}} continent at the same time. The Desert Locust Control Organisation of East Africa remained an effective body, but elsewhere little monitoring was done, with civil wars in Chad and the Central African Republic hindering the detection of outbreaks. In many countries, there were few resources to deal with any outbreaks that were discovered. This plague lasted until 1986.|$|E
40|$|It is {{just over}} 100 {{years since the}} {{chemical}} control of locusts began in South Africa when sodium arsenite dust was first applied by hand to Red Locust hopper bands and roosting swarms in Natal (Anonymous, 1906). Although our knowledge of locust outbreak dynamics, insecticide technology, application techniques and intervention strategies has made great advances, locusts remain a serious problem. Outbreaks of Brown, African Migratory and Red Locust still threaten sustainable agricultural production in southern Africa. Due to insufficient early warning and limited operational capacity, <b>Brown</b> <b>Locust</b> outbreaks are only contained after emergency campaigns have been launched. Such a curative control response involves vast expenditure, high insecticide usage and increased risk of environmental contamination. This paper briefly describes the biology and outbreak dynamics of the four species of plague locust occurring in southern Africa and focuses on the <b>Brown</b> <b>Locust</b> – a species of great economic importance for the SADC Region.

50|$|The LUBILOSA team {{continued}} to look for opportunities to test Metarhizium against locusts and grasshoppers. Field trials were conducted against Senegalese grasshoppers, African rice grasshoppers (Hieroglyphus daganensis), variegated grasshoppers, Sahelian tree <b>locusts</b> (Anacridium melanorhodon), <b>brown</b> <b>locusts</b> and desert locusts. These trials demonstrated that Metarhizium at a dosage of 50 g/ha could reduce grasshopper populations and those of tree locusts by 80-90% within two to three weeks. Population level control was more difficult to achieve with other locusts, but a significant effect was demonstrated on hopper bands notwithstanding the great difficulties in tracking individual bands. Some trials against Senegalese grasshoppers included the chemical insecticide fenitrothion for comparison. Because of its rather short persistence, this chemical {{turned out to be}} much less effective than commonly believed. It was highly effective in producing an immediate sharp reduction in population densities, but continued hatching and remigration into the treated plots caused these densities to start increasing again after less than a week, until they reached or exceeded the original levels after about two to three weeks. Metarhizium, on the other hand, reduced population levels at a slower rate, but maintained low levels for at least one and a half months. The half-life of its spores on the vegetation was estimated at more than 7 days under rainy season conditions in the Sahel and, of course, some conidia must survive between seasons.|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of locust research and control. The life history and biology of the <b>Brown</b> <b>Locust,</b> Locustana pardalina, are documented, but little is known of the species ’ population dynamics. To understand the mechanisms driving population fluctuations of the <b>Brown</b> <b>Locust,</b> a model for simulating plague events was developed using MATLAB (MATLAB, 1992). A rule-based model that determined the transitions between stages of the locust life-cycle, contingent on daily rainfall and temperature records, was enhanced by migration probability functions based on distance between stations, wind speed, locust flight duration and wind heading. In order to test simulation effectiveness, simulations for specific stations were compared with data on swarms eradicated in each magisterial district. This information had been collected to pay locust control officers and was used despite the limitations of its accuracy. Rainfall, temperature and wind data were supplied by the South African Weather Bureau. It was assumed that incorporation of wind-facilitated migration into the basic model would increase the accuracy of predictions. The inclusion of migration tracking routines improves the simulation of outbreak events with respect to timing...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) imagery {{was collected}} over a <b>brown</b> <b>locust</b> Locustana pardalina outbreak area to estimate soil moisture relevant to egg development. ERS- 2 /RadarSat overpasses and field studies enabled parameterization of surface roughness, volumetric soil moisture, soil texture, and vegetation cover. Data were analyzed both when the target area was assessed as nonvegetated and when treated as vegetated. For the former, using the integral equation model (IEM) and soil surface data {{combined with the}} sensitivity of the IEM to changes in surface roughness introduced an error of ∼ � 0. 06 cm 3 cm− 3 in volumetric soil moisture. Comparison of the IEM modeling results with backscatter responses from the ERS- 2 /RadarSat imagery revealed errors as high as � 0. 14 cm 3 cm− 3, mostly due to IEM calibration problems and the impact of vegetation. Two modified versions of the water cloud model (WCM) were parameterized, one based on measurements of vegetation moisture and the other on vegetation biomass. A sensitivity analysis of the resulting model revealed a positive relationship between increases in both vegetation biomass and vegetation moisture and the backscatter responses from the ERS- 2 and RadarSat sensors. The WCM was able to explain up to 80...|$|E

40|$|The LUBILOSA (Lutte Biologique contre les Locusts et les Sauteriaux) Programme {{has been}} working on the {{development}} of a myco-insecticide for the control of locusts and grasshoppers for the past 9 years. The resulting myco-insecticide product (trade name Green MuscleTM) is based on an oil formulation of aerial conidia of the fungal entomopa-thogen, Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum. Field testing of this myco-insecticide in sou-thern Africa has been conducted in close collaboration with the Locust and Termite Research Division of the Plant Protection Research Institute, South Africa. Trials have been conducted against <b>Brown</b> <b>Locust,</b> Locustana pardalina, in the Karoo region of South Africa and the Red Locust, Nomadacris septemfasciata, in the Buzi outbreak area of Moz-ambique. High (H 90 %) insect mortalities have been demonstrated following field appli-cations with standard ultra low volume (ULV) spraying equipment normally used in acridid control. Moreover, extensive eco-toxicological work has shown that Green MuscleTM has minimal impact on other non-target species, including other insects, reptiles, birds and mammals. Accordingly, Metarhizium has been recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Pesticide Referee Group for locust control in environmen-tally sensitive areas. Most significantly, Green MuscleTM has recently undergone successful registration for locust control in South Africa. This represents a fundamental breakthrough in locust control and creates, for the first time, real opportunities {{to move away from the}} use of chemicals towards more integrated control strategies incorporating biological con-trol techniques.

40|$|Locustana pardalina (Walk.) eggs {{have the}} ability to survive during drought. Diapause and quiescence, both types of dormancy, {{play a major role in}} {{contributing}} to <b>brown</b> <b>locust</b> survival under arid conditions by preventing immediate hatching and allowing build-up of eggs in the soil which contributes to swarming. This study investigated the water balance, hydropyle cell structure, tracking of development and the metabolic rate of eggs in different states. The eggs {{have the ability}} to resist desiccation and to survive water loss when it occurs. Locustana pardalina eggs consist of 66 % water and can lose almost all the water during desiccation. Hydropyle cell structure showed morphological structures such as lateral infoldings supporting evidence of active rather than passive water uptake. We showed that water absorption was immediate in non-diapause eggs and limited in diapause eggs. There was a general increase in hydropyle cell nuclear area and cell height during water absorption. We measured the metabolic rate of diapause and non-diapause eggs and directly linked these to embryonic development. Day 6 after laying seems to be the point at which some of the embryos in anatrepsis enter diapause and others continue development. The metabolic rate of non-diapause eggs increased exponentially until hatching while that of laboratory and field diapause eggs maintained a low stable metabolic rate. Eggs subjected to alternate drying and hydration showed adaptability by stopping development, lowering their metabolic rate while still maintaining the embryo. Locustana diapause and non-diapause eggs {{have the ability to}} control water absorption, resist desiccation and survive water loss. The maintenance of low stable metabolic rate of desiccation resistant diapause eggs contributes to the success of Locustana in harsh environments...|$|E
40|$|During {{the growing}} season of 1995 further field trials using the fungus Metarhizium flavoriride to control locusts and {{grasshoppers}} {{have been carried out}} in several regions of Africa. (See Spore 55 p 1). The international collaborative locust and grasshopper biological control programme (LUBILOSA) worked with the Niger Service de Protection des Vegetaux to spray some 50 -hectare plots of grassland in Eastern Niger which were grasshopper infested. Three weeks after spraying, the pest population had declined by over 70 % and was still decreasing. There was also evidence that the pathogen from the initial spraying multiplies in the insects which results in further spread of the infection. Researchers from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) also tested Metarhizium in Mali and Niger to treat bands of grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus) in the bush alongside croplands to prevent them entering the crop. Pests began to die eight days after spraying and continued to do so for the next ten days. Populations continued to decline and there was no subsequent recovery later in the season. In Mauritania, LUBILOSA collaborated with the crop protection authorities and also the German aid agency, GTZ to treat the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria. Whilst in South Africa in separate trials, LUBILOSA and collaborators used aerial applications of Metarhizium formulations against the <b>brown</b> <b>locust</b> populations.

40|$|Trials in South Africa on {{the control}} of locusts with the {{pathogenic}} fungus Metarhizium flavoviride have speeded up research work. This follows trials which had been carried out in West Africa (see Spore 41). In West Africa the desert locust does not swarm every year and this makes field testing difficult. However, in South Africa the <b>brown</b> <b>locust</b> swarms several times every year. Currently they are controlled with chemicals which are ecologically damaging. The swarming habits of the locusts in South Africa provided good opportunities for testing the fungus, which prompted Dr Roger Price of the Plant Protection Research institute to start work with Meturhizium. In the first field trials in 1994 the fungus killed off 95 %, of the locusts in a swarm: the result {{is as good as}} that obtained by using chemical sprays. The disadvantage is that it took 20 days to reach the 95 % level of control, although half the locusts were dead after 10 days. However, within five days, infected locusts were eating about half the amount of food that an uninfected insect would consume. Normally the fungal spores would not survive the hot dry climate associated with arid areas. That problem has been overcome by mixing the spores in a vegetable oil. This technique was developed by the International Institute of Biological Control in the UK. Suspended in the oil, the spray can be applied with normal spraying equipment. Locusts are infected on contact with the spray; it {{does not have to be}} ingested.

40|$|A {{pesticide}} {{that not}} only kills locusts, but simultaneously benefits one of their natural enemies, has been identified by scientists in South Africa. Normally pesticides kill both the target insects and their predators. But Roger Price and his colleagues from the Plant Protection Research Institute in Pretoria, South Africa, made an interesting discovery when spraying <b>brown</b> <b>locust</b> nymphs (Locustna pardalina) with differing amounts of deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, to see if weather had any affect on the death rate of the insects. The researchers noticed that when they applied 15 gm/ha of deltamethrin, the locusts sought shade in deep drifts under bushes. Two days later the heaps of locusts were seen crawling with maggots of the locust fly (Wolhlfahrtia pachytyli); the fly pupae were also present. The finding was surprising when doses of only 0. 2 am/ha of deltamethrin are used very effectively for tsetse control. Locusts take between {{three to five days}} to succumb to the pyrethroid, giving time for the predator fly to lay its eggs. Usually the fly invades locust nymphs while they are shedding their skins and are therefore relatively immobile. Active adult locusts are able to brush off the flies before they can lay their eggs and so under normal conditions only about 6 % of locusts are parasitized. However, the level rose to an average of 30 % parasitic control on those locusts suffering the effects of the deltamethrin. Researchers at the University of Witwatersrand are now studying W. pachytyli to determine how it copes with deltamethrin as this will have useful implications for locust control, if spraying at this dose rate is able to increase the parasitic presence in locust locations.
