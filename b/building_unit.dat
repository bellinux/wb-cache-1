500|$|If it {{were not}} for Shen Kuo's {{analysis}} and quoting in his Dream Pool Essays of the writings of the architect Yu Hao (fl. 970), the latter's work would have been lost to history. Yu designed a famous wooden pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the 'Iron Pagoda') of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen's quotation—or perhaps Shen's own paraphrasing of Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual (木經; Mujing)—shows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of <b>building</b> <b>unit</b> proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work. However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110), the Treatise on Architectural Methods (營造法式; Yingzao Fashi) of 1103. Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the Timberwork Manual quoted by Shen is most likely Shen's summarization of Yu's work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes: [...] "According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{study of}} MOFs {{developed}} {{from the study of}} zeolites, except for the use of preformed ligands. MOFs and zeolites are produced almost exclusively by hydrothermal or solvothermal techniques, where crystals are slowly grown from a hot solution. In contrast with zeolites, MOFs are constructed from bridging organic ligands that remain intact throughout the synthesis. Zeolite synthesis often makes use of a [...] "template". Templates are ions that influence the structure of the growing inorganic framework. [...] Typical templating ions are quaternary ammonium cations, which are removed later. In MOFs, the framework is templated by the SBU (secondary <b>building</b> <b>unit)</b> and the organic ligands. A templating approach that is useful for MOFs intended for gas storage is the use of metal-binding solvents such as N,N-diethylformamide and water. In these cases, metal sites are exposed when the solvent is evacuated, allowing hydrogen to bind at these sites.|$|E

50|$|Control is more {{tractable}} if {{the constituents}} are molecular building blocks, i.e., stable molecules {{that can be}} readily induced to assemble in accordance with geometric restrictions. Typically, {{while there may be}} many species of constituents, there are two main classes: somewhat compact and often polyhedral secondary <b>building</b> <b>units</b> (SBUs), and linking or bridging <b>building</b> <b>units.</b> A popular class of examples are the Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), in which (classically) the secondary <b>building</b> <b>units</b> are metal ions or clusters of ions and the linking <b>building</b> <b>units</b> are organic ligands. These SBUs and ligands are relatively controllable, and some new crystals have been synthesized using designs of novel nets. An organic variant are the Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), in which the SBUs might (but not necessarily) be themselves organic. The greater control over the SBUs and ligands {{can be seen in the}} fact that while no novel zeolites have been synthesized per design, several MOFs have been synthesized from crystal nets designed for zeolite synthesis, such as Zeolite-like Metal-Organic Frameworks (Z-MOFs) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIFs).|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} complex {{inorganic}} solids with open-framework and other fascinating architectures, involving silicate, phosphate, and other anions, have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The {{past few years}} have also seen the successful synthesis and characterization of several molecular compounds that can act as precursors to form open-framework and other materials, some of them resembling secondary <b>building</b> <b>units</b> (SBUs). Transformations of rationally synthesized molecular compounds to materials constitute an important new direction in both structural inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry and enable possible pathways for the rational design of materials. In this article, we indicate the potential of such a bottom-up approach, by briefly examining the transformations of molecular silicates and phosphates. We discuss stable organosilanols and silicate secondary <b>building</b> <b>units,</b> phosphorous acids and phosphate secondary <b>building</b> <b>units,</b> di- and triesters of phosphoric acids, and molecular phosphate clusters and polymers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{endeavors to}} delineate practical paradigms for crystal engineering {{based upon the}} understanding of supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly, i. e. the design and synthesis of novel functional crystalline materials. Two basic metal-organic <b>building</b> <b>units,</b> Zn(RCOâ) â(py) â and (Lâ) Mâ(RCOâ) â (M = Zn, Cu), as well as nano-scaled secondary <b>building</b> <b>units</b> (nSBUs) that are constructed from Cuâ(RCOâ) â are researched and discussed. Design strategies {{have been developed to}} propagate these metal-organic synthons into predictable coordination polymer networks. A series of crystal structures, as well as their syntheses and characterization, are presented. This work demonstrates that supramolecular structures can be designed from pre-selected molecular precursors with the consideration of chemical functionalities and geometrical arrangements. The design strategy represents a practical paradigm for the construction of porous materials as well as interesting networks with special topologies. The modular nature of these metal-organic <b>building</b> <b>units</b> introduces a broad impact on the discovery of novel coordination compounds with potential useful properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} prepare ultrathin {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets (NSs) in high yield {{is of great}} importance for the further exploration of their unique properties and potential applications. Herein, by elaborately designing and choosing two flexible molecules with C 3 v molecular symmetry as <b>building</b> <b>units,</b> a novel imine-linked COF, namely TPA-COF, with hexagonal layered structure and sheet-like morphology, is synthesized. Since the flexible <b>building</b> <b>units</b> are integrated into the COF skeletons, the interlayer stacking becomes weak, resulting in the easy exfoliation of TPA-COF into ultrathin 2 D NSs. Impressively, for the first time, the detailed structural information, i. e. the pore channels and individual <b>building</b> <b>units</b> in the NSs, is clearly visualized by using the recently developed low-dose imaging technique of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As a proof-of-concept application, the obtained ultrathin COF NSs are used as a novel fluorescence sensing platform for the highly sensitive and selective detection of DNA...|$|R
