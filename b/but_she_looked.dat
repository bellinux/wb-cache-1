500|$|Billiards {{champion}} Tex Zimmerman (Cochran's {{partner in}} the 924 Club) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty {{had a hand in}} organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88 and 96pounds. and standing 5feet tall—just about the height of a standard cue stick. McGoorty later mused: [...] "Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Saul of our body, man! <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> wondrous grim," [...] {{answered}} King James. [...] "Art thou {{sure she}} has not been in her time maid of honour to Queen Mary, our kinswoman, of redhot memory?" ...|$|R
60|$|Anna did not pause, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{over her}} {{shoulder}} with slightly lifted eyebrows.|$|E
60|$|A wave {{of color}} came to Barbara's skin, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up {{and her eyes}} flashed.|$|E
60|$|Adelia {{laid down}} her {{knitting}} and blushed crimson. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at Young Thomas squarely and reproachfully.|$|E
6000|$|No. I. 1722.--Hibernia, {{with both}} {{her hands on}} the harp, which is placed on her right side; her figure is full front, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> towards the right; round her this inscription, HIBERNIA, 1722. (Simon, plate 7, Numb. 160) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is lying}} down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says <b>she</b> thinks so, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> worried, {{and that makes}} me fidgety," [...] {{answered}} Meg.|$|R

6000|$|... "How are you, Bessie?" [...] said Muller {{in a quiet}} voice, <b>but</b> <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> {{into his}} face, saw that it belied the voice. It was alive with evil passions that seemed to make it {{positively}} lurid, an effect that its undoubted beauty only intensified.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] {{returned}} the boy doubtfully, and surveying {{me with his}} arm held out above his burning eyes. [...] "She looks to me the t'other one. It ain't the bonnet, nor yet it ain't the gownd, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> to me the t'other one." ...|$|R

50|$|She {{is one of}} the {{students}} of La Flora long ago, and has the same personality as Tiwa, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> mature and smart instead of her daughter. Every students admired her, but they don't know she is Tiwa's mother. She were very similar to Arin, her sister.|$|R
60|$|My hostess {{sat with}} lowered eyes, saying nothing; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> {{presently}} <b>looked</b> up.|$|R

6000|$|... "Wonderful," [...] said John, with a quiver {{of feeling}} on his face.

60|$|On {{her side}} she seemed quite bewildered, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> about her with happy eyes, {{and was not}} at all afraid of her deliverer.|$|E
5000|$|Howard, who {{had never}} done {{anything}} like that before, leaves, horrified. Howard later travels {{back to the city}} and to a bank where he sees Christine working there, and tries to speak to her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> away in anger. He loudly pleads with her to [...] "listen" [...] to him, but his pleas literally fall on deaf ears.|$|R
