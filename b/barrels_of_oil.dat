For its part the Baytown Refinery located on this site is the largest refinery in the United States and is capable of processing 572,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> per day.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 2008, Williams and a {{consortium}} of oil companies led by Chevron Canada signed a deal to develop the Hebron oil field – the second largest oil field {{off the coast of}} the province with an estimated 700million <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> reserves, worth some $20billion in royalties and up to 3,500 jobs from the project. Construction is scheduled to start in 2012, with oil extraction by 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-east}} {{coast of}} the United States depended on these supplies of oil, importing both crude and refined products. Across most of Texas, there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil, and petroleum was typically moved from the south-west to the north-east coast using a mixture of sea freight and railroad transport. In early 1941, 70,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> were moved on the railroads each day, but this method was expensive, and {{the bulk of the}} oil was moved using barges, some with a capacity of up to 15,000 barrels, operating up and down rivers and the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> {{releases}} about 5.8 million BTU when burned, so that 5.8 MCF of gas (at {{the standard}} one thousand BTU per cubic foot) releases {{about the same}} energy as a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Sometimes gas containing 5.8 million BTU {{is defined as a}} [...] "barrel <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> equivalent for energy calculation purposes. When describing reserves or production, however, {{the oil and gas industry}} more commonly uses the rounded number of 6 MCF of gas (or 6 million BTU in the natural gas) as equal to one <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> equivalent.|$|R

50|$|Natural gas {{is burned}} {{to heat the}} bitumen in the tar sands in order to extract the liquid oil. The energy {{equivalent}} <b>of</b> one <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> in natural gas is needed to produce three <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> synthetic crude. Producing a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> from the oil sands requires approximately one thousand cubic feet of natural gas.|$|R
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Mired in {{economic}} problems, Cuba was {{aided by the}} election of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day. That same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E

25|$|As of 2000, Huntington Beach had {{produced}} over a billion <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and 845 billion cf of natural gas.

50|$|Two to {{four and}} a half <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> water are {{required}} to produce a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> from the tar sands. Water is used to create the slurry <b>of</b> bitumen and <b>oil</b> that is heated and processed. Water is also disposed of through Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage method of extraction where steam is pumped into the ground to cause bitumen to flow into a lower pipe for removal. For every <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> produced approximately one <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> water is contaminated in the process and deposited into a tailings pond.|$|R

50|$|In the oil industry, {{following}} {{the definition of}} the American Petroleum Institute, a standard <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> is often taken to mean the amount <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> that at a standard pressure (14.696 psi) and temperature (60 F) would occupy a volume of exactly 1 bbl. This standard <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> will occupy a different volume at different pressures and temperatures. A standard barrel in this context is thus not simply a measure of volume, but of volume under specific conditions. The task of converting this standard <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> to a standard cubic metre <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> is {{complicated by the fact that}} the standard cubic metre is defined by the American Petroleum Institute to mean the amount <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> that at 101.325 kPa and 15 C occupies 1 cubic metre. The fact that the conditions are not exactly the same means that an exact conversion is impossible unless the exact expansion coefficient of the crude is known, and this will vary from one crude oil to another.|$|R
25|$|Ships from Red Bay alone sent 6,000–9,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> to Europe {{every year}} during the peak of exploitation, while a further 8,000 or 9,000 barrels was {{produced}} in St. Modeste, Chateau Bay, and other harbors. Each ship averaged 1,000 barrels a season, a cargo that rivaled the Spanish galleons bringing back treasure from the Caribbean for sheer monetary value. So, on average, a minimum of 15,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> would have been produced each year, which would have involved a catch of at least 300 whales, or twenty per ship.|$|E
