The sticker uses a traffic light color scheme, with a red zone above 18 inches, and a large arrow pointing down with the words, “More Safe, Less Energy” changing from yellow at the midpoint to green at the bottom when the sash is closed completely. Surveys were conducted by collecting real-time sash position data provided by the campus’ <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> system (BMS). Data were collected for 10-day periods prior to sticker installation for select fume hoods, and one, two, and three months following sticker installation. The average sash height for each hood was calculated for each 10-day period. In the Engineering Science Building, average sash opening was ~15 inches prior to sticker installation, ~6.5 inches 3 months after sticker installation, and ~9.5 inches 23 months after sticker installation. In the California NansoSystems Institute building, average sash opening was ~7.5 inches prior to sticker installation, ~6 inches 3 months after sticker installation, and ~5 inches 23 months after sticker installation.|$|E

40|$|The {{last years}} have seen a few severe cases of {{structural}} damage to buildings in the Netherlands. A recent case was the shopping mall ‘t Loon in Heerlen. It would be beneficial if structural failures could be avoided, or at least be predicted. New satellite technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), proves {{that it is possible}} to detect structural deformation in buildings at the level of millimeters and to receive weekly updates. TU Delft has shown that for the Heerlen case, the deformation could already be detected years before the collapse. The InSAR data was also used for forensic research at Heerlen. The previously discussed developments resulted in the main research question of this thesis: How can InSAR data contribute to forensic engineering and <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> in general? The objective is to determine in which cases data provided by radar interferometry can be used, and how this data should be interpreted for <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> and forensic engineering. A literature review is conducted to identify the general properties and limitations of InSAR. To research the potential contribution to forensic engineering, an analysis of a damage database is made to determine InSAR’s potential as a forensic engineering tool. The database is assessed according to the guiding principles of forensic engineering using InSAR as laid out by this thesis: opportunistic character, large deformations and no sudden deformations. A research methodology for forensic engineering with InSAR is proposed and tested with a couple of case studies. <b>Building</b> <b>monitoring</b> is subdivided into object-driven <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> and data-driven <b>building</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Conventional <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> techniques are analysed to research the potential of InSAR as a <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> tool. To research object-driven <b>building</b> <b>monitoring,</b> a literature study is conducted to examine the different variables that cause building movement that influence the InSAR data. One dominant variable is analysed to research the relation between a variable and the InSAR data. To research data-driven buildings monitoring, general building limits for deformations are discussed. InSAR data of Delft, provided by the TerraSAR-x satellite, is used to analyse the potential of InSAR as a data-driven <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> tool. Deformation areas with very high deformation rates are examined to find out how to work with InSAR as a data-driven <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> tool. ? The development of the movements caused by torsion, inelastic deformation, fracture, second order effects and buckling are hard to detect with InSAR. Deformation caused by failure needs to be visible on the outer shell of the structure. Damage on the outer shell is visible to InSAR, as are damages that influence the supporting structure of the building. Deformations of the supporting structure can be damped in the outer shell; this is caused by the structural integrity. One fifth of the damage cases of the damage database have potential to be researched with InSAR. Only failures caused by aging and structural errors were suitable for research. Deformation measurements for buildings is one of the <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> fields in which InSAR can compete. Competitors in this field are Lidar, photogrammetry, levelling, and tachymetry. One of the main advantages of monitoring with InSAR is that large areas can be monitored with one measurement, and no one needs to be present at the site. Object-driven monitoring of buildings can be done by monitoring a building and identifying explanations for building movements. The movement of a Persistent Scatter point (PS-point) is caused by forces that work on a building and by the resistance of the building. Forces that do not change over time will not make the building move, unless there is degradation of the building elements. InSAR measurements are most suitable for vertical deflection monitoring because of the sensitivity of the satellite measurements. Factors that are suitable to monitor with InSAR are temperature, settlement and groundwater change. Data-driven monitoring is most suitable for monitoring foundation problems. The movements are often gradual over time, and large deformations limits are allowed. Attention should be paid to the translation of the top structure of the movement. Movements of 3 mm/year of a PS-point in vertical direction, or 1. 5 mm/year relative to another PS-point on a building, are alarming. InSAR can become an addition to conventional monitoring techniques for building research. For forensic engineering InSAR can indicate which parts of building elements were influenced by the failure, and when deformation started to develop. InSAR can support evidence for the possible cause of the failure, when the failure is expressed in deformation. For <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> InSAR may support the indication of the development of deformation that may cause damage. The monitoring of vertical deformations is limited by the sensitivity and the phase ambiguity. These boundaries make InSAR most suitable for monitoring gradual deformations, often found in deformations of foundations.

Real time building information collected from various sensors {{needs to be}} managed smartly and promptly, and the corresponding software system ideally should have enough intelligence to consume these inter-connected and domain oriented information in an autonomous way.

40|$|<b>Building</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{is one of}} the {{challenging}} issues in building construction, due to its high cost and the time consuming procedure for implementation and maintenance. It is also a critical issue that directly affects building security, safety, and management, energy saving, and tenants' convenience. Wireless sensor networking is a new networking technology that holds great promise for monitoring, evaluation and management of buildings. However, sufficient work has not been done in the application part of wireless sensor networks for <b>building</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In this thesis, we show how advanced wireless sensor technology can be used by building managers to monitor climate conditions, brightness level, lamp status and room occupancy in buildings {{as well as by the}} wireless sensor network administrator to monitor the nodes' connectivity and conditions in the network. We conceive of the <b>building</b> <b>monitoring</b> application as being divided into three main parts. First, wireless sensor hardware is programmed to process signals from sensors and transmit the data in a suitable format to a gateway/server application using multi-hop routing. The second task involves the forwarding of the signals sent by the wireless sensor nodes to the end user application by the gateway/server further retrieval and analysis. The third part consists of an end user application for processing the sensor data sent by the wireless sensor nodes and then forwarded by the gateway/server. The end user application visualizes the network topology, network connectivity graph and real time information of individual motes. In addition, this application provides the real time analysis of the data and functionalities for search and observation. Finally, the end user application allows users to analyze the rooms and network conditions by mining the database using different parameters such as the type of data and the time of data acquisition.
