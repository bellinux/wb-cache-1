40|$|ABSTRACT: Isochoric {{response}} of the hypoplastic constitutive model is improved by means of small modica-tions in the linear stiffness tensor and in the <b>barotropy</b> function. Comparisons with the Rowe theory of dilatancy and with the experimental results by Pradhan et al. are presented. The essential modication consists in increasing of shear stiffness. Moreover two anisotropic effects have been implemented: one in the linear part {{and one in the}} denition of <b>barotropy</b> factor. The modied hypoplastic model is presented using isomorphic variables P;Q. ...|$|E
40|$|Rayleigh-Taylor {{instability}} in a compressible fluid is reconsidered. The density {{is allowed to}} vary with pressure under the <b>barotropy</b> assumption. For the case with equal speeds of sound in the two superposed fluids, {{in order to give}} a non-trivial compressibility correction to the Rayleigh-Taylor growth rate, the compressibility correction is calculated to $O(g^ 2 /k^ 2 a^ 4) $. To this order, compressibility effects are found to reduce the growth rate...|$|E
40|$|The various plasma models - {{incompressible}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, compressible MHD model, incompressible Hall MHD model, compressible Hall MHD model, electron MHD model, compressible Hall MHD with electron inertia model - {{notwithstanding the}} diversity of the underlying physics, are shown to exhibit some common features in the Beltrami states like certain robustness with respect to the plasma compressibility effects (albeit in the <b>barotropy</b> assumption) and the Bernoulli condition. The Beltrami states for these models are deduced by minimizing the appropriate total energy while keeping the appropriate total helicity constant. A Hamiltonian formulation framework is used to carry out these variational problems...|$|E
40|$|Small {{amplitude}} {{compression and}} shock waves in granular materials were examined {{from the point}} of view of an analytical model and discrete element simulations. The barotropic behaviour of granular materials was discussed in terms of the mechanisms behind the formation of shock fronts. This discussion leads to the development of a one dimensional continuum model which was used together with the method of characteristics to describe the nature of shock waves. The model provides a relationship between the states of the material on either side of a shock and an equation that defines the velocity of shock waves. Discrete Element Modelling was used to demonstrate the shock forming process in granular materials and to confirm the predictions of the analytical model. During this process it is demonstrated that an assembly based on a linear contact model does not show any <b>barotropy</b> and consequently cannot describe dynamics of granular materials in terms of shock forming mechanisms. This observation may have important consequences in the application of the linear contact model to dynamic systems. The Hertz–Mindlin contact model did not suffer from this issue and was able to demonstrate both <b>barotropy</b> and shock formation. The DEM assemblies were characterised in terms of the material properties of the analytical model which allowed direct comparisons to be made. In all respects the analytical model performed well, predicting the change in state of the material and the shock wave speed with a good deal of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{instability}} of linear, nonaxisymmetric baroclinic {{waves in the}} radiative regions of a thin accretion disk is investigated with simplifying assumptions used in {{the representation of the}} structure of the basic state. As in stars with rotation laws deviating from rotation on cylinders, the departure from <b>barotropy</b> ('baroclinicity') resulting from such rotation feeds potential energy from the basic state into the kinetic energy of the baroclinic motions. The baroclinic instability is considered as a possible mechanism for driving turbulence in disks. Estimations of the Reynolds stress from baroclinic waves indicate that the degree of baroclinicity in stationary disk models is insufficient to account for the large viscosity inferred from observations of, e. g., cataclysmic variables...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} the CFD to cavitating flow around marine propellers operating in ship wake. Especially the emphasis was put on the tip vortex cavitation and the erosive cavitation around the trailing edge. This research found that adaptive mesh refinement methodology was effective for the resolution of tip vortex cavitation. Next, <b>barotropy</b> model and full cavitation model were validated, and show qualitatively agreement with the experimental results. Finally, simple four cavitation erosion indexes were applied for the estimation of the erosion risk and one index shows good agreement with the experimental results. It is concluded that the RANS CFD gives the valuable information for judging the erosion risk although its presumption accuracy and numerical stability need to be improved...|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of a fully nonlinear conserved curvature perturbation on large scales in Galileon-type scalar field models in two approaches. The first approach is based on the conservation of energy-momentum tensor of the Galileon field, which is also the familiar approach in understanding the conservation in k-essence or perfect fluid models. We show that the fluid corresponding to the Galileon field becomes perfect and barotropic on large scales, which is responsible to the conservation. The difference from k-essence model is that, besides the energy-momentum conservation, the Einstein equation must be employed in order to complete the proof of <b>barotropy.</b> In the second approach, we derive the fully non-perturbative action for the curvature perturbation ζ in Galileon model on large scales, and argue that ζ=const is indeed an exact solution on large scales. This conservation of curvature perturbation is important since it relates the later and the primordial universe.
