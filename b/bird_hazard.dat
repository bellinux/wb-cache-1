40|$|According to Cleary and Dolbeer (Wildlife hazards at airports, 2005), before {{solving a}} problem, {{it must be}} understood. A {{mandatory}} and first step toward understanding and solving the complex problem of collisions between aircrafts and birds is the collection and analysis of bird hazards. Therein lies the <b>bird</b> <b>hazard</b> report, as an important document that feeds the safety management system. Safety is typically managed from a systemic perspective in which the accident results from a chain of events. Despite {{the large amount of}} knowledge that exists about the dynamics of aircraft accidents, the investigation processes still identify in the accident chain practices and conditions that point to poor operational risk management. Risk management requires information from those who are the frontline, who usually are the first ones to know the hazards pertaining to their workplace. Pilots are usually the last domino piece before a mishap occurs, {{and most of the time}} they are also the last people who could avoid an accident. But they are also the ones who are always in contact with all sorts of hazards. The <b>Bird</b> <b>Hazard</b> Report allows the pilots to let safety professionals investigate each single hazard, and it is considered a big step in the accident prevention effort and consequently enhances the effectiveness of the report. The effectiveness of safety culture varies greatly among organizations. To a large extent, the variations may reflect organizational culture, the level of safety performances established by management policies, and especially practices accepted and practiced by its employees. Therefore, it is critical to understand civil pilots’ perceptions regarding the <b>Bird</b> <b>Hazard</b> Report as an important safety tool.

40|$|The {{presence}} of birds at retention/detention basins on or adjacent to an airport increases {{the probability of}} experiencing a wildlife strike.

The Michigan Wildlife Services program (WS) tested five types of grid material on three large detention basins to determine which materials could span up to 675 meters (2214. 5 feet) without center supports. Additionally, the line material could not sag substantially, because of water fluctuations of up to 1. 5 meters (5 feet) depending on the frequency and duration of rain events. If a line would touch {{the surface of the}} water, the surface tension would hold it in place until freeze-up. The material found to be superior in our tests, was a braided fishing line made of Spectra® called PowerPro. Grid lines were suspended in two directions on 30 -meter (100 foot) spacing. Preliminary results show a notable reduction in bird usage by waterfowl and gulls...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} five years, {{development}} of mobile bird detection radars for use as real-time aircraft bird strike avoidance systems has moved from research and development into active deployment as an operational technology. The MERLIN™ bird detection radar, with an update rate as frequent as once per second, is currently deployed as production-model technology with 15 systems operating in the U. S., Canada, Scotland, England and The Netherlands. Deployment challenges {{over the past two}} years have included “how” and “in what forms” to deliver the real-time and near real-time information to controllers, wildlife control units, pilots and decision makers so that <b>bird</b> <b>hazards</b> can be more reliably detected, strike risk reduced, bird control efficiency increased, and to develop detailed historical resource databases to support long-term management actions. MERLIN systems are currently being used in civil, military and landfill environments using widearea wireless distribution of data displays and products in real-time direct to airfield operations, planners and bird control units. On-going operating experience is helping to define specific concepts-of-operations (CONOPS) for each type of environment as to how the technology can be used and how and in what form bird radar information is integrated into current operational risk management and flight safety programs...|$|R
