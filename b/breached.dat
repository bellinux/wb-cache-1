Storm surge <b>breached</b> the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was <b>breached</b> on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal <b>breached</b> in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E.

Accurate computation of the flood flow magnitude and timing associated with a levee <b>breach</b> {{remains one of the}} most difficult and uncertain components of levee risk analysis.

40|$|<b>Breaching</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} form of embankment failure in the world. Due to overtopping, an embankment starts to <b>breach</b> when part of the embankment actually breaks away, leaving an opening for water to flood the land protected by the embankment. A <b>breach</b> can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused by surface erosion and/or headcut erosion in the embankment. The magnitude and extent of the losses depend highly on the rate of <b>breaching</b> of the embankment, which determines the discharge through the <b>breach</b> and the speed and rate of inundation of the valley or polder. Therefore, modelling of the <b>breach</b> evolution in embankments is of significant interest for damage assessment and risk analysis. It is also important {{for the development of}} early warning systems for dike and dam failures and of evacuation plans for people at risk. The <b>breach</b> flow {{plays an important role in}} the embankment <b>breaching</b> process, coupling the hydraulic process and the sediment transport process. During the <b>breaching</b> process, the flow overtops the entire embankment crest and generates the <b>breach</b> channel in the initial phase of the <b>breach</b> development. As the <b>breach</b> further develops, the <b>breach</b> flow goes only through the <b>breach</b> channel due to the decrease of the upstream water level. The <b>breach</b> flow can thus be classified as compound weir flow and weir flow, each having own special characteristics. In a <b>breach,</b> the helicoidal flow accelerates the sediment undermining at the toe of the <b>breach</b> slopes and widens the <b>breach</b> in the lateral direction of the embankment. A triangular hydraulic jump happens when the <b>breach</b> flow changes from supercritical flow into subcritical flow, with a triangular critical area at the toe of the <b>breach.</b> The triangular hydraulic jump works as a driving force to the headcut erosion in the <b>breaching</b> process and the scour hole development at the toe of embankment. According to the hydraulic energy loss in the <b>breach,</b> the discharge coefficients are deducted for both weir flow condition and compound weir flow condition. The resulting discharge coefficients can be used in the calculation of the <b>breach</b> discharge in a <b>breach</b> model. In the present study, five runs of <b>breach</b> experiments were conducted in a relative large laboratory flume. The experimental results clearly expose the hydrodynamic process and the erosion process in the <b>breaching</b> of the cohesive embankment. The <b>breaching</b> starts with the initial erosion of the embankment surface washing away the embankment surface. Due to the surface erosion at the toe of the embankment, the headcut erosion is stimulated on the embankment slope. While headcut migration stimulates the <b>breach</b> to develop in longitudinal direction, the lateral erosion triggers the <b>breach</b> to widen in lateral direction. Three types of erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion) contribute to the <b>breach</b> erosion process in the embankment, however, the <b>breach</b> flow is the driving force for the erosion. Sediment deposition in the <b>breaching</b> process, generally ignored in the embankment <b>breaching</b> studies, is also of importance. A mathematical model has been developed that couples weir flow and erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion). The <b>breaching</b> process is simplified into initial development, deepening development and widening development, corresponding with surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion, respectively. As the link between flow and embankment material, erosion plays a key role in the embankment <b>breach</b> model. Mathematical descriptions of the headcut migration and the lateral migration rate have been developed to simulate the <b>breaching</b> process in cohesive embankments. The headcut erosion and the lateral erosion are considered to occur in the form of clay blocks instead of in the form of individual clay particles.

40|$|Nowadays, every {{business}} transaction {{and many other}} activities in this world are {{used to create a}} credible contract to secure their legal rights and obligations. Even though a contract is well-established, sometimes there is a condition which makes the contract undesirable anymore, such as increasing in price material, changes in environment regulation or a better offer from other company. Therefore, conducting efficient <b>breach</b> is one of the solutions to obtain a higher surplus or even to prevent from a further loss. To perform efficient <b>breach,</b> the <b>breaching</b> party may <b>breach</b> the original contract only if the victim of the <b>breach</b> receive full compensation, thus there is no party which become worse off.

40|$|Current law and {{economics}} scholarship analyzes efficient <b>breach</b> cases monolithically.

However, by simplistically grouping efficient <b>breach</b> cases as of a single kind, the prior literature overlooks that gainseeking <b>breaches</b> might be different from loss-avoiding <b>breaches.</b> To capture these different motives, we designed a novel game called Contract-Breach Game where we exogenously varied the reasons for the <b>breach</b> — pursuing a gain or avoiding a loss — under a specific performance remedy. Results from an incentivized laboratory experiment indicate that the motives behind the <b>breach</b> induce sizable differences in behavior; subjects are less willing to renegotiate when facing gain-seeking than loss-avoiding <b>breaches,</b> and the compensation premium obtained by the promisee is higher. Our analysis suggests that inequality aversion is an important driver of our results; indeed, inequality-averse subjects accept low offers more often in cases of loss-avoiding <b>breaches</b> than gain-seeking <b>breaches.</b> These results give us insight into the preferences and expectations of ordinary people in a case of a <b>breach...</b>|$|R
