5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> for three months to aid the healing of the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis had {{remained}} sober the entire tour and maintained positive disposition during shows. Navarro, however, was growing tired of touring, {{and that was}} beginning to grate on his fellow band-mates. Kiedis suffered an additional injury in Prague after falling off the stage while attempting to execute a back flip. He was forced to wear a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> {{for the next few}} shows, which restricted his actions to the area around his microphone. After shows in Paris and London, the band returned home to Los Angeles. Kiedis began taking drugs once again, though he forced himself to discontinue after several weeks. The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.|$|E
5|$|While {{the injury}} {{did not require}} surgery, Raymond {{retained}} the <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> for six weeks and was largely immobile for two months. In late July, he received a text message from Boychuk, explaining that his intention was not to injure with the hit. Unable to train on the ice or with weights, Raymond spent the 2011 off-season largely inactive, {{with the exception of}} cardiovascular workouts. Five-and-a-half months after sustaining his back injury, Raymond was set to return to the Canucks' lineup for a game against the Predators on December 1, 2011. However, the team failed to file the proper paperwork to the NHL by the 5 p.m. deadline, delaying Raymond's return until the following game. He recorded six points (three goals and three assists) in his first seven games back, but struggled to produce offensively {{for the remainder of the}} season. In March 2012, he was made a healthy scratch for the first time in three years.|$|E

Then he would come <b>back,</b> <b>braced</b> and refreshed, and try his luck again.|$|R
25|$|One {{month after}} {{making his first}} class debut, Lee was chosen to {{represent}} the Australian A team on a tour to South Africa. He claimed two wickets but in that very match, stress fractures in his back from the previous injury had re-opened and Lee was in a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> for over three months.|$|E
25|$|Michael Clarke {{returned}} to the crease {{at the start of}} Day 2 with a <b>back</b> <b>brace,</b> and put on a 51-run partnership with Steve Smith, before a rain delay left Smith stranded just 2 runs short of a century. The rain consistently fell and lunch was taken early. The players returned after lunch and Smith brought up his century in the first ball. Play was delayed once again just 2 overs later. Play resumed again and Clarke reached his own century as the pair quickly added another 50 before yet another rain delay. Play continued and more quick runs were added as Smith reached 150. Clarke then was dismissed by Karn Sharma for 128 and stumps were called just one over later because of bad light. Shami, Aaron and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.|$|E

NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) appeals to Jenna to allow Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) birthday celebration {{to be combined}} with hers, [...] as Tracy has never celebrated a birthday. Jenna dislikes the idea, but plays along. On her birthday, Jenna, upset that no one pays attention to her, decides to fake an injury to get sympathy, to no avail. To get attention, Jenna is seen riding a wheelchair, but this fails, so she gets fed up with everyone. Tracy sees Jenna jumping out of a wheelchair to get attention and tells her that his birthday wish was that she get better, after seeing her wear a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> at the birthday party.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} during the European tour, guitarist Carlos Alomar ripped a {{ligament}} in his leg, an injury that caused him to change his on-stage character. Said Alomar, [...] " [...] had to change my character into the mad, limping Mad Max reject with spiky hair. I went to a chiropractor and asked him {{for a lot of}} metal stuff -- leg <b>braces,</b> <b>back</b> <b>braces</b> and everything. Now I'll be adding more metal as the show progresses." ...|$|R

500|$|Gonzalez {{retired from}} the army due to a {{disability}} in December 2012. He wore a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> and complained of pain in his foot, though friends stated he never disclosed {{the nature of his}} injury. A family member said he had been injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Iraq and had been prescribed both antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication, though he was suspected to have since ceased taking the medication. Gonzalez' former step-son said that Gonzalez was [...] "a very good guy" [...] who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A family member said Gonzalez was on patrol in Iraq when his Humvee was struck, adding that [...] "a portion of his foot was amputated [...] and the evidence is the limp you see in the video of him running across the White House lawn." [...] According to a neighbour he used a cane and was taking [...] "very strong medication".|$|E
500|$|Berry overcame several {{physical}} ailments {{during his}} football career, a fact he became famous for, {{but one that}} according to Berry was often exaggerated by the media. He was skinny and injury prone, such that when his college teammates saw {{him for the first}} time they sarcastically dubbed him, [...] "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy". Reportedly, because one leg was shorter than the other, Berry had to wear padding inside his shoe in order to walk properly. However, according to Berry, this was not entirely true. In actuality, bruised nerves near the sacroiliac joint occasionally caused misalignment in his back, which in turn affected his legs and caused one to become slightly shorter; it was not a permanent condition. To alleviate this, he wore a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> for 13 years in the NFL. That he required specialized shoes was a myth, which Berry says was perpetuated by an overzealous information director with the Colts when Berry tried to compensate for his condition by putting something in his shoe during training camp.|$|E

50|$|While {{there is}} no {{explanation}} for what causes Scheuermann's Disease, {{there are ways to}} treat it. For decades {{there has been a lot}} of controversy surrounding treatment options. For less extreme cases, manual medicine, physical therapy and/or <b>back</b> <b>braces</b> can help reverse or stop the kyphosis before it does become severe. Because the disease is often benign, and because back surgery includes many risks, surgery is usually considered a last resort for patients. In severe or extreme cases, patients may be treated through an extensive surgical procedure in an effort to prevent the disease from worsening or harming the body.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, Sothern {{was injured}} while {{appearing}} in a Jacksonville, Florida, stock production of Everybody Loves Opal when a fake tree fell on her back. The accident {{left her with}} a fractured lumbar vertebra and damaged nerves in her legs. Her injuries required hospitalizations where she was put in traction. She was also required to wear <b>back</b> <b>braces.</b> Due to her forced inactivity, Sothern gained {{a considerable amount of}} weight. In addition to her physical pain, Sothern also developed depression. Sothern credited her [...] "optimistic belief" [...] and Roman Catholic faith for getting her through. For the remainder of her life, Sothern suffered from numbness in her feet and required a cane to walk.|$|R
2500|$|Body casts, which {{cover the}} trunk of the body, and in some cases the neck up to or {{including}} the head (see Minerva Cast, below) or one or more limbs, are rarely used today, and are most commonly used in the cases of small children, who cannot be trusted to comply with a <b>back</b> <b>brace,</b> or in cases of radical surgery to repair an injury or other defect. A body cast which encases the trunk (with [...] "straps" [...] over the shoulders) is usually referred to as a body jacket. These are often very uncomfortable.|$|E
2500|$|Seemingly free {{of injury}} {{for the first}} time in years, Graf began the year by winning the Australian Open, where she {{defeated}} Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final with the loss of only two games. Graf later stated it was the best tennis she had ever played in a Grand Slam final. She then won her next four tournaments in Tokyo, Indian Wells, Delray Beach and Miami respectively. In the Miami final, she lost her first set of the year—to Natasha Zvereva—after winning 54 consecutive sets. In the Hamburg final, she lost {{for the first time}} in 1994 after 36 consecutive match victories, losing to Sánchez Vicario in three sets. She then won her eighth German Open, but there were signs that her form was worsening as she almost lost to Julie Halard in a quarterfinal. As the defending champion Graf lost in straight sets to Mary Pierce in the French Open semifinal. This was followed by a first-round straight-sets loss at Wimbledon to Lori McNeil, her only loss at Wimbledon between 1991 and 1997 and her first loss in a first round Grand Slam tournament in ten years. Graf still managed to win San Diego the following month but aggravated a long-time back injury in beating Sánchez Vicario in the final. Graf developed a bone spur at the base of her spine due to a congenital condition of the sacroiliac joint. She began to wear a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> and was unsure about playing the US Open but elected to play while receiving treatment and stretching for two hours before each match. She made it to the final and took the first set against Sánchez Vicario but lost the next two sets [...] — Sanchez Vicario's last victory over Graf. In the middle of the second set, Graf suffered back spasms while reaching for a ball in the ad court. She took the following nine weeks off, returning only for the Virginia Slims Championships where she lost in straight sets to Pierce in the quarterfinal.|$|E

500|$|Metal corsets (also {{known as}} iron corsets) are {{a type of}} {{historical}} corset or bodice made entirely out of metal, usually iron or steel. The metal corset was popularly {{claimed to have been}} introduced to France by Catherine de' Medici in the 16th century, although this is now considered a myth. The idea that such garments were worn for fashionable purposes is debatable, with fashion historians now regarding such claims sceptically. Many of the original metal bodices that have survived are now believed to have been intended for medical purposes as orthopaedic support garments and <b>back</b> <b>braces.</b> Such garments were described by the French army surgeon Ambroise Paré in the sixteenth century as a remedy for the [...] "crookednesse of the Bodie." ...|$|R

50|$|One large {{issue in}} bracing for {{scoliosis}} is patient compliance, as mentioned above. Compliance is often {{impacted by the}} other above-mentioned factors (psycho-social comfort, exercise), {{but there are others}} also, including ability to eat and move, pain, and physical deformation. <b>Back</b> <b>braces,</b> especially the Boston brace, puts a great deal of pressure on the abdomen and can make digestion uncomfortable. Scoliosis braces, like those used for correcting post-operatively and for fractures, inhibit motion to a large extent, though percentages are difficult to find. Patients frequently complain about the inability to tie their own shoes, sit on the floor, etc. Bracing is also painful, though the body can adapt to tolerate the pain. Braces can also deform the patient's existing bone structures, most notably the hips, though there have been complaints about rib cage deformities as well.|$|R

50|$|Hiding one's breasts {{is likely}} the most {{challenging}} piece of the gender illusion puzzle for a drag king. While some are small-breasted and may succeed using a tight sports bra, many kings resort {{to one of the}} following, or several of the following used in conjunction with other methods: Ace bandages; duct tape; soft, hard, or ribbed <b>back</b> <b>braces</b> (worn backwards); and compression shirts and vests. Some use a method involving cutting a hole in the crotch of pantyhose for the head and making sleeves out the legs. This creates a tight stocking shirt that compresses the breasts. Duct tape is the most skin damaging method of binding. Prolonged use has resulted, in some cases, of tearing off skin and excessive blister after removal, or stretching of the breast tissue and skin after long-term use. Another damaging binding technique, but more immediately so, is the use of cling wrap. This method has caused Kings to fall unconscious while performing.|$|R
