25|$|United Automobile Services {{had five}} coaches with Plaxton Elite bodies, but the {{remaining}} 218 LHs ordered for this fleet were standard ECW <b>bus</b> <b>bodies</b> for services in north-east England. A number of second-hand buses were also acquired.|$|E
25|$|To further {{solve the}} problem of lost time loading/unloading, by 1927 the {{corporation}} was stipulating two door <b>bus</b> <b>bodies</b> with wider doors, allowing simultaneous boarding and alighting - in through the rear (being at least 32' wide), and out through the front (28').|$|E
25|$|Because the charabanc motor {{coaches were}} not in use in the winter months, some would be re-fitted with {{single-deck}} <b>bus</b> <b>bodies</b> and put into route service, {{while some of the}} remaining charabancs would be used in route service in case of extreme need. During the tram electrification programme, some were refitted with truck bodies to assist the works.|$|E
40|$|Bending {{stiffness}} is {{an important}} factor to determine the mechanical performance of <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> skeleton. Traditional computational method for bending stiffness is sensitive to local deformation and load applications, which often results in great fluctuation to the computational results. This paper proposes an advanced computational method for bending stiffness based on deformable feature curve of <b>bus</b> <b>body.</b> Firstly, the feature point collection from the deformation of <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> under bending conditions is extracted. Secondly, all the feature points are processed by means of coordinate transformation and then the feature curve of <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> deformation is established via piecewise cubic curve-fitting. Lastly, the expected value of bending stiffness of <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> is obtained through the stiffness samples which are computed according to the feature curve. Furthermore, a FORTRAN program is written to implement the method. Compared with the traditional methods, the validity and stability of this method are verified via several numerical examples. This method is meaningful to the conceptual design of a <b>bus</b> <b>body,</b> as the experimental measures are difficult to be carried out in the early stage...|$|R

50|$|It was {{originated}} from the <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> manufacturing business of Metal Sections, known as TI Metsec {{in the late}} 1970s, the present day Metsec plc. Metal Sections, as the name suggests, produced prefabricated sections of metal for customers {{for a variety of}} products. In the early days, Metal Sections was not involved in the <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> business, however, after supplying framing sections for other <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> builders, they decided to get into the business themselves.|$|R
25|$|For the {{standard}} LH the 41-seat Plaxton coach and 43-seat ECW bus were most widely used; the <b>bus</b> <b>bodies</b> manufactured in Belfast by Alexander for Ulsterbus had 45 seats, East Midland Motor Services' ten 1969 buses {{were the only}} ones with Willowbrook bodies, as built they had 45 seats but with a 3+2 seating arrangement in three rows forward of the rear bench, making room for a pram pen, they were also unusual in carrying no grille badge, which puzzled the author of this sentence when he first came across a seemingly unidentifiable bus as a schoolboy in the mid 1970s. The LHS was produced as both buses and coaches with 26 to 35 seats. The LHL had up to 53 seats as a coach or 55 as a bus. Between 1975 and 1982 Vanplan built eight with delivery van bodies.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 1921, the Orange Bus Line began service along Merrick Road from Freeport in Nassau County to Rosedale in Queens {{near the}} county border. On September 15, 1921, the route was {{extended}} west and {{north to the}} Jamaica business district. In 1922, Republic Motor Truck Company dealer Henry B. Carter sold two truck chassis fitted with <b>bus</b> <b>bodies</b> to the operators of the Orange Line. On February 13, 1922, the Orange Line ceased operations, and the buses reverted to Carter's ownership. Carter's new Bee-Line Bus Company operated its first bus, without a franchise, on February 19, between the Rosedale station and Jamaica. This was the predecessor to the Q5. With only two buses, the route originally operated on half-hour headways. In addition to Jamaica-Rosedale service, on April 3, 1926, Bee-Line began operating service along Merrick Road between Jamaica and Freeport, Long Island, replacing the eastern portion of the Brooklyn-Freeport Line streetcar. Bee Line originally operated from 163rd Street and Jamaica Avenue in the Jamaica business district. On October 1, 1930, the Bee Line routes began terminating at the newly constructed Jamaica Union Bus Terminal near its former terminus. The new bus terminal was located at Jamaica Avenue and New York Boulevard (now Guy R. Brewer Boulevard), adjacent to the now-closed Union Hall Street Long Island Rail Road station.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1913 it was {{documented}} that the Melbourne Motor Omnibus Co Ltd employed over 100 people.

5000|$|In 1925, Luce {{had sold}} a {{customer}} a Ford Model T {{with a wooden}} bus body; the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers. Due {{to a combination of}} unsatisfactory construction quality of the <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> and the rough conditions of the rural Georgia roads, the wooden <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle. [...] Driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers, Luce sought input to develop a stronger <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> capable of surviving unimproved roads. [...] In place of wood, Luce constructed his <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> from steel and sheetmetal; wood was used as a secondary material. [...] Completed in 1927, the bus was put into use as a school bus.|$|R

The Red Line connects to the Orange Line at [...] station. The Orange Line feeds about 15,000 new boardings into the Red Line at the North Hollywood terminus. Currently, little chance exists for further underground Red Line extension west from its northern terminus.|$|E
2500|$|The single-decker ECW {{body was}} just [...] wide and used some similar styling {{elements}} to those {{built for the}} heavier Bristol MW. The <b>bus</b> <b>bodies</b> were [...] high but the coaches were a little taller at the length varied depending on the chassis and whether it was to bus or coach style (see table below). A forward entrance was provided opposite the driver's position. Seats were forward-facing in pairs, but where wheel arches protruded above {{the floor of the}} bus body, the seats were turned sideways to give sufficient leg room.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday 25 January it was {{reported}} that the Lord Mayor of Melbourne (Councillor Hennessy) and members of the Melbourne City Council were treated to a bus ride to St Kilda and back on one of the Daimler buses that the Melbourne Omnibus Motor Co was about to put into service. By the end of February another shipment of the Daimler buses was to be exported to the Melbourne Motor Omnibus Co from London.

40|$|As a bus developer, Scania {{focus to}} {{construct}} a safe vehicle for the passengers, i. e. high strength of the bus structure and good comfort, which is also profitable for the operator, i. e. high passenger capacity and low fuel consumption. The trade-off when developing a <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> structure is to get both high stiffness and low weight. The <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> including exterior panels plays together with the chassis an important role for the stiffness of the bus. By gathering knowledge about how various exterior panels affects the stiffness of the <b>bus</b> <b>body,</b> {{the design of the}} panels can be optimized with respect to high stiffness and low weight. Also from a calculation point of view is it of interest to know how important different panels are for the stiffness of the <b>bus</b> <b>body,</b> in order to make conscious simplifications in the calculation model. The aim with this master thesis was to investigate how the stiffening plate, side windows and roof sheet influence the strength of the <b>bus</b> <b>body.</b> How the thickness of the side windows affects the stiffness of the <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> is also investigated. The investigations were made as a relative comparison between a complete bus and comparison models.   The results showed that exterior panels participate in distributing load. By distributing the load, the load uptake gets more efficient since a bigger part of the bus structure is used to take up the load. The side windows affect the stiffness for all tested load cases, with increased importance for the load case where a gravity field is applied in the longitudinal direction, for the torsion load case and when a load is applied to the power train in vertical direction. The roof sheet has a high impact on the stiffness in the torsion load case, but has negligible influence on the stiffness of the <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> for the other tested load cases. The stiffening plate has little influence on the stiffness of the <b>bus</b> <b>body</b> in general and is negligible for all tested load cases except for when a lateral load is applied as either a gravity field or locally to the power train.   Thinner side windows are shown to have a positive influence on the stiffness of the <b>bus</b> <b>body...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Minibuses {{and short}} {{wheelbase}} midibuses {{have not been}} used in large numbers by Lothian, although some midibuses had previously been used on less busy routes. Ten Seddon Pennine IV-236 were acquired in 1973. These were replaced by 18 Leyland Cubs with Duple Dominant <b>Bus</b> <b>bodies</b> in 1981, which in turn gave way to 12 9m Dennis Darts with Alexander Dash bodies in 1992. When the Darts were delivered {{they were the only}} non-Leyland vehicles in the fleet. [...] In 2001 five of these Darts were sold to Yorkshire Traction. [...] The ones that remained were gradually cascaded to the Mac Tours subsidiary until their replacement by six Optare Solo SRs in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Bodies were fitted by {{different}} manufacturers, who adapted {{them to the}} needs of different operators. Bodies could be fitted out as buses, coaches or dual purpose buses which could be used for coach services when traffic demanded. <b>Bus</b> <b>bodies</b> usually came from the Eastern Coach Works (ECW), which was owned by the same Transport Holding Company. This was a government-owned company but Leyland had acquired a 25% share in 1965. Plaxton bodies were preferred for coaches. Other manufacturers of bodies for the LH were Walter Alexander, Duple, East Lancashire, Marshall, Northern Counties, Weymann and Willowbrook. The only Weymann body was fitted to the first LHS6L built (LHX003) to the orders of Western Welsh. [...] Weymann had been closed in 1965 and the body was originally mounted on an Albion Nimbus delivered to Western Welsh in 1961; modifications included extending the body wheelbase to match the chassis and fitting a Lodekka style grille to provide cooling for the radiator. WWOC numbered their LHS 1 and registered it MBO1F. It later passed to Thornes of Selby and is currently preserved.|$|E
