In example, 58% of the surveyed in May 2012 had this belief. A later poll for the German Marshall Fund published in September 2012, even found 71% of Poles believed an immediate switch to the euro would <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the Polish economy.|$|E

Misrepresentations generally do not render a contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of common mistake or frustration; it makes a contract voidable at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E

Huntsman replied that China can't be taken to the WTO and starting a trade war with them would <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the American economy. The debate itself was criticised for not spending sufficient time on the Eurozone crisis, with only the very last question devoted to it, which only Huntsman was given the opportunity to answer.|$|E

The ruling Law and Justice Party opposes euro adoption. Former PM Donald Tusk has said that he may agree to a referendum on euro participation in order to gain their support for a constitutional amendment.

25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the economy.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the sources}} agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a miller named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller. The {{historian}} Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth. The novelist Sir Walter Scott, who took {{a keen interest in}} the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that [...] "there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed", as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with whisky, Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement. They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid £10. Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight on the victim stifled movement—and thus the ability to make noise—while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been [...] "practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics".|$|E

[...] Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as [...] "terrifically wonderful and intimidating". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. [...] In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, [...] "it might <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> their future career." [...] The parents politely informed these callers [...] "We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't share your concerns." [...] When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: [...] "This is not litigation material. This is nothing." [...] In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: [...] "It's clear the Church doesn't like the show—but in my opinion that kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues. So I take a certain pride in that." ...|$|E
