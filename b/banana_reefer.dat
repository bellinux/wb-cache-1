Laeisz. The outbreak of World War Ⅰ {{made it impossible for}} the company to commission these two ships for employment in its own banana trade. With “Poseidon” Laeisz commissioned 1923 its first Steamer for its own liner service to the SAWC and 1926 the last four-masted barque Padua was built for FL. This newbuilding signaled the end of the Flying P-Liner area which terminated with the end of World War II when “Padua” was given to the USSR, still trading as “Krusenstern” to this day.|$|E

And while they may have no wish for the container lines to become involved in their trades, it is already becoming ever more difficult to justify shipping on reefers, such is the rate differential.
