5|$|The {{advent of}} steel frame {{structural}} systems allowed completely vertical construction; {{but as with}} many skyscrapers of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple setbacks at increasing heights, which served to allow additional light into the ever-deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. At night, the setbacks are upwardly lit by floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements. The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the Wrigley <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> Jewelers <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> Palmolive <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> LaSalle-Wacker Building, and the Tribune Tower.|$|E
