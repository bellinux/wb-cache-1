60|$|To {{begin at}} the west, where the border is on Romsey, Michelmersh and Farley, the Romsey road, {{formerly}} the direct road from Winchester to Salisbury, running through it, beside Ampfield Church and village. This is high ground, and Ampfield Wood extends along it to the borders of Hursley Park. It is chiefly of oak, fir, and beech, and on the southern side are the fine arcades of beechwood that Mr. Keble used to call Hursley Cathedral. From {{one point in the}} wood long sight can distinguish a sort of needle which is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral. The wood is very old, probably primeval, as it is guarded in the oldest notices of the Manor of Merdon, and it contains a flora of its own, in which may be mentioned that rare and beautiful Melittis Melissophyllum, <b>bastard</b> <b>balm,</b> like a purple and white archangel. The bilberry is plentiful there and all along the beautiful park-like road to Romsey and Salisbury. The church, raised above the wayside fountain, and the churchyard full of very beautiful varieties of pine, still nestles into the wood, and there is a charming view over the open country towards the south.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bastard</b> <b>balm</b> grows {{well as an}} edging in a sunny {{woodland}} or as a scrubby border. It {{is attractive}} to insects. Cultivars include 'Royal Velvet Distinction'.|$|E
50|$|In the New Forest in England, P. longifolia shares its habitat {{with wild}} {{daffodil}} (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood-sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), <b>bastard</b> <b>balm</b> (Melittis melissophyllum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa), columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).|$|E
50|$|Melittis melissophyllum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. Its common name is <b>bastard</b> <b>balm.</b> It is the only species in the monotypic genus Melittis. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Greek melitta, which is in turn from melissa ("a bee").|$|E
50|$|The {{woods to}} the south of the manor house, {{on the banks of the}} Helford River, were {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1972 for their biological characteristics. The 72.2 ha site is of importance due to its population of Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea). Other notable species within the woods include the nationally uncommon <b>Bastard</b> <b>Balm</b> (Melittis melissophyllum) and the nationally rare mosses Fissidens curnowii and Hookeria lucens.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{wildfires}} of 1994 and 1998, pines {{dominated the}} landscape: Pinus nigra, Pinus halepensis Pinus sylvestris and {{a lesser extent}} Pinus pinea. After the fires Quercus humilis and Quercus ilex sprouts became the most visible trees. Where there is no forest predominate meadow Aphyllantion or Brachypodium and shrubs specially Dorycnum pentaphyllum and rosemary. It is remarkable the presence of he gypsophylous plant named ruac (Ononis tridentata) in some small gypsum patchs and the <b>bastard</b> <b>balm</b> (Melittis melissophyllum). Also interesting are the examples of yellow foxglove (Digitalis lutea), Primulas (Primula acaulis) and the broom (Genista cinerea).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to trap the {{volatiles}} released from whole frozen and dry aerial parts, and, separately, from different organs (leaves, stems, corolla and calyx) of <b>bastard</b> <b>balm</b> (Melittis melissophyllum L., Lamiaceae) populations collected in Italy and Slovakia by HS-SPME, and to identify the headspace constituents responsible for the characteristic aroma impression by GC/FID and GC/MS techniques. Among more than 100 volatile components detected, the C 8 alcohol oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol, responsible for the typical mushroom-like odor, and the phenolic coumarin, with a characteristic sweet and creamy vanilla bean odor, {{played a major role}} in the aroma of whole aerial parts and different plant organ samples. In particular, dry calyx parts could be proposed as flavoring agent in food products as mushroom aroma enhancer. Multivariate chemometric techniques, such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis, were used to characterize the sample populations according to the geographical origin and processing of plant material...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method for}} in vitro propagation of <b>bastard</b> <b>balm</b> by enhanced axillary shoot branching has been developed. The material to establish in vitro culture was shoot tips collected from three-year-old plants in May. The shoots obtained from initial explants {{were placed on}} MS/B 5 medium containing 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg/l BA with 0. 01 mg/l NAA or without the auxin. The highest number of shoots per explant was obtained on the medium with 1. 0 mg/l BA (3. 9 shoots per explant). For the rooting of shoots ½ MS/B 5 with IBA (0. 25, 0. 50 and 1. 0 mg/l) medium was used. The medium without plant growth regulators served as a control. The best root regeneration was observed on the medium without IBA (87. 1 % of cuttings rooted). IBA used in the medium for shoot rooting affected the morphological traits of obtained microcuttings but not affected their weight. Irrespective of auxin concentration in this medium, obtained microcuttings acclimated in ex vitro conditions very well...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} changes in the species composition and structure of natural tree stands in the Białowieża Forest (BF), which occurred in the years 1975 – 2012, as well as to evaluate their trends, directions and rate. The study was carried out on 121 permanent research plots (50 × 50 m), which represented the most important forest phytocenoses in BF, i. e. fresh pine-whortleberry forest Vaccinio vitisidaeae-Pinetum Sokoł. 1980, fresh mixed spruce-reed grass forest Calamagrostio-Piceetum Sokoł. 1968, oligotrophic form of hornbeam - <b>bastard</b> <b>balm</b> forest Melitti-Carpinetum Sokoł. 1976, different forms of lindenhornbeam forest: Tilio-Carpinetum Tracz. 1962, alder-ash forest Fraxino-Alnetum W. Mat. 1952 and sub-boreal spruce forest on bog moss Sphagno girgenshonii-Piceetum Polak. 1962. On the plots selected, there was measured the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all trees, as well as every tree and shrub up to 1. 3 m high was counted and described with reference to species. The measurements and observations were regularly repeated every 10 – 15 years. The results showed that over the last period of nearly 40 years, there has increased a share of common hornbeam Carpinus betulus L. in the structure of forest stands in numerous BF associations. This tree species has expanded into different forest habitats including poor, medium fertile and wetland sites. The results obtained indicate a trend towards formation of linden-hornbeam forests in BF phytocenoses. The most evident changes were recorded in hornbeam – <b>bastard</b> <b>balm</b> forest. In natural conditions of the majority of forest associations analysed, there prevailed hornbeam trees in forest regeneration, except for the stands in fresh mixed pine forest and spruce forest on bog moss. In the latter two cases, hornbeam showed signs of its presence in the last observation period. Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) retreated into oligotrophic forest associations. In the recent decades, spruce populations have been dramatically reduced in the stands in mixed coniferous and different kinds of broadleaved forests. There have also decreased a share of light-demanding tree species, such as Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and silver birch (Betula pendula L.) in BF tree stands, including their regeneration-layer. Especially, Scots pine regeneration has not been successful. In the short period of time (about 15 years) there has been observed rapid and outsized reduction of ash Fraxinus excelsior L. populations in natural conditions of alder-ash forests. All through the last 10 – 15 years, there has been also observed increased rate of change in stand species composition. The trend and rate of change in stand species composition point out to a possibility of human intervention towards stimulation of natural regeneration so as to preserve valuable populations of threatened tree species in the Białowieża Forest.
