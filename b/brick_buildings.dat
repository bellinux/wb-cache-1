5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> in the town. The principal <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also {{a considerable number of}} Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is of architectural interest because it still retains architectural elements from many previous centuries, including a 14th-century sacristy wall and 16th-century tower {{connected with the}} King's Council of the North. It {{is also one of}} only two intact 17th-century <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> that survive in the city, the other being Alderman Fenwick's House.|$|E
5|$|The {{office to}} the north of the head keeper house is a small square room raised on short {{concrete}} pillars, constructed of timber framed fibro clad walls and corrugated fibrous cement roof. It has a continuous band of windows. The last three buildings, the garage, powerhouse and fuel store, are small <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> with metal roofs and reinforced concrete floors.|$|E

5|$|Caversham has no {{secondary}} schools, {{although it}} does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, {{at the corner of}} South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate– the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure– is the suburb's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury it was {{the custom}} for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, {{following}} a lamp-lit procession through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted tapers carried by mourners. The buildings {{on the west side}} of the market place, low cottages with thatched roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising the houses were eventually replaced with <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> with tile roofs.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} Prospect Park Zoo, {{prepared}} by Aymar Embury II, were announced in March 1934. The area between the Wild Fowl Pond and former Deer Paddock {{on the east side}} of the park, situated across the East Drive from the Menagerie, was chosen as the site for the new zoo. Architect Embury designed a half circle of six <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> centered on a seal pool. Built of red brick with limestone trim, the buildings featured bas-relief scenes from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{building in}} Sale is Eyebrow Cottage. Built around 1670, {{it was originally}} a yeoman farmhouse {{and is one of}} the earliest <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> in the area. Its name is derived from the decorative brickwork above the windows. It was built in Cross Street, which at the time was a separate village from Sale. Of the twenty-one conservation areas in Trafford, two are in Sale: Ashton upon Mersey and Brogden Grove.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} in 1846 was 3,500. <b>Brick</b> <b>buildings</b> included a jail and court house, {{and a large}} barracks had also been built. London had a fire company, a theatre, a large Gothic church, nine other churches or chapels, and two market buildings. In 1844, a fire destroyed 150 buildings but most had been rebuilt by 1846. Connection with other communities was by road; stages ran daily. A weekly newspaper was published; the post office received mail daily.|$|E
5|$|Before Indiana {{became a}} state, the Indiana Territory had two governors. William Henry Harrison, the first governor, built a plantation-style home in Vincennes, and named it Grouseland for its many birds. Built in 1804, {{it was one}} of the first <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> in the territory. The home is still {{preserved}} and is a National Historic Landmark. Thomas Posey, the territory's second governor, had a home built in Corydon, but lived there only briefly before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a room in a boarding house. The Posey House is preserved as part of a National Historic District.|$|E

5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple <b>brick</b> <b>buildings.</b> The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons across the United States and Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and <b>brick</b> <b>buildings.</b> After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} an upper part depicting the halo phenomenon viewed vertically and a lower part depicting the city as it must have appeared viewed from Södermalm in the late Middle Ages. The medieval urban conglomeration, today {{part of the old}} town Gamla stan, is rendered using a bird's-eye view. The stone and <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E

5000|$|On October 6, 1892, the Kinney's {{production}} and logistics complex on West 22nd Street was gutted by a five-alarm fire. It was supposed {{that the fire}} originated around 5:30 a.m. in the basement storage area of the four-story <b>brick</b> <b>building,</b> address No. 521-525 West 22nd Street, from a gas leak that was ignited by a gas-powered chandelier (gasalier).

5|$|This strong, long-tracked wedge tornado {{touched down}} in extreme {{southwest}} Greene County to the west-southwest of Tishabee, near the Sumter County border, at 5:30p.m. CDT (2230 UTC) and moved northeast. After having touched {{down in a}} rural area {{on the east side of}} the Tombigbee River, the tornado quickly intensified to high-end EF2 strength along County Road 69. Moving northeast, the tornado damaged a barn and destroyed two small churches and at least four mobile homes. While crossing U.S. Highway 43, the tornado destroyed a large metal outbuilding, caused substantial roof and wall damage to several <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> and homes. Hundreds of trees were downed in this area as well. Two people sustained minor injuries in Greene County as the tornado continued along a primarily rural path northeast, moving across the Black Warrior River and into Hale County.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Almshouses on East Street {{were founded}} by Robert Gray in 1615 for poor single women. The red <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> bear {{the arms of}} Robert Gray, dated 1635, and another arms of the Merchant Tailors. A small room is used as chapel and has {{original}} benches and a painted ceiling. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. St Margaret's Almshouses was founded as a leper colony in the 12th century. Glastonbury Abbey acquired the patronage of the hospital in the late 13thcentury and rebuilt it as almshouses in the early 16th century. From 1612 to 1938 the building continued {{to be used as}} almshouses, cared for by a local parish. In the late 1930s it was converted into a hall of offices for the Rural Community Council and accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. It later fell into disrepair until the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust with Falcon Rural Housing purchased and restored it for use as four dwellings of social housing. It is a gradeII* listed building.|$|E
5|$|In 1038, Kraków {{became the}} seat of the Polish government. By the end of the 10th century, the city was a leading centre of trade. <b>Brick</b> <b>buildings</b> were constructed, {{including}} the Royal Wawel Castle with St. Felix and Adaukt Rotunda, Romanesque churches such as St. Adalbert's, a cathedral, and a basilica. The city was almost entirely destroyed during the Mongol invasion of 1241. It was rebuilt practically identical, based on new location act and incorporated in 1257 by the high duke Bolesław V the Chaste who following the example of Wrocław, introduced city rights modelled on the Magdeburg law allowing for tax benefits and new trade privileges for the citizens. In 1259, the city was again ravaged by the Mongols. A third attack in 1287 was repelled {{thanks in part to the}} new built fortifications. In 1335, King Casimir III of Poland (Kazimierz in Polish) declared the two western suburbs to be a new city named after him, Kazimierz (Casimiria in Latin). The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362, and a plot was set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka.|$|E

5|$|The tornado became violent as {{it entered}} Cullman, being tracked and {{broadcast}} live via several tower cameras, including one operated by ABC 33/40 for several minutes; that camera captured {{the destruction of}} a communications tower belonging to Cullman area low-power television station WCQT-LP as the tornado ripped through the city. Radio stations in downtown Cullman also reported on the tornado and some even captured it passing over until power was knocked out. Downtown Cullman was badly damaged by the tornado, with the major damage being along a two-block area {{through the center of the}} downtown business district. Numerous well-built <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> and storefronts in downtown Cullman were heavily damaged or completely destroyed, along with multiple churches. The courthouse and nearby emergency management building took a direct hit from the tornado, sustaining considerable damage, and two school buildings were heavily damaged as well. Many well-known businesses, such as Vincent's Furniture, The Cullman Times, and the Busy Bee Cafe, were also severely damaged/destroyed. Many homes were damaged or destroyed in residential areas of the city, with extensive tree and power line damage noted as well. In all, a total of 867 residences and 94 businesses within the city of Cullman were damaged or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Two shocks on July 25 that {{occurred}} {{within an hour}} of each other were felt throughout central California and caused pipeline damage south of Bakersfield and other minor building damage in several locations. Pre-existing ground disturbances were enhanced in Tejon Canyon, and landslides occurred at Caliente Creek Canyon, Oiler Canyon Grade, and on State Route 178 between Kernville and Bakersfield. A number of fires were initiated by the July 29 aftershock (intensity VII (Very strong)) and other severe damage was caused by it, especially to buildings that had already been damaged (including one in Bakersfield). The strongest aftershock in the sequence came on August 22 as a magnitude 5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). Damage was especially heavy to <b>brick</b> <b>buildings</b> in Bakersfield, and although only a few buildings collapsed outright, 90 of 264 buildings that the shock damaged needed to be brought down completely. Total damage from this event alone was estimated to be $10 million, with several injuries, and two additional deaths.|$|E
