5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>as</b> the highest ratings for departing presidents {{in the modern}} era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not, some under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. Reagan had the third-longest life out of all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Critics of MINUSTAH's goal of {{providing}} security {{say that the}} provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the joblessness and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> the UN Special Envoy, there is hope that the international donor community will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, {{there are signs of}} a desire for political independence that the international community would rather ignore.|$|E

[...] In 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr exonerated President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> well as the First Lady of any involvement in the matter. [...] In 2000 Independent Counsel Robert Ray issued his final report on Filegate, stating {{that there was no}} credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that senior White House figures or the First Lady had requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone's hiring.

500|$|... "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] was {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore and written by George Meyer, Brian Scully, Mike Scully and Tom Martin, the first credit Martin received for the series. Mike Scully jokingly said that the episode was [...] "thrown together without thought or structure" [...] by the writers. For the subplot, the writers tried {{to come up with}} the [...] "most boring thing" [...] Lisa and Marge could do to pass time. The episode features several guest-stars, including comedian Fred Willard, country singer Dolly Parton, Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch, sports commentators Pat Summerall and John Madden, and former American football players Troy Aikman, Rosey Grier and Dan Marino. All guest-stars played themselves, except for Willard who portrayed Kogen. The episode pokes fun at folk singer Burl Ives, former United States president <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> well as the series' fans, among other things.|$|E

500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. [...] It portrayed <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> being heavily involved in the travel office affair, {{more than any other}} investigation. [...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the Travel Office Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment to you , this committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E

2500|$|Geffen was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Barack Obama for president and raised $1.3million for Obama in a star-studded Beverly Hills fundraiser. [...] On February 21, 2007, {{in an interview with}} Maureen Dowd of the New York Times, Geffen described Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton in unflattering terms: [...] "Everybody in politics lies, but they do it with such ease, it's troubling." [...] He said that Hillary Clinton was [...] "incredibly polarizing" [...] and described <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> [...] "reckless" [...] and cast doubt on those who say he has become a different person since leaving office.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>as</b> well as economists Brad DeLong and Tyler Cowen {{have all}} {{argued that the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act {{softened}} {{the impact of the}} crisis. Atlantic Monthly columnist Megan McArdle has argued that if the act was [...] "part of the problem, it would be the commercial banks, not the investment banks, that were in trouble" [...] and repeal would not have helped the situation. An article in the conservative publication National Review has made the same argument, calling liberal allegations about the Act [...] "folk economics." [...] A New York Times financial columnist and occasional critic of GLBA stated that he believes GLBA {{had little to do with}} the failed institutions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{roots of}} the {{doctrine}} begin with the lineage of Clinton's political career from standing {{in the shadow of}} her husband, President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>as</b> First Lady, to being put in the public spotlight in her own right during a speech she gave at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing. In this speech, Clinton made the proclamation that, [...] "if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all."
