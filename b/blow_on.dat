5|$|On November 23, 1999, Michaels made {{a special}} {{appearance}} for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling at the 10th Anniversary Show pay-per-view at the Yokohama Arena, {{serving as the}} guest referee for the H vs fake Hayabusa main event. He got himself involved in the match when fake Hayabusa delivered a low <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> him and he responded later on with Sweet Chin Music.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Randy Orton faced Ric Flair in a steel cage match, which gained 68% of the vote. During the match, both Orton and Flair {{managed to get}} the upper hand. A spot in the match saw Flair hit a low <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Orton and sent him into the cage, causing Orton to bleed. Orton regained the {{momentum}} by sending Flair into the cage, resulting in Flair bleeding. The match concluded with Orton performing an RKO for the win. After the match, the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|It was as yet {{too early}} to assume 'night {{cruising}} order.' The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark, he could have prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight. There {{was only one way}} of avoiding this: to inflict a second <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered the possibility of a last attempt being made to bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ship's company.|$|E

5|$|After WrestleMania 32, on the April 4, 2016 {{episode of}} Raw, Ziggler {{went to a}} double countout with Baron Corbin, leading to Corbin hitting an End of Days outside of the ring to Ziggler, igniting a feud in the process. At the Payback pre-show, Ziggler faced Baron Corbin in a winning effort. The two then had a no {{disqualification}} match at Extreme Rules where Corbin won after hitting a low <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Ziggler. Following Extreme Rules, on the May 23 episode of Raw, Ziggler had a confrontation backstage with Corbin and challenged him to a technical wrestling match the next week. In that match, Ziggler intentionally got himself disqualified when he kicked Corbin in the groin immediately after the match began. This led to a rubber match at Money in the Bank, which Corbin won to end their feud.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
5|$|In 963, {{following}} the death of Emperor Romanos II, Nikephoros {{turned his attention to the}} power struggle that saw him ascend the imperial throne. The defeats of the previous years, and particularly the occupation of Aleppo, had dealt a heavy <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Sayf al-Dawla's power and authority. At the same time, the Hamdanid prince also suffered from physical decline, with the onset of hemiplegia as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, that henceforth confined him to a litter. The disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, Qarquya, and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior lieutenants to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that increasingly occurred in his domains.|$|E

5|$|Skleros {{eventually}} set {{out from}} the city, and divided his forces into three groups: two divisions were placed in ambush on the wooded {{sides of the road}} leading towards the Rus' camp, while another, probably some 2,000–3,000 men, was placed under himself (or Alakaseus in Skylitzes' account) and went forth to attack the Rus' host. The Byzantine detachment quickly came into contact with the Rus' army, and charged the Pecheneg contingent. The Byzantines executed a gradual orderly retreat, turning at intervals to charge back at the pursuing Pechenegs, who had thus become separated from {{the main body of the}} Rus' army. This conflict was fierce and bloody, taxing the discipline and endurance of the small Byzantine force. According to Leo the Deacon, at one point one of the Pechenegs charged Bardas himself and delivered a sword <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> his helmet, which was deflected by the metal without doing harm. Bardas' young brother Constantine came to his rescue, killing the Pecheneg.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Carthage, he {{justified}} his decision to turn back by insisting that the entire army was needed to quell the insurgents, and urged Guntharic to set forth himself. At the same time, he conspired with his nephew, Gregory, {{and a few other}} of his Armenian bodyguards to murder the usurper (although Corippus suggests that it was the praetorian prefect Athanasius who was the real mastermind of the plot). On the eve of the army's departure in early May, Guntharic hosted a great banquet, and invited Artabanes and Athanasius to share the same couch, a mark of honour. Suddenly, during the banquet, Artabanes' Armenians fell upon Guntharic's bodyguards, while Artabanes himself allegedly landed the killing <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Guntharic.|$|E
5|$|While exchanging {{correspondence}} with Leo Choirosphaktes, Simeon sent envoys to forge {{an alliance with}} the Pechenegs, the eastern neighbours of the Magyars, and {{in the beginning of}} 896 the Bulgarians and Pechenegs attacked the Magyar homeland on two fronts. In the decisive battle the Bulgarian army dealt a crushing defeat on the Magyars in the steppes along the Southern Bug river. The struggle was so bloody that it is said that the victorious Bulgarians lost 20,000 riders. At the same time, the Pechenegs advanced westwards and prevented the Magyars from returning to their homeland. The <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> the Magyars was so heavy that they were forced to migrate further west in search of new pastures, eventually settling in the Pannonian Basin, where they established the powerful Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{spanwise}} <b>blowing</b> <b>on</b> the surface pressures of a 44 deg swept trapezoidal wing-strake configuration were measured. Wind tunnel {{data were obtained}} at a free stream Mach number of 0. 26 {{for a range of}} model angle of attack, jet thrust coefficient, and nozzle chordwise location. Results showed that spanwise blowing delayed the leading edge vortex breakdown to larger span distances and increased the lifting pressures. Vortex lift was achieved at span stations immediately outboard of the strake-wing junction with no blowing, but spanwise blowing was necessary to achieve vortex lift at increased span distances. <b>Blowing</b> <b>on</b> the wing {{in the presence of the}} strake was not as effective as <b>blowing</b> <b>on</b> the wing alone. Spanwise blowing increased lift throughout the angle-of-attack range, improved the drag polars, and extended the linear pitching moment to higher values of lift. The leading edge suction analogy can be used to estimate the effects of spanwise <b>blowing</b> <b>on</b> the aerodynamic characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Blow {{created the}} Thekla, Inc. {{team for the}} {{development}} and publication of The Witness. Since December 2009, Blow was working remotely with two additional full-time roles, one a 3D artist, and another as a technical programmer. By 2015, Blow stated there were about eight full-time members on his team, though had had ten to eleven people involved around 2011, {{and as many as}} fifteen at its peak. The Witness incorporates other artists and programmer's contributions in smaller roles, such as David Hellman, who had previously worked with <b>Blow</b> <b>on</b> Braids art design and worked on conceptualizing the design of The Witness. Other contributors include Eric Urquhart, who has provided 3-D concept artwork for the game, and Ignacio Castaño, who has developed a rendering system for the game's illumination and visual effects. Blow gives much credit to Orsolya Spanyol, a freshly-graduated graphic artist he hired around 2011, for transforming the original sparse imagery of the island to the more vivid scenery that was included in the final game. By diversifying work on the game, Blow has been able to focus more of his time on the core game design, allowing his team to implement his vision, in contrast to the development of Braid where he also had to program much of the game himself.|$|E
5|$|During late 1990 {{and early}} 1991 the Australian {{government}} considered deploying F-111Cs {{to expand the}} Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group. The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) preferred option if the government decided to expand Australia's commitment was to deploy at least two RF-111s, though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate in this war zone. Due to {{the small size of}} the RF-111 force, the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Australia's reconnaissance capability. The second preference in the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of four to eight F-111Cs, though Defence did not support this. In the event, the government decided to not expand the Australian force. As a result, the F-111Cs' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010 La Sombra began a storyline {{feud with}} El Felino. The feud began on February 2, 2010, during a singles match between El Felino and La Sombra; when tied at one fall each, Puma King, El Felino's son, showed up wearing an El Felino outfit and mask, distracting both the referee and La Sombra {{long enough for}} El Felino to land a low <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> La Sombra to win the match. The two met in a Lighting match (a one fall, 10 minute time limit match) on the February 19 CMLL Super Viernes show. Once again Puma King tried to help his uncle, {{but this time the}} referee disqualified El Felino for the transgression. La Sombra and El Felino {{continued}} to feud, both interfering in a match between Volador Jr. and Místico. The storyline led to Místico, Volador Jr., La Sombra and El Felino being booked in a four-way Lucha de Apuestas match as the main event of the 2010 2010 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to Two Legends") show. La Sombra was the first man pinned at Dos Leyendas and El Felino was the second, forcing the two to compete with their masks on the line. La Sombra pinned El Felino, forcing him to unmask and reveal his real name.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 1805, the French Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve {{successfully}} {{broke out}} of Toulon harbour, avoiding the British blockade fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson and sailing westwards out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic, Nelson following several days behind. Villeneuve, joined by a Spanish squadron, crossed the ocean to the Caribbean and anchored at Martinique, while Nelson arrived at Barbados on 11 June. Panicked by the British arrival, Villeneuve immediately returned to Europe, with Nelson again close behind. Villeneuve's orders had specified that he sail to Brest, the French naval port on the Bay of Biscay, and join there with the fleet under Vice-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. Together this force would drive the Royal Navy out of the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain. However, as he passed the Spanish port of Ferrol on 22 July 1805, Villeneuve was intercepted by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder. At the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, Calder captured two Spanish ships but failed to inflict a decisive <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Villeneuve's squadron, which later sailed to Cadiz, Spain's principal Atlantic seaport. Nelson arrived shortly afterwards and initiated a blockade of the port.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
5|$|Once inside, Roy {{is shown}} the true history of The Scouring. The dragons, despite their power, {{were unable to}} {{maintain}} their numbers due to how slowly they reproduced compared to humans. As the war came to a close, the surviving Fire Dragons captured a Divine Dragon named Idunn and sealed away her soul. Enslaved to their will, Idunn reproduced dragons at an incredible rate and {{became known as the}} Demon Dragon, but she was defeated by a warrior wielding the Binding Blade. Her power was locked away until Zephiel, disgusted at humanity's failings, released her out of his insane desire to return Elibe to the dragons. As she has no emotion or free will, Idunn continues to follow Zephiel's orders even after his death and threatens to raise a dragon army that will destroy everything on the continent. On the topmost floor of the temple, the Etrurian Army battles Idunn's endlessly spawning dragons, allowing Roy to deliver the final <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> her with the Binding Blade. This does not kill her, and Roy carries her out as the temple collapses behind him. In the war's wake, Elibe begins to rebuild itself. Guinivere is named the new ruler of Bern, while Elffin returns to Etruria after his long absence. Roy and Lilina become the new marquesses of Pherae and Ostia, while Idunn is taken to Arcadia and lives with Fae as her soul slowly returns to her.|$|E

5|$|On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Anderson {{defeated}} Sting after {{interference from}} Eric Bischoff, a low blow, and a Mic Check {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the second time, turning heel in the process once again. On June 18, Anderson represented TNA at Mexican promotion AAA's Triplemanía XIX pay-per-view, where he and Abyss unsuccessfully challenged Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans for the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match. At the tapings of the July 7 edition of Impact Wrestling, Immortal forced Anderson to choose whether he was with them or against them. In the main event of the evening, Anderson turned on Kurt Angle and joined Immortal. On July 11 at the tapings of the July 14 edition of Impact Wrestling, Anderson lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship back to Sting. On the July 28 edition of Impact Wrestling, Anderson faced Kurt Angle in a steel cage match, but was defeated following a distraction from fellow Immortal member Bully Ray. The {{tension between the two}} stablemates eventually led to a match on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, where Ray defeated Anderson with a low <b>blow.</b> <b>On</b> the following edition of Impact Wrestling, the rest of Immortal turned on Anderson and kicked him out of the group. Anderson returned on the August 25 edition of Impact Wrestling, attacking his former stablemates. On the September 8 edition of Impact Wrestling, Anderson challenged Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but the match ended in a disqualification following interference from Immortal. On September 11 at No Surrender, Anderson again failed to capture the title in a three-way match, which also included Sting. Anderson and Bully Ray settled their grudge on October 16 at Bound for Glory, where Anderson won a Falls Count Anywhere match. On November 13 at Turning Point, Anderson and Abyss defeated Ray and Scott Steiner in a tag team match, ending his year long storyline with Immortal.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} matches on the undercard was a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match for the WWE United States Championship between the champion, John Cena, René Duprée, Booker T, and Rob Van Dam. At Judgment Day, Cena {{defeated}} Duprée to retain the United States Championship. Four days later, on SmackDown!, Cena faced Duprée in a rematch for the title. Duprée executed a low <b>blow</b> <b>on</b> Cena outside the ring, which caused Cena to be counted out. Duprée won the match, but not the title since a championship cannot be lost via countout or disqualification. The following week, Cena defeated Duprée in a Lumberjack match to retain the title. On the June 3 episode of SmackDown!, Cena confronted Booker about his interference in the Lumberjack match the week before. As General Manager Kurt Angle told Cena to leave the arena, Booker attacked Cena from behind and pushed him onto Angle. Angle claimed {{he was going to}} strip Cena of the United States Championship for what he did. The next week, on SmackDown!, Cena faced Booker, Van Dam, and Duprée, respectively, in one-on-one matches with a five-minute time limit. The man to defeat Cena would become the number-one contender to the United States Championship at The Great American Bash. Cena, however, won all three matches as no man was able to defeat him within the time limit. This led to Angle booking Cena in a Fatal Four-Way match for the title at The Great American Bash. On the June 17 episode of SmackDown!, Angle changed the match to an elimination match.|$|E
