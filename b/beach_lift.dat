5000|$|The record-setting {{flight of}} Daedalus 88 had as pilot Olympic cyclist Kanellos Kanellopoulos of Greece. [...] The flight {{began at the}} main airport of Iraklion, on Crete, with a {{horizontal}} launch under the pilot's own power, as governed by FAI rules. During the flight, the Daedalus flew primarily between 15 and 30 feet in altitude, and was accompanied by several escort vessels. The speed of the flight was helped by a tailwind, but this also made a head-on landing approach to the narrow beach hazardous, especially with crowds of spectators on the sand. The pilot maneuvered the aircraft to land more into the wind and parallel with {{the length of the}} beach. As the right wing extended over the black sand beach, the heat rising from the <b>beach</b> <b>lifted</b> that wing, turning the aircraft back towards the sea. This effect prevented the pilot from getting the whole aircraft onto the beach.|$|R
50|$|Attractions {{include a}} large sandy <b>beach,</b> a <b>lifting</b> bridge across Kettle Creek, marinas, restaurants, hotels, shops, the Port Stanley Festival Theatre, {{located in the}} former town hall {{building}} on Bridge Street, and the Port Stanley Terminal Rail, which operates a tourist train between St. Thomas, Ontario and Port Stanley using {{a portion of the}} former L&PS rail line (see The London and Port Stanley Railway).|$|R
50|$|Embarking U.S. Army {{troops and}} {{equipment}} at Honolulu, Cambria got underway 15 September 1944 for Manus, arriving 3 October {{to join the}} Southern Attack Group for {{the invasion of the}} Philippines. On 20 October she landed troops at Dulag, Leyte, in the first assault wave, then remained off Leyte as a casualty evacuation ship, receiving 70 wounded from the <b>beach.</b> Cambria <b>lifted</b> reinforcements from Oro Bay, New Guinea, to the Leyte area, then returned to New Guinea for rehearsal landings at Huon Gulf.|$|R
50|$|Tunnel Rat {{returned}} to reserve status. He was called into action {{to help a}} group of Joes infiltrate an abandoned Cobra facility in New York City. During the World War 3 storyline, Tunnel Rat was reactivated again, this time he deployed to South America alongside Footloose, <b>Beach</b> Head, <b>Lift</b> Ticket, Rapid Fire, and Windmill. As the main team moved to attack Cobra forces in the Appalachian Mountains, Tunnel Rat redeployed to New York City where he battled Alley Vipers in the sewers.|$|R
60|$|Swinging {{past the}} ledge as an {{undulation}} rolled in, they {{were met by}} its broken recoil; but Whitney drove the craft through this, and {{a few moments later}} ran her on to a narrow <b>beach.</b> Quietly <b>lifting</b> the boat {{beyond the reach of the}} water, they made for the cliff. After a few yards they came to large, rough stones, and Dick stopped. Everything was quiet except for the splash of the surf, and the wall of rock rose above them, black and mysterious.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} our {{tourists}} found themselves at rest in Ha-Ha Bay, {{at the head}} of navigation for the larger steamers. The long line of sullen hills had fallen away, and the morning sun shone warm on what in a friendlier climate would have been a very lovely landscape. The bay was an irregular oval, with shores that rose in bold but not lofty heights on one side, while on the other lay a narrow plain with two villages clinging about the road that followed the crescent <b>beach,</b> and <b>lifting</b> each the slender tin-clad spire of its church to sparkle in the sun.|$|R
60|$|As for the Sea Lion of the Vineyard, she was {{literally}} shelfed, {{as has been}} said. So irresistible had been {{the momentum of the}} great floe, that it lifted her out of the water as two or three hands would run up a bark canoe on a gravelly <b>beach.</b> This <b>lifting</b> process had, very fortunately for the craft, been effected by an application of force from below, in a wedge-like manner, and by bringing the strongest defences of the vessel to meet the power. Consequently, no essential injury had been done the vessel in thus laying her on her screw-dock.|$|R
60|$|Here were no seals whatever. The boat’s stern {{touched the}} hard shingle. I sprang out, {{extending}} {{my hand to}} Maud. The next moment she was beside me. As my fingers released hers, she clutched for my arm hastily. At the same moment I swayed, as about to fall to the sand. This was the startling effect of the cessation of motion. We {{had been so long}} upon the moving, rocking sea that the stable land was a shock to us. We expected the <b>beach</b> to <b>lift</b> up this way and that, and the rocky walls to swing back and forth like the sides of a ship; and when we braced ourselves, automatically, for these various expected movements, their non-occurrence quite overcame our equilibrium.|$|R
5|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} plaza {{is located}} {{along the beach}} {{next to one of}} Wicked Twister's towers. A sculpture with the GateKeeper logo is {{in the center of the}} plaza. The queue runs parallel to the <b>beach,</b> under the <b>lift</b> hill and station. Once under the station, riders can choose which side of the train they would like to ride. GateKeeper uses the Fast Lane queuing system; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to wait in a shorter line.|$|R
50|$|Raking technologycan {{be used on}} dry or wet sand.When {{using this}} method, a {{rotating}} conveyor belt containing hundreds of tines combs through the sand and removes surface and buried debris while leaving the sand on the beach. Raking machines can remove materials {{ranging in size from}} small pebbles, shards of glass, and cigarette butts to larger debris, like seaweed and driftwood. By keeping the sand on the <b>beach</b> and only <b>lifting</b> the debris, raking machines can travel at high speeds.|$|R

At the western end of the beach there is a {{promenade}} which ends at the cave known as the Xorino Grotto. According to 13th-century legend, the cave was used as shelter by the Moors after the Christian conquest of Albufeira.

500|$|The smoking lamp was re-lit on 18 April, {{with the}} three days of {{prohibition}} having taken a noticeable toll on crew morale. Rather than passing the word in a traditional manner, Captain <b>Beach</b> demonstrated the <b>lifting</b> of the ban by walking though the ship smoking a cigar, blowing smoke in people's faces, and asking, [...] "Don't {{you wish you could}} do this?" [...] He recorded in his log that [...] "it took some 37seconds for the word to get around." [...] On 20 April 1960, the Triton crossed the Prime Meridian, and on 24 April, the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated.|$|R
6000|$|Glynn slept two hours, {{and then}} he wakened with a start, as most persons do when they have arranged, before going to sleep, to rise at a certain hour. He rose softly, carried the {{provisions}} back to the canoe, and in his sleepy condition almost stepped upon {{the head of a}} huge crocodile, which, ignorant of their presence, had landed its head on the islet {{in order to have a}} snooze. Then he roused Ailie, and led her, more than half asleep, down to the <b>beach,</b> and <b>lifted</b> her into the canoe, after which he pushed off, and paddled briskly over the still waters of the star-lit lake. Ailie merely yawned during all these proceedings; said, [...] "Dear me! is it time to--yeaow! oh, I'm so sleepy;" [...] mumbled something about papa wondering what had become of Jim Scroggles, and about her being convinced that--"yeaow!--the ship must have lost itself among the whales and monkeys;" [...] and then, dropping her head on the leopard-skins with a deep sigh of comfort, she returned to the land of Nod.|$|R
5000|$|Muscle Beach {{dates back}} to the 1930s when the Works Progress Administration (WPA) {{installed}} exercise equipment immediately south of the Santa Monica Pier in Santa Monica, California. [...] Popular gymnastic and acrobatic exhibitions were routinely held there on city-provided equipment. A platform on the <b>beach</b> with weight <b>lifting</b> equipment provided a workout area for such famous bodybuilders as Vic Tanny, Jack LaLanne, and Joe Gold. [...] Muscle House was a [...] "crashpad" [...] just off the beach where many bodybuilders would live for cheap rent and convenient access to the beach. It was a common waypoint for bodybuilders such as Chet Yorton, Steve Reeves, Vince Edwards, Jack Delinger, George Eiferman, and Dave Draper.|$|R
5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, <b>beach</b> seine, <b>lift</b> nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R
5000|$|When a Chinese {{emissary}} {{returned from}} a voyage to the court at Shuri Castle, he brought a gift for the king, a necklace decorated with a figurine of a shisa. The king found it charming and wore it underneath his clothes. At the Naha Port bay, the village of Madanbashi was often terrorized by a sea dragon who ate the villagers and destroyed their property. One day, the king was visiting the village, and one of these attacks happened; all the people ran and hid. The local noro had been told in a dream to instruct the king when he visited {{to stand on the}} <b>beach</b> and <b>lift</b> up his figurine towards the dragon; she sent the boy, Chiga, to tell him the message. He faced the monster with the figurine held high, and immediately a giant roar sounded all through the village, a roar so deep and powerful that it even shook the dragon. A massive boulder then fell from heaven and crushed the dragon's tail, so that he couldn't move, and eventually died. This boulder and the dragon's body became covered with plants and surrounded by trees, and can still be seen today as the [...] "Gana-mui Woods" [...] near Naha Ohashi bridge. The townspeople then built a large stone shisa to protect it from the dragon's spirit and other threats.|$|R
2500|$|Four reporters left to file stories {{after the}} first two taxi runs while the {{remaining}} press stayed for the final test run of the day. After picking up speed on the channel facing Cabrillo <b>Beach</b> the Hercules <b>lifted</b> off, remaining airborne for 26 seconds at [...] off the water at a speed of [...] for about one mile (1.6km). At this altitude the aircraft still experienced ground effect. The brief flight proved to detractors that Hughes' (now unneeded) masterpiece was flight-worthy—thus vindicating the use of government funds. The Spruce Goose, however, never flew again. Its lifting capacity and ceiling were never tested. A full-time crew of 300 workers, all sworn to secrecy, maintained the aircraft in flying condition in a climate-controlled hangar. The company reduced the crew to 50 workers in 1962 and then disbanded it after Hughes' death in 1976.|$|R

50|$|The Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Center (JATWC) {{sent out}} tsunami {{warnings}} for New South Wales, Queensland, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, Tasmania, and Victoria. The organization {{warned of the}} possibility of dangerous waves, strong ocean currents and foreshore flooding to occur on the east coast of Australia for several hours on Sunday.As a result of the warnings, patrolled beaches in New South Wales and Queensland remained closed (red flags) and lifeguards ushered people to leave the water. However beach goers and surfers ignored the warnings. Numerous onlookers also crowded parts of the shore to view potential effects of the tsunami.The <b>beach</b> ban was <b>lifted</b> {{by the end of the}} day and there was no reports of damage, flooding or other emergencies. Tsunami waves of between 10 cm and 50 cm were recorded and their surges were believed to have created strong currents.

500|$|Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, {{three were}} spawned in the {{southern}} portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF-1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly {{in the form of}} shingles and roof covering torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, the garage door was damaged, causing the door to blow in, which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through her bedroom window. A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a [...] boat was flipped on its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, a tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm <b>Beach</b> County before <b>lifting</b> back up; it resulted in no damage.|$|R
50|$|This {{long-lived}} {{and destructive}} EF3 tornado initially touched down at 6:34 p.m. EDT (23:34 UTC) on Homlestown Road {{to the north}} of Bruington. It produced high-end EF1 damage as it moved to the northeast and passed just west of Miller's Tavern. Multiple homes sustained considerable damage in this area, one of which was destroyed. The tornado continued to intensify and reached peak strength as it crossed Kino Road to the east of Dunbrooke, producing EF3 damage and expanding to a width of up to 500 yd. Three poorly constructed frame homes, two double-wide mobile homes, and one double wide mobile home were all completely swept away and destroyed. Winds in this area were estimated at up to 145 mph, and multiple people were injured, some critically. The tornado then passed west of Tappahannock as a high-end EF2, causing major tree damage, destroying outbuildings, and severely damaging homes. It then crossed over the Rappahannock River shortly thereafter. Entering Richmond County as an EF2, the tornado caused major damage to the second floor of a two-story home as well as destroying several other smaller homes nearby as it impacted Naylors Beach directly. Past Naylors Beach, it weakened to a low-end EF1 before re-intensifying to high-end EF1 strength as it entered Westmoreland County and crossed Route 3. The tornado destroyed a mobile home while severely damaging two other homes in this area. Nearing Mount Holly, the EF1 tornado continued damaging multiple homes and uprooted several trees before crossing the Potomac River into the state of Maryland. The tornado weakened and shrunk in size, and as it moved onshore, it uprooted some trees in the White Point <b>Beach</b> area before <b>lifting</b> at 7:14 p.m. EDT (00:14 UTC on February 25) In total, at least 25 people were injured and the tornado caused at least US$10 million in damages.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} importance of artisanal fishing in Kainji Lake lower basin, knowledge about gear and craft being used is deficient and outdated. Little {{is also known}} as to why fishermen adopted the diverse fishing gear and craft they use in the Lake, as well as the relationship of these input factors to the socio-economic status of the fishermen and ecology of the lake. To address these issues, a survey of sixty (60) artisanal fishers and twelve (12) village leaders drawn from 12 selected communities was undertaken. The survey was performed as a structured questionnaire to the fishers, and as unstructured interviews with the heads of the fishing villages (Maigari). The data collected were analyzed in a dual way: as general statistics of the population of fishers (aggregate analysis), and as multi-dimensional statistics of the individual respondents (respondent analysis). The survey showed that the commonest gear are gill nets, cast nets, hooks and line, traps, surrounding nets, <b>beach</b> seines and <b>lift</b> nets. The kind of craft used in the region is planked canoe (paddle and mechanized) with flat bottom hull, and ownership varies across fishermen. Fish diversity is high, and along this survey # species (# families) were detected. There was a trend for association of species to types of fishing gear, and each fisher could own a number of gear types in different amounts. The most frequent species in the catches is x, but in terms of biomass y seems to be the most important, while Nile perch (Lates niloticus) is relevant for fishers is because of its commercial value. The Hausa ethnic group is dominant in number among the resident fishers. Relationship between gear types and socio-economic status of the fishers revealed inter alia that fishermen that use gill nets, cast nets and hook & line tend to have larger households, belong to a cooperative society, married and older than their counterparts. Settled older fishers are often members of the local cooperative group (fadama), an organization that seems to be less interesting or inclusive for young fishers or outsiders. This seems to exclude these workers from access to credit. The fishers generated a relatively good (gross) income compared to e. g. civil servants in of the state. The majority of the fishers, particularly the settled older men, are part-time in fishing with the possibility of pursuing other activities to generate income. There was contradiction in the opinions of most fishers and village leaders concerning the status and trends of the fisheries in the basin. Further research is needed to provide a better understanding on: (i) dynamics of change of gear with respects to daily or seasonal occurrence; (ii) social dynamics of the fishery...|$|R
