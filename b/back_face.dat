5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central front face may be smiling. Sometimes, the <b>back</b> <b>face</b> may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata (matted hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the fourth}} head as Kapila is {{interpreted}} in two ways. Taking the literal meaning of kapila as red, it is interpreted as meaning fierce or angry. The epithet kapila {{is associated with the}} fire god Agni and the solar deity Surya in early canonical texts. Another theory relates to Vishnu's sage avatar and founder of Samkhya philosophy, Kapila, who is described as having a wrathful nature and cursing the sons of Sagara to turn into ashes for insulting him. The head-dress jatajuta is typical of Brahmin sages like Kapila. The Agni Purana also describes the icon having four heads, without describing the nature of each. The iconographical treatises Aparajitapriccha and the Rupamandana mention that the fourth head is Shri (Lakshmi - the wife of Vishnu) and Stri (female) respectively, however no sculptures with a fourth female head have been discovered. The <b>back</b> <b>face</b> may be carved on the halo behind the central three heads in low relief or in a space between the halo.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Robbins plays Henry Foss, {{who runs}} the Sanctuary's {{computer}} and security systems. The producers wanted Henry to set a lighter tone to the series and add [...] "goofy and fun" [...] humor, including in somewhat dire situations. The producers cast Robbins, and were pleased with his performance. Chuck Campbell plays [...] "two-faced guy", a character with another face {{at the back of}} his head. The <b>back</b> <b>face</b> was accomplished using visual effects. Panou plays Sylvio, an associate of Ashley's. The character was originally named Ernie and was played by director Peter DeLuise in the webisodes, but he was unavailable to reshoot his scenes for the season premiere. Jonathon Young stars as Nikola Tesla. Heyerdahl suggested Young to the producers, who ended up being highly impressed by his performance. Young also played Tesla in a one-man show before appearing in the series. Whilst filming the second part of [...] "Revelations", Young's scenes in the underground city were filmed first, as he was scheduled for another play while the episode was shot.|$|E

Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had [...] "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the [...] "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its <b>back</b> <b>face,</b> remains popular", but [...] "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".|$|E

2500|$|The {{preference}} for producing one enantiomer instead of another in these reactions is often {{explained in terms}} of steric interactions between the ligand and the prochiral substrate. [...] Consideration of these interactions has {{led to the development of}} quadrant diagrams where [...] "blocked" [...] areas are denoted with a shaded box, while [...] "open" [...] areas are left unfilled. [...] In the modeled reaction, large groups on an incoming olefin will tend to orient to fill the open areas of the diagram, while smaller groups will be directed to the blocked areas and hydrogen delivery will then occur to the <b>back</b> <b>face</b> of the olefin, fixing the stereochemistry. [...] Note that only part of the chiral phosphine ligand is shown for the sake of clarity.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to save the {{plunging}} salmon populations, the federal government constructed the Coleman National Fish Hatchery on Battle Creek in 1942. The hatchery is situated approximately [...] southeast of Redding, and produces 13,850,000 eggs per year – nearly 87 percent of which are for the fall chinook salmon run. Another remedy {{was carried out by}} the Bureau of Reclamation in 1991, with the installation of a gigantic facility called a TCD (Temperature Control Device) on the rear face of Shasta Dam. This structure enables dam operators to decide the depth of the reservoir from which the water feeding into the penstocks originates. As one progresses deeper into Shasta Lake, the water gets colder where it receives less sunlight. The TCD is equipped with fifteen openings called [...] "shutters" [...] arranged in rows along the <b>back</b> <b>face</b> of the structure. The rows lie , , and [...] above sea level. (The crest of Shasta Dam is at an elevation of [...]) The system has shown significant success in reducing the temperature of the Sacramento River below the dam, although it does exhibit leakage.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} graphics, {{a silhouette}} edge on a 3D body projected onto a 2D plane (display plane) is {{the collection of}} points whose outwards surface normal is perpendicular to the view vector. Due to discontinuities in the surface normal, a silhouette edge is also an edge which separates a front facing <b>face</b> from a <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> face. Without loss of generality, this edge is usually chosen to be the closest one on a face, so that in parallel view this edge corresponds to the same one in a perspective view. Hence, {{if there is an}} edge between a front facing face and a side facing face, and another edge between a side <b>facing</b> <b>face</b> and <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> face, the closer one is chosen. The easy example is looking at a cube in the direction where the face normal is collinear with the view vector.|$|R
