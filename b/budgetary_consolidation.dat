40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that monetary stability in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) requires sustainable public finances of the member states. But how can a sufficient degree of budgetary discipline be maintained in Stage three of EMU?To answer this question, this study provides an empirical analysis of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidations</b> in the EU member states by carrying out an analysis of: {{the importance of the}} quality of the budgetary adjustment for the success of the consolidations; the anatomy of fiscal adjustment processes in the EMU member states during the 1990 s; the quality of the budgetary institutions of the member states and the changes in these institutions that have occurred during the 1990 s; the macroeconomic aspects of fiscal consolidations. The results of the analysis support the proposition that, in order to maintain a high degree of sustainability in Stage three of EMU, attention might shift away from the numerical criteria regarding overall deficits and debts, and focus more on the quality of fiscal adjustments and of the institutions governing public finances in the member states. national budgets, emu, economic and monetary union, public finances...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the long-term effects}} on output of different fiscal policies in Portugal {{in the context of}} unrestricted VAR models that include several public spending and taxation variables. Empirical results suggest that the effects of fiscal policies are within the Keynesian paradigm for public transfers, public consumption, public investment and direct taxation, with public investment showing particularly strong positive effects and direct taxation showing particularly strong negative effects. In turn, non-Keynesian effects dominate in the case of public wages where cuts are expansionary and indirect taxation where raises are neutral. Accordingly, cuts in public wages and raises in indirect taxations are the two most desirable instruments for fiscal consolidation in Portugal. Finally, deficit-neutral policies that offset raises in public transfers, public consumption, and public investment, with raises in indirect taxes have long-term positive effects on output. The same is true for cuts in direct taxation offset with cuts in all forms of public spending except for public investment. policy, <b>budgetary</b> restraint, fiscal <b>consolidation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{a period}} of {{heightened}} concern about fiscal consolidation in the euro area a politically expedient way of controlling the public budget is to cut public investment. A critical question, however, {{is whether or not}} political expediency comes at a cost, in terms of both long-term economic performance and future budgetary contention efforts. First, common wisdom suggests that public investments have positive effects on economic performance although the empirical evidence is less clear. Second, it is conceivable that public investment has such strong effects on output, that over time it generates enough additional tax revenues to pay for itself. Obviously, it is equally plausible that the effects on output although positive are not strong enough for the public investment to pay for itself. In this paper we investigate these issues empirically for the twelve countries in the euro area using a vector auto-regressive approach. We conclude that the euro countries can be gathered in four groups according {{to the nature of the}} economic and budgetary impact of public investment. The first group includes Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Netherlands, where the economic effects are either negative or positive but very small and, therefore, cuts will be harmless for the economy and effective from a budgetary perspective. The second group includes Finland, Portugal, and Spain, where public investment does not pay for itself and, therefore, cuts are an effective tool of <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation</b> although they are harmful for the economy. The third group includes France, Greece, and Ireland where public investment just pays for itself and therefore cuts are not an effective way of achieving long-term <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation</b> and are harmful for the economy. Finally, the fourth group includes Germany and Italy, where public investment more than pays for itself and, therefore, cuts are not only harmful for the economy but also counterproductive from a budgetary perspective. public investment, economic performance, <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation,</b> euro area...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the public debt to GDP ratio during 40 fiscal consolidation episodes in 21 OECD countries in 1980 - 2008. We test within a multivariate regression framework seven hypotheses put forward in the literature on {{the success or failure of}} consolidation programmes. These hypotheses concern (i) the composition of the consolidation programme, (ii) its size and persistence, (iii) the gravity of the debt situation, (iv) the influence of the international macroeconomic environment, (v) the role of labour and product market institutions and institutional reform, (vi) the ideological orientation of the government, and (vii) the role of strict fiscal rules. We add a new hypothesis emphasizing the influence of public sector efficiency. We also improve on the literature methodologically by controlling for one-off <b>budgetary</b> measures. <b>Consolidation</b> programmes imply a stronger reduction of the public debt ratio when they mainly rely on spending cuts (except public investment), are large but of short duration, take place when growth in the international economy is high and interest rates are low, are accompanied by product market deregulation, are adopted by left-wing governments, are embedded in a regime of strict and wide fiscal rules, and are executed by highly efficient administrations. Public sector efficiency is important also for the composition hypothesis. Government wage bill cuts do not contribute to lower public debt ratios when public sector efficiency is high. On the hypothesis that consolidation is more likely to succeed in a situation of fiscal emergency, our evidence is mixed. Finally, we find no evidence that labour market deregulation contributes to a reduction of the public debt ratio during consolidation periods. public debt, fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy composition, fiscal rules, labour and product market institutions, government efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Economists discuss {{multi-level}} governance {{in terms of}} fiscal federalism, namely as a problem of assigning fiscal functions optimally to different tiers of government. This literature assumes that {{the jurisdiction of the}} monetary authority coincides with that of the central fiscal authority. However, EMU implied for each member state that national fiscal policy became devolved relative to supranational monetary policy. In several member states, this ‘upward’ devolution of stabilisation came on top of fiscal decentralisation in the conventional sense. In the run-up to EMU, and even earlier, governments tended to decentralise public finances. The question this paper asks is how this dual trend of devolution relates to the goals of the EMU fiscal framework and its operation in practice. In this paper, we argue that laboratory fiscal federalism is a more appropriate framework than functional public finance or constitutional public choice for understanding fiscal devolution in EMU. We explore to what extent national governments have used innovations in upward and downward devolution to get better control over their budgets, using EMU as a lever. We also ask what this potential gain in <b>budgetary</b> control and <b>consolidation</b> has meant for national stabilisation in EMU...|$|R

40|$|Europe is in {{the throes}} of <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation,</b> {{tightening}} its fiscal rules. It could not prevent the recession of 2012 and the inexorable growth of debt, especially in Southern Europe, while unemployment spreads and the social gap widens. Social policy is mostly a national matter, but is nevertheless increasingly shaped by European rules and facing some big-scale challenges. New responsibilities can no longer be funded by additional taxes as state expenditure already makes up 50 percent of the economic performance and is not even fully covered by revenues. New responsibilities can be undertaken only when problems are identified early on or even prevented outright, e. g., by an education policy or preventive health scheme, before the costs of unemployment, illness and nursing actually arise. Investment in the future and youth employment decide on the economy's competitiveness as much as on the acceptance of the European model, especially with the young.

40|$|Summary: Prior to EMU, {{fiscal policy}} within the EU was disciplined {{by the threat}} of {{exclusion}} of the single currency; post-EMU, discipline has been exerted through the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this paper, we contrast the discipline induced by the two separate regimes on three specific criteria: the probability of violating the 3 % deficit limit, the probability of commencing a <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation,</b> and the longevity of a <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation</b> once undertaken. We find that the run-up to EMU did lead to a marked increase in the probability of commencing consolidations. However, once inside EMU, this discipline gradually slipped – with the longevity of consolidations being reduced year on year, and the probability of violating the 3 % limit rising year on year. By 2004, the cumulative slippage meant that the initial disciplinary benefits of joining the Euro were completely eroded. Growth accounting analysis reveals that the source of the problem was the reliance on growth to meet budge-tary targets and a corresponding failure to build up adequate surpluses {{at the top of the}} cycle.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} post-crisis fiscal {{priorities}} in the ASEAN- 5 economies - Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Sound economic fundamentals and timely and forceful policy {{responses to the}} crisis, including fiscal stimulus, contributed to rapid economic recovery in the ASEAN- 5. As growth rebounds, these economies are beginning to identify, communicate and implement their strategies for unwinding the fiscal stimulus while addressing long-term growth challenges. In this context, the paper highlights the need for fiscal policies to address infrastructure gaps, stimulate private consumption and expand social safety nets. Creating fiscal space to address these challenges will require raising revenues and reorienting public spending rather than increasing borrowing. Supporting structural reforms, aiming to stimulate private infrastructure investment, could help address long-term growth challenges, while easing the burden on fiscal policy.

40|$|A popular {{narrative}} amongst European policymakers is that Eurozone members facing {{problems in}} the bond market are {{paying the price for}} past <b>budgetary</b> excess. Fiscal <b>consolidation</b> in these countries is seen as the principal remedy for the crisis. It is clear however that Ireland’s problems derive mainly from a banking bust exacerbated by weaknesses in the design of Europe’s monetary union and the policy response of both the Irish authorities and the European Central Bank. From the Euro’s inception in 1999 up to 2007, both debt and deficit ratios in Ireland were comfortably within the Stability and Growth Pact ceilings. The gross debt ratio was only 25 % of GDP at the end of 2007. The Stability and Growth Pact was the only macroprudential measure in place at Eurozone level, and Irish adherence reflected public finances flattered by a credit-fuelled property bubble. The banks experienced intense liquidity pressures in September 2008 and the Irish government provided a blanket liability guarantee. The banks were in reality badly insolvent, the bank guarantee has cost 40 % of GDP and Ireland was forced from the bond market and into an EU/IMF programme just over two years later. There can be no presumption that it will emerge, and re-enter the bond market, on schedule at the end of 2013. This paper argues that the incomplete design of the currency union, with free capital movement and trans-border banking, but no centralised banking policy, contributed to the Irish debacle. The absence of bank resolution and any centralised system of liability insurance threw the burden of bank rescue on sovereigns. Countries in currency union are vulnerable to sovereign default, since they must borrow in what is, in effect, a foreign currency. Resort to official lenders enjoying seniority, combined with ECB insistence on sovereign repayment of bank senior bondholders, even in banks insolvent many times over, has undermined confidence in Irish sovereign debt. Closer fiscal union may prove necessary if the Eurozone is to survive. To avoid future sovereign debt crises, there is also a need for centralised bank supervision and resolution, as well as for a centralised system of liability insurance for banks. What happened in Ireland shows that sticking to purely fiscal rules is no guarantee of solvency for the sovereign in a currency union with inadequate mechanisms for the prevention and resolution of banking crises...|$|R

The magnitude of the impact of these effects on social expenditures, however, is dwarfed by the resources needed to enable these countries to reach the Millennium Development Goals.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{capacity}} for environmental fiscal reform to reduce CO 2 emissions, stimulate economic performance, and promote fiscal sustainability. Simulation results suggest that reforms based on CO 2 taxation stimulate GDP when tax revenues are used to promote private or public investment and stimulate employment when used to finance reductions in personal income taxation or firms' social security contributions. More generally, reforms allow for reductions in the costs of climate policy, a weaker realization of the second dividend. In addition, several reforms lead to reductions in public debt, the realization of a third dividend. When political constraints on reducing public spending are considered, however, this third dividend only materializes when revenues finance public investment or reductions in the firms' social security contributions. Overall, our results suggest that low growth and high public debt need not be regarded as hindrances for environmental fiscal reform but can actually be seen as catalysts.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} value of {{political}} institutions for financial markets, using panel data from emerging market countries. We test the hypothesis that changes in political institutions, such as improvements in democratic rights and increased government accountability, have a direct effect on sovereign interest rate spreads. We find that financial markets value institutions {{over and above the}} economic and fiscal outcomes these institutions shape. Democracy and accountability generally lower sovereign spreads, political risk tends to increase them, and financial markets tend to view election years negatively.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} on {{overview of}} the Hungarian Convergence Programme (CP) that envisages the path to restore macroeconomic equilibrium during the next three years. The spiralling budget deficit in 2006 made an update of the previous CP inevitable. In the September 2006 version the government shows strong commitment {{to face up to}} the fiscal imbalances and structural problems, yet several aspects question the feasibility of the Programme. The paper focuses on the evaluation of the major objectives and elements of the CP as well as on significant technical assumptions and external factors that may constitute a downside risk for the implementation. Besides introducing a corrective fiscal package the Convergence Program draws the outlines of several, long-awaited reforms of almost the entire sphere of the social welfare systems. As the primary focus is on the feasibility of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>consolidation</b> strategy, the paper deals with these reforms only in the context of the long-term sustainability of public finances. ...|$|E
