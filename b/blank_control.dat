40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} microRNA 150 (miR- 150) up-regulation on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC 7721, and the potential mechanism thereof. Methods　The SMMC 7721 cells were divided into miR- 150 modulated group, negative control group, and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group. Chemically synthesized hsa-miR- 150, according to the maturity sequence of hsa-miR- 150, was inserted into pGIPZ vector. SMMC 7721 cells in miR- 150 modulated group and negative control were transfected with miR- 150 pGIPZ and miR-control respectively, while those in <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group without transfection. The expression of miR- 150 was determined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The cell proliferation ability was determined by Cell Counting Kit- 8 (CCK- 8) assay, and cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry. The protein expression of c-Myb was measured by Western blotting. Results　The miR- 150 expression increased by 7 folds in cells after being transfected with miR- 150 than those in negative control group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group. CCK- 8 assay showed that the cellular growth rate of SMMC 7721 cells in miR- 150 pGIPZ group was significantly lower than those in negative control group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group (P < 0. 05). The apoptotic rate in miR- 150 pGIPZ group, negative control group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group was (19. 36 ± 1. 78) %, (5. 12 ± 0. 54) % and (4. 68 ± 0. 35) %, respectively.

The FAK-RNAi lentiviral vector was infected into SGC 7901 gastric cancer cells in order to observe the in vivo situations of tumor growth and metastasis before and after the FAK interference. The growth of SGC 7901 gastric cancer cells in the interfer-ence group was significantly inhibited compared with that of the negative control (P< 0. 05) and the <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> groups (P< 0. 05), and the FAK expression significantly decreased (P< 0. 05). The in vitro invasion and metastasis experiments showed that the cell invasion and metastasis abilities of the interference group significantly decreased when compared with those of the negative control (P< 0. 05) and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> groups (P< 0. 05). In the nude mouse subcutaneous tumor transplantation model, the mean ± standard deviation tumor weight of the interference group (1. 474 ± 0. 9840 g) was lower than that of the negative control (3. 134 ± 0. 3299 g) and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> (2. 68 ± 0. 12 g) groups (P< 0. 05).

ConclusionThe anti-aging effects of mild-warming moxibustion may be due to increased Bcl− 2 and PKC expression in peripheral blood in aged people...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} gas chromatography-time-of-flight {{mass spectrometry}} (GC × GC-TOF-MS) {{is applied to}} the comparative metabolic fingerprinting of physiological fluids. Stable isotope-labeled internal standards plus norvaline serve as extraction standards and are added to the <b>blanks,</b> <b>controls</b> and patient samples prior to protein precipitation with methanol. The extracts are evaporated to complete dryness and derivatized in two steps using methoximation with methoxylamine hydrochloride (MeOx) and silylation with N-methyl-N-trimethylsily-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Between derivatization steps a second internal standard containing odd-numbered, saturated straight chain fatty acids is added for quality control and to normalize retention time shifts. After GC × GC-TOF-MS analysis raw data are processed, aligned, and combined in one data matrix for subsequent statistical evaluation. Both a custom-made and the NIST 05 library are used to preliminarily identify significant metabolites. For verification purposes, commercial standards are run individually. Absolute quantification of selected metabolites is achieved by using a multi-point calibration curve and isotope-labeled internal standards...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of iRoot Fast Set root repair material (iRoot FS) on the proliferation, migration and differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). The hDPSCs were treated with eluates of iRoot FS at concentrations of 0. 2 and 2 mg/mL, referred to as FS 0. 2 and FS 2, respectively, and Biodentine (BD; Septodont, Saint Maur des Faussés, France) eluates at the corresponding concentrations as positive controls. A CCK 8 assay was performed to determine cell proliferation. Wound healing and transwell assays were conducted to examine cell migration. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated based on alkaline phosphatase activity, Alizarin Red S staining and quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to analyze the mRNA expression of differentiation gene markers. Cell proliferation was higher in the FS and BD groups than in the <b>blank</b> <b>controls</b> at 3 and 7 days. Moreover, FS 0. 2 enhanced cell migration and significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. These findings suggested that iRoot FS is a bioactive material that promotes the proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs...|$|R
40|$|The CAT 4103 is a 3 −channel, linear based constant−current LED driver {{designed}} for RGB LED control, requiring no inductor {{and provides a}} low noise operation. LED channel currents up to 175 mA are programmed independently via separate external resistors. Low output voltage operation of 0. 4 V at 175 mA allows for more power efficient designs across wider supply voltage range. The three LED pins are compatible with high voltage up to 25 V supporting applications with long strings of LEDs. A high−speed 4 −wire 25 MHz serial interface controls each individual channel using a shift register and latch configuration. Output data pins allow multiple devices to be cascaded and programmed via one serial interface with no need for external drivers or timing considerations. The device also includes a <b>blanking</b> <b>control</b> pin (BIN) {{that can be used}} to disable all channels independently of the interface. Thermal shutdown protection is incorporated in the device to disable the LED outputs whenever the die temperature exceeds 150 °C. The device is available in a 16 −lead SOIC package. Feature...|$|R
