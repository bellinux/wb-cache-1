25|$|Rituximab is a {{chimeric}} monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, {{developed from}} its parent antibody Ibritumomab. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and follicular lymphoma and leukaemias such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although {{the function of}} CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a calcium channel involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Other mechanisms include apoptosis and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{cutaneous}} <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> are <b>B-cell</b> non-Hodgkin's <b>lymphomas</b> {{that arise}} in the skin.

In this study, we analyzed the variable heavy chain (VH) genes of 7 of these lymphomas, ie, 4 follicle center cell lymphomas (diffuse large-cell lymphomas) and 3 immunocytomas.

Infection of newborn inbred NMRI mice with Akv induced 35 % plasma cell proliferations (PCPs) (consistent with plasmacytoma), 33 % diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> 25 % follicular <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and few splenic marginal zone and small <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> Deleting one copy of the 99 -bp proviral enhancer sequence still allowed induction of multiple B-cell tumor types, although PCPs dominated (77 %). Additional mutation of binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor, Ets, Runx, or basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors in the proviral U 3 region, however, shifted disease induction to almost exclusively PCPs, but had no major influence on tumor latency periods. Southern analysis of immunoglobulin rearrangements and ecotropic provirus integration patterns showed that many of the tumors/cell proliferations induced by each virus were polyclonal. Our results indicate that enhancer mutations weaken the ability of Akv to induce mature <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> prior to the plasma cell stage, whereas development of plasma cell proliferations is less dependent of viral enhancer strength...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{our recent}} study, we {{determined}} the cut-off value of CD 20 expression {{at the level}} of 25 000 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF) to be the predictor of response to rituximab containing treatment in patients with <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> In 17. 5 % of patients, who had the level of CD 20 expression below the cut-off value, the response to rituximab containing treatment was significantly worse than {{in the rest of the}} patients with the level of CD 20 expression above the cut-off value. The proportion of patients with low CD 20 expression who might not benefit from rituximab containing treatment was not necessarily representative. Therefore the aim of this study was to quantify the CD 20 expression in a larger series of patients with <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> which might allow us to determine more reliably the proportion of patients with the CD 20 expression below the cut-off. Methods: Cytological samples of 64 diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (DLBCL), 56 follicular lymphomas (FL), 31 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), 34 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 18 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) and 15 <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> unclassified were analyzed for CD 20 expression by quantitative four-color flow cytometric measurements using FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

40|$|<b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> {{the most}} {{frequent}} human immune system malignancies, often contain dysregulated TCL 1 oncogene expression. TCL 1 transgenic (TCL 1 -tg) mice develop a spectrum of B-cell malignancies, supporting an oncogenic role for TCL 1 in B cells. Our prior global survey of DNA methylation patterns in TCL 1 -tg <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> identified many lymphoma-specific candidate hypermethylated genes, including Stk 39. The Stk 39 encoded protein, sterile 20 -like-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK), regulates cell stress responses, and microarray studies identified reduced SPAK expression in metastatic prostate and treatment-resistant breast cancers, suggesting that its loss may {{have a role in}} cancer progression. Here we identified DNA hypermethylation and SPAK silencing in TCL 1 -tg <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and SPAK silencing without DNA methylation in multiple subtypes of human <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> SPAK knockdown by shRNA protected B cells from caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by DNA double-strand breaks but not apoptosis in response to osmotic or oxidative cell stressors. Caspase 3 activation by cleavage was impaired with SPAK repression in DNA damaged B cells. Interestingly, c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase is potentially activated by SPAK and pharmacological inhibition of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase in SPAK-expressing B cells recapitulated the cell-protective phenotype of SPAK knockdown.
