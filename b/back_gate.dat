5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of November 2, 2002, a female {{employee}} of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her car on a deserted road near the <b>back</b> <b>gate</b> of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E

25|$|Samples from bloody shoe prints leading {{away from}} the bodies and from the <b>back</b> <b>gate</b> of the {{condominium}} were tested for DNA matches. Initial polymerase chain reaction testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken from the crime scene (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples). Police criminalist Dennis Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse {{at the time of the}} murders. But defense expert Barry Scheck conducted an eight-day cross-examination, questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests. At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the routed Roman cavalry and skirmishers {{were just}} straggling into camp {{when they found}} {{themselves}} {{face to face with}} the Nervii – they ran again. Camp followers further up the hill by the camp’s <b>back</b> <b>gate</b> had observed the success of the Romans at the river and came down in the hope of plunder, but noticed the Nervii in the camp and also ran. [...] People accompanying the baggage train just arriving were horrified at the sight before them and panicked as well. [...] Even the usually-dependable Treveri cavalry arriving to support the Romans looked at the seemingly hopeless situation and promptly turned for home to report the disaster.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to the Roman move, the Carthaginians {{reduced the}} number of their foragers for a few days and kept the army in {{readiness}} within their camp situated near the Roman camp. Minucius, however, sat tight in his camp, emulating Fabius. [...] This put Hannibal in horns of a dilemma: his army could stay in their camps and consume the accumulated supplies, thus risking a possible supply shortage later in the season, or start foraging in strength again and further build up their stores for the coming winter. Hannibal was eventually forced to send out parties in increasing numbers for foraging. The Romans, seizing their chance, sent out light infantry and horsemen through the <b>back</b> <b>gate</b> of their camp to cut off and kill a large number of Carthaginian foragers, who were scattered all over the plain of Geronium, while Minucius himself led the infantry in strength towards the temporary Carthaginian camp itself, where most of the Carthaginians had taken refuge after being worsted in the initial clash. Hannibal, with his foragers under attack and his camp in danger of being assaulted, led out a sortie against the attacking Roman infantry.|$|E
2500|$|Tornado {{activity}} {{the following}} day was much more significant, especially in Arkansas. An EF3 passed {{near the town of}} Strong, Arkansas, heavily damaging homes and mobile homes. A brick house was mostly destroyed, and double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed, with debris scattered up to 200 yards away. 5 people were injured. An EF2 tornado struck the Mt. Olive community in Bradley County a short time later. A house suffered major damage and a mobile home was destroyed there. An elderly woman was injured in the house, and a family of five was injured in the mobile home. Three other homes had minor damage, and several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed. Thousands of trees were blown down, as were a number of power poles and power lines. A second EF3 tornado formed and tore directly through the town of Dumas, where 25 businesses were destroyed, along with 19 homes. More than 65 additional homes sustained minor to moderate damage. Six mobile homes were destroyed, along with an athletic park. A community building sustained major damage, as well as a 20-unit assisted living center. An electrical substation was destroyed, leaving the area without power for several days. Numerous trees and power lines were also blown down. Farther to the northeast, in the community of <b>Back</b> <b>Gate,</b> 11 mobile homes were destroyed and 12 sustained minor damage. One house was destroyed, along with three that were damaged. This tornado injured a total of 28 people along its path. [...] After the Dumas tornado dissipated, an EF2 tornado touched down and passed north of Monticello before dissipating near Garrett Bridge. That tornado snapped hundreds of trees, damaged or destroyed several shop buildings and a barn, partially destroyed one house and damaged another. Further south, two EF2s touched down in Louisiana. Overall, the outbreak resulted in 20 tornadoes and no fatalities. Damages from the tornadoes totaled to US$48.41 Million.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline work we have {{recently}} completed {{on the novel}} high speed photodetector which {{has come to be}} known as the 'back-gated metal-semiconductor-metal' photodetector or BG-MSM for short. This device was first realized by E. Greger et. al. and us. Recent theoretical work by Hurd et. al. provided a sound basis by which to test the device against a model. The work presented here clearly indicates that the main conclusion of Hurd et. al. is sound. That conclusion was that the main response speed gain obtained by the back-gating is obtained by simply earthing the back contact. As well as this confirmation we have found strong dependence of the peak height of the response on the <b>back</b> <b>gating</b> voltage and a very strong position dependence of the excitation spot on the response particularly at low applied fields. We conclude that the <b>back</b> <b>gating</b> is an advantage over the conventional metal-semiconductor- metal photodetector and needs to be studied more extensively both theoretically and experimentally using devices capable of operation at above 100 GHz. © 2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R
