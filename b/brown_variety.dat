The black habanero has an exotic and unusual taste, and is hotter than a regular habanero with a rating between 400,000 and 450,000 Scoville units. Small slivers used in cooking can have a dramatic effect on the overall dish. Black habaneros take considerably longer to grow than other habanero chili varieties. In a dried form, they can be preserved for long periods of time, and can be reconstituted in water then added to sauce mixes. Previously known as habanero negro, or by their Nahuatl name, their name was translated into English by spice traders in the 19th century as [...] "black habanero".

40|$|Abstract Three cowpea {{varieties}} namely: Kafanji, <b>Brown</b> <b>variety</b> and Ex-potiskum {{were used}} in this study to test their resistance on weevil infestation. Cowpea samples of 60 grams were measured from each variety and were artificially infested with different weevil densities made up of male and female ratios of 5 : 10, 10 : 15 and 15 : 15. The samples had three replicates and a control treatment each. These were allowed to stand on the shelves without disturbance, thus making it possible for the weevils to mate and oviposit naturally. The results were analysed statistically and the differences between the treatments with respect to weight loss and adult emergence were significant (P> 0. 05) and the damages were also closely related to the infestation density increasing with the densities. Kafanji suffered more damage while the <b>Brown</b> <b>variety</b> and Ex-potiskum suffered less damage. This indicates that Ex-potiskum and Brown-variety exhibits more resistance qualities to the weevil attack than Kafanji which is more susceptible to the weevil attack.

40|$|Póster presentado en el EuroFoodChem XVII celebrado en Istambul (Turkey) del 7 al 10 de mayo de 2013. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{a staple}} food for {{over half of}} the world's population. Brown rice, which is hulled {{directly}} from rough rice, consists of a bran layer, embryo, and endosperm. From a nutritional point of view, brown rice should be the preferred eating type as contains higher dietary fiber, B-vitamins and minerals than white rice as well as important phytochemicals such as tocopherols, tocotrienols, γ-oryzanol and polyphenols, suggested to have properties that may benefit health. Germination is an effective and common process used to improve the nutritional quality of cereals. Bioactive compounds with antihypertensive activity (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and antioxidant activity (polyphenols) are accumulated in sprouts. During germination, the synthesis and accumulation of bioactive compounds is highly affected by operating parameters such as time and temperature. The objective of this research was to optimize temperature and time during the germination process of brown rice for the maximum GABA concentration, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity using the response surface methodology (RSM). Long-grain <b>brown</b> rice <b>varieties</b> 15 and 17 were provided by the National Institute of Agricultural Research from Ecuador (INIAP). GABA concentration and TPC was determined by HPLC-MS and Folin-Ciocalteau method, respectively. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity method. Response surface plots showed that germination time and temperature significantly influenced the GABA concentration, TPC and antioxidant activity of germinated <b>brown</b> rice <b>varieties.</b> The longer the germination time the higher was the GABA concentration, TPC and antioxidant activity in germinated brown rice. In contrast, temperature had no influence on GABA synthesis during germination. Under the predefined conditions of the temperature from 28 to 34 ºC, and germination time from 24 to 120 h, the maximum GABA concentration, TPC and antioxidant activity were obtained at different germination conditions. The maximum GABA concentration (137. 8 and 119. 7 mg/ 100 g dry weight in 15 and 17 <b>brown</b> rice <b>varieties,</b> respectively) was achieved at a temperature of 34 ºC and time of 120 h. The maximum TPC (3066, 5 and 2878, 9 μg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight for 15 and 17 <b>brown</b> rice <b>varieties,</b> respectively) was achieved at a temperature of 28 ºC and 120 h of germination. Finally, the maximum predicted antioxidant capacity (28. 7 and 27. 4 μmol Trolox equivalents in 15 and 17 <b>brown</b> rice <b>varieties,</b> respectively) was obtained at a temperature of 34 ºC and 28 ºC for variety 15 and 17, respectively and 120 h.

Nitrogen free extracts were found to be 1. 66 % and 73. 97 % for brown and white samples, respectively. The amylose contents were 35. 00 % for brown and 21. 67 % for white. Mineral contents such as calcium, potassium and phosphorus determined showed that the <b>brown</b> <b>variety</b> contains 0. 14 % calcium, 0. 19 % potassium and 0. 16 % phosphorus while the white variety contains 0. 27 % calcium, 0. 21 % potassium and 0. 12 % phosphorus.
