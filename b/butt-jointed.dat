5000|$|The 1712 boiler was {{assembled}} from riveted copper {{plates with}} a domed top made {{of lead in}} the first examples. Later boilers were made of small wrought iron plates riveted together. The problem was producing big enough plates, so that even pressures of around [...] were not absolutely safe, nor was the cast iron hemispherical boiler initially used by Richard Trevithick. This construction with small plates persisted until the 1820s, when larger plates became feasible and could be rolled into a cylindrical form with just one <b>butt-jointed</b> seam reinforced by a gusset; Timothy Hackworth's Sans Pareil 11 of 1849 had a longitudinal welded seam. Welded construction for locomotive boilers was extremely slow to take hold.|$|E
50|$|Chancellor and Patrick {{began with}} a variety of {{expressive}} houses, mostly holiday homes, on the Mornington Peninsula, where the firm began. They soon developed their own distinctive style; an amalgam of features of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie and Usonian houses, the houses of Californian architect Harwell Hamilton Harris, and their own innovations. They featured dynamic plans, emphasised by projecting intersecting wings or bays with expressed, overhanging gable or flat roofs, dramatic cantilevers, strong horizontals with occasional verticals, off-centre supports, expressed structure, <b>butt-jointed</b> corner windows, and integration with the landscape. Many {{can be found on the}} Peninsula, as well as many dotted around the 1950s and 60s suburbs and area of Melbourne, especially the Bayside suburbs. They are said to have designed (if not built) over 1000 houses in their career. Their houses of the late 1960s onwards were often larger, and evolved into brown brick, skillion roofed compositions, more ground hugging, and more in tune with the 'environmental' designs of their contemporaries. Throughout their career, they also designed many non-residential projects, including a number of churches, pre-school buildings and a hospital, as well as banks and other commercial work. Their largest projects were the all the halls of residence at Monash University, and Chisholm College at La Trobe University.|$|E
50|$|Before the retail, {{leisure and}} {{business}} parks were built Middlebrook {{was the site}} of Sefton Fold Farm in Horwich. The old timber-framed farmhouse with sandstone flag roof as could have been seen latterly would seem to have dated from the 16th century with many intervening changes. The floor plan would indicate a 3-bay farmhouse or hall: the latter access being a 'baffle' entry facing the central chimney stack; this may have also been the original position but could have been a more traditional 'screens' entrance adjacent to the service bay. A cellar appears to have been located under the northern service bay and later GMAU investigations would infer that this used to be occupied by a small water wheel (for grinding domestic crops?) That would also infer that a stream ran under the house at this point. A well existed very nearby in the yard but any evidence of a stream latterly had become obscured. Something of a rebuild appears to have happened around 1666 and was possibly refaced or altered in 1811, as evidenced by the semi-circular datestone over the adjacent cottage which dates from 1811. However, an earlier late-Georgian brick wing was seemingly added before that date, the bricks having been locally 'clamped'. The old bay (parlour) closest to the 'new wing' as described had already had its wattle and daub removed and replaced with brick. The middle bay (housebody) and end bay (service) together with the north gable had been rebuilt in 'watershot' squared & coursed gritstone rubble, although when that happened is not clear, because the stone of the adjacent 1811 cottage was constructed from thinner, flaggy sandstone and not watershot. The rear of the range was extended, evidently in the 19th Century, from random sandstone rubble walling under a full 'catslide' stone flag roof, and this extension had a floor over creating a loft: this loft was accessed from the first floor and was lain with compressed straw and other material. Floorboards upstairs in the main range were <b>butt-jointed</b> and wide, of random size; some doorleaf stiles and rails were reed-moulded and mortise-framed and simply panelled, indicating 17th Century origin. The floor over the 'housebody' was a much later addition to the original, being supported off separate beams running parallel to the long walls and resting on inserted brackets or 'corbels'. The mortises and pegholes to the former arch-bracing to the central house frame could still be seen, identifying that this part of the house was possibly originally double-height, or at least, the floor was set much higher than latterly, rendering the upper floor of poor usage. There is also the presence of a vestige of a wattle and daub 'fire hood', a forerunner of a later brick chimney stack. The opening {{to one side of the}} chimney stack upstairs was blocked up economically in brick-on-edge - the bricks were machine-pressed with 'frogs' and bore the text 'Yates Plastic Horwich'. Much of the original timber framing remained within the rear 'outshut' including a former unglazed window complete with Oak stave mullions. the timber framing was set upon a high sandstone plinth - the same remained on the main frontage under the brick infill to the 'parlour' bay. The complete wallplate remained over the rebuilt main east facade and exhibited all the original mortises and peg holes from the original framing, so a reasonable guess could be made at the appearance of the building. the timbers in the 'outshut' were all re-used and exhibited peg holes, mortises and carpenters' marks. There is a case for supposing that these were taken from the timbers replaced by the later stonework, and one beam in particular hinted at coming from the old north gable truss chord, due to its size and moulding. Other evidence in the timbers points at herringbone patterning within the framing, which would reflect the regional trend for such decoration. (these detailed notes modified and expanded by Mark Head, who surveyed the house in about 1985). Before demolition in 1996 the University of Manchester's Archaeological Unit spent three weeks on the Sefton Fold Farm site. The team excavated a moated site of late medieval origins and pottery believed to date from the late 16th or early 17th centuries was found. When development started, the site was partly covered by a roundabout. The farmhouse's 1666/1811 date stone, 1860s cooking range and other items were saved and can be seen at the Heritage Centre in Horwich.|$|E
30|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of glue application and placement of butt-joints on the compressive and tensile properties in a <b>butt-jointed</b> lamination. The aim was to provide background information for producing <b>butt-jointed,</b> glued, laminated timber. Three <b>butt-jointed</b> lamination models were prepared from spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) dimension lumber with glued and nonglued butt joints, with different placements of the butt joints in the models. The axial stiffness and strength properties were assessed using both compressive and tensile tests. The {{results of the study}} indicated that for the compressive lamination model the application of glue at the butt joint gave more stiffness than the nonglued butt joint. Neither glue application nor placement of the joint had a statistically significant effect on the compressive strength. There {{were no significant differences between}} the glued and nonglued butt joint for either tensile strength or stiffness.|$|E

Based on the result {{the dependence of}} the singular stress fields around the interface edge on the material combination is discussed. The relation between the exponent of the stress singularity and its intensity is investigated. The uniqueness of the intensity of singular stress fields for Dundurs's parameters is also studied. The equations which is useful for materials selection of joint concerning with the stress singularity are newly developed...|$|E
40|$|Building {{automobile}} {{bodies from}} lightweight materials using space-frame construction techniques is increasingly popular because of exhaust emission legislation. One proposed method of achieving {{this is by}} using plug and socket joints, which are injected with adhesive after assembly. A method for controlling this process, irrespective of component tolerances, is proposed here. A test rig representing a plug and socket joint was injected with the adhesive and a method for successfully filling the <b>butt-jointed</b> end of the joint found. The addition of a restriction to the joint's open end gave a method of filling the cavity without creating any air gaps. The use of neoprene O-ring seals for creating the restriction was investigated. The pressure of the adhesive at the joint inlet (gate) was recorded (data logger), and an analysis {{of this has been}} used to determine the point when adhesive injection can be arrested and the joint correctly filled...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] In this study, {{the effect}} of bending strain on the {{transport}} property and critical current of lap and <b>butt-jointed</b> (non-laminated) BSCCO tapes has been investigated. The samples were joined using a mechanically controlled jointing procedure. To achieve a uniform thickness at the joint a single point loading contact has been devised. GFRP mandrels with different bending radii which support the sample during bending have been used. Ic have been measured at 77 K and self field. In the case of easy bending test for jointed BSCCO tapes, sudden degradation of Ic {{is caused by the}} local strain concentration due to non uniform deformation at the edge parts of the joint. In the case of hard bending test of jointed BSCCO tapes transverse macroscopic crack at specific subsection caused a large Ic degradation. The transport property of jointed BSCCO tapes in each bending mode was discussed with the damage morphology occurred...|$|E
40|$|Cusping, tearing along tacking margins, {{and failure}} around tacking points are common {{features}} of easel paintings. They {{are related to}} the methods used to attach the canvas to the wooden support. These features are part of the mechanical degradation process and therefore important in understanding the overall deterioration of a painting. The attachments {{have a significant effect on}} the strain distribution within the painting. Understanding these effects will help to identify vulnerable areas and aid the choice of attachment method when restretching a painting which has undergone treatment. The historical evolution of attachments and present-day methods used as part of structural conservation treatments are discussed briefly. The strain distribution resulting from attachments on <b>butt-jointed</b> stretchers has been investigated experimentally using a combination of electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) and biaxial tensile testing. The results showing the strain distribution are presented, and the contribution to strain concentrations introduced by the type of attachment (tacks and staples), orientation, and spacing are compared...|$|E
40|$|Co-application of acoustoelasticity {{and optical}} {{interferometry}} to residual stress analysis is discussed. The underlying {{idea is to}} combine the advantages of both methods. Acoustoelasticity is capable of evaluating a residual stress absolutely {{but it is a}} single point measurement. Optical interferometry is able to measure deformation yielding two-dimensional, full-field data, but it is not suitable for absolute evaluation of residual stresses. By theoretically relating the deformation data to residual stresses, and calibrating it with absolute residual stress evaluated at a reference point, it is possible to measure residual stresses quantitatively, nondestructively and two-dimensionally. The feasibility of the idea has been tested with a <b>butt-jointed</b> dissimilar plate specimen. A steel plate 18. 5 mm wide, 50 mm long and 3. 37 mm thick is braze-jointed to a cemented carbide plate of the same dimension along the 18. 5 mm-side. Acoustoelasticity evaluates the elastic modulus at reference points via acoustic velocity measurement. A tensile load is applied to the specimen at a constant pulling rate in a stress range substantially lower than the yield stress. Optical interferometry measures the resulting acceleration field. Based on the theory of harmonic oscillation, the acceleration field is correlated to compressive and tensile residual stresses qualitatively. The acoustic and optical results show reasonable agreement in the compressive and tensile residual stresses, indicating the feasibility of the idea...|$|E
