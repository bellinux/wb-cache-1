In the PV Array Task, UPG significantly improved the conventional means and methods required to structurally interface PV modules to the roofs of single-family residential houses and to electrically interconnect these PV modules to a power conversion unit. UPG focused on the design and test of a PV array based on the highly efficient use of materials and labor. Design criteria included cost, structural integrity, electrical safety, reliability, conformance with applicable standards and building and seismic codes, and adaptability {{to a wide range of}} roof materials for both existing and retrofit roof applications. In the Power Unit Task, UPG designed and tested a high-efficiency, low-cost, high-reliability prototype power conversion unit that included all materials, components, equipment, and software required to perform all DC-AC/AC-DC power collection, conversion, and control functions between the output of the PV array and the interconnection to the electrical grid service of single-family residences.

30|$|Climate {{change is}} mainly {{attributed}} to the burning of fossil fuels. To solve the problem, current inhabitants have to dispense with fossil fuels {{as a source of}} power. It has been demonstrated that this can be secured before 2050 by transitioning to renewable sources of energy. Massive energy storage (MES) incorporated into long distance high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems is the key technology for the transition. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art in electricity grid configurations. It demonstrates how MES, and other <b>back-up</b> local <b>electricity</b> storage schemes represent a natural way of buffering electricity consumers from the intermittency of inherent in the primary renewable systems. Consequently, it can solve the base-load issues and facilitate a global transition to 100 % renewable energy sources over the next fifteen to twenty years.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the mechanical, structural, and neutronic aspects of the Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) design concept. The AHTR is a design concept for a large output Fluoride salt cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR) that is being developed to enable evaluation of the technology hurdles remaining to be overcome prior to FHRs becoming a commercial reactor class. This report documents the incremental AHTR design maturation performed over the past year and is focused on advancing the design concept to a level of a functional, self-consistent system. The AHTR employs plate type coated particle fuel assemblies with rapid, off-line refueling. Neutronic analysis of the core has confirmed the viability of a 6 -month 2 -batch cycle with 9 weight-percent enriched uranium fuel. Refueling is intended to be performed automatically under visual guidance using dedicated robotic manipulators. The present design intent is for used fuel to be stored inside of containment for at least 6 months and then transferred to local dry wells for intermediate term, on-site storage. The mechanical and structural concept development effort has included an emphasis on transportation and constructability to minimize construction costs and schedule. The design intent is that all components be factory fabricated into rail transportable modules that are assembled into subsystems at an on-site workshop prior to being lifted into position using a heavy-lift crane in an open-top style construction. While detailed accident identification and response sequence analysis has yet to be performed, the design concept incorporates multiple levels of radioactive material containment including fully passive responses to all identified design basis or non-very-low frequency beyond design basis accidents. Key building design elements include: 1) below grade siting to minimize vulnerability to aircraft impact, 2) multiple natural circulation decay heat rejection chimneys, 3) seismic base isolation, and 4) decay heat powered <b>back-up</b> <b>electricity</b> generation. The report provides a preconceptual design of the manipulators, the fuel transfer system, and the salt transfer loops. The mechanical handling of the fuel and how it is accomplished without instrumentation inside the salt is described within the report. All drives for the manipulators reside outside the reactor top flange. The design has also taken into account the transportability of major components and how they will be assembled on sit...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{society is}} {{increasingly}} dependent on high quality electricity for its economy, security, cultural life, public health, safety and governance. As such, ensuring {{the resilience of}} electric power systems against deliberate attacks and natural disasters {{is critical to the}} continuous function, particularly of urban cities. This thesis proposes an efficient for assessing the resilience of electric power systems under hurricane hazards. The thesis also explores the use of wind turbines as distributed generation to provide <b>back-up</b> <b>electricity</b> during hurricane-induced outages. The study develops computationally efficient models for evaluating outages in electric grids, while demonstrating their applicability through modeling a large real system subject to natural hazards, structural and system responses, and restoration processes. It employs a Bayesian networks approach and uses influence networks constructed via N- 1 contingence Direct Current (DC) flow analyses to make the framework computationally tractable, time-efficient and amenable for real-time updating of information via data fusion in the future. The framework computes hurricane-induced customer outages in distributed 1 km 2 blocks across the entire system, and simulates system restoration according to resource mobilization practices and sequences identified from historic events. The study uses the Harris County electric grid in Texas under Hurricane Ike in 2008 to illustrate the framework’s application. The framework yields system responses that are in agreement with observed outages, with a mean error of 15. 4 % in outages aggregated at the ZIP code level. Performance comparison of the proposed framework with two previously existing models shows that the model has a better prediction accuracy and requires a significantly lower computation time than the existing models. The model takes minute and half as compared to more than an hour required by the previous models to run 50 simulations. Having observed widespread outages in the electric power system, with some lasting several days or weeks before power restoration, the study also looked at the reliability of wind turbines to support their integration in the form of distributed generation in power systems. The study introduced a closed-form methodology for computing the system failure probabilities of wind turbines considering different failure event definitions. The methodology is enhanced to incorporate consequences such as downtimes and repair costs of individual component failures, and to determine the turbine unavailability or cost risks. It yields vital reliability information that could be readily used for planning maintenance and forecasting wind power outputs necessary for widespread distributed wind generation. Furthermore, the study examines the use of tuned liquid column dampers (TLCDs) to increase the reliability of wind turbines. Comparison of results for wind turbines with and without the damper shows that a baseline TLCD of 1 % mass ratio significantly reduces the structural vibrations (by as much as 47 %), and considerably decreases the unavailability probability of a turbine (by up to 8 %). Armed with the resilience assessment model for power systems and the reliability analysis tools for wind turbines, the study also develops a probabilistic model for quantifying the impact of distributed wind generation (DWG) on an electric grid during hurricane-induced outage periods. The model incorporates energy adequacy assessment principles while accounting for the uncertainty in electricity demands and in power output due to variability in the wind resource, unavailability of DWG units owing to turbine failures, as well as component failures in the main utility system. An application of the model to Harris County’s power system equipped with turbines of total rated capacity of 1. 8 GW shows that the DWG can provide back-up power to up to 85 % of the customers in a distribution area which directly connects a DWG unit, while reducing the overall outages in the entire county by 8. 5 %. Thus, DWG can help improve the resilience of electric grids, support the rapid recovery of hurricane-affect communities and reduce economic losses associated with widespread and prolonged outages. In summary, the study provides computationally efficient tools for exploring a wide range of what-if scenarios in large real energy systems. The models can be readily adapted to consider other emerging technologies such as storage systems, vehicle grids, smart grids and micro grids in electric grid resilience assessments. Thus, they can support resilience-based decisions for hurricane preparedness and mitigation, and restoration strategies that could ensure rapid recovery of the systems. They support efforts in ensuring a reliable and a sustainable supply of electricity during normal conditions or {{in the immediate aftermath of}} hurricane events. The outage assessment model, for instance, is directly implemented in the City of Houston’s Storm Risk Calculator, an online tool that informs resident users about the local risks they face from an in-coming hurricane, and the city’s emergency managers in hurricane disaster management. ...|$|E

40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} are {{believed}} to reduce drastically greenhouse gas emissions {{that would otherwise be}} generated from fossil fuels used to generate electricity. This implies that a unit of renewable energy will replace a unit of fossil-fuel, with its CO 2 emissions, on an equivalent basis (with no other effects on the grid). But, the fuel economy and emissions in the existing power systems are not proportional with the electricity production of intermittent sources due to cycling of the fossil fuel plants that make up the balance of the grid (i. e. changing the power output makes thermal units to operate less efficiently). This study focuses in the interactions between wind generation and thermal plants cycling, by establishing the levels of extra fuel use caused by decreased efficiencies of fossil <b>back-up</b> for wind <b>electricity</b> in Spain. We analyze the production of all thermal plants in 2011, studying different scenarios where wind penetration causes major deviations in programming, while we define a procedure for quantifying the carbon reductions by using emission factors and efficiency curves from the existing installations.

40|$|In {{solar cooling}} systems the {{selection}} of the thermal driven and solar collection technologies is mainly based on climate and load conditions analysis. Moreover in particular conditions (i. e., south part of the Mediterranean basin), energy (<b>electricity,</b> <b>back-up</b> fuel) and water costs and availability can be driving parameters in the design process. The work presented in this paper falls within the activities carried out to evaluate the technical feasibility of solar cooling in the Mediterranean food & agro industry. In particular, a case study based on the application of a solar refrigeration system for a Tunisian Agro-food industry is presented. This novel system consists in the series connection of a concentrating collector, a water-ammonia single effect air-cooled absorption chiller and a cold storage. This configuration is justified by the high temperature difference between the chilled refrigerant temperature about – 5 °C and the ambient temperature which could exceed 40 °C. The monitoring data obtained were analyzed in order to extract the performance figures recommended by the most up to date unified monitoring procedure proposed within Task 38 -SHC of the International Energy Agency (IEA). These results showed a good operation of the system as well as they are reasonably comparable to the expected performance of the system.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{air-conditioning}} in buildings and for industrial process cooling - e. g., in food industry - is growing rapidly {{all over the}} world. A new promising approach to meet this increasing demand in an environmentally sound way {{is the use of}} solar energy in combination with heat driven cold production. Many technical solutions are possible to use solar heat for air-conditioning. Key issues for system design and selection of components are: - The selection of the room air-conditioning distribution systems: e. g., radiative ceilings and other ”high temperature” systems need only chilled water temperatures in the range of 15 - 18 °C while chilled water networks supplying fan-coil systems require temperatures at 7 - 10 °C. - The heat rejection technology used: a wet cooling tower allows for lower heat rejection temperatures than dry air-cooling. - The presence and size of a storage to overcome mismatches between solar gains and cooling loads. A very attractive solution in terms of energy density is an ice storage; however this storage requires cold production temperatures below 0 °C. The system selection is mainly based on climate and load conditions analysis and on the energy (<b>electricity,</b> <b>back-up</b> fuel) and water costs and availability. In this paper a basic thermodynamic analysis is presented which gives insight into the interaction between the selection of the proper technical solution and the climate and load conditions. In {{the second part of the}} paper a special focus is given on a newly designed system which can be applied under extreme climatic conditions, i. e., hot and humid climates...|$|R
