"You see," [...] said she, [...] "old Billy Simpson {{let this}} house fur a hundred dollars--there's eighty acres with it--to Sarah Ann Hemphill and her husband; and he's gone to Richmond to git stock for a wheelwright's shop.

I guess you {{remember}} that heifer; they got her of old Joe Sanders, on the Creek. And they sold one of their horses--the sorrel--and a mule; they hadn't no use fur 'em here, fur the land's not worth much, and hasn't seen no guano nor nothin' fur three or four years; and the money they got was enough to start a mighty good cooper-shop, ef Sam don't spend it all, or most of it, in Richmond, which I think he will; and of course, he being away, Sarah Ann wanted to go to her mother's, and she got herself ready and took them four children--and I pity the old lady, fur Sam's children never had no bringin' up. I disremember how old Tommy is, but it isn't over eight, and just as noisy as ef he wasn't the oldest. And so I come here {{to take care of the}} place; but I can't stay no longer than Tuesday fortnight, as I told Sarah Ann, fur I've got to go to Betsey Cropper's then to help her with her spinnin'; and there's my own things--seven pounds of wool to spin fur Truly Mattherses people, besides two bushel baskets, easy, of carpet-rags to sew, and I want 'em done by the time Miss Jane gits her loom empty, or I'll git no weavin' done this year, and what do you think?

6000|$|But {{the effect}} was only momentary; a few steps further she found that she could walk with little {{difficulty}} between the ranks of stalks, which were regularly spaced, and the resemblance now changed {{to that of a}} long pillared conservatory of greenish glass, that touched all objects with its pervading hue. She also found that the close air above her head was continually freshened by the interchange of currents of lower temperature from below,--as if the whole vast field had a circulation of its own,--and that the adobe beneath her feet was gratefully cool to her tread. There was no dust, as he had said; what had at first half suffocated her seemed to be some stimulating aroma of creation that filled the narrow green aisles, and now imparted a strange vigor and excitement to her as she walked along. Meantime her guide was not conversationally idle. Now, no doubt, she {{had never seen anything like}} this before? It was ordinary wheat, only it was grown on adobe soil--the richest in the valley. These stalks, she could see herself, were ten and twelve feet high. That was the trouble, they all ran too much to stalk, though the grain yield was [...] "suthen' pow'ful." [...] She could tell that to her friends, for he reckoned she was the only young lady that had ever walked under such a growth. Perhaps she was new to Californy? He thought so from the start. Well, this was Californy, and this was not the least of the ways it could [...] "lay over" [...] every other country on God's yearth. Many folks thought it was the gold and the climate, but she could see for herself what it could do with wheat. He wondered if her brother had ever told, her of it? No, the stranger wasn't her brother. Nor cousin, nor company? No; only the hired driver from a San Jose hotel, who was takin' her over to Major Randolph's. Yes, he knew the old major; the ranch was a pretty place, nigh unto three miles further on. Now that he knew the driver was no relation of hers he didn't mind telling her that the buggy was a [...] "rather old consarn," [...] and the driver didn't know his business. Yes, it might <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>up</b> so as to take her over to the major's; there was one of their own men--a young fellow--who could do anything that COULD be done with wood and iron,--a reg'lar genius!--and HE'D tackle it. It might take an hour, but she'd find it quite cool waiting in the shanty. It was a rough place, for they only camped out there during the season to look after the crop, and lived at their own homes the rest of the time. Was she going to stay long at the major's? He noticed she had not brought her trunk with her. Had she known the major's wife long? Perhaps she thought of settling in the neighborhood? ...|$|E

The small homes that surround the project buildings have also decayed as many homes are now boarded up and abandoned.

50|$|Although the {{description}} above has employed {{the notion that}} code may be generated with certain fields left to <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>up</b> later, there was an implicit assumption {{that the size of}} such code sequences was stable. This may not be the case. Many computers have provision for operations occupying different amounts of storage, notably relative addressing whereby if the destination is within say -128 or +127 addressing steps then an eight-bit address field can be used, otherwise a much larger address field is required to reach. Thus if the code were generated with a hopeful short address field, later it may become necessary to go back and adjust the code to use a longer field, with the consequence that earlier code referencing locations after the change will have to be adjusted as well. Likewise, later references going backwards across the change will have to be fixed, even those that had been to known addresses. And as well, the fixup information will itself have to be fixed, correctly. On the other hand, long addresses could be used for all cases when nearness is not certain, but the resulting code will no longer be the best possible...|$|E
50|$|Both telescopes {{sat in the}} {{observatory}} unused, for years up until 2008. In 2001 Dr. Timothy Dey learned about {{the observatory}} and first surveyed the site. He dreamed and worked toward a plan to restore the observatory. Being an amateur astronomer himself and living in Lincoln Park, he sought out a means to reactivate the observatory {{and bring it back}} into use. Leo Macmaster, an 8th grade science teacher and Dr. Dey worked together wrote a grant application for funds to revitalize the observatory. They won a grant from Toshiba Incorporated. The grant initially larger, was reduced from its initial award due to the economic downturn of 2008. The observatory was found to still house the original telescope and the 8 in Newtonian reflector, but many starlings over the years had nested in the observatory and many bird droppings coated the mirrors of both instruments. The observatory had to <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>up</b> and the older instruments removed. Parts of the original scaffolding used to climb up and view through the old 12 in Newtonian were used {{as a part of a}} raised floor. Viewers no longer have to climb a large wooden scaffold to peer through an eyepiece 9 ft off the floor. The SCT telescope has an eyepiece at the back of the telescope.|$|E

After the zombies break into the diner and kill Peter and his mother, Annie runs back to her own group of survivors. Nick and the others make it to Rhonda's auto shop and learn that {{the government is going to}} bomb the city in six days to stop the outbreak. The group drives to a military checkpoint, only to find everyone there dead and be ambushed by a rogue biker gang. After defeating the bikers, Nick reunites with his old friend Diego, who is now a soldier, and learns from him that there is a plane at the old museum in town that can <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>up</b> and used to escape the city before it is destroyed. However, before starting to work on the plane, Nick is bitten by a zombie and heads to the crematorium in town to search for some Zombrex, meeting a man called Gary on the way, who is looking for a certain girl under orders from his boss. Unable to find any Zombrex, Nick loses all hope until Gary notices that his wound has healed, revealing that he is somehow immune from turning.|$|E
