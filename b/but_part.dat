5|$|Artie {{reveals the}} origin of his {{disability}} to Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), explaining that he was paralyzed {{in a car accident}} at the age of eight. He likens his wheelchair use to Tina's speech impediment. The two go on a date and kiss, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> on bad terms when Tina confesses that she has been faking her speech impediment since the sixth grade, in order to deflect attention from herself, but now feels she no longer needs to, having been given confidence by the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer {{is spoken}} by the {{indigenous}} Khmer {{population of the}} Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, {{have been forced to}} take Vietnamese names. Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.|$|E

5|$|The {{state highway}} map in 1933 showed a {{proposed}} southern extension from Clarkston through southern Oakland County, Wayne County into Monroe County. This proposed highway would have bypassed Metro Detroit {{to the west}} through Farmington, Northville, Plymouth and Belleville. The full highway was never built, and M-15 was never extended south of Clarkston, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of this proposal was completed.

5|$|In 1960, {{aspiring}} musician Govind (Shahid Kapoor) {{and popular}} Bollywood superstar Ruksar (Priyanka Chopra) meet {{on a train}} heading to Bombay, India. Ruksar had run away from her home Lucknow with her best friend to become a film star. The two bond over their careers <b>but</b> <b>part</b> ways after arriving in Bombay. Govind befriends Radhika (Prachi Desai), a confident and modern girl, who is charmed by his simplicity. Ruksar and Govind meet again and hit it off at a party, but Govind notices a photo journalist following them. He holds Radhika's hand to mislead the journalist, unaware that Radhika has {{fallen in love with}} him. Radhika is the best friend Ruksar had run away with, and the two tell each other about the man they've fallen in love with, not realising he is the same person. When Ruksar, Radhika and Govind all meet, the three realise what happened and brokenheartedly part ways.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 April, {{elements}} of the SS Motorised Infantry Division Reich, under command of XLI Motorised Corps crossed the Danube in pneumatic boats and captured Belgrade without resistance. About the same time, most {{of the elements of}} XLVI Motorised Corps that were approaching Belgrade from the west were redirected away from the capital, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of the 8th Panzer Division continued their thrust to capture the Sava bridges to the west of Belgrade, and entered the city during the night. The rest of the 8th Panzer Division turned southeast and drove towards Valjevo to link up with the left flank of the First Panzer Group southwest of Belgrade. The 16th Motorised Infantry Division was redirected south across the Sava, and advanced toward Zvornik.|$|E

5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. <b>But</b> <b>part</b> of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Simeon I {{planned to}} secure his {{position}} in Constantinople through a marriage between his daughter and the infant Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959), thus becoming basileopator (father-in-law) and guardian of Constantine VII. However, in 919 Admiral Romanos Lekapenos married his daughter to Constantine VII and in 920 proclaimed himself senior emperor, ruining Simeon I's ambitions to ascend the throne by diplomatic means. Until his death, the Bulgarian monarch never recognized the legitimacy of Romanos' accession to the throne. Thus, {{in the beginning of}} 921 Simeon I did not reply to a proposal of the Ecumenical Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos to betroth one of his daughters or sons to a progeny of Romanos I and sent his army into Byzantine Thrace, reaching Katasyrtai in the outskirts of Constantinople. Romanos I retaliated with a campaign under Pothos Argyros, who reached the town of Aquae Calidae, near modern Burgas, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of his army was ambushed and destroyed by the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch air force, {{which was}} not an {{independent}} arm of the Dutch armed forces, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of the Army, on 10 May operated a fleet of 155 aircraft: 28 Fokker G.1 twin-engine destroyers; 31 Fokker D.XXI and seven Fokker D.XVII fighters; ten twin-engined Fokker T.V, fifteen Fokker C.X and 35 Fokker C.V light bombers, twelve Douglas DB-8 dive bombers (used as fighters) and seventeen Koolhoven FK-51 reconnaissance aircraft—thus 74 of the 155 aircraft were biplanes. Of these aircraft 125 were operational. Of the remainder the air force school used three Fokker D.XXI, six Fokker D.XVII, a single Fokker G.I, a single Fokker T.V and seven Fokker C.V, along with several training airplanes. Another forty operational aircraft served with the marine air service along with about {{an equal number of}} reserve and training craft. The production potential of the Dutch military aircraft industry, consisting of Fokker and Koolhoven, was not fully exploited due to budget limitations.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{position}} of the Polish Army is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of the Polish right flank, moving quietly in the dense mist, encircled Maximilian's left flank. After the mist began to clear the Archduke realized his force was being flanked and his retreat to Byczyna was threatened. He ordered an attack, but a miscommunication of his orders confused part of his army and the Hungarian regiment began to retreat. The Polish left wing, under command of future Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, dispersed the opposing units. The battle saw more infantry action than many others of the Commonwealth but, even so, the Polish cavalry (Polish winged hussars) played a major part. The battle began with some duels between elears (cavalry champions), soon followed by Polish cavalry charges, on the left flank and in the center, which {{did not result in}} any significant breakthroughs for either side. Zamoyski is said to have commanded the battle very well, turning it at several points. Eventually a Polish hussar counterattack on the left flank mauled Maximilan's Hungarian cavalry and forced his army to start giving ground. The bloody retreat quickly turned into a general rout during which the Archduke's army suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} begins sinking as {{the creature}} {{in the ice}} escapes and runs amok. The TARDIS, which originally was on a course set for Las Vegas, materialises inside the submarine and the Doctor and Clara tumble out. The Doctor convinces Captain Zhukov (Liam Cunningham) to maneuver the submarine to the side, landing it safely and preventing it from imploding. During this the TARDIS inexplicably dematerialises. They then encounter the escaped Ice Warrior, Grand Marshal Skaldak (Spencer Wilding, voiced by Nicholas Briggs). The Doctor encourages the crew to be peaceful, but the ship's executive officer Stepashin (Tobias Menzies) knocks out Skaldak with a cattle prod, suspecting {{that he is not}} an alien <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of a Western plot. Knowing that Skaldak will desire vengeance for being attacked, the Doctor and the crew chain Skaldak, who sends out a distress call for others of his race to find him.|$|E
5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E

5|$|The {{hexagonal}} Great Tower {{was probably}} {{begun in the}} 1430s and 1440s, possibly on the motte of a previous castle. The tower today has lost not only one of its walls <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of its upper structure, and would originally have been three storeys high with probably additional machicolations on top similar to those on the gatehouse. It {{was designed to be}} a self-contained fortification, with its own water and food supplies, and luxurious quarters lit by large windows on the upper floors. Originally the tower was reached by a bascule drawbridge, usually considered to be drawn from contemporary French designs, such as those at Ferté-Milon and Vannes. This drawbridge was designed to have two parts— a wide, heavy bridge that would be raised or lowered when the family was in residence, and a thinner bridge, easier to lift, designed for the use of servants at other times. The Herberts used the bridge as their badge, and it {{can be seen in the}} carved window designs around the castle. The drawbridge was replaced with a grander stone bridge in the 1460s, probably at a cost of around £900 to £1000. An apron wall with six turrets was also added around the tower at around the same time.|$|E
25|$|The bridge lasted {{much longer}} than its predecessor, <b>but</b> <b>part</b> of it {{collapsed}} in 1859. A ferry crossing was briefly revived until {{the completion of the}} third bridge in 1864.|$|E
