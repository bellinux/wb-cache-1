40|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry {{plays a key}} role in Vietnam (due to its labour advantage), generating jobs, contributing to social and political stability, and adding high value exports to help the <b>balance</b> <b>payment.</b> As Vietnam becomes more and more active in its pursuit of global economic integration, the entry of many foreign giants into its own domestic market will surely intensify the competition. Recognizing the importance of functional competencies to the firm’s performance will help the companies improve its competitiveness. In addition, many researchers had emphasized the importance of an integrative perspective study. Therefore, this study integrates four functions to investigate relationship between four functional competencies and firm performance of manufacturing companies in Vietnam. To address these issues, a field survey of manufacturing companies in Vietnam was conducted with the use of structured questionnaires and mail survey. A total of 725 questionnaires were sent by mail to manufacturing companies. Consequently 125 questionnaires were mailed back at gross response rate of 17. 24 %. The sample composed of 63. 6 per cent limited or joint-stock companies, 27. 3 per cent state-owned enterprises and 9. 1 per cent foreign capital organizations. Various data analysis procedures were applied including factor analysis, descriptive analysis, single regression and multiple regression in order to accomplish the objectives of the study. The findings identified four set of items of functional competencies namely manufacturing, marketing, research & development (R&D), and human resource and two set of items of organizational performances called profitability and market performance. All of these factors had high loadings (all above 0. 541) and high reliability (all above 0. 794), indicating internal consistency. Although these dimensions retain a certain degree of similarity with others found in previous studies elsewhere, this collection of dimensions offers typical features of manufacturing companies in Vietnam. It found that in general, manufacturing companies in Vietnam do not perform very well their four functions: manufacturing, marketing, research & development and human resource. This expected result came from a long period where production and consumption were all planned and distributed by the Government. It was discovered that seven hypotheses out of eight were supported by the empirical research and there were no unexpected results. The study confirmed that those manufacturing companies in Vietnam putting more emphasis on marketing, research & development and human resource competencies can expect to earn higher profitability and market performance. The study also found the positive and significant relationship between manufacturing competency and profitability. These findings are consistent with some previous studies...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there exists}} a large volume of {{literature}} on the {{theory and practice of}} LDC exchange rate regimes in the post-Bretton Woods era, it is mostly of a general nature treating LDCs as a whole. There are very few studies which examine in depth the special features of individual exchange rate regimes. Moreover, the issue of exchange rate instability that characterized the generalized floating of world's major currencies since the early 1970 s, has so far received only superficial treatments as far as LDCs are concerned. The thesis attempts to fill these gaps by examining the Indian case in detail. An exchange rate policy in fact has two aspects. First, it involves the establishment of an optimal exchange rate regime which lays the framework for the day-to-day determination of the nominal exchange rate. Second, the exchange rate policy is concerned with the operation of the exchange rate regime {{in such a way as}} to promote given policy objectives. In the context of generalized floating, the decision regarding exchange rate regime for an LDC has to be made on the grounds of `internal balance', i. e. with a view to protecting the domestic economy from disturbances arising from day-to-day third world currency fluctuations. This would require a multi-currency peg based on balance of trade elasticities. Once an exchange rate regime is established, it has to be managed on considerations of `external balance'. This in turn would require adjustments in the value of the peg, either to compensate for the inflation differential between the home country and its trading partners, or in order to bring about a balance of payments adjustment. India adopted a basket peg since September 1975. However, India's basket system does not appear to be optimal, firstly because of the major role given in it to sterling as the currency of intervention, designation and valuation, and more importantly, because the official currency basket does not seem to be representative enough and also is not based on elasticity weights. Concerning the management of the basket peg, it appears that the authorities have been guided by a number of alternative considerations which came into conflict with the objective of external balance. Particularly, considerations such as the minimization of speculation and inflation, and the stabilization of the rupee-dollar rate seemed to have considerably influenced India's exchange rate policy. An important result of the promotion of the above alternative objectives has been high exchange rate volatility. Exchange rate instability depresses trade by generating exchange risk. In the context of LDCs with quantitative restrictions on private imports and direct government imports, the impact of exchange risk is felt much more on exports than imports. Previous studies on the impact of exchange rate instability on LDC exports have suffered from specification mistakes of export functions as well as inaccuracy of the exchange risk proxies employed. We developed a fully specified exchange risk-augmented demand-supply model of exports for India. We used this model to estimate the impact of changes in exchange rate and exchange risk on exports in the aggregate as well as for the two disaggregated groups, namely, manufactured and non-fuel primary products. The separate effects on the volume and price of exports were estimated. We also demonstrated that the signs of the exchange risk elasticity coefficients in export price equations are consistent with the invoicing pattern of India's exports. We simulated the results of the export model under reasonable assumptions for the medium term, and demonstrated the possibility of much gains on current account through a policy of reducing exchange rate instability in real terms. They also tend to show that an equilibrium exchange rate cannot be defined independent of the short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate. The results of the study have profound implications also for other LDCs which are subject to chronic <b>balance</b> <b>payment</b> deficits...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to trigger the devolution of the system balancing responsibility entirely belonging to the transmission system operator (TSO) to several local distribution system operators by fairly allocating system balancing cost based on a cost-causality principle. Within the devolved system balancing scheme, distribution system operators (DSOs) have appropriate motivation for reducing the variability and uncertainty caused by units in their own area. As the number of renewable electricity sources (RES) being connected to the local distribution system increases, it would be advantageous for the TSO to share the increasing burden of the system balancing responsibility with multiple DSOs. To achieve this, we suggest that, first DSOs be designated as the representatives of their own jurisdictions with primary economic responsibility for <b>balancing</b> <b>payments</b> that are originally charged to each energy market participant. Second, {{this research}} proves that a cost-causality based cost allocation scheme(CC-CAS) is superior to an energy-amount based cost allocation scheme (currently widely used) in terms of economic efficiency.
