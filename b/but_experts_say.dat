50|$|This public fear of {{radiation}} {{also plays a}} big role in why the costs of an RDD impact on a major metropolitan area (such as lower Manhattan) might be equal to or even larger than that of the 9/11 attacks. Assuming the radiation levels are not too high and the area {{does not need to be}} abandoned such as the town of Pripyat near the Chernobyl reactor, an expensive and time consuming cleanup procedure will begin. This will mainly consist of tearing down highly contaminated buildings, digging up contaminated soil and quickly applying sticky substances to remaining surfaces so that radioactive particles adhere before radioactivity penetrates the building materials. These procedures are the current state of the art for radioactive contamination cleanup, <b>but</b> some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that a complete cleanup of external surfaces in an urban area to current decontamination limits may not be technically feasible. Loss of working hours will be vast during cleanup, but even after the radiation levels reduce to an acceptable level, there might be residual public fear of the site including possible unwillingness to conduct business as usual in the area. Tourist traffic is likely never to resume.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{studies also}} show that women face more {{barriers}} in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job. When taking the median earnings {{of men and women}} who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the [...] "wage gap" [...] has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the [...] "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, <b>but</b> some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line. Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|There are two notable {{instances}} of legal action over dōjinshi. In 1999, {{the author of}} an erotic Pokémon manga was prosecuted by Nintendo.
