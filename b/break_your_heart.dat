500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just <b>break</b> <b>your</b> <b>heart.</b> But I'm only gonna <b>break</b> <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E
500|$|Bill Fay {{released}} {{his first two}} albums, Bill Fay (1970) and Time of the Last Persecution (1971), on the Deram Records label. The recordings did not perform well and Fay was dropped from Deram soon {{after the release of}} his second album. After failing to secure another recording contract, Fay took various jobs including fruit picking, working in a factory and in a supermarket. Fay continued to write songs and entered the studio with a group of musicians in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tapes of the resulting album, Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow, were sent to twelve record companies but the album did not receive a release. In 1998, British record label See for Miles Records re-issued Bill Fay and Time of the Last Persecution on compact disc, reviving interest in Fay's work. Wilco singer Jeff Tweedy, who sang Fay's [...] "Be Not So Fearful" [...] during the 2002 Wilco documentary I Am Trying to <b>Break</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Heart,</b> Current 93s David Tibet, Okkervil Rivers Will Sheff, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, Jim O'Rourke and Nick Cave declared themselves fans of Fay's music.|$|E
