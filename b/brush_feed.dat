40|$|Background: Prolonged {{bottle and}} breast feeding {{may result in}} Early Childhood Caries (ECC). The {{clinical}} appearance of teeth in ECC in the children is typical and follow a definitive pattern. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of ECC and its dependent factors in Hamadan Kindergarten's children in 2006. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, ECC data were collected using questionnaires from 414 children with age range of 2 - 6 years by a dentist. The relationship between early childhood caries and bottle or breast feeding, period of feeding, use of sweetening materials, frequency of feeding at night, and first time brushing were recorded. Data were analyzed with T-test and Chi- square test. Results : The prevalence of ECC was 31. 7. The most affected teeth were left maxillary incisors (28. 01) and least affected left lower canine (0). There was a meaningful correlation between breast feeding and ECC. There was no correlation between ECC and age, sex, first time <b>brushing,</b> <b>feeding</b> period, use of sweetening materials, bottle feeding and feeding at night. Conclusion: The prevalence of ECC was high in the studied population and there was a relationship between breast feeding and it's duration with ECC...|$|R
60|$|He worked {{slowly and}} carefully, {{keenly aware of}} his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he {{increased}} {{the size of the}} twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the <b>brush</b> and <b>feeding</b> directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy-five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire—that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.|$|R
50|$|The {{mosquito}} larva has a well-developed {{head with}} mouth <b>brushes</b> used for <b>feeding,</b> a large thorax and a nine-segment abdomen. It has no legs. In contrast to other mosquitoes, the Anopheles larva lacks a respiratory siphon, so it positions itself {{so that its}} body {{is parallel to the}} surface of the water. In contrast, feeding larva of a nonanopheline mosquito species attaches itself to the water surface with its posterior siphon, with their body pointing downwards.|$|R
50|$|The radula {{is used in}} {{two main}} ways: either as a rake, {{generally}} to comb up microscopic, filamentous algae from a surface; or as a rasp, to feed directly on a plant.The rhipidoglossan (see below) and, to a lesser extent, the taenigloissan radula types are suited to less strenuous modes of <b>feeding,</b> <b>brushing</b> up smaller algae or feeding on soft forms; molluscs with such radulae are rarely able to feed on leathery or coralline algae. On the other hand, the docoglossan gastropod radula allows a very similar diet to the polyplacophora, feeding primarily on these resistant algae, although microalgae are also consumed by species with these radular types.|$|R
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is a Department of Energy Facility {{designed}} to vitrify highly radioactive waste. An extensive materials evaluation {{program has been}} completed on key components in the DWPF after twelve months of operation using nonradioactive simulated wastes. Results of the visual inspections of the feed preparation system indicate that the system components, which were fabricated from Hastelloy C- 276, should achieve their design lives. Significant erosion was observed on agitator blades that process glass frit slurries; however, design modifications should mitigate the erosion. Visual inspections of the DWPF melter top head and off gas components, which were fabricated from Inconel 690, indicated that varying degrees of degradation occurred. Most of the components will perform satisfactorily for their two year design life. The components that suffered significant attack were the borescopes, primary film cooler <b>brush,</b> and <b>feed</b> tubes. Changes {{in the operation of}} the film cooler brush and design modifications to the feed tubes and borescopes is expected to extend their service lives to two years.

40|$|Abstract. Most of the polychaete larvae {{in which}} feed-ing {{mechanisms}} {{have been studied}} feed using an op-posed-band mechanism, capturing particles with proto-trochal and metatrochal ciliary bands and transporting them to the mouth via a food groove. However, many other planktotrophic polychaete larvae lack a metatroch and food groove and thus must feed in a different way. In this latter group are the larvae of polynoid polychaetes, which not only lack a metatroch and food groove but also bear a bundle of long cilia (the oral brush) attached near {{the left side of}} the mouth. In feeding experiments with polystyrene beads and plankton, larvae of the poly-noid Arctonoe vittata ingested larger particles (up to 60 pm in diameter) than those ingested by the opposed-band feeding larvae of the serpulid Scrpda vcrmicdaris (up to 12 pm in diameter). Videotaped images of feeding A. vittata larvae showed that capture behavior was elic-ited as particles in a feeding current driven by the proto-troth approached or contacted the larval episphere. Par-ticles on or very near the episphere were disengaged by a recoiling motion ofthe larva and were then moved to the mouth, probably by the oral <b>brush.</b> This <b>feeding</b> mecha-nism may be widespread in the polychaete superfamily Aphroditacea, which includes about 10 % of extant poly-chaete species...|$|R
40|$|The larva of the {{mosquito}} Culex pipiens is a filter-feeder {{and is able}} to use the feeding current generated by its mouth brushes to glide slowly through the water. The hydrodynamics of the mouth brushes, and of gliding, were investigated by visualizing the feeding current using dyes. Unlike the mouth brushes of a sessile filter-feeder such as the blackfly larva, those of C. pipiens function more like 'paddles' than 'rakes', a beneficial adaptation to life in still as opposed to running water. Technically, the Froude efficiency of gliding is very low (0. 23) because the design of the <b>feeding</b> <b>brushes</b> favours delivery of water into the wake rather than forward momentum to the body. The wider implications of these findings to foraging strategy and other aspects of the behaviour of mosquito larvae are discussed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTIntroductionThe {{promotion}} of oral health in children is highly important, {{as well as}} parents' motivation to adopt the attitudes necessary {{for the maintenance of}} the health of their children. ObjectiveTo evaluate parents' attitudes about their children's oral health and to determine the prevalence of dental caries. Material and methodA cross-sectional analytical study, conducted with parents and preschoolers from the elementary schools in Araçatuba. A formal instrument was used to collect data, in order to evaluate parents' attitudes regarding their children's oral health. A clinical oral exam was performed {{in order to determine the}} decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) and Index of Oral Health&# 8211;Simplified (IOH&# 8211;S). The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS 21. 0 software. ResultThe state of the children's oral health was good; the mean of the decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) was 0. 68 (Standard deviation = 1. 70). Most of the children presented a mean index of oral hygiene (IOHS = 1. 51, Standard deviation = 0. 48). The parents' attitudes related to oral health were not very good. Many of them did not floss their children's teeth; the bottle-fed children did not <b>brush</b> after <b>feeding.</b> The consumption of sugar was associated with the presence of dental plaque in the children (p= 0. 05). Nevertheless, in most cases, tooth brushing was performed by the parents and was associated with a good dmft index in the children (p= 0. 04). ConclusionThe state of children's oral health in the present study was good. However, the parents' attitudes in relation to oral health were not good...|$|R
40|$|During {{the milling}} of Sandvik Coromant’s world leading Drill with {{replaceable}} inserts,the CoroDrill 880 ©, burrs appear around the milled surfaces. The burrs are removedusing different methods, {{one of which}} is deburring with special brushing machines thatare integrated into milling cells. The machines of the type Sinjet, use a Siemensguidance system. The deburring results are not satisfying and manual deburring isrequired afterwards. The manual deburring may cause damage to important edges andmeasurements of the product and is also very time consuming for the machineoperators. As almost no engineering work has been done with the process, it has to be evaluatedand improved. The objective is to present a proposition of an improved process,where no manual deburring is required and also to present an instruction manual ofhow the implementation should be carried out. The evaluation of the deburring process revealed some flaws that lead to themachines bad performance. The greatest flaw was that many dimensions of theproducts use the same recipe, where few parameters are adapted to the differentdimensions, which gives an uneven performance. Another problem was the generallack of knowledge about the guidance system. Many experiments were carried out to find which adjustable parameters that had themost influence on the machines performance. The tests showed that the brushingangle against the part and the <b>brushes</b> in <b>feed</b> depth had the most effect. By designinga new program that was better adapted to the problematic areas of the part, as wellas making better use of the parameters that gave the best results, a significantimprovement was achieved. An instruction manual was made in order to explain the changes in the program andthe different parameters contribution to the performance of the machines. Theimplementation process was also thoroughly explained to make the work easier forthe ones doing it...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and characterize the hypothesized apical cation/H+ exchanger responsible for K+ and/or Na+ secretion in the renal (Malpighian) tubules of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. From Aedes Malpighian tubules, we cloned “AeNHE 8,” a full-length cDNA encoding an ortholog of mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger 8 (NHE 8). The expression of AeNHE 8 transcripts is ubiquitous among mosquito tissues and is not enriched in Malpighian tubules. Western blots of Malpighian tubules suggest that AeNHE 8 is expressed primarily as an intracellular protein, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical localizations in Malpighian tubules. AeNHE 8 immunoreactivity is expressed in principal cells of the secretory, distal segments, where it localizes to a subapical compartment (e. g., vesicles or endosomes), but not in the apical <b>brush</b> border. Furthermore, <b>feeding</b> mosquitoes a blood meal or treating isolated tubules with dibutyryl-cAMP, both of which stimulate a natriuresis by Malpighian tubules, do not influence the intracellular localization of AeNHE 8 in principal cells. When expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes, AeNHE 8 mediates EIPA-sensitive Na/H exchange, in which Li+ partially and K+ poorly replace Na+. The expression of AeNHE 8 in Xenopus oocytes is associated with the development of a conductive pathway that closely resembles the known endogenous nonselective cation conductances of Xenopus oocytes. In conclusion, AeNHE 8 does not mediate cation/H+ exchange in the apical membrane of Aedes Malpighian tubules; it is more likely involved with an intracellular function...|$|R
