5|$|The Rosewood massacre, {{the ensuing}} silence, and the {{compensation}} hearing were {{the subject of}} the 1996 <b>book</b> <b>Like</b> Judgment Day: The Ruin and Redemption of a Town Called Rosewood by Michael D'Orso. It was a New York Times bestseller and won the Lillian Smith Book Award, bestowed by the University of Georgia Libraries and the Southern Regional Council to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works.|$|E
5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also concerned for their daughter Hema, who was only three years old. The bereavement brought about {{a significant change in}} his life and was the inspiration behind his next novel, The English Teacher. This <b>book,</b> <b>like</b> his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|Blökumen are {{mentioned}} in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. They argue that the reference to the Tyrkir and Blökumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs {{when he decided to}} go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey <b>Book,</b> <b>like</b> the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.|$|E

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn <b>book.</b> <b>Like</b> other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} <b>book</b> <b>like</b> their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E

25|$|M. Daphne Kutzer of the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{argues in}} Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that {{the charm of}} Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes lies in the {{illustrations}} rather than the text, and that the <b>book</b> (<b>like</b> other nursery rhyme collections) is not a sustained narrative {{but a series of}} short verses. Such collections are typically unified in style and design, but Appley Dapply lacks this unity because the illustrations range {{over a number of years}} in which Potter's style changed significantly.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{the process}} of {{physically}} assembling a book from an ordered stack of paper sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods to binding a stack together that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards and a label with identifying information is attached to the covers along with additional decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can greatly expand the previous explanation to include <b>book</b> <b>like</b> objects of visual art with high value and artistic merit of exceptional quality in addition to the book's content of text and illustrations.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Mark Melvin, {{an inmate}} at the Kilby Correctional Facility, was banned from {{reading the book}} by Alabama Department of Corrections officials.

500|$|The book {{received}} a mostly favorable reception from news sources and library trade publications. Library Journal described {{the book as}} a sincere analysis of the word and its history of censorship, [...] called it stimulating, and the San Diego Law Review said it was thought-provoking. One reviewer said that the <b>book,</b> <b>like</b> the article, was a format for the author to repeatedly use [...] "fuck", rather than actually analyze it from a rigorous perspective. After the book's release, Fairman was consulted by media sources including CNN and The New York Times, {{as well as the}} American Civil Liberties Union, on issues surrounding word taboo in society.|$|E
500|$|Eugenides blended {{fact and}} fiction in his <b>book.</b> <b>Like</b> Cal, the author was born in 1960; unlike his creation, he is not intersex. His family moved to a house on Middlesex Road in Grosse Pointe after the Detroit riot in 1967. Eugenides studied at University Liggett School, a private {{institution}} {{that served as a}} model for Callie's Baker and Inglis School for Girls. He tapped into his own [...] "locker room trauma", an adolescent experience of being naked among many other nude bodies, and used it to develop Callie's self-discovery of her body during puberty. He based the name of the character the [...] "Obscure Object" [...] on a Brown University classmate whom he found alluring and to whom he gave that nickname. Eugenides married a Japanese-American artist, Karen Yamauchi, and moved to Berlin.|$|E
500|$|Dillard's {{primary reader}} for Pilgrim was a Hollins {{professor}} called John Rees Moore. [...] After finishing a chapter, she would {{bring it to}} Moore to critique. [...] Moore specifically recommended that she expand the book's first chapter [...] "to make clear, and to state boldly, what it was [...] was up to," [...] a suggestion that Dillard at first dismissed, but would later admit was good advice. [...] Previous to publication, chapters of the book appeared in publications including Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic, and The Living Wilderness. [...] Pilgrim at Tinker Creek was published by Harper's Magazine Press in 1974, and was dedicated to Dillard's husband.

500|$|Mom & Me & Mom debuted {{at number}} 8 on The New York Times bestseller list {{the week of}} its release, April 21, 2013. [...] The <b>book,</b> <b>like</b> Angelou's {{previous}} autobiographies, received mostly positive reviews. [...] Fiona Sturges, who reviews the book in the British publication The Independent, and reviewer Stacy Russo of Library Journal both state that Angelou's readers would recognize many of the passages in Mom & Me & Mom from her earlier autobiographies. [...] Bernardine Evaristo of the British publication The Observer, {{in one of the}} few negative reviews of Mom & Me & Mom, calls the book [...] "a slight, anecdotal and badly edited book that rehashes stories from previous memoirs". [...] Evaristo questions the veracity of Angelou's anecdotes, and states that some of them contradict earlier versions. [...] Evaristo also believes that Mom & Me & Mom undermines Caged Bird, which she calls [...] "a ground-breaking triumph".|$|E
500|$|While {{there has}} been {{speculation}} that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana, particularly with lines such as [...] "take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship" [...] and [...] "the smoke rings of my mind", Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs. Though he was using marijuana {{at the time the}} song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or muse, or the singer's search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his <b>book</b> <b>Like</b> a Complete Unknown that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.|$|E
500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a <b>book</b> <b>like</b> this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E
