5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, he {{experimented with}} various {{different}} racquets {{and played the}} German Open with a blacked-out 98-inch Wilson racquet, instead of his regular Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX racquet with the smaller 90-inch hitting area. He returned to his regular racquet {{for the second half}} of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, and indicated it was a mistake to have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.|$|E
5|$|On the surface, {{the novel}} is a love story between the protagonist Jake Barnes—a man whose war wound has made him impotent—and the {{promiscuous}} divorcée usually identified as Lady Brett Ashley. Barnes is an expatriate American journalist living in Paris, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman with bobbed hair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett's affair with Robert Cohn causes Jake to <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> and break off his friendship with Cohn; her seduction of the 19-year-old matador Romero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards in Pamplona.|$|E

5|$|Winchelsey further irritated Edward {{with his}} {{opposition}} to the Bishop of Lichfield, Walter Langton, who was the king's treasurer. The king {{was not the only one}} to <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> by the archbishop; the abbot of Oseney, in 1297, was so affected by a rebuke from him that he suffered a fatal heart attack. In 1299, Winchelsey and the king briefly reconciled, and the archbishop presided at the king's second marriage, to Margaret of France, at Canterbury. Winchelsey vigorously asserted his authority over his suffragan, or subordinant bishops, quarrelled with Pope Boniface VIII over a Sussex living, and was excommunicated by one of the pope's clerks in 1301. He was absolved in 1302.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech was about to <b>be</b> <b>upset.</b> Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown {{and returned to the}} bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|Starting the US Series, del Potro won the 2013 Citi Open in Washington DC, {{where he}} got a first-round bye, and then {{defeated}} Ryan Harrison, Bernard Tomic, and Kevin Anderson {{on his way to}} the quarterfinals, Tommy Haas in the semifinals, and won the final against John Isner in three sets. Before the final he didn't drop a set. This was his third title at the event and his second of the year. Del Potro reached the semifinals of Western & Southern Open where he won against Nikolay Davydenko, Feliciano López, in the quarterfinals Dmitry Tursunov, and faced Isner again, this time in the semifinals. He lost the match in three sets. Del Potro got to the second round of the US Open, after a four-set victory against Guillermo García-López, only to <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> by Lleyton Hewitt in five sets.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the {{selection}} of Kansas, yet another controversy arose when {{it was revealed that}} Big12 and ACC officials had worked out an agreement to feature an Oklahoma/Virginia Tech matchup in the Orange Bowl in the hours leading up to the final selection. Oklahoma, which initiated the proposal, requested that it face the highest-ranked BCS opponent then available, which would have been Virginia Tech (ranked 3rd in the BCS). Normally, Oklahoma, the 2007Big12 Champion, would have played in the Fiesta Bowl, which holds the automatic rights to the Big12 Champion's BCS bid. A little-known clause in the Bowl Championship Series contract, however, allows for the commissioners of the BCS to override that bid if the automatically selected team had played in the game the previous year, or to create a more interesting matchup. Oklahoma had played in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl and seemed a perfect candidate for execution of the clause. Representatives from the Orange and Fiesta bowls reportedly worked out a deal to swap Oklahoma and Kansas and Dan Beebe, the commissioner from the Big12, presented the plan to the BCS committee. The remaining BCS commissioners rejected the request (with only the Big 12, ACC and Big East commissioners in favor) and honored the original selection of Kansas for the Orange Bowl and forced Oklahoma to accept its automatic Fiesta Bowl Bid. The release of this plan upset many fans at both schools and across the country, who perceived that an (4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia Tech matchup would have been superior to a (8)Kansas-(3)Virginia Tech game. Ironically, while Oklahoma-Virginia Tech was perceived as a better match-up due to their high rankings, both teams went on to <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> by the lower ranked team with Oklahoma losing 48-28 to (9)West Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The great dynastic {{success of}} the six {{children}} was {{to a great extent}} not attributable to Christian himself, but the result of the ambitions of his wife Louise of Hesse-Kassel.

25|$|Study has {{indicated}} that most non-Asian Americans do not generally differentiate between Asian Americans of different ethnicities. Stereotypes of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are nearly identical. A 2002 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that 24% of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an Asian American, second only to African Americans; 23% would be uncomfortable supporting an Asian American presidential candidate, compared to 15% for an African American, 14% for a woman and 11% for a Jew; 17% would <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> if {{a substantial number of}} Asian Americans moved into their neighborhood; 25% had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general. The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as business people (77%); high value on education (67%).|$|E
25|$|The British {{telephone}} system proved vulnerable to German artillery-fire {{and the movement}} of troops along communication trenches was delayed by far more than the most pessimistic expectations. An equilibrium between attack and defence quickly resumed, which could only <b>be</b> <b>upset</b> by another set-piece attack, after a delay for preparation which gave the defenders just as much time to reorganise. The attack front was found to have been wide enough to make it impossible for the small number of German reserves to defeat the attack but the attackers had not been ordered to assist units which had been held up and reinforcements were sent to renew failed attacks rather than reinforce success. Small numbers of German troops in strong-points and isolated trenches, had been able to maintain a volume of small-arms fire sufficient to stop the advance of far greater numbers of attackers.|$|E
