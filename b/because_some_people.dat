5|$|On {{the front}} side, on the Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe {{to gain a}} professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook {{page that}} Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability {{in a new}} episode. On June 26, Rovio {{released}} a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. <b>Because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E

25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} answer the door.

Some of Chotiner's friends stated that Nixon involved him in this project after news reports claimed that Nixon had abandoned his former campaign manager, however, Chotiner himself denied that and stated he had been made special counsel <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> in the White House had decided he could be useful. The special counsel also coordinated Vice President Spiro Agnew's campaign against [...] "radic lib" [...] senatorial candidates, including New York Republican Senator Charles Goodell, who was subsequently defeated by Conservative Party candidate James L.

Radio Times made a similar comment about Poppy's return saying that, [...] "In happier news, the glorious Poppy Meadow is back. That is sooo lovely!". Although Stewart did not particularly aim this at Poppy, Stewart did complain about the younger characters in the cast, using Poppy as one of the examples. He said, [...] "While there are some talented and award-winning young actors in the cast, you can't help but suspect that colouring books and crayons are handed out with the scripts at times".

An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: [...] "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion {{of the terms of}} a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were {{likely to be able to}} influence".

[...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out.

2500|$|Today, {{second round}} {{characters}} are officially regarded as incorrect. However, some have survived in informal contexts; this is <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> {{who were in}} school between 1977 and 1986 received their education in second-round characters. For example, eggs at markets are often advertised as [...] "鸡旦" [...] rather than [...] "鸡蛋," [...] parking venues may be marked [...] "仃车" [...] rather than [...] "停车," [...] and street side restaurants as [...] "歺厅" [...] rather than [...] "餐厅."

2500|$|Another {{big change}} to {{swimming}} occurred when Speedo launched the LZR Racer swim suits on February 13, 2008. The suits, developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport, {{were designed to}} repel water, allow oxygen to flow to the muscles, and hold the body in a more hydrodynamic position. The suits had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%. Due to the advantage provided by the suits, some swimmers complained about the fairness in its use, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> used multiple swimsuits to improve buoyancy and compressing of body; even the official blog for the National Collegiate Athletic Association pondered whether they were [...] "technology doping" [...] {{and what was the}} difference between gaining advantage from a swimsuit and gaining advantage from performance-enhancing drugs. In response to these complaints, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) scheduled a meeting with Speedo to discuss the suits. After the meeting, FINA dismissed the claims of cheating, and endorsed the suits for future swimming meets. By August 14, 2008, 62 world records had been broken by swimmers wearing the LZR Racer.|$|E

2500|$|The letters y and i {{are mostly}} equivalent, {{and there is no}} {{concrete}} rule that says when to use one or the other, except in sequences like ay and uy (i.e. tay ("arm, hand") is read [...] while tai ("ear") is read [...] ). There have been attempts since the late 20th century to standardize the orthography by replacing all the vowel uses of y with i, the latest being a decision from the Vietnamese Ministry of Education in 1984.

2500|$|Startup founders {{often have}} a more casual or offbeat {{attitude}} in their dress, office space and marketing, as compared to traditional corporations. For example, startup founders in the 2010s may wear hoodies, sneakers and other casual clothes to business meetings.

Some of the casual approaches, {{such as the use of}} [...] "flat" [...] organizational structures, in which regular employees can talk with the founders and chief executive officers informally, are done to promote efficiency in the workplace, which is needed to get their business off the ground. In a 1960 study, Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace are not necessary <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> are born with the motivation to work without incentives. Some startups do not use a strict command and control hierarchical structure, with executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Some startups offer employees stock options, to increase their [...] "buy in" [...] from the start up (as these employees stand to gain if the company does well). This removal of stressors allows the workers and researchers in the startup to focus less on the work environment around them, and more on achieving the task at hand, giving them the potential to achieve something great for their company.|$|E
