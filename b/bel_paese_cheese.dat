It has an image of the Italian geologist and paleontologist Antonio Stoppani, whose geological treatise Il bel paese gave its name to Galbani's cheese; but while on the wrapping of the cheese made in Italy Stoppani's image comes with a map of Italy, cheese made in the United States has a map of the Americas.|$|E

50|$|As {{suggested}} by its name, Butterkäse has a buttery flavor and appearance. It {{is often described}} as mild, partly due to its brief aging time. The softness and mildly salty or acidic flavor is reminiscent of Muenster or Gouda cheeses. Butterkäse first appeared in 1928 as a variant of Italian <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese.</b> The texture of Butterkäse is smooth and creamy, sometimes nearly spreadable depending on the firmness desired by the cheese maker. Butterkäse is often sliced and added to rolls and sandwiches or melted for cooking.|$|R

50|$|The {{quality of}} foot odor is often {{reported}} as a thick, cheese-like smell. Some describe the smell {{like that of}} malt vinegar. However, {{it can also be}} ammonia-like. Brevibacteria are considered a major cause of foot odor because they ingest dead skin on the feet and, in the process, convert amino acid methionine into methanethiol, which is a colorless gas with a distinctive putrid smell that has a sulfuric aroma. The dead skin that fuels this process is especially common on the soles and between the toes. The brevibacteria are also what give cheeses such as Limburger, <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese,</b> Port Salut, Pálpusztai and Munster their characteristic pungency.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{produced}} in Melzo, {{a small village}} near Milan in the Lombardy region, it is now made in both Italy and the United States. <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese</b> is a cow's milk cheese. It matures for six to eight weeks, and has a creamy and light milky aroma. The color is a pale, creamy yellow. It is made in small discs, and {{is very similar to}} the French Saint-Paulin cheese and to German Butterkäse. It has a mild, buttery flavor for which it has been popularly eaten with fruity wines, such as dry red or white. It is favored by many as a snack or dessert cheese and melts easily for use on pizzas or in casseroles. It is often used as a substitute for mozzarella cheese.|$|R
40|$|The article aims {{to explore}} the theme of {{cultural}} and landscape heritage in the Nineteenth century through the analysis of primary school textbooks. In particular, the A. focuses the attention on three well-known and very successful reading books: Giannetto by Luigi Alessandro Parravicini (1837), Il <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese</b> by Antonio Stoppani (1876) and Cuore by Edmondo De Amicis (1886). The A., through {{a detailed analysis of}} content and using the most reliable bibliography of historical-educational and historical-literary field, shows that, although with different perspectives, these three classics of Nineteenth century educational literature fit perfectly in the large debate that, in the decades following the Italian Unity, was the central theme of the construction of national identity. Therefore, the article aims to provide a new and original reading of these three long-sellers, which shows that in the three works – certainly with different approaches, symptomatic of the historical moment and the author’s cultural background – the reference to the natural and historic-artistic beauties of the Italian Peninsula is part of the set of behaviours, values, and content deemed essential to build the Italian identity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} factual {{evidence on}} the extent of public intervention in the Italian economy. It further illustrates the internal contradictions and weaknesses of public action in Italy. New policy proposals to solve old structural problems of the <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese</b> are then discussed. Among them, a major privatization programme decided since 1992 is analysed, together with drastic budgetary cuts aiming at curbing public debt to maintain sustainability. Finally, the paper tries to explain why, {{in spite of all the}} excesses and limits of the policy-making, the performance of the Italian economy is apparently quite brilliant. The conclusion is that Italian society is already doing de facto what I suggest in the text that the Government should allow it to do, primarily by introducing deregulation and flexibility in economic matters. Italy is achieving these goals through the underground economy, by evading taxes and union rules in small private enterprises, but it is largely failing to do so in larger companies and in the public sector. In short, the country is developing thanks to what the Italians call `l'arte d'arrangiarsi', their generalized talent for improvization, thus providing living proof that deregulation and flexibility work.

40|$|Unlike many nineteenth-century British {{travelers}} and expatriates who left detailed accounts of Italy, Walter Savage Landor (1775 - 1864) never wrote a travelogue {{nor did he}} extensively comment on his Tuscan experience first in Florence, at Palazzo Medici and Villa Castiglione, then in Fiesole at Villa Gherardesca, which he bought in 1829 and where he lived until 1835. Nevertheless, much of his literary production – both in verse and in prose – is interspersed with hints at Italy and his best known and most acclaimed work, Imaginary Conversations, features a lot of Italian historical and literary characters, both {{of the past and}} of the present. Landor certainly intended to provide his English readers with a first-hand insight into contemporary Italian history, while dialogues in which he himself appears as one of the interlocutors focus on topics concerning customs and manners of the <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese.</b> Landor’s picture of Italy is inferable not only from his "Conversations", but also from such writings as "High and Low Life in Italy", his epistolary autobiographical novel, serialized by Leigh Hunt in the "Monthly Repository". This might throw interesting light both on his attitude towards Italian history, life and literature, and on his own Weltanschauung, revealing the idiosyncrasies of an intellectual who, like many contemporary British exiles, chose Italy as a refuge from the cultural and political claustrophobia of his motherland...|$|R
40|$|International audience"Food for Life and Food for the Soul – {{from the}} Indian Subcontinent to the <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese,</b> a Literary Journey through Laila Wadia’s short Stories –" Food {{seems to be}} a very central topic in Laila Wadia’s short stories (since her first {{published}} story – « Curry di pollo », that is ‘Chicken Curry’ – winner of the literary prize Eks & Tra for migrant literature in 2004). For the past twenty years, the Indian- born author has been living in Italy. The food topic appears to be an emblem for the question of identity in her texts. Food gives the title to most of the shorts stories she wrote from 2004 {{to the end of the}} decade : from « Fornelli spenti » (‘Cold Furnaces’) to the « Cena delle letterate » (‘the Women Writers’ Dinner’). According to the philosopher Michel Serres: « Le goût institue la sapience » [‘the sense of taste institutes sapience’]. We will therefore analyse Wadia’s writings – published in various collections and anthologies – examining the variations on the theme. What is really going on, when food becomes the nourishment for both the spirit and the body? Laila Wadia’s writings deal with fundamental issues such as the modalities of the cultural transmission from mother to child (in particular from mother to daughter), the emergence of a new kind of gap between first and second generations immigrants and the acculturation process. Such issues are developed within the framework of short stories that often turn out to be an effective exemplification of these very notions. Though a focus which is mainly social, the relationship between orality and language is certainly not omitted (see ‘The Women Writers’Dinner’) ...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{focuses on}} Giuseppe Baretti’s "Account of the Manners and Customs of Italy" {{published}} in London in 1768 as a firm refutation of Samuel Sharp’s slanderous "Letters from Italy" (1765) {{and of the}} books written by “those other English writers, who after a short tour have ventured to describe Italy and the Italians”. In the Preface, Baretti ascribes their distorted reports about the <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese</b> to “premature and rash judgments” and sets out to provide the English public with a new account of Italian life and culture interspersed with observations on the mistakes of those travelers whose only aim was to write fashionable books full of “slander and invective” just to please their readers’ “malignity and love of novelty”. His account results in an illuminating cultural document in which Italy is ‘explained’ to the English by an Italian intellectual long accustomed to England and English life. This allows him not only to ‘deconstruct’ Sharp’s book by punctually rebutting the prejudices and stereotypes Doctor Sharp shared with many of his contemporaries, but also to provide the reader with pregnant comparisons between the two countries. The essay {{also points out that}} Baretti’s position somewhat mirrors that of the traditional travel writer: while the latter usually reports upon a foreign nation to his fellow countrymen often surrendering, as it happens in Sharp’s "Letters", to common views and preconceived ideas, Baretti writes a book about his own country for the benefit of a foreign audience, whose culture and mentality he nevertheless knows well {{enough to be able to}} orientate his account in order to make it as appealing as possible to his English readers. A careful negotiation on the part of the author is therefore necessary, which the paper unveils in both its cultural components and argumentative strategies...|$|R

40|$|Today Italian men’s {{fashion is}} known and {{appreciated}} worldwide. It represents an important {{segment of the}} entire Italian fashion system. But {{it was not always}} like this. Until {{the first decade of the}} twentieth century, in fact, an Italian male style did not exist and Italian tailoring production reused the diktat that seasonally came from London, which since the end of the eighteenth century became the undisputed capital of men’s fashion. However, it was thanks to the Italian tailors who, from the twentieth century, it is affirmed the idea of tailoring as scientific and design discipline, which would become a central point for the renewal of men's fashion. The Italian tailors made decisive contributions to the cut and design of the men's gown, starting with the most important garment: the jacket, which became less rigid than the English one. These were the years when the first brands of Italian men's fashion began to emerge, appreciated all over the world, such as that of Domenico Caraceni, who opened an atelier in Rome in 1926. A new season for the Italian men's tailoring was inaugurated which, from the second half of the 1940 s, would definitively undermined the English leadership. Another important contribution from Italian tailors was in anthropometric measurements. The Milanese tailor Bruno Piergiovanni patented a small and simple machine used to take exact measures. The other measuring system called Plastes was patented in 1940 by the Roman tailor Luigi Branchini. It was a metallic cage which enclosed the body, registering any “disharmonies” of proportion and determining a corresponding change of projections and ratios, which allowed the tailor to create a harmony in the form of the outfit. These innovations in sartorial measurements, were resumed and improved in the post-war period, when the male dress, much earlier than it was in the female, also knew the success of the ready to wear dress in Italy. The Italian tailors tried to create an alternative style to the English, in contrast to the muted tones of English tailoring, through the use of colour which did not go beyond the limit of good taste, but bestowed on male clothing a distinctly Italian look because inspired by the sun and <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese</b> colours...|$|R
40|$|The “artificial” {{landscape}} of Po Valley {{is the result}} of the evolution of many elements which have contributed to its formation: water, soil, cultivations, structures of drainage, daily action and presence of man. If we read it “from above” we understand a map not only “real”, but also “cultural”: unicum composed of many identities. The ordinary routine of this horizontal landscape has unique characteristics in the Italian panorama, even though it is less recognizable than more "attractive" landscapes of the <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese.</b> Works and heritage together are the heart of the largest Institution that manages the water of this area (Consorzio di Bonifica dell’Emilia Centrale), whose history began centuries ago, dating back to the sixteenth century and to the first laws of the Kingdom of Italy (1864), extending for 3, 113 sq kilometres and covering three regions, five provinces, sixty-five municipalities. The huge route project carried out by the Consorzio last year aimed at tracing the network of water and draining nodes which have contributed to the definition of this cultural landscape, updating roles and functions, disclosing its presence, always seen but never consciously perceived, through a conscious contemporary valorisation. The aim of this study is to take a census of the main structures of the heritage of the Consortium, named Consorzio di Bonifica dell’Emilia Centrale, in order to arrange a volume of documents which could be useful for future decisions. This will lead to a real knowledge of a wide area such as the one in Central Emilia. The cataloguing of the most significant drainage works (more than 50 buildings, 20 canals, 6 expansion chambers) started from these operative and informative bases, so as to make the district of the consortium a real “cultural and human site”, where culture stands for knowledge and participation. The mapping aimed at unambiguously identifying architectural structures (draining plants or other buildings used for drainage) or the portion of territory (canals and expansion basins) through some fundamental parameters such as: the direct analysis of the structure and its condition, the operative value with basic dimensional data, the significant elements, the environmental restrictions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT No {{country on}} the European Continent has captivated the English {{imagination}} so completely and for so long as Italy. As with two magnetic poles, unlikes attract. Italy has been said not to challenge the British {{at any of the}} pursuits they are best at. For centuries the British have been susceptible to the charms of Italy – “il <b>bel</b> <b>paese,</b> là dove il sì suona”, “where things happen”, wrote E. M. Forster in his early draft of A Room with a View. In his ‘Italian novels’ Forster invokes a long-established tradition of representing English travel to Southern Europe and the long-standing North-South dichotomy by sharply contrasting England with Italy – the chief topic focused on in this dissertation. Using imagology as a methodological instrument, I explore the aspects that travel literature highlights as a major source of images of Italy in literary and ethnographic representations, while concentrating on the impact Italy had on Forster and how it grew on him, so providing material for his novels. The role the ‘Spirit of Place’ played in the interrelatedness between the historic Grand Tour, Forster’s version rooted in Tuscany, and his characters’ Italian experiences, is a second focus of attention. A Room with a View and Where Angels Fear to Tread, which have been customarily called Forster’s ‘Italian novels’, invite a close examination of the intricate links that polarise images: of middle-upper class Englishness against what he saw represented in the Italian character – a unique capacity for spontaneity combined with warmth, sunshine, romance, adventure, violence, and sensual pleasure. In these two novels such features are found in conflict with features that Forster saw as centred on repressive proprieties and conventions that were heightened by adverse atmospheric and historic constraints. Forster’s experience as a globetrotter allowed him to become a firm advocate of multiculturalism. He diagnosed the ailing England of his times and offered literary responses. I argue that Forster uses Italy, which works on his characters as an exhilarating, saving source of power, as a remedy for England’s malaise – a malaise that, he said, produced people “with well-developed bodies, fairly developed minds, and undeveloped hearts” (in his essay “Notes on the English Character”, 1936); these, when confronted by alterity/foreignness, need an education of the “heart”. Under the spell of Tuscan light and landscape, his more opened-minded protagonists are awakened by their exposure to Italy, a spiritual home where their hearts dwell and become developed...|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the Italy {{by night}} image {{made by the}} ITATEN {{research}} group shows new shapes of the Italian landscape. A continous urban cloud that fills the nitescape. A myriad of sources of light gathering {{up on the big}} infrastructural lines, that clears only when meets the mountains and the sea. Hystoric centers, industrial areas, arterial roads, suburbs: everything becomes homologous in the negative zenith figure. In the last 20 years new lifestyles designed new landscapes. Italy proposed by traditional geographic maps with cities like balls, separated and gathered around their nucleus, is a conventional image, that does’nt match the real. The 100 towns Italy does’nt exist any more. The great order of natural landscape becomes the theatre of urban sprawl, and hystoric and cultural contexts estabilish the local declentions of change. The new geography of the Country does not consider administrative borders, does not have boundaries: as one city made of thousand different others, that intersect and are placed one upon the other. Towns tend to connect each other. Central places move along infrastrucures and residential areas towards the countryside. Public space is sucked back inside malls. Hystoric centres and nature areas are made up for tourism. Ratification and identity mark the characteristic of the different local territories. The new image of Italy keeps togeteher history, innovation and mediocrity: shows an antropologic dimension that describes enviromental conditions specific and glocal (global and local) at the same time. Following similar researches in Europe, Atlas 003 wants to detect the new aesthetics of BelPaese through the gaze of 30 photographer (from the most famous as Gabriele Basilico to the younger ones, as Francesco Jodice) to show up its contraddictions and opportunities. Atlas 003 is a report on physical conditions of Italy. A picture that could be taken again after years to monitorize changing and the ability to manage it.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{different}} ways in which Italy and Italian art, culture, customs, and traditions are depicted and commented upon in two British travelogues of the eighteenth century: Joseph Addison’s Remarks upon Several Parts of Italy (1705) and Tobias Smollett’s Travels through France and Italy (1766). By dealing with various aspects of Italian life ‒ from classical to popular culture, from landscape to art works, from places to people ‒ these accounts contribute to the consolidation of the idea of Italy and the Italians as the “Other”, firmly grounded on centuries-old prejudices and stereotypes about the <b>Bel</b> <b>Paese.</b> At the same time, however, the experience of travelling inevitably triggers a process of re-negotiation of the Self whose essential features are modified in the passage from the first to {{the second half of the}} century, due to a remarkable change in the way travelling itself is conceived and recorded as well as in the traveller’s attitudes towards outward reality and personal experience.
