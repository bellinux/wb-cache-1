5|$|While Massive Dynamic {{offers its}} {{computing}} resources to identify possible buildings of similar mass, Walter implores Olivia (Anna Torv) to recall her childhood Cortexiphan-induced {{ability to see}} objects from the alternate universe, believing she {{will be able to}} foresee which <b>building</b> <b>will</b> be affected and warn everyone in time.
