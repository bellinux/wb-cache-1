5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says {{that he decided to}} stop, entered a bar and ordered a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>and</b> drank it almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question {{was not in the}} cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E
500|$|Eddie {{returns to}} Washington as Mulder and, along with Scully, reports to Skinner {{on the case}} with a poorly written report. Eddie visits Mulder's office, then his apartment, being {{surprised}} at what a loser Mulder appears to be (though highly pleased with how attractive a man he now is in Mulder's face - as he admires himself and practices his 'agent moves' in the mirror). Later that evening Eddie visits Scully with a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> tries to get her drunk, as well as seduce her. As a reluctant Scully is about {{to give in to}} a kiss, the real Mulder breaks in and interrupts them. Revealed, Eddie sheepishly reverts back to his actual form, as a shocked Scully just about jumps out of her own skin at the revelation. A month later, Mulder visits Eddie in a prison visitation room at Eddie's bidding. Eddie complains at being given muscle relaxants to prevent him from turning into someone else, asking if that was Mulder's doing. Eddie then tells Mulder that he was born a loser, but Mulder is one by choice and that he should seriously [...] "live a little".|$|E

500|$|Back in Scranton, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{tries to}} protect Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{from a group}} of kids who are {{throwing}} pine cones at her, and a young girl, [...] "Tiffany" [...] (Caitlin Williams), punches him, giving him a black eye. Andy tells his co-workers that he stepped in when a [...] "gang" [...] harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>and</b> took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E
500|$|Trace {{amounts of}} some heavy metals, mostly in period 4, are {{required}} for certain biological processes. These are iron and copper (oxygen and electron transport); cobalt (complex syntheses and cell metabolism); zinc (hydroxylation); vanadium and manganese (enzyme regulation or functioning); chromium (glucose utilisation); nickel (cell growth); arsenic (metabolic growth in some animals and possibly in humans) and selenium (antioxidant functioning and hormone production). Periods 5 and 6 contain fewer essential heavy metals, consistent with the general pattern that heavier elements {{tend to be less}} abundant and that scarcer elements {{are less likely to be}} nutritionally essential. In period 5, molybdenum is required for the catalysis of redox reactions; cadmium is used by some marine diatoms for the same purpose; and tin may be required for growth in a few species. [...] In period 6, tungsten is required by some bacteria for metabolic processes. A deficiency of any of these period 4–6 essential heavy metals may increase susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning (conversely, an excess may also have adverse biological effects). An average 70 kg human body is about 0.01% heavy metals (~7 g, equivalent to the weight of two dried peas, with iron at 4 g, zinc at 2.5 g, and lead at 0.12 g comprising the three main constituents), 2% light metals (~1.4 kg, the weight of a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine)</b> <b>and</b> nearly 98% nonmetals (mostly water).|$|E
2500|$|... pikemen (soldiers {{armed with}} muzzle-loading {{firearms}} and with spears) and targeteers (men armed with swords and buckler shields). On September 16 the force assembled at {{the call of}} trumpets, drums, fifes, and the ringing of the bells. After hearing mass, it set out, each man carrying on his back his arms, a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>and</b> six pounds of biscuit, in which Menéndez himself set the example. Two Indian chiefs, whose hostility the French had incurred, and who had visited Fort Caroline six days before, accompanied the party to show the way. [...] A picked company of twenty Asturians and Basques under their captain, Martin de Ochoa, led the way armed with axes with which they blazed {{a path through the}} forest and swamps for the men behind them, guided by Menéndez who carried a compass to find the right direction.|$|E

2500|$|St. Thomas Aquinas, {{the leading}} {{scholastic}} theologian of the Roman Catholic Church, argued {{charging of interest}} is wrong because it amounts to [...] "double charging", charging for both the thing {{and the use of}} the thing. Aquinas said this would be morally wrong in the same way as if one sold a bottle of wine, charged for the <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>and</b> then charged for the person using the wine to actually drink it. Similarly, one cannot charge for a piece of cake and for the eating of the piece of cake. Yet this, said Aquinas, is what usury does. Money is a medium of exchange, and is used up when it is spent. To charge for the money and for its use (by spending) is therefore to charge for the money twice. It is also to sell time since the usurer charges, in effect, for the time that the money is in the hands of the borrower. Time, however, is not a commodity that anyone can charge. [...] In condemning usury Aquinas was much influenced by the recently rediscovered philosophical writings of Aristotle and his desire to assimilate Greek philosophy with Christian theology. Aquinas argued that in the case of usury, as in other aspects of Christian revelation, Christian doctrine is reinforced by Aristotelian natural law rationalism. [...] Aristotle's argument is that interest is unnatural, since money, as a sterile element, cannot naturally reproduce itself. [...] Thus, usury conflicts with natural law just as it offends Christian revelation: see Thought of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
