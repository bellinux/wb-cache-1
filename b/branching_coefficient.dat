The significance of the following features was evaluated: widths, angles, <b>branching</b> <b>coefficient</b> (BC), angle-to-BC ratio, standard deviations, means and medians of widths and angles, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity and FD-to-lacunarity ratio, using a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) design.

It appears that for one decade now the efficiency of nano structured cells has been essentially stagnating. This problem is analyzed and found to be mainly due to the exhausted exploitability of the surface roughness factor and the involvement of new mechanistic principles, which are scientifically still barely understood and therefore not well controlled.

40|$|Background. Cerebral {{small vessel}} disease (lacunar stroke and {{cerebral}} white matter hyperintensities) {{is caused by}} vessel abnormalities of unknown aetiology. Retinal vessels show developmental and pathophysiological similarities to cerebral small vessels and microvessel geometry may influence vascular efficiency. Hypothesis. We hypothesized that retinal arteriolar branching angles or co-efficients (the ratio of {{the sum of the}} cross sectional areas of the two daughter vessels to the cross sectional area of the parent vessel at an arteriolar bifurcation) may be associated with cerebral small vessel disease. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional observational study in a tertiary referral hospital, United Kingdom. An experienced stroke physician recruited consecutive patients presenting with lacunar ischaemic stroke with a control group consisting of patients with minor cortical ischaemic stroke. We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging to assess the recent infarct and periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities. We subtyped stroke with clinical and radiological findings. We took digital retinal photography to assess retinal arteriolar branching co-efficients and branching angles using a semi-automated technique. Results. We recruited 205 patients (104 lacunar stroke, 101 cortical stroke), mean age 68 (Standard Deviation 12) years. With multivariate analysis, increased <b>branching</b> <b>coefficient</b> was associated with periventricular white matter hyperintensities (p= 0. 006) and ischaemic heart disease (p< 0. 001); decreased branching co-efficient with deep white matter hyperintensities (p= 0. 003) but not with lacunar stroke subtype (p= 0. 96).

40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of spectral line broadening and variations in relative intensities of hyperfine spectral components {{due to optical}} pumping is presented. Hyperfine levels of sodium $ 3 p_{ 1 / 2 }$ and $ 3 p_{ 3 / 2 }$ levels are selectively excited in a supersonic beam at various laser intensities under the conditions when optical pumping time is shorter than transit time of atoms through the laser beam. The excitation spectra exhibit significant line broadening at laser intensities well below the saturation intensity, and redistribution of intensities of hyperfine spectral components is observed, which in some cases is contradicting with intuitive expectations. Theoretical {{analysis of}} the dynamics of optical pumping shows that spectral line broadening depends sensitively on <b>branching</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the laser-driven transition. Analytical expressions for branching ratio dependent critical Rabi frequency and critical laser intensity are derived, which give the threshold for onset of noticeable line broadening by optical pumping. Transitions with larger and smaller branching coefficients are relatively less affected. The theoretical excitation spectra were calculated numerically by solving density matrix equations of motion using the split propagation technique, and they well reproduce the observed effects of line broadening and peak intensity variations. The calculations also show that presence of dark (i. e., not laser- coupled) Zeeeman sublevels in the lower state results in effective branching coefficients which vary with laser intensity and differ from those implied by the sum rules, and this can lead to peculiar changes in peak ratios of hyperfine components of the spectra.

40|$|Published Online First 17 October 2016 Aim: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between retinal vascular morphology and cognitive abilities in a narrowage cohort of community-dwelling older people. Methods: Digital retinal images taken at age ~ 73 years from 683 participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC 1936) were analysed with Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Multiple regression models were applied to determine cross-sectional associations between retinal vascular parameters and general cognitive ability (g), memory, processing speed, visuospatial ability, crystallised cognitive ability and change in IQ from childhood to older age. Results: After adjustment for cognitive ability at age 11 years and cardiovascular risk factors, venular lengthto- diameter ratio was nominally significantly associated with processing speed (β=- 0. 116, p= 0. 01) and g (β= - 0. 079, p= 0. 04). Arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio was associated with visuospatial ability (β= 0. 092, p= 0. 04). Decreased arteriolar junctional exponent deviation and increased arteriolar <b>branching</b> <b>coefficient</b> values were associated with less relative decline in IQ between childhood and older age (arteriolar junctional exponent deviation: β=- 0. 101, p= 0. 02; arteriolar branching coefficient: β= 0. 089, p= 0. 04). Data are presented as standardised β coefficients (β) reflecting change in cognitive domain score associated with an increase of 1 SD unit in retinal parameter. None of these nominally significant associations remained significant after correction for multiple statistical testing. Conclusions: Retinal parameters contributed < 1 % {{of the variance in the}} majority of associations observed.

40|$|Abnormalities in the {{vascular}} {{pattern of}} a retina, such as morphologic changes in vessel shape, branching pattern, width, tortuosity, or {{the appearance of}} retinal lesions, {{may be associated with}} the occurrence of retinopathies or cardiovascular diseases. Thus, an automated quantitative analysis of changes in vessel morphology may help indicating the clinical signs of aforementioned retinopathies, describing their early occurrence or severity. The responses obtained from different types of retinal vessels, i. e., arteries and veins, may be variable to retinopathies and their measurement may lead to a more precise diagnosis compared to that by the average response accounted for the entire vessel network. I propose a set of automated methods in order to analyze the retinal vessel network and to quantify its morphologic properties with respect to arteries and veins, in two-dimensional color fundus images. The analytical methods include; 1) Forma- tion of a well connected vessel network, 2) Structural mapping of a vessel network, 3) Artery-venous classification, and 4) Blood vessel hemorrhage detection. The quan- tification methods include vessel morphology analysis based on the measurement of tortuosity, width, branching angle, <b>branching</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and fractal dimension. The aforementioned morphologic parameters are measured with respect to arteries and veins separately in a vessel network. The methods are validated with the manually annotated retinal fundus images as a ground truth. The major contribution of this thesis includes the development of automated methods for; 1) Identification and separation of retinal vessel trees for individual vessel analysis, 2) Automated quantification of morphologic characteristics of retinal vessels for quick and precise measurement, 3) Automated quantification of vessel morphology with respect to arteries and veins, and 4) Analysis of two datasets, a) malarial retinopathy subject dataset, b) longitudinal study dataset. The ability of the automated methods to quantify the retinal vessel specific properties may enable the individual vessel analysis as an alternative to a time- consuming and subjective clinical evaluation, or to a quantitative morphology char- acterization averaged over the entire vessel network. The objective evaluation may indicate the progression of retinopathies precisely and may help characterizing nor- mal and abnormal vascular patterns with respect to arteries and veins. This may enable a quick diagnosis, treatment availability, prognosis, and facilitation of clinical health-care procedures in remote areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{deleterious}} effects of Type 2 diabetes {{on the brain}} {{have been shown to}} result in a greater prevalence of age-associated cognitive impairment and an enhanced risk of age-related cognitive decline in older diabetic populations. Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder. Apart from the negative impact of abnormalities intrinsic to diabetes, diabetes-associated cerebral microvascular disease may contribute to this accelerated cognitive ageing. Direct in vivo evaluation of the cerebral microcirculation is difficult in humans and the vessels themselves are too small to permit detailed visualisation with current neuroimaging methods. The microvasculature of the retina may offer a window into such vascular status of the brain as there is considerable homology between the retina and cerebral microcirculations. Moreover, the retinal vasculature is known to be affected by a wide range of systemic pathologies and is unique in that it is the only vasculature that can be directly visualised and photographed. Retinal microvascular abnormalities (RMAs) have been understudied risk factors in cognitive ageing epidemiological research. Few reports have comprehensively examined cognitive function in relation to diabetic retinopathy. Also the relationship between cognitive function and quantitative aspects of retinal vascular network geometry has not been investigated in people with Type 2 diabetes. The results of a systematic review reported in this thesis showed inconsistent findings on the importance of the association between retinal microvascular abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction in predominantly non-diabetic populations. This may have reflected substantial differences between studies regarding the choice of population under study, the methods applied for measuring and defining RMAs, the types of neuropsychological tests administered for assessing cognitive function, and the approach taken in data analysis. The principal aim of the original research described in this thesis was to examine the associations of cognitive test performance with severity of diabetic retinopathy and quantitative parameters of retinal vascular network in a population-based sample of older people with Type 2 diabetes. Objective, reproducible and computerized retinal image analysis was used to quantify retinal vessel calibres and arteriolar bifurcation geometry in order to detect subtle changes in retinal vascular network. A valid estimation of peak prior cognitive ability allowed the further exploration of the impact of retinal microvascular abnormalities on imputed cognitive decline from best-ever levels of cognitive function to that measured in old age. The analysis was based on a cohort of 547 men and 519 women aged 60 - 75 years with Type 2 diabetes, randomly sampled from the Lothian Diabetes Register, Scotland, in 2006 / 2007 (the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study). A battery of seven cognitive tests was administered and standard 7 -field binocular digital retinal photography undertaken. The Mill Hill Vocabulary Scale was used to estimate pre-morbid cognitive ability. Diabetic retinopathy was evaluated independently by two optometrists using a standardised grading protocol (a modification of the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Scale). Quantitative retinal vascular parameters were measured by myself from a digital image of field 1 using semi-automated, computer-based methods. Retinal vessel calibres were summarised as the central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalents (CRAE and CRVE, respectively) and arterio-venous ratio (AVR). Retinal arteriolar bifurcation geometry was expressed as arteriolar bifurcation angles (BA), arterial <b>branching</b> <b>coefficient</b> (BC), and sub-optimality (degree of deviation from optimality) of the retinal arteriolar angles. The statistical analyses were based on the 1, 044 study participants who had both gradable retinal images and cognitive testing. Both general cognition, as indexed by a general cognitive factor reflecting the variance common to all the cognitive tests used, and most of the individual cognitive tests were negatively affected in participants with diabetic retinopathy relative to those without. These cognitive measures also showed a significant relationship with increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy (none, mild, and moderate-severe). Those with moderate-severe diabetic retinopathy had worst performances on general cognitive function, executive function, information processing speed, non-verbal memory and mental flexibility. When lifetime decline was estimated from peak, prior cognitive level, severity of diabetic retinopathy was significantly associated with a greater decline in information processing speed, non-verbal memory and mental flexibility and, in men for general cognition and executive function. The associations of severity of diabetic retinopathy with general cognition, executive function and information processing speed were independent of socio-demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, macrovascular disease, mood and hyperglycaemia. The associations with estimated decline in specific cognitive measures resulted principally from the impact of diabetic retinopathy on general cognitive ability. The study also showed that larger retinal arteriolar and venular calibres were both significantly associated with lower test scores on verbal memory in men. Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated larger retinal arteriolar calibre was associated with a significantly greater decline in verbal memory after possible confounding by retinal venular calibre and vascular risk factors and disease was taken into account. In contrast, the study did not support an independent association between retinal venular calibre and cognitive decline in men or in women with Type 2 diabetes. Parameters of retinal arteriolar bifurcation geometry were not associated with cognitive outcome. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that cerebral microvascular disease associated with Type 2 diabetes, reflected by the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, may exacerbate the effects of ageing on cognitive function. In particular, alterations in the blood-brain barrier may be an important pathophysiological mechanism in the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction in diabetic patients. They further may be added to the knowledge that gained from previous pathologic and brain imaging investigations demonstrating a relationship between markers of cerebral microvascular disease and cognitive dysfunction in diabetes. The role of quantitative parameters of retinal vascular network geometry in diabetes-related cognitive impairment is less clear. Prospective studies are required to clarify the temporal sequence of these associations and the eventual clinical significance of these small, early cognitive function changes. Such a follow-up project involving the present study population is underway. From a clinical perspective, if the above findings are substantiated, diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction may be amenable to treatment and preventive strategies specifically targeted at protecting the cerebral microvasculature and reducing the risk of developing even mild microvascular disease in an ageing diabetic population...|$|E

In {{the case of}} a power sum plethysm, we prove that the coefficients of the decomposition of this stabilized form on the basis of Weyl characters are <b>branching</b> <b>coefficients</b> which can be determined by a simple algorithm. This generalizes in particular some classical results by Littlewood on the power sum plethysms of Schur functions. We also establish explicit formulas for the outer multiplicities appearing in the decomposition of the tensor square of any irreducible finite-dimensional module into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts. These multiplicities can notably be expressed in terms of the Littlewood–Richardson coefficients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe use power sums plethysm {{operators}} to introduce H functions which interpolate between the Weyl characters and the Hall–Littlewood functions Q′ corresponding to classical Lie groups. The coefficients of these functions {{on the basis}} of Weyl characters are parabolic Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials and thus, by works of Kashiwara and Tanisaki, are nonnegative.  We prove that they can be regarded as quantizations of <b>branching</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained by restriction to certain subgroups of Levi type. The H functions associated to linear groups coincide with the polynomials introduced by Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon in [A. Lascoux, B. Leclerc, J. Y. Thibon, Ribbon tableaux, Hall Littelwood functions, quantum affine algebras, J. Math. Phys. 38 (1996) 1041 – 1068]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{construction}} of holomorphic gauge invariant operators for general quiver gauge theories with flavour symmetries. Using a characterisation of the gauge invariants in terms of equivalence classes generated by permutation actions, along with representation theory results in symmetric groups and unitary groups, we give a diagonal basis for the 2 -point functions of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic operators. This involves a generalisation of the previously constructed Quiver Restricted Schur operators to the flavoured case. The 3 -point functions are derived and shown to be given in terms of networks of symmetric group <b>branching</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The networks are constructed through cutting and gluing operations on the quivers.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the range of}} the radiative lifetime and energy of the anomalous, low-energy 3 / 2 ^+(7. 8 ± 0. 5 eV) state in the ^ 229 Th nucleus. Our phenomenological calculations are based on the available experimental data for the intensities of M 1 and E 2 transitions between excited levels of the ^ 229 Th nucleus in the K^π[Nn_ZΛ]= 5 / 2 ^+[633] and 3 / 2 ^+[631] rotational bands. We also discuss the influence of certain <b>branching</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which affect the currently accepted measured energy of the isomeric state. From this work, we establish a favored region where the transition lifetime and energy should lie at roughly the 90...|$|R
40|$|The <b>branching</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the {{tensor product}} of finite-dimensional {{irreducible}} U_q(g) -modules, where g is so(2 n+ 1,C) (B_n-type), sp(2 n,C) (C_n-type), and so(2 n,C) (D_n-type), {{are expressed in}} terms of Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coefficients in the stable region. We give an interpretation of this relation by Kashiwara's crystal theory by providing an explicit surjection from the LR crystal of type C_n to the disjoint union of Cartesian product of LR crystals of A_n- 1 -type and by proving that LR crystals of types B_n and D_n are identical to the corresponding LR crystal of type C_n in the stable region.
