40|$|Abstract: The {{technology}} of E-Metering (Electronic Metering) {{has gone through}} rapid technological advancements and there is increased demand for a reliable and efficient Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) system. This paper presents {{the design of a}} simple low cost wireless Zigbee energy meter and its associated user interface, for automating billing and managing the collected data globally. The proposed system replaces traditional meter reading methods and enables remote access of existing energy meter by the energy provider. Also they can monitor the meter readings regularly without the person visiting each house. A Zigbee based wireless communication module is integrated with electronic energy meter of each entity to have remote access over the usage of electricity. A personal computer with a Zigbee receiver at the other end, which contains the database acts as the <b>billing</b> <b>point.</b> Live meter reading from the Zigbee enabled energy meter is sent back to this <b>billing</b> <b>point</b> periodically and these details are updated in a central database. A new interactive, user friendly graphical user interface is developed using LabVIEW. The complete monthly usage and due bill is messaged back to the customer after processing these data...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we will {{describe}} a commercial service that will use distributed resources, such as storage or bandwidth, in a cooperative effort. We name this service “durable storage”. This service is able to guarantee {{the existence of the}} data it contains in “any circumstance ” at “any time”. Although the solution is based on a P 2 P paradigm, we use a centralized approach that matches the commercial side of the service. We have designed the system with anonymity, confidentiality and security in mind. The ISP, or service provider, will not only assure several of the main functions, such as authentication or directory maintenance, but constitutes as well the only <b>billing</b> <b>point</b> for every user. We will describe the architecture or the service and the implementation of the prototype which is a dual stack IPv 4 /IPv 6 application. Finally we will point out that the solution is not only IPv 6 compatible, but it could clearly benefit from an IPv 6 only version. 1...|$|E

40|$|Instrument {{transformers}} {{are crucial}} {{elements in the}} metering infrastructure of high voltage grids. With the evolvement of smart grids and the liberalization of the electricity market, new <b>billing</b> <b>points</b> can arise in the grids where electrical energy is transferred between different parties. When these new <b>billing</b> <b>points</b> are at existing places in the grid, it is strongly preferred to use the available instrument transformers for realization of a revenue metering system rather than installing new CTs and PTs. However, these available instrument transformers do not always meet the accuracy class requirements prescribed by legislation like electricity metering codes. In this paper, we present {{the results of an}} extensive performance evaluation of the ratio error of high voltage CTs under actual operating conditions. The aim of this evaluation was to find out to what extent CTs that do not meet the required accuracy class can nevertheless be used for revenue metering systems when their ratio errors are measured and corrected for. The study has {{a significant impact on the}} expansion of the metering infrastructure within smart grids, since it paves the way to a significant cost saving in the realization of new revenue metering setups.

5000|$|Creosote was a {{community}} of Bainbridge Island, Washington, along Eagle Harbor.

When surprised on its nest or concerned, it assumes the characteristic attitude of bitterns, termed the on-guard.

5000|$|Experts {{who have}} studied supernotes {{extensively}} and examined them alongside genuine <b>bills</b> <b>point</b> {{out that there are}} many different varieties of supernotes. In 2006 the [...] "family" [...] of fraudulent bills was thought to have 19 members, but since 2006 producers of the supernotes have improved the product, and more varieties exist. Early versions of the fake notes, for example, lacked the bands of magnetic ink printed in distinctive patterns on different denominations of U.S. money; later counterfeits rectified this error. Several of the inconspicuous [...] "mistakes" [...] on the first supernotes were corrected, some several times.|$|R
