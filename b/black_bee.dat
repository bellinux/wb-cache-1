60|$|Their {{architecture}} {{closely resembles}} that of B. terrestris. They make rudely-shaped oval honey-cells, varying from half an inch to {{an inch and a}} half in length, the smaller ones being the first made; later in the season the old cocoons are utilized for storing honey. The wax is chocolate-coloured, and almost the only difference I can find in the economy of the two species is that the <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> uses a large quantity of wax in plastering the interior of its nest. The egg-cell of the yellow bee always contains from twelve to sixteen eggs; that of the <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> from ten to fourteen; and the eggs of this species are the largest though the bee is smallest. At the entrance on the edge of the mound one bee is usually stationed, and, when approached, it hums a shrill challenge, and throws itself into a menacing attitude. The sting is exceedingly painful.|$|E
60|$|One summer I was so {{fortunate}} as to discover two nests {{of the two}} kinds within twelve yards of each other, and I resolved to watch them very carefully, {{in order to see}} whether the two species ever came into collision, as sometimes happens with ants of different species living close together. Several times I saw a yellow bee leave its own nest and hover round or settle on the neighbouring one, upon which the sentinel <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> would attack and drive it off. One day, while watching, I was delighted to see a yellow bee actually enter its neighbour's nest, the sentinel being off duty. In about five minutes' time it came out again and flew away unmolested. I concluded from this that humble-bees, like their relations of the hive, occasionally plunder each other's sweets. On another occasion I found a <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> dead at the entrance of the yellow bees' nest; doubtless this individual had been caught in the act of stealing honey, and, after it had been stung to death, it had been dragged out and left there as a warning to others with like felonious intentions.|$|E
60|$|There is one {{striking}} {{difference between}} the two species. The yellow bee is inodorous; the <b>black</b> <b>bee,</b> when angry and attacking, emits an exceedingly powerful odour: curiously enough, this smell is identical in character with that made when angry by all the wasps of the South American genus Pepris--dark blue wasps with red wings. This odour at first produces a stinging sensation on the nerve of smell, but when inhaled in large measure becomes very nauseating. On one occasion, while I was opening a nest, several of the bees buzzing round my head and thrusting their stings through the veil I wore for protection, gave out so pungent a smell that I found it unendurable, and was compelled to retreat.|$|E
60|$|Forthwith {{there was}} heard a great buzzing in the air, and {{a swarm of}} <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> came flying toward her.|$|R

50|$|Bhringi, however, was so {{focussed}} on Shiva {{that he had}} {{no desire}} to go around Shakti. Seeing this, Shakti sat on Shiva’s lap making it difficult for Bhringi to go around Shiva alone. Bhringi, determined to go around Shiva took the form of a Bhring (<b>Black</b> <b>Bee)</b> and tried to slip in between the two.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, only 16 {{surviving}} colonies {{were left}} in the abbey. All of them were either pure Ligurian (Italian) or of Ligurian origin, hybrids between Ligurian and the English <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> A. m. mellifera. Kehrle also imported some more Italian queens. From these he began to develop what would {{come to be known}} as the Buckfast bee.|$|E
60|$|All {{over the}} sunny slopes cacti lifted slender shafts, {{unfolding}} in spiral leaves as they shot upward and bursting {{at the top}} into plumes of yellow flowers. The blossoming stalks waved in the wind, and <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> circled round them.|$|R
50|$|Apis mellifera mellifera is {{no longer}} a {{significant}} commercial subspecies of the Western honey bee, but {{there are a number of}} dedicated hobbyist beekeepers that keep these bees in Europe and other parts of the world. Immigrants brought these subspecies into the Americas. Prior to their arrival, the American continent did not have any honey bees. Hybrid descendants of the original colonial <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> may also have survived in North America as feral bees. There are reports by beekeepers that, after the arrival of the Varroa mite on the American continent in 1987, some feral bee colonies survived. The original form {{is no longer}} present in North America. A common myth regarding European <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> is that they cannot sting because they do not have a stinger.|$|R
50|$|Carniolan {{bees are}} nearly {{as big and}} long as the Western European <b>black</b> <b>bees,</b> though their abdomens are much slimmer. Furthermore, the Carniolan bee has a very long tongue (6.5 to 6.7 mm, which is very well adapted for clover), a very high elbow joint and very short hair.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the average}} {{lifespan}} of a queen in most subspecies is {{three to five}} years, reports from the German-European <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> subspecies previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years. Because a queen's store of sperm is depleted {{near the end of}} her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.|$|E
50|$|The European dark bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) is a {{subspecies}} {{of honey}} bee whose original European range stretched from western Russia through Northern Europe and probably {{down to the}} Iberian Peninsula. It was domesticated in Europe and hives were brought to North America in the colonial era. They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues. They are sometimes called the German <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> or German dark bee.|$|E
5000|$|The crystal {{red shrimp}} (called [...] "red bee shrimp" [...] in Japan) {{is a red}} and white variety {{specially}} bred for the aquarium hobby industry. In 1996 Hisayasu Suzuki of Japan discovered among his population of <b>Black</b> <b>Bee</b> shrimp a red one; and later two more. By selectively breeding these, [...] over time he and other shrimp breeders obtained shrimp with intense red and white stripes with various patterns, but with little genetic diversity.|$|E
50|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati {{was summoned}} by the Gods {{to kill the}} demon Arunasura {{in the form of}} Bhramari Devi, who took over the heavens and the three worlds. She stings him to death with the help of innumerable <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> {{emerging}} from her body, and the Gods regain control.|$|R
50|$|Each race or sub-species {{of honey}} bee {{has its own}} {{swarming}} characteristics. Italian bees are very prolific and inclined to swarm; Northern European <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> have a strong tendency to supersede their old queen without swarming. These differences {{are the result of}} differing evolutionary pressures in the regions where each sub-species evolved.|$|R
60|$|The Wicked Witch was {{so angry}} when she saw her <b>black</b> <b>bees</b> in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling {{them to go to}} the strangers and destroy them.|$|R
5000|$|Brother Adam (born Karl Kehrle in 1898 in Germany, died in 1996) was put {{in charge}} of the Abbey's {{beekeeping}} in 1919, and began extensive breeding work creating the honeybee known as the Buckfast bee. Brother Adam had to replenish the bee colonies as 30 of the monastery's 46 colonies had been wiped out by a disease called [...] "acarine", all the bees that died were of the native British <b>black</b> <b>bee.</b> The remaining 16 hives that survived were of Italian origin.|$|E
5000|$|In Western Europe, dark bee breeds {{were the}} {{original}} honey bee stock until {{creation of the}} Buckfast bee. This is a hybrid breed whose progeny includes salvaged remnants of the British <b>black</b> <b>bee,</b> nearly extinct by then due to Acarapis woodi (acarine mite). The breeding stocks in Central Europe were nearly destroyed by order of the Nazis, who considered the honey yields not up to modern standards and wanted to [...] "improve" [...] the bee stocks kept in areas under their control.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flowers of}} Monarda bradburiana produce copious {{quantities}} of nectar and are attractive to bumblebees and other long-tongued bees, butterflies, hummingbird moths, beeflies and hummingbirds. Pollen is harvested by halictid bees which cannot reach the nectar, and a specialist pollinator is Doufourea monardae, a small <b>black</b> <b>bee.</b> This is a food plant for the caterpillars of the hermit sphinx, the gray marvel, the orange mint moth and the raspberry pyrausta moth. Herbivorous mammals tend {{to avoid the}} foliage, perhaps because it has an odour of oregano.|$|E

50|$|HFT-60A is {{the larger}} {{cousin of the}} smaller HFT-40A and both have the same design layout. In {{addition}} to size, {{the main difference between}} HFT-40A and HFT-60A is in their respective power plant: HFT-60A is powered by a VWP-60, a 60 kgf micro turbojet engine, while HFT-40A is powered by VWP-40, a 40 kgf micro turbojet engine. Like its smaller cousin HFT-40A, HFT-60A is also developed by Beijing Black Buzzard Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. (The exact literal translation of the name of the division/subsidiary is actually <b>Black</b> <b>Bee</b> instead of Black Buzzard).|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that body size and coloration impacts a bee’s ability to survive in certain temperatures. The larger and darker the bee, the better it does in colder environments. The color of the bee also influences where it tends to forage, either in sunlight or under the forest canopy. Trigona corvina is a midsized, <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> with a passive cooling rate of [...]32 °C/s. This is important because their foraging and nesting locations are often based on thermal constraints. For example, T. corvina refrain from foraging during the hottest period of the day. It also explains why they prefer foraging areas in shady areas.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{developer}} Kehrle {{was inspired}} about {{the survival of}} the Italian × <b>black</b> <b>bee</b> crosses. To be able to control the matings, he started to use the isolated valley of Dartmoor. With no other bees within range, Kehrle could maintain their genetic integrity and develop desirable traits. [...] Kehrle investigated various honey bee races and made many long journeys in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, searching for pure races and interesting local stocks. The book In Search of the Best Strains of Bee tells about his travels in search of genetic building blocks. Kehrle imported more bees to cross with his developing Buckfast bee.|$|E
