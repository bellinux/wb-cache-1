50|$|The LeO 45 {{featured}} an all-metal {{construction and}} a monocoque fuselage; the structure included 60 individual fixed frames attached to longitudinal stringers and {{was covered by}} flush-rivetted light alloy panels. As {{a consequence of the}} specified speed requirements of the programme, a lot of effort was spent in reducing parasitic drag. The fuselage cross-section was reduced via the adoption of not only a main fuselage bomb bay but smaller bomb bays that were located within the wing roots. The low cantilever wing, which employed a structure designed and patented by Mercier, was constructed in four separate sections. Specifically, the inner section was built around two spars equipped with steel booms which had enough room between them to accommodate a 200 kg-class bomb and large self-sealing fuel tanks; the spars did not continue to the wing-tip but made way for a <b>box-type</b> <b>structure.</b> The wings were furnished with large split-type slotted flaps, which were electronically controlled and high aspect-ratio slotted ailerons, the latter of which being depressed during takeoff.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the railway}} arrived here {{the road was}} little more than a pack-horse road; at its {{intersection}} with the railway, traditional level crossing gates were installed. A gatekeeper's house and small lodge were also built; these both still stand: the former is now a private house, whilst the latter remains extant though out of use. It was not until the 1960s that the wooden manually operated gates were replaced with far larger mechanical gates, and the small gate lodge modified to accommodate the [...] "wheelhouse", a small signal <b>box-type</b> <b>structure</b> in a position above the road to increase visibility for the person operating the gates. A series of inter-connected rods beneath the road protected by large metal plates were also extant, but when the whole crossing was relaid in 2000 these were removed and a standard concrete crossing installed. These gates were opened and closed by a large ship's wheel structure which remains in situ. These distinctive gates were a feature of the line and survived until 2001 when, in line with a health and safety ruling, they were removed and replaced with automatic barriers which are now operated by the railway station staff from the platform for departing trains and by treadle activated by trains approaching from a southerly direction. The barriers now in operation tower above the site when in the [...] "off" [...] position; they are long enough to block both carriageways when in use. The crossing is also protected by colour lights to warn motorists of approaching trains, and a set of repeater lights on the exit to Silverburn Way further alert motorists approaching from the south.|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} and {{boundary}} element methods {{are employed in}} this study to investigate the sound radiation characteristics of a <b>box-type</b> <b>structure.</b> It has been shown [T. R. Lin, J. Pan, Vibration characteristics of a <b>box-type</b> <b>structure,</b> Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, Transactions of ASME 131 (2009) 031004 - 1 – 031004 - 9] that modes of natural vibration of a <b>box-type</b> <b>structure</b> can be classified into six groups according to the symmetry properties of the three panel pairs forming the box. In this paper, we demonstrate that such properties also reveal information about sound radiation effectiveness of each group of modes. The changes of radiation efficiencies and directivity patterns with the wavenumber ratio (the ratio between the acoustic and the plate bending wavenumbers) are examined for typical modes from each group. Similar characteristics of modal radiation efficiencies between a box structure and a corresponding simply supported panel are observed. The change of sound radiation patterns {{as a function of}} the wavenumber ratio is also illustrated. It is found that the sound radiation directivity of each box mode can be correlated to that of elementary sound sources (monopole, dipole, etc.) at frequencies well below the critical frequency of the plates of the box. The sound radiation pattern on the box surface also closely related to the vibration amplitude distribution of the box structure at frequencies above the critical frequency. In the medium frequency range, the radiated sound field is dominated by the edge vibration pattern of the box. The radiation efficiency of all box modes reaches a peak at frequencies above the critical frequency, and gradually approaches unity at higher frequencies...|$|E

50|$|MOSE {{consists}} of rows of mobile gates {{at the three}} inlets, which temporarily separate the lagoon from the sea {{in the event of}} a high tide. There will be a total of 78 gates divided into four barriers. At the Lido inlet, the widest, there will be two rows of gates of 21 and 20 elements respectively linked by an artificial island (the island connecting the two rows of gates at the centre of the Lido inlet will also accommodate the technical buildings housing the system operating plant); one row of 19 gates at the Malamocco inlet and one row of 18 gates at the Chioggia inlet.The gates consist of metal <b>box-type</b> <b>structures</b> 20 m wide for all rows, with a length varying between 18.5 and 29 m and from 3.6 to 5 m thick, connected to the concrete housing structures with hinges, the technological heart of the system, which constrain the gates to the housing structures and allow them to move.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{function of a}} uniform beam has been widely used for {{the solution to the}} problem in vibrations of a uniform plate, but it has not been used yet for vibrations of plate systems as seen in <b>box-type</b> <b>structures.</b> 　In this paper are considered free flexural vibrations of an open triangular box free at the edges and those of an open rectangular box, the base edges of which are built-in and the other edges free. The corners of the boxes are assumed free in rotation and fixed in translation and the stretching of the middle surface of the constituent plates is neglected. The functions used to represent the plate deflections are combinations of the {{characteristic function}}s of a uniform beam with both free ends or built-in-free ends and those of a triangular or a rectangular frame work. By using the functions we obtain the Lagrangians of the boxes, and from the minimum conditions of the Lagrangians we derive the frequency equations and modes of vibration. The frequencies and the mode shapes obtained from the numerical computations are compared with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the understanding of vibration characteristics of a <b>box-type</b> <b>structure</b> using finite element method as a tool. We found that mode shapes of the box structure can be classified according to their symmetrical properties, which are defined by the relative motion between the six plate panels constituting the box. The infinite number of modes of the <b>box-type</b> <b>structure</b> is divided into six groups. Each group has common features of symmetry and similar coupling mechanism between component panels and distribution of out-of-plane and in-plane components of vibration. Local and net-volume displacements associated with each mode can be correlated to the characteristics of the box as a sound source. Large volume displacement modes resembling the simple sound sources (e. g. monopole, dipole, etc) are identified among the low frequency modes. The distribution of in-plane and out-of-plane (including translational and rotational vibration at the box edges) vibration components in the modes of the box are also investigated to illustrate the energy transmission mechanism between the box panels...|$|E

Satisfactory agreement is obtained with only four rectangular elements per individual face and a simplified loading of the box...|$|E

40|$|The use of “ductile seismic frames,” whose proper seismic {{behavior}} largely {{depends upon}} construction details and specific design rules, may {{do not always}} lead to effective seismic resistant structures, as dramatically denounced by the famous Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in his artwork Straight. The artwork (96 [*]t of undulating metal bars that were salvaged from schools destroyed by the 2008 Sichuan, China earthquake, where over 5, 000 students were killed) is a clear denounce against the corruption yielding to shoddy construction methods. The issue of safe constructions against natural hazards appears even more important in developing countries where, in most cases, building structures are realized by non-expert workers, or even by simple “people from the street,” {{who does not have}} any technical knowledge on construction techniques and seismic engineering. In this paper, a brief history from the first frame structures to the more efficient wall-based structures is provided within Earthquake Engineering perspectives. The superior structural properties of <b>box-type</b> wall <b>structures</b> with respect to conventional frame structures envisage a change of paradigm from actual “ductility-based” Earthquake Engineering (centered on frame structures) toward 100 % safe buildings through a “strength-based” design exploiting the use of <b>box-type</b> wall-based <b>structures...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{active member}} {{vibration}} control experiment in a KC- 135 reduced gravity environment {{was carried out}} by the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Two active members, consisting of piezoelectric actuators, displacement sensors, and load cells, were incorporated into a 12 -meter, 104 kg <b>box-type</b> test <b>structure.</b> The active member control design involved the use of bridge (compound) feedback concept, in which the collocated force and velocity signals are feedback locally. An impact-type test was designed to accommodate the extremely short duration of the reduced gravity testing window in each parabolic flight. The moving block analysis technique was used to estimate the modal frequencies and dampings from the free-decay responses. A broadband damping performance was demonstrated up to the ninth mode of 40 Hz. The best damping performance achieved in the flight test was about 5 percent in the fourth mode of the test structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a multi {{objective}} optimization problem of crushing energy absorption of basic <b>box-type</b> column <b>structures.</b> This paper has tried to show the influence of dimensions of polygon, thicknesses of outer wall and inside diaphragms to the absorbing behaviors and the crushing peak force by the CAE simulation using LS DYNA. Then, this design problem is formulated as a multi-objective design optimization problem considering the maximization of total absorbing energy by crushing of column, and the minimization of crushing force peak during energy absorption. The response surface approximation technique is adopted to get the Pareto optimum with small numbers of CAE simulation of crushing. The suggested formulation is applied to solve the box type shell structures with diaphragm and hexagonal type shell structures with diaphragm. Finally, {{it is found that}} the shell structures with diaphragm, which connects the center of cross section and midpoint of each edge of side wall, show better energy absorbing performance in comparison with the structures with diaphragm connecting the center of cross section and the apexes of side walls...|$|R
40|$|Free {{vibration}} is {{analyzed for}} unsymmetrical joined plate or shell structures with a closed member {{by means of}} the transfer matrix method. For this purpose, the continuity and equilibrium relations for the displacements and forces at the joints are written with use of the joint matrices. The connection matrix between the closed member and other members at the joints is derived by introducing the structure matrix of the closed member, and the entire structure matrix is obtained by the product of the connection matrix of the closed member and the transfer matrices of other members. This method is applied to a plate structure with an unsymmetrically sited duct and a <b>box-type</b> <b>structure</b> with an aslant interior plate, and the natural frequencies are calculated numerically together with the mode shapes of vibration giving the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of a new}} Modal Positive Position Feedback (MPPF) strategy in controlling the vibration of a complex flexible structure using a single piezo-electric active structural member is demonstrated. The control strategy generates its control forces by manipulating only the modal position signals of the structure to provide a damping action to undamped modes. This {{is in contrast to}} conventional modal controllers that rely in their operation on negative feedback of both the modal position and velocity. The proposed strategy is very simple to design and implement as it designs the controller at the uncoupled modal level and utilizes simple first order filters to achieve the Positive Position Feedback effect. The performance of the new strategy is enhanced by augmenting it with a time sharing strategy to share a small number of actuators between larger number of modes. The effectiveness of the new strategy is validated experimentally on a flexible <b>box-type</b> <b>structure</b> that has four bays and its first two bending modes are 2. 015 and 6. 535 Hz respectively. A single piezo-electric actuator is utilized as an active structural member to control several transverse bending modes of the structure. The performance of the active control system is determined in the time and the frequency domains. The results are compared with those obtained when using the Independent Modal Space Control (IMSC) of Meirovitch. The experimental results suggest the potential of the proposed strategy as a viable means for controlling the vibration of large flexible structures in real time...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{extensive}} test program to characterize the behavior of typical aircraft structures under acoustic loading and to establish their fatigue endurance are presented. The structures tested were the three flap-like <b>box-type</b> of <b>structures.</b> Each structure consisted of one flat (bottom) and one curved (top) stiffener stiffened skin panel, front, and rear spars, and ribs that divided the structures into three bays. The three structures, constructed from three different materials (aircraft standard aluminum alloy, Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic, and a Glass Fibre Metal Laminate, i. e., GLARE) had {{the same size and}} configuration, with only minor differences due to the use of different materials. A first set of acoustic tests with excitations of intensity ranging from 140 to 160 dB were carried out to obtain detailed data on the dynamic response of the three structures. The FE analysis of the structures is also briefly described and the results compared with the experimental data. The fatigue endurance of the structures was then determined using random acoustic excitation with an overall sound pressure level of 161 dB, and details of crack propagation are reported...|$|R
