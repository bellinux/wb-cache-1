40|$|We {{investigate}} the scaling relations of <b>bulge</b> and disk structural parameters for {{a sample of}} 108 disk galaxies. Structural parameters are obtained from 2 D bulge/disk decomposition of H-band images. <b>Bulges</b> are modelled with a generalized exponential (Sersic) with variable shape index n. We find that <b>bulge</b> effective scalelength and luminosity increase with increasing n, but disk properties are independent of <b>bulge</b> shape. As Hubble type T increases, <b>bulges</b> become less luminous and their mean effective surface brightness gets fainter; disks shows a similar, but much weaker, trend. When <b>bulge</b> parameters are compared with disk ones, they are tightly correlated for n= 1 <b>bulges.</b> The correlations gradually worsen with increasing n such that n= 4 <b>bulges</b> appear virtually independent of their disks. The Kormendy relation, surf. brightness vs. effect. radius, is shown to depend on <b>bulge</b> shape; the two parameters are tightly correlated in n= 4 <b>bulges,</b> and increasingly less so as n decreases; disks are well correlated. Bulge-to-disk size ratios are independent of Hubble type, but smaller for exponential <b>bulges.</b> Strongly barred SB galaxies with exponential <b>bulges</b> are more luminous than their unbarred counterparts. Exponential <b>bulges</b> appear to be closely related to their underlying disks, while <b>bulges</b> with higher n values are less so.

40|$|<b>Bulges</b> in spiral galaxies {{have been}} {{supposed}} to be classified into two types: classical <b>bulges</b> or pseudobulges. Classical <b>bulges</b> are thought to form by galactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested to form by secular evolution due to spiral arms and a barred structure funneling gas into the galactic centre. Noguchi (1998, 1999) suggested another <b>bulge</b> formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a numerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form clumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc {{is expected to be}} highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic centre by dynamical friction and merge into a single <b>bulge</b> at the centre. This <b>bulge</b> formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the high-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution. Therefore, clump-origin <b>bulges</b> may have their own unique properties. We perform a high-resolution N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation for the formation of the clump-origin <b>bulge</b> in an isolated galaxy model and study dynamical and chemical properties of the clump-origin <b>bulge.</b> We find that the clump-origin <b>bulge</b> resembles pseudobulges in dynamical properties, a nearly exponential surface density profile, a barred boxy shape and a significant rotation. We also find that this <b>bulge</b> consists of old and metal-rich stars, displaying resemblance to classical <b>bulges.</b> These natures, old metal-rich population but pseudobulge-like structures, mean that the clump-origin <b>bulge</b> can not be simply classified into classical <b>bulges</b> nor pseudobulges.

40|$|Context: Knowledge of the {{intrinsic}} shapes of galaxy components provides crucial information when constraining phenomena driving their formation and evolution. Aims: We analize the structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred S 0 -Sb galaxies to derive {{the intrinsic}} shape of their <b>bulges.</b> Methods: We {{developed a new}} method to derive the intrinsic shapes of <b>bulges</b> based on geometrical relationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of <b>bulges</b> and disks. <b>Bulges</b> were assumed to be triaxial ellipsoids sharing the same center and polar axis of their surrounding disks. Disks were assumed to be circular, infinitesimally thin, and to lie on the equatorial plane of <b>bulges.</b> The equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of <b>bulges</b> {{were obtained from the}} length of the apparent major and minor semi-axes of the <b>bulge,</b> the twist angle between the apparent major axis of the <b>bulge</b> and the galaxy line of nodes, and the galaxy inclination. Results: We find that the intrinsic shape is well constrained for a subsample of 115 <b>bulges</b> with favorable viewing angles. A large fraction of them are characterized by an elliptical section (B/A 50 % and none has a probability > 90 % of being elongated along the polar axis. The distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. This bimodality is driven by <b>bulges</b> with Sérsic index n > 2, or equivalently, by the <b>bulges</b> of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio B/T > 0. 3. <b>Bulges</b> with n ≤ 2 and with B/T ≤ 0. 3 follow a similar distribution, which differs from that of <b>bulges</b> with n > 2 and B/T > 0. 3. In particular, <b>bulges</b> with n ≤ 2 and B/T ≤ 0. 3 exhibit a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) <b>bulges,</b> a smaller fraction of triaxial <b>bulges,</b> and fewer prolate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) <b>bulges</b> with respect to <b>bulges</b> with n > 2 and with B/T > 0. 3, respectively.

We show that dynamical friction of massive clumps in gas-rich disks is a plausible disk-driven mode for the formation of "old" late-type <b>bulges.</b> If disk evolutionary processes are responsible for the formation of the entire family of late-type <b>bulges,</b> CDM simulations need to produce a similar number of initially bulgeless disks in addition to the disk galaxies that are observed to be bulgeless at z= 0.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a classical <b>bulge</b> in disk galaxies holds important clue to the assembly history of galaxies. Finding observational evidence of very low mass classical <b>bulges</b> particularly in barred galaxies including our Milky Way, is a challenging task as the bar driven secular evolution might bring significant dynamical change to these <b>bulges</b> alongside the stellar disk. Using high-resolution N-body simulation, we show that if a cool stellar disk is assembled around a non-rotating low-mass classical <b>bulge,</b> the disk rapidly grows a strong bar within a few rotation time scales. Later, the bar driven secular process transform the initial classical <b>bulge</b> into a flattened rotating stellar system whose central part also have grown a bar-like component rotating {{in sync with the}} disk bar. During this time, a boxy/peanut (hereafter, B/P) <b>bulge</b> is formed via the buckling instability of the disk bar and the vertical extent of this B/P <b>bulge</b> being slightly higher than that of the classical <b>bulge,</b> it encompasses the whole classical <b>bulge.</b> The resulting composite <b>bulge</b> appears to be both photometrically and kinematically identical to a B/P <b>bulge</b> without any obvious signature of the classical component. Our analysis suggest that many barred galaxies in the local universe might be hiding such low-mass classical <b>bulges.</b> We suggest that stellar population and chemodynamical analysis might be required in establishing the evidence for such low-mass classical <b>bulges.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} spectrum of a microlensed G dwarf in the Galactic <b>bulge</b> with spectroscopic temperature T_eff = 5600 +/- 180 K. This I~ 21 mag star was magnified {{by a factor}} ranging from 1160 to 1300 {{at the time of}} observation. Its high metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0. 33 +/- 0. 15) places this star at {{the upper end of the}} <b>bulge</b> giant metallicity distribution. Using a K-S test, we find a 1. 6 % probability that the published microlensed <b>bulge</b> dwarfs share an underlying distribution with <b>bulge</b> giants, properly accounting for a radial <b>bulge</b> metallicity gradient. We obtain abundance measurements for 15 elements and perform a rigorous error analysis that includes covariances between parameters. This star, like <b>bulge</b> giants with the same metallicity, shows no alpha enhancement. It confirms the chemical abundance trends observed in previously analyzed <b>bulge</b> dwarfs. At supersolar metallicities, we observe a discrepancy between <b>bulge</b> giant and <b>bulge</b> dwarf Na abundances. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, submitted to Ap...|$|R
