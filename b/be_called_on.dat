25|$|The {{basic problem}} is that the {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory. And by the time it finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>on</b> an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E
