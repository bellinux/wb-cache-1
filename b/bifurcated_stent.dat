40|$|In {{this paper}} a method is introduced, to {{visualize}} <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> grafts in CT-Data. The {{aim is to}} improve therapy planning for minimal invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Due to precise measurement of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and exact simulation of the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft, physicians are supported in choosing a suitable stent prior to an intervention. The presented method {{can be used to}} measure the dimensions of the abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as simulate a <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft. Both of these procedures are based on a preceding segmentation and skeletonization of the aortic, right and left iliac. Using these centerlines (aortic, right and left iliac) a bifurcated initial stent is constructed. Through the implementation of an ACM method the initial stent is fit iteratively to the vessel walls - due to the influence of external forces (distance- as well as balloonforce). Following the fitting process, the crucial values for choosing a <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft are measured, e. g. aortic diameter, right and left common iliac diameter, minimum diameter of distal neck. The selected stent is then simulated to the CT-Data - starting with the initial stent. It hereby becomes apparent if the dimensions of the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft are exact, i. e. the fitting to the arteries was done properly and no ostium was covered.

40|$|ObjectiveThe goal of {{this article}} is to report the {{preliminary}} results of infrapopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty stenting with the Nile Croco coronary <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> (Minvasys, Gennevilliers, France) for selected patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). MethodsFrom October 2006 to December 2010, 31 patients with CLI with below-the-knee TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus C and D lesions at the popliteal (n = 17, 54. 8 %) and distal tibioperoneal trunk (n = 14, 45. 2 %) bifurcations, with suboptimal primary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty results (residual stenosis > 30 %, elastic recoiling, or dissection), with at least two-vessel runoff to the foot (present or after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), free of aortoiliac arterial disease, and at high surgical risk (more than three risk factors) were treated with the Nile Croco coronary <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent.</b> Study end points included technical success, immediate and midterm primary and secondary patency rates, clinical improvement, and limb salvage. ResultsTechnical success was achieved in all patients (100 %) without any intraoperative complications. Early complications included an acute stent occlusion and an acute compartment syndrome for a collateral arterial branch perforation. Median follow-up was 12. 1 months (range, 1 - 32). Primary and secondary patency rates were 96. 7 % and 86. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 67. 2 %- 94. 6 %) at 30 days and and 100 % and 96. 6 % (95 % CI, 78. 0 %- 99. 5 %) at 1 year, respectively. Clinical improvement (an upward shift of at least two Rutherford categories) was achieved in 28 patients (90. 3 %). A major amputation was required in one patient (3. 2 %). The overall limb salvage rate at 1 year was 96. 7 % (95 % CI, 78. 6 %- 99. 5 %). ConclusionsPreliminary data suggest that the Nile Croco <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> for below-the-knee angioplasty in selected patients with CLI is associated with high rates of technical success, early and midterm patency, and clinical improvement. Limb salvage rates are acceptable for this technically highly challenging anatomy, yet further studies with larger patient populations are necessary to validate these results...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{long-term}} {{performance of the}} <b>bifurcated</b> Zenith <b>stent</b> graft. MethodsA total of 325 patients (300 men and 25 women) underwent elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with <b>bifurcated</b> Zenith <b>stent</b> grafts between October 1998 and December 2005. Follow-up included routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography and multiview abdominal radiographs at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Data on late-occurring (> 30 days after stent-graft implantation) complications and interventions were collected prospectively. ResultsOf the original 325 patients, 92 have since died, resulting in a mean follow-up of 2. 3 years (range, 1 month to 7. 0 years). Nine (2. 8 %) of 325 patients required reintervention to treat or prevent endoleak (type I or III) or graft occlusion {{at an average of}} 1. 4 years after stent-graft placement (range, 40 days to 4. 0 years). Three (0. 9 %) of these patients died from causes related to malfunction of the stent graft: one each from aneurysm rupture, stent-graft infection, and infection of a femoral-femoral bypass graft placed after limb occlusion. Nineteen additional patients (5. 8 %) required treatment for type II endoleak, for a total reintervention rate of 8. 6 %. ConclusionsLate failures of Zenith stent-graft attachment, structure, or function are rare.

40|$|Abstract Objective: Endovascular {{techniques}} to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms results in lower {{morbidity and mortality}} rates. However, dilation of the common iliac arteries prevents adequate distal sealing, which compromises the procedure success. The {{aim of this study}} is report the long-term outcomes of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms associated with aneurysm of the common iliac artery following endovascular repair using a <b>bifurcated</b> bell-bottom <b>stent</b> graft. Methods: This is a retrospective study that evaluated patients treated with <b>bifurcated</b> bell-bottom extension <b>stent</b> grafts to repair an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and who had at least one common iliac artery with dilatation > 1. 5 cm for at least 12 months after the endovascular intervention. Results: Thirty-eight patients {{with a mean age of}} 70. 4 ± 8. 2 years were included. Stent graft placement was followed by dilation of the common iliac artery aneurysms in 35. 3 % of cases; endoleak and reoperation rates were 17. 6 % and 15. 7 %, respectively. Younger patients showed a higher rate of artery diameter increase following the procedure. The average arterial dilation was 16 % in the first year, 29 % in the second year, 57 % in the third year and 95 % from the fourth year until the end of follow-up. Conclusion: Repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms with <b>bifurcated</b> bell-bottom type <b>stents</b> when there is common iliac artery dilation is a good therapeutic option to preserve hypogastric flow. The rate of endoleak was 17. 6 %, and 15. 7 % of cases required reoperation. Younger patients are more likely to experience dilation of the common iliac artery after the procedure...|$|R
30|$|One {{explanation}} for the inconsistency in the radiation dose received by patients undergoing EVAR could be the range of complexity of the procedure within the groups being analysed. Hence, the present study retrospectively divided patients who received a <b>bifurcated</b> aortic <b>stent</b> graft into two groups, depending on {{the complexity of the}} EVAR procedure as determined by the anatomical criteria for the EVAR- 1 Trial, with those patients meeting the criteria having aneurysms deemed to be less complicated.

40|$|A 40 -year-old {{man with}} Stanford type B {{dissection}} underwent his first endovascular repair (EVAR) in April 2004 by Talent thoracic stent graft. He had an uncomplicated recovery and maintained good blood pressure control. However, a new retrograde dissection appeared in September 2004. The new dissection involved his aortic arch and ascending thoracic aorta {{to the opening}} of the coronary arteries. To reconstruct the aortic arch, bypasses between the right common carotid artery (RCCA), left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were performed before endovascular repair. A modified bifurcated Talent stent graft was deployed from the RCCA to the ascending thoracic aorta with a long limb in the innominate artery and a short limb in the aortic arch. A further two pieces of graft were deployed via the common femoral artery. The ascending thoracic aorta and aortic arch were reconstructed completely by the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft. The final angiography confirmed that there was good stent graft configuration, normal blood flow, and stable haemodynamics. No endoleak or other major complications were encountered.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the anatomic suitability for endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) according to instructions for use (IFUs) of three commercially available <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft devices and explore the possible benefits of low-profile delivery systems. Computed tomography scans of 241 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) were evaluated for suitability of Zenith Flex(®), Gore Excluder(®) and Endurant(®) <b>bifurcated</b> <b>stent</b> graft systems according to their IFUs. The most common exclusion criteria and possible benefits of smaller diameter delivery systems were analyzed. When choosing the most suitable graft model for each patient, the overall suitability was 49. 4 %. By brand, the suitability was 28. 6 % for Zenith(®), 25. 7 % for Gore Excluder(®) and 48. 1 % for Endurant(®). By step wise accepting iliac diameters of ≥ 6 mm, ≥ 5 mm and ≥ 4 mm the overall suitability increased to 56. 7, 58. 9 and 60. 2 %, respectively (P < 0. 001). Diameters below 4 mm had no additional effect on suitability as combinations of other anatomical features, with or without narrow iliacs, accounted for the remaining excluding factors. In conclusion, Less than half of patients with AAAs are suitable for EVAR according to current IFUs. Low-profile delivery systems may allow for endovascular treatment in up to 60 % of patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of crossing the limbs of <b>bifurcated</b> modular <b>stent</b> grafts for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is often {{employed in the}} face of splayed aortic bifurcations to facilitate cannulation and prevent device kinking. However, little has been reported about the implications of cross-limb EVAR, especially in comparison to conventional EVAR. Previous computational fluid dynamics studies of conventional EVAR grafts have mostly utilized simplified planar stent graft geometries. We herein examined the differen-ces between conventional and cross-limb EVAR by comparing their hemodynamic flow fields (i. e., in the “direct ” and “cross ” configurations, respectively). We also added a “planar ” configuration, which is commonly found in the literature, to identify how well this configuration compares to out-of-plane stent graft configurations from a hemody-namic perspective. A representative patient’s cross-limb stent graft geometry was seg-mented using computed tomography imaging in Mimics software.

MethodsWe reviewed the clinical data of consecutive patients treated for IIAAs between 2001 and 2012. End-points were morbidity, mortality, graft patency, and freedom from pelvic ischemic symptoms (buttock claudication, ischemic colitis, and spinal cord injury). ResultsThere were 97 patients, 87 male and 10 female, with mean age of 74  ± 8  years. A total of 125 IIAAs (71 unilateral and 27 bilateral) with mean diameter of 3. 6  ± 2  cm were treated. Eighty-two patients (86 %) had elective repair and 15 (14 %) required emergent repair (mean size, 6. 7  ± 2. 4  cm; range, 3. 6 - 10  cm). OR in 60 patients (62 %; 49 elective, 11 emergent) included IIA bypass in 36 (60 %) patients and endoaneurysmorrhaphy in 24 (40 %). II-EVAR in 37 patients (38 %; 30 elective, 4 emergent) required IIA embolization in 29, iliac branch device in five or open IIA bypass in three, combined with <b>bifurcated</b> aortic <b>stent</b> grafts in 17. Early mortality was 1 % for elective (1 / 49 open, 0 / 33 endovascular) and 7 % for emergent repair (1 / 11 open, 0 / 4 endovascular). Early morbidity (43 % vs 8 %; P <. 001) and length of stay (9 vs 1  day; P <. 001) were significantly higher for OR as compared with II-EVAR. Pelvic ischemic complications occurred in 25 patients (26 %), including hip claudication in 23, ischemic colitis in two, and paraplegia in one. Freedom from buttock claudication at 2  years was 25 % in patients with no IIA preserved, 68 % with preservation of one, and 95 % with preservation of both IIAs (P =. 002). Freedom from buttock claudication was higher after OR than after II-EVAR (79 % vs 59 %; P =. 05). Primary and secondary patency rates of IIAA bypasses were 95 %, and 80 % at 1 and 3  years, respectively. ConclusionsII-EVAR of IIAAs is associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stay compared with OR.

Target vessel failure is a composite endpoint, consisting of cardiac death, target vessel MI, or target vessel revascularization. Results Patients {{with at least one}} bifurcated lesion (n = 465, 25. 7 %) versus patients with non-bifurcated target lesions only (n = 1346, 74. 3 %) showed similar rates of clinical endpoints including target vessel failure (9. 2 versus 7. 9 %, p = 0. 36) and definite stent thrombosis (0. 4 versus 1. 0 %, p = 0. 38). Target vessel MI was more common in patients with bifurcated lesions (3. 4 versus 1. 6 %, p = 0. 02); but after multivariate analysis with propensity score adjustment, bifurcation treatment was found not to be an independent predictor of target vessel MI (HR 1. 40, 95 % CI 0. 71 – 2. 76; p = 0. 34). Among patients with bifurcated lesions, DES type and side-branch size did not affect outcome, but periprocedural MI occurred more often after two-stent approaches (9. 0 versus 2. 1 %; p = 0. 002). Conclusion All-comer patients treated for bifurcated and non-bifurcated target lesions showed similar and low rates of clinical endpoints, suggesting that the DES used are efficacious and safe for treating bifurcated target lesions...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{is a complex}} problem and difficult treatment for tracheobronchial stenoses/occlusions involving in carina. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of argon plasma coagulation (APC) and <b>bifurcated</b> covered Z-type <b>stents</b> (CZTS) placement for the treatment of tracheobronchus stenoses and esophagorespiratory fistula (ERF). Methods Thirty-two cases with airway disorders were retrospectively reviewed for the treatment of APC and CZTS placement. Under the bronchoscopic guidance, APC was first given in patients with airway stenoses, then CZTS was placed under the fluoroscopic and flexible bronchoscopic guidance either with airway stenoses or ERF. Results APC was first given in 19 patients with airway stenoses. Airway structures were significantly improved after APC procedure (57. 4 %- 72. 1 % before APC vs 12. 8 %- 25. 8 % after APC). Thirty-two CZTS were technically successfully placed in 30 out of 32 cases involving in carinal bifurcation. After APC and stent placement, short breath index was significantly reduced and karnofsky physical score (KPS) increased obviously. The endobronchial defects were successfully palliated with bifurcated CZTS placed under fluoroscopy and flexible bronchoscopy in 12 out of 13 patients with ERFs. There is no bleeding introprocedure. Mucous retention was very common in all types of the stents less than 2 weeks after stenting, which required debridement by bronchoscopy and could be prevented by normal saline solution nebulizations. Granuloma developed at the ends of stents after 1 month of stenting which all of them were treated successfully with APC and CO 2 cryosurgery. Conclusion Utilization of APC and retrieval bifurcated CZTS placement is a simple and safe protocol for the management of airway complex stenoses involving the tracheal carina and ERF...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To review our {{experience}} with fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) to treat complications after previous standard infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Methods: A prospectively maintained database including all consecutive patients with juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that {{were treated with}} F-EVAR after failed previous EVAR within the period March 2002 to November 2012 at the University Medical Center of Groningen, Netherlands (up to October 2009), and the Klinikum Nurnberg Sud, Germany (from November 2009) was analyzed. Evaluated outcomes included initial technical success, operative mortality and morbidity, and late procedure-related events with regard to survival, target vessel patency, endoleak, renal function, and reintervention. Results: A total of 26 patients (24 male, mean age 73. 2 +/- 6. 5 years) were treated. All patients had proximal anatomies precluding endovascular reintervention with standard techniques. In 23 patients a fenestrated proximal cuff was used, and in three patients a <b>bifurcated</b> fenestrated <b>stent</b> graft. Technical success was achieved in 24 (92. 3 %) patients. One patient required on-table open conversion because of impossibility to retrieve the top cap {{as a result of}} twist of the ipsilateral limb. In the second patient the right kidney was lost due to inadvertent stenting in a smaller branch of the renal artery. Catheterization difficulties, all related to the passage through the limbs or struts of the previous stent graft, were encountered in 11 (42. 3 %) cases, including five (19. 2 %) patients with iliac access problems and six (23. 1 %) with challenging renal catheterization. Operative target vessel perfusion success rate was 94. 6 % (70 / 74). Operative mortality was 0 %. Mean follow-up was 26. 8 +/- 28. 5 months. No proximal type I endoleak was present on first postoperative CTA. The mean aneurysm maximal diameter decreased from 73 20 mm to 66. 7 +/- 21 mm (p <. 05). There were six late deaths, one of them aneurysm related. Estimated survival rates at land 2 years were 94. 1 +/- 5. 7 % and 87. 4 +/- 8. 4 %, respectively. Patency during follow-up for the target vessels treated successfully with a fenestrated stent graft was 100 % (70 / 70). Reintervention was required in four cases, including one acute conversion due to rupture, one for iliac limb occlusion and two for type Ib and II endoleak. Renal function deterioration was observed solely in the two cases of primary technical failure. Conclusions: F-EVAR represents a feasible option for the repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm after prior EVAR failure. It is advantageous in terms of mortality and less morbid than open surgery, but is associated with increased technical challenges because of the previously placed stent graft. Outcome seems related to initial technical success. (C) 2013 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
