40|$|The Public Sickness Insurance Act (Act no. 187 / 2006 Coll.) which {{replaced}} the existing fragmented law regulations governing the subsystem {{of the public}} sickness insurance regime in the Czech Republic became effective as of 1 January 2009. The new law regulations {{in the field of}} public sickness insurance was expected to bring, among other aspects, a higher motivation of employees and employers for reduction of the events of unjustified temporary work incapacity. The main aim of the Bachelors Dissertation was to find out whether the new law regulation fulfilled the intents and whether the rate of temporary work incapacity of employees decreased and whether the average duration of temporary work incapacity in the Region of South Bohemia dropped in comparison with the situation before 1 January 2009. While drawing up the Bachelors Dissertation, the author used a quantitative research and statistical data analysis. It implied from the results found that the hypothesis "The number of temporary work incapacities in the Region of South Bohemia dropped in comparison with the situation before 1 January 2009 was confirmed. The fulfilment of the hypothesis is correlated with the legislators intent in this area because its fulfilment was intended in the objectives of the new law regulations. The implementation of the new Public Sickness Insurance Act led to a significant reduction of the number of cases of temporary work incapacity. On the basis of the analysis of the data acquired it was proven that the time of duration of one temporary work incapacity was extended in all districts of the Region of South Bohemia. The hypothesis "The average time of temporary work incapacity in the Region of South Bohemia dropped in comparison with the situation before 1 January 2009 was not confirmed. The results of the Dissertation indicate that the adoption of the new law regulation system of public sickness insurance led to the system stabilisation, elimination of undesired trends in the sickness insurance system, limitation of misuse of benefits, involvement of treating physicians and employers in the reduction of the number of cases of temporary work incapacity. The implementation of the new law regulations managed to achieve this objective. Therefore the results found can be used by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs as a certain form of feedback relating to implementation of the new law regulation of the public sickness <b>benefit</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> and the professional public...|$|E

40|$|In 2002 the Chilean {{government}} implemented {{new legislation}} for an unemployment insurance scheme {{which has been}} presented both at a national and international level {{as a model for}} other developing countries, because it provides protection against unemployment, avoids issues of moral hazard associated with traditional unemployment <b>insurance</b> <b>systems,</b> and has a relatively low public finance requirement. The scheme, which is financed principally through individual savings accounts, but also institutes a government financed contingency fund for workers with insufficient savings, has been described by the ILO as “new legislation {{that could lead to a}} new generation of reforms in unemployment insurance matters. ” But before this scheme is copied by other developing countries, and perhaps also by developed ones, we should ask whether it really does provide adequate insurance for the unemployed. Initial research conducted on the Chilean case suggests that good quality jobs in the formal sector will be well covered by this insurance scheme, whereas precarious and low income jobs will hardly be covered at all. Since workers with low quality jobs face a far higher probability of becoming unemployed, this means that the vast majority of the unemployed will not <b>benefit</b> from this <b>insurance</b> <b>system.</b> This paper is the first published account of how this unemployment insurance will work in practice...|$|R

In the opening chapters it explains rudimentary terms and other important notions whose - at least sketchy - characterization is necessary for further full comprehension of the complex system of retirement pension benefits. The fifth chapter focusses on elementary terms which make clear the general calculation of retirement pension income. In the thesis different pension incomes (old age pension, disability pension and surviving dependant's pension) are defined by a general introduction into the topic of the respective types of pensions and their caracterization. In some cases there is a brief note about the historical context of the pension, in particular in case of surviving dependants' pensions. The thesis refers to the roots of such an adjustment. Then it is made clear what the legal conditions for the pension claim are, what entitles the benefit duration and when - according to the law - the respective <b>benefit</b> of pension <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> expires, including the amount and payment of different pension incomes.

This paper provides novel critiques of <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> responses to climate change and of the attendant political economy perspective {{on the relationship between}} insurance and climate change. A complex adaptive systems (CAS) analysis suggests that ecologically effective (i. e. strong) mitigation is the only viable approach to manage medium and long term climate risk, for the <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> itself and for human societies more widely. In contrast, we find that even the most substantial <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> responses to date are generally adaptive and weakly mitigative. This analysis extends an earlier political economy perspective that explains the limitations of <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> responses to climate change, but provides little guidance to the ecological implications of such responses.

30|$|This {{study is}} based on the theory of social justice by John Rawls, which is devoted to {{achieving}} equality for the underclass group and prioritizing vulnerable groups in distributing medical benefits and resources, thus improving their health outcomes as much as possible. Although Rawls did not list health as a basic social good, Daniels et al. (1999) extend Rawls’s theory and considers from the perspective of opportunity equity that encompasses health. Two points are emphasized in Rawls’s principles of justice: one is opportunity equity (each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others), and the other is the difference principle, i.e., improving the well-being of the least advantaged group as much as possible (Rawls 1971). In the social medical <b>insurance</b> <b>system,</b> the disadvantaged social group should share equitable benefits; by the theory of expected utility, the demand for insurance reflects the degree of risk aversion and certainty for incomes (Wagstaff 2000). Facing the risk of illness, the vulnerable group will express stronger risk aversion since the vulnerable or the poor are not able to afford healthcare services without insurance. In practice, the principle of giving priority to disadvantaged groups has been successfully implemented in the national medical <b>insurance</b> <b>systems</b> of certain countries or regions, such as Taiwan, such that the lowest income group receives the most <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits.</b> As individual income increases, <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> decrease, while the highest income group receives the least <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> compared to their contributions to the insurance fund (Huang et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|Two {{important}} {{dimensions of}} the Swedish social <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> are those of universality (encompassing the entire population) and of compensation for loss of income. The decisions basic to the Swedish social <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> and thus to the Swedish Welfare State were made during the 1910 s. A universal pension <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> was decided upon in 1913. This was the world's first universal public <b>insurance</b> <b>system.</b> Pensions were provided both in cases of disability and of a person reaching the age of 67. Important factors explaining this decision were that Sweden had the oldest population in the Western world and thus high expenditures for poor relief, and that as the reporting and taxation of individual incomes had just been introduced it became possible to finance a universal pension system by means of compulsory contributions by the individual (a special earmarked tax). The establishment of a pension <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> {{provided the basis for}} a <b>system</b> of <b>insurance</b> for work-related injuries, in 1916. It included the entire workforce and was the most modern of its kind. The presence of a pension <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> and <b>insurance</b> for work-related injuries pointed to the need for a sickness <b>insurance</b> <b>system.</b> This was designed to deal with simple cases of injury as well as with more serious cases of illness or injury that could lead to disability.
