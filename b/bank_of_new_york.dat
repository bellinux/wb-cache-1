5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuing {{his studies}} before graduating when the college closed its doors during British {{occupation}} of the city, Hamilton {{played a major role}} in the American Revolutionary War. At the start of the war in 1775, he joined a militia company. In early 1776, he raised a provincial artillery company, to which he was appointed captain. He soon became the senior aide to General Washington, the American forces' commander-in-chief. Hamilton was dispatched by Washington on numerous missions to convey plans to his generals. After the war, Hamilton was elected as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation from New York. He resigned to practice law, and founded the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b>|$|E

Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E

In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July.
