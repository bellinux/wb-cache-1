She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the Star Wars universe. Sara Kestelman voiced {{the character}}, with Kreia's casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine's hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi's robes.|$|E

25|$|During his centenary in 1903, while {{receiving}} {{attention from}} all leading musical reference books, {{he was still}} not generally accepted as {{being one of the}} great composers. Some of his music was still in neglect and his following was smaller than other, mainly German, composers. Even half a century did not change much, and it took until the 1960s for the right questions to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> his work, and for it to be viewed in a more balanced and sympathetic light. One of the pivotal events in this fresh ignition of interest in the composer was a performance of Les Troyens by Rafael Kubelík in 1957 at Covent Garden. The music of Berlioz enjoyed a revival during the 1960s and 1970s, {{due in large part to}} the efforts of French conductor Charles Munch and of British conductor Sir Colin Davis, who recorded his entire oeuvre, bringing to light a number of Berlioz's lesser-known works. An unusual (but telling) example of the increase of Berlioz's fame in the 1960s was an explosion of forged autographs, manuscripts, and letters, evidently created to cater for a much greater interest in the composer. Davis's recording of Les Troyens was the first near-complete recording of that work. The work, which Berlioz never saw staged in its entirety during his life, is now a part of the international repertoire, if still something of a rarity. Les Troyens was the first opera performed at the newly built Opéra Bastille in Paris on 17 March 1990 in a production claimed to be complete, but lacking the ballets.|$|E

[...] Forthcoming single 'Rock Steady' was another energetic, commercially viable highlight. They looked tired at times, especially Mel Blatt, who perspired heavily under the lights, and while their routines were competent, serious questions have to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> their live skills, with accusations of miming rumbling frequently around the room. Luckily for All Saints, this didn't feel like a symptom of decline, having always employed minimal physical effort, simple choreography, and heavily produced vocals. All Saints are not natural live performers, but against the odds, last night's showing provided some optimism about their comeback potential.|$|E
2500|$|Congress {{rushed to}} enact the {{existing}} gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton's planned repeal effort. Clinton called for legislation to overturn the ban, but encountered intense opposition from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of Congress, and portions of the public. DADT emerged as a compromise policy. Congress included text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy. The Clinton Administration on December 21, 1993, issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants were not to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> their sexual orientation. This is the policy now known as [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell". The phrase was coined by Charles Moskos, a military sociologist.|$|E

2500|$|Currently the ADF also {{recognises}} [...] "interdependent relationships", {{which include}} same-sex relationships, regarding benefits available {{to active duty}} members. This means equal benefits in housing, moving stipends, education assistance and leave entitlements. To be recognised as interdependent, same-sex partners will have to show they have a [...] "close personal relationship" [...] that involves domestic and financial support. The ADF also gives equal access to superannuation and death benefits for same-sex partnerships.

2500|$|With Parliament opened, and the King safely back in Buckingham House, serious {{questions}} started to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> {{the exact nature}} of Rochford's 'emergency.' [...] In the Cabinet he was increasingly isolated, as his fellow ministers stepped back from the whole affair in an attempt to minimise the political damage. [...] Finally, on November 7, the hapless minister resigned for reasons of 'ill health.' [...] Soon after Sayre was released, all charges against him having been dropped, and the bail returned. [...] He then began his counter-attack, commencing legal action against the former minister. [...] In the end, though the law was on his side, the action came to nothing, because the escalation of the war in North America turned Sayre from a defender of liberty, in the mould of John Wilkes, into an enemy alien.|$|E
2500|$|A {{question}} that may <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> an adaptation {{is whether it}} is generally obligate (relatively robust {{in the face of}} typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation). The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like [...] "if-then" [...] statements. For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; {{this is an example of}} another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|An ulcer {{that keeps}} forming {{on the same}} site and then healing {{may be caused by}} a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at {{different}} sites are likely to be RAS. Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. The size of the ulcers may be helpful in distinguishing the types of RAS, as can the location (minor RAS mainly occurs on non-keratinizing mucosa, major RAS occurs anywhere in the mouth or oropharynx). Induration, contact bleeding and rolled margins are features of a malignant ulcer. There may be nearby causative factor, e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues. Otherwise, the person may <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> problems elsewhere, e.g. ulceration of the genital mucous membranes, eye lesions or digestive problems, swollen glands in neck (lymphadenopathy) or a [...] general unwell feeling.|$|E
2500|$|To Plant's horror, [...] "Sea of Love" [...] {{became his}} biggest-selling single. According to Plant, the {{original}} single was [...] "Rockin' at Midnight," [...] with [...] "Sea of Love" [...] as the [...] "B" [...] side. The single was eventually [...] "flipped" [...] because radio stations were playing [...] "Sea of Love" [...] {{far more than}} [...] "Rockin' at Midnight". Plant feared his career would be ruined by this, and that people would think of him now as a [...] "crooner", instead of {{the rock and roll}} singer he'd always been. As a result, when he would <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> The Honeydrippers in years to come, Plant would refer to The Honeydrippers as having been [...] "put to sleep." [...] "Rockin at Midnight" [...] is a remake of the 1949 recording by Roy Brown, the song's author, who wrote it as an answer record to his 1947 composition and recording, [...] "Good Rockin' Tonight".|$|E

He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr. Hollywood guy, Mr. Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy..." [...] He added, [...] "And for me to do interviews all the time and <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don't get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn't even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that's how pathetic he is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fallout from}} the {{controversy}} wounded both Clinton and Aspin politically and dragged on until December 1993, when, after many months of equivocation, confusion, and more controversy, Aspin released new regulations, known as the [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy on homosexual conduct in the armed forces: Applicants for the services would not <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> their sexual orientation, and homosexual orientation would not disqualify anyone from service [...] "unless manifested by homosexual conduct"; military personnel would be judged on suitability for service, not sexual orientation; separation from the service {{would be based on}} homosexual acts, same sex marriage, or statements by an individual that he or she was bisexual or homosexual, with the person accorded the opportunity to rebut the presumption of homosexual acts; DoD criminal investigation or law enforcement organizations would not investigate solely to determine a service member's sexual orientation, and sexual orientation questions would not be included in personnel security questionnaires; finally, service members would be informed of DoD policy on sexual conduct during their training. This compromise policy, [...] issued after an agonizing and divisive public debate, did not completely satisfy any of the concerned parties.|$|E
