40|$|The 'juste retour' attitude, namely each EU <b>member</b> <b>state's</b> {{priority}} for securing {{the best possible}} individual net financial position vis-à-vis the community budget over any other consideration concerning the community budget is stronger than ever. The differences across <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in terms of net financial positions are indeed remarkable. In the period 1997 - 2006 the group of major net payer countries (the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Austria) had an average 'deficit' vis-à-vis the EU budget amounting to 0. 35 % of the GNI. For the group of minor net payers (Denmark, France, Finland and Italy) the respective indicator was 0. 08 % only. The UK with its rebate stood closer to the second group. The full impact of the 2004 / 2007 enlargement will be felt in 2013, after the 'phasing in' process will have been nearly completed. Estimated net financial positions for 2013 show that major net payers' financial positions will not change significantly but those of the minor payers' will deteriorate to a large extent. The net <b>beneficiary</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> will typically get substantially less (net) EU transfers than the cohesion countries had received in the 1990 s. Several reform proposals envisage {{the introduction of a}} European tax. Various candidates for this tax were tested in the paper for fulfilling the requirement for proportionality of contributions to the EU budget with economic strength of the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The results show that a couple of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> would contribute substantially more or less to the community budget than their share is in the aggregate EU GNI, thus these taxes would open up a new battlefield for ¿juste retour¿ discussions. On the expenditure side of the EU budget conditions of eligibility for support have emerged over decades in the framework of various, with one another unrelated, EU policies. This led to a strong differentiation in the extent of financial support by <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> decoupled from their relative prosperity. Germany and the UK were overall 'losers' as in each main policy areas their share was substantially lower than in the aggregate EU GNI in 1997 - 2006. The Netherlands joined the club of overall 'losers' from 2003 on. The results of an estimation for 2013 hint at increasing polarization. 8 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> will be 'losers' both in agricultural and cohesion expenditures while 13 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> 'winners' in both areas, and only 6 of the 27 will have mixed position. The final chapter of the paper presents a comprehensive reform proposal which faces the juste retour problem frontally instead of negating or circumventing it. The corner stone of the proposed system is the EU 27 average per capita GNI, at official exchange rate. Each <b>member</b> <b>state</b> would receive annually a transfer from the EU budget that corresponds to 1 % of the EU average per capita GNI multiplied by the number of inhabitants in the <b>member</b> <b>state</b> concerned. The revenues of the EU budget would be secured through contributions from <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> which would amount to 1 % of the <b>member</b> <b>state</b> GNI. <b>Member</b> <b>states</b> with higher than EU average per capita GNI would be thus net payers, those with lower than the average per capita GNI of the EU would be net beneficiaries. Net contributions and receipts, respectively, would clearly reflect the difference in relative prosperity of the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> This proposition is supplemented by recommendations for reform both on the revenues and expenditures sides of the EU budget. Comparing the estimated financial position of net payer <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in 2013 under the prevailing and the reformed system, respectively, show that each net payer would come off better, though to varying extent, under the new regime. Further enlargements, even with Turkey, would create an average net financial position for this group of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> matching that had been prevailing in 1997 - 2006. The same comparison for the net <b>beneficiary</b> <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> however, indicates less gains under the new regime. Clear rules for the post- 2013 years, smaller, but safely secured and for the long run foreseeable transfers from the EU budget, further significantly increased flexibility in utilization of the EU resources may win the net <b>beneficiary</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> for the reforms proposed.

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
