5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain <b>boundaries.</b> <b>In</b> low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E

5|$|An {{area the}} Reform Act {{did not address}} was the issue of {{municipal}} and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county <b>boundaries</b> <b>in</b> {{the late nineteenth and}} twentieth centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with high wind shear, marginal ocean temperatures caused deep convection {{in association with}} Flossie to weaken and become ragged; as a result, the forecast called for continued weakening. Instead, a brief reprieve in upper-level winds allowed the system to intensify to a secondary peak of 65mph (100km/h) by 1200UTC on July28. An anticyclone northwest of the system increased shear atop the system once again by the following day, and dry air began to become ingested into the circulation. The low-level vortex became exposed to view and progressively ill-defined as outflow <b>boundaries</b> <b>in</b> association with a previous convective burst impeded on the low. At 0000UTC on July30, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression; after the circulation became indistinguishable on satellite imagery twelve hours later, the system was declared a remnant area of low pressure. At this time, the vortex was centered near the northern coast of Kauai.|$|E

When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation <b>boundaries</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed {{the problem of how}} to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E
