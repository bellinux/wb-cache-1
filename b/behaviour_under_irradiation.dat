40|$|Zirconium carbide {{is one of}} the {{candidate}} materials to be used for some fuel components of the high temperature nuclear reactors planned in the frame of the Gen-IV project. Few data exist regarding its <b>behaviour</b> <b>under</b> <b>irradiation.</b> We have irradiated ZrC samples at room temperature with slow heavy ions (4 MeV Au, fluence from 10 (11) to 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 2)) in order to simulate neutron irradiations. Grazing incidence X-Ray diffraction (GIXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis have been performed in order to study the microstructural evolution of the material versus ion fluence. A high sensitivity to oxidation is observed with the formation of zirconia precipitates during the ion irradiations. Three damage stages are observed. At low fluence (10 (14) cm(- 2)), the micro-strains saturate and the loops coalesce to form a dense dislocation network. No other structural modification is observed. The material shows a moderate cell parameter increase, corresponding to a 0. 6 vol. % swelling, which saturates around 10 (14) ions/cm(2), i. e., a few Zr dpa. As a result, in spite of a strong covalent bonding component, ZrC seems to have a <b>behaviour</b> <b>under</b> <b>irradiation</b> close to cubic metals. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Depending on the nature of the particles obtained with various fabrication processes (centrifugal atomisation or mechanical grinding), noticeable differences about gas retention capabilities and <b>behaviour</b> <b>under</b> <b>irradiation</b> of the fuel are observed [1, 2]. Up to now, no precise links between the microstructure of the fuel and its <b>behaviour</b> <b>under</b> <b>irradiation</b> have been established. Several methods of characterisation have then been developed, more particularly, to characterise various types of defects and the γ-U(Mo) phase stability, which are both supposed to influence the gas retention capacities of the fuel [1,[2] and [3]]. Our method is based on a multi-scale approach, high temperature X-Ray diffraction experiments have first been carried out followed by observations using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-Ray diffraction has revealed being a pertinent tool in order to study the kinetic of decomposition of the γ-U(Mo) phase as a function of temperatures and times, for different kind of powders. TEM is also among one of these techniques and allows a microstructure characterisation at a grain size scale. It has required the development of an original protocol set up for producing thin sections from large particles introducing a minimum quantity of defects within the material.
