Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album.

500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break <b>between</b> <b>My</b> Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I really like the sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't {{get a chance to see}} the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—"Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha" [...] and [...] "Roni"—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' [...] "Tender Love" [...] and LL Cool J's [...] "I Need Love".|$|E
500|$|Humor and irony are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} book.

Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... struck Father Mike {{right in the middle of}} the face." [...] Derek Weiler of the Toronto Star noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the [...] "horrific qualities of public men's rooms". The author employed another writing deviceabrupt incongruityin describing Desdemona's physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her [...] "braids were not delicate like a little girl's but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver's tail". According to Penelope Music of Book Magazine, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from [...] "run-of-the-mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy". An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal's grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that [...] "hameful as it is to say, the riots were the best thing that ever happened to us." [...] The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout.|$|E

500|$|Hitchens writes [...] "the biggest fake miracle {{staged in}} human history was {{the claim that the}} Soviet Union was a new {{civilisation}} of equality, peace, love, truth, science and progress. Everyone knows that it was a prison, a slum, a return to primitive barbarism, a kingdom of lies where scientists and doctors feared offending the secret police, and that its elite were corrupt and lived in secret luxury". He then cites Walter Duranty's denying the existence of the great Ukrainian famine, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb's [...] acceptance that the 1937 Moscow show trials were [...] "genuine criminal prosecutions". Hitchens then examines Lenin's suppression of religion in the Soviet Union, which included making the teaching of religion to children punishable by the death penalty and the creation of an antireligious organisation of Soviet workers. Hitchens begins Chapter 13 by quoting William Henry Chamberlin: [...] "In Russia, the world is witnessing the first effort to destroy completely any belief in supernatural interpretation of life", and then examines some consequences of this, including intolerance of religion, terror, and the persecution of priests and bishops at the Solovetsky concentration camp. Hitchens asserts that in the Soviet Union [...] "the regime's institutional loathing for the teaching of religion, and its desire to eradicate it, survived every doctrinal detour and swerve". In the final chapter, Hitchens analyses a number of his brother's arguments, and contends that [...] "the coincidence in instinct, taste, and thought <b>between</b> <b>my</b> brother and the Bolsheviks and their sympathisers is striking and undeniable". He then records how his brother nominated the [...] "apostle of revolutionary terror" [...] Leon Trotsky for an edition of the BBC radio series Great Lives; praised Trotsky for his [...] "moral courage"; and declared that one of Lenin's great achievements was [...] "to create a secular Russia". Hitchens speculates that his brother remained sympathetic towards Bolshevism and is still hostile towards the things it extirpated, including monarchy, tradition, and faith. He ends the chapter by claiming a form of militant secularism is becoming established in Britain, and that [...] "The Rage Against God is loose".|$|E
