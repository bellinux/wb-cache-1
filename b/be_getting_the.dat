25|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again {{proved to be}} the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind {{at some point during the}} descent, but the two leaders worked {{together}} not to let that happen. However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping to <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from coming back. In the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.|$|E

500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't seem to <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh {{to say that this}} was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{released}} in most {{regions of the}} world, EA have said Australasia will <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> game at a later date. The reason behind this is to hold back digital and boxed copies for a smooth launch so to avoid any problems encountered during launch. However, BioWare revealed that the game would not be region or IP blocked, allowing players to purchase the game from other regions. Additionally, BioWare allowed Australian and New Zealand players {{to take part in}} the beta stages of the game. BioWare community manager Allison Berryman said [...] "Data from this test will be used to inform decisions about the launch of the game in Oceanic regions", however, she was unable to provide any information in regards to the game's launch in those regions.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{liked the}} console {{versions}} of the game, they believed there were obvious differences between the PC and console versions. Neigher believed that due playing with thumbsticks and shoulder buttons [...] "you definitely won't <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> ultimate CS:GO experience." [...] Ron Vorstermans for Gamer.nl said that the PC version is there to play at a higher competitive level, though {{he went on to}} say that the console versions are not inferior because of the PC's superiority for competition. Dyer wrote that the PlayStation 3 version was at an advantage to the Xbox version because of the ability to connect a keyboard and mouse to the system. He continued on to say that the user-interface on both of the consoles was as good as the PC one. Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy held the opinion that although the game has support for the PlayStation Move, using it only makes the [...] "already unforgiving game all the more challenging." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 2006, Jackson {{spoke at}} a meeting in Dallas and {{addressed}} the subject of government contracting. [...] He recounted that a prospective HUD contractor had made a [...] "heck of a proposal" [...] and was selected upon the basis of that proposal, but upon thanking Jackson for being selected the bidder, mentioned that he did not like President Bush. [...] As a result, Jackson said, the bidder who had criticized Bush did not receive the contract: [...] "Brother, you have a disconnect—the President is elected, I was selected. You wouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> contract unless I was sitting here. If {{you have a problem with}} the President, don’t tell the secretary." [...] Jackson told the crowd, [...] "He didn't get the contract. Why should I reward someone who doesn't like the president, so they can use funds to try to campaign against the President? Logic says they don't get the contract. That's the way I believe." ...|$|E
