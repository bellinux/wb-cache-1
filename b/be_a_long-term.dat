5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned {{whether he would}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run {{of the season in}} his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Australians {{participated in}} the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945. Ten RAAF squadrons, {{hundreds}} of Australians in RAF units and about 500Australian sailors serving with the Royal Navy formed part of the force assembled for the landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944; overall, {{it has been estimated}} that about 3000 Australian personnel took part in this operation. From 11 June until September 1944 the Spitfire-equipped No.453Squadron RAAF was often based at forward airfields in France and it and Australian light bomber and heavy bomber squadrons supported the liberation of France. RAAF light bomber and fighter squadrons continued to support the Allied armies until the end of the war in Europe by attacking strategic targets and escorting bomber formations. No.451 and 453Squadrons formed part of the British Army of Occupation in Germany from September 1945, and it was planned that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> Australian presence in this force. Few RAAF personnel volunteered to remain in Europe, however, and both squadrons were disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Metro Transit Committee {{debated the}} {{inclusion}} of the bus tunnel in the project's environmental impact assessment well into 1983, Seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a transit mall and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system. On September 22, UMTA requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of November, which prompted the Metro Council to expedite its decision. Metro Council Executive Director Neil Peterson favored the tunnel alternative, while the Seattle City Council and Mayor Charles Royer preferred the transit mall, but stated that a tunnel would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> solution to downtown congestion. The Seattle City Council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative, voting unanimously on October 17 in favor of an electric-only transit tunnel. Along with Mayor Royer, they were willing to compromise on Peterson's proposed dual-mode buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible. The Metro Council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on November 3, 1983, estimating a cost of $300 million to build a five-station tunnel under 3rd Avenue and Pine Street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd Avenue into a landscaped transit mall.|$|E

25|$|His {{background}} is explored {{further in the}} comic book Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale. Book was born Henry Evans, a boy who was raised by an abusive father. He {{ran away from home}} and began life as a petty criminal before being recruited by the Independence movement and moving out to the Border Worlds. Long before the Alliance begins the Unification War, forward-thinking Browncoats assign Evans to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> mole. He sheds his old identity by killing a random passerby and stealing his identification card, becoming Derrial Book. His Browncoat superiors keep tabs on him by surgically removing one of his eyes and replacing it with a camera. He joins the Alliance military and quickly moves up in rank. Becoming an officer, Book intentionally leads a risky operation that results in a humiliating defeat for the Alliance. He is forced to retire from the Alliance military. It is implied that the Alliance covers up the loss, therefore not officially punishing Book. Homeless, he visits a soup kitchen and finds God while contemplating a bowl of soup. He takes refuge at an abbey where he becomes a shepherd before leaving on Serenity to become a missionary.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Davies' pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee called [...] "Return of the Daleks". The production team had always intended for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role, Bruno Langley was chosen, previously known for his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. It was never intended for Adam to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> companion, Davies wanted to show that not everyone is suitable to join the TARDIS crew and dubbed him [...] "The Companion That Couldn't", he [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} show with someone who was a rubbish companion".|$|E

500|$|The Japanese ground {{offensive}} on Guadalcanal {{was under}} way in the Battle for Henderson Field while the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of 26 October 1942, just north of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with one carrier sunk (...) and another heavily damaged (.) The participating Japanese carrier forces also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses plus significant damage to two carriers. Although a tactical victory and a short-term strategic victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, and control of the seas around Guadalcanal, Japan's loss of many irreplaceable veteran aircrews proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low and quickly replaced.|$|E
500|$|Since 1963, the {{perennial}} companion figure in Doctor Who generally serves {{to remind the}} Doctor of his [...] "moral duty". However, Adam {{was never meant to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> companion. In the behind-the-scenes book Doctor Who: The Inside Story Davies explains that he [...] "always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubs Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he characterised Adam as [...] "a little bit ambitious and [...] "a little bit too clever for his own good." [...] Langley added that the character ends up [...] "on {{the wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] because he likes [...] "meddling with things" [...] and that [...] "him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he [...] "doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where knowledge, information and power are put in front of him." [...] Davies felt that Adam's story provided [...] "a chance to see someone starting on that path" [...] before the Doctor cuts his ambitions short.|$|E
500|$|In August, {{during a}} long weekend in the arts colony at Woodstock, Bryant began what was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term,</b> {{intermittent}} love affair with painter Andrew Dasburg, {{with whom she had}} been close for a couple of years. Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 Patchin Place. Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the use of Allied troops in Russia; the specific charge against him was that he had used [...] "disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States". He was released on $5,000 bail. In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, Floyd Dell, and others from the former staff of The Masses for conspiracy to obstruct the draft of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, [...] "Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops. Bryant was questioned in The Masses cases but not charged. Both trials involving The Masses ended in hung juries, and the defendants were set free. In October, Bryant's first book, Six Red Months in Russia, was published to [...] "mostly favorable reviews," [...] and Reed resumed work on Ten Days That Shook the World after the government returned his notes. It would not be published until April 1919.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the vast}} {{majority}} of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many small teams of programmers and artists have contributed to the genre.

As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or [...] "indie") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres.
