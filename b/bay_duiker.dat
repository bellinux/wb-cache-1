2500|$|World of Darkness {{opened in}} 1969 {{and was the}} world's first major exhibit {{designed}} specifically around nocturnal animals. Built by Morris Ketchum, Jr. & Associates, the house was built where the zoo's [...] "Rocking Stone Restaurant" [...] stood until 1942. The exhibit used red-lights to dimly illuminate the enclosures within the windowless building. Like all nocturnal exhibits, the house ran on a reversed lighting schedule, which simulated night and day at opposite times to allow visitors to view nocturnal animals in a more naturalistic setting. Due to budget cuts and the high-cost of running the exhibit, it was closed in 2009 At the time of closing, exhibited species included Rodrigues flying fox, western <b>bay</b> <b>duiker,</b> Javan slow loris, pygmy slow loris, Chinese leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis), Arabian sand cat, naked mole-rat, Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, broad-snouted caiman, and cane toad.|$|E

50|$|The {{mandrill}} is an omnivore. It usually consumes plants, {{of which}} it eats over a hundred species. It prefers to eat fruits, but will also eat leaves, lianas, bark, stems, and fibers. It also consumes mushrooms and soil. Carnivorously, mandrills mostly eat invertebrates, particularly ants, beetles, termites, crickets, spiders, snails, and scorpions. It will also eat eggs, and even vertebrates such as birds, tortoises, frogs, porcupines, rats, and shrews. Mandrills likely will eat larger vertebrates when they have the opportunity, such as juvenile <b>bay</b> <b>duikers</b> and other small antelope. Large prey are likely killed with a bite to the nape with the mandrill's long canines. One study found the mandrill's diet was composed of fruit (50.7%), seeds (26.0%), leaves (8.2%), pith (6.8%), flowers (2.7%), and animal foods (4.1%), with other foods making up the remaining (1.4%).|$|R
40|$|Bushmeat is {{the main}} source of protein and the most {{important}} source of income for rural people in the Congo Basin, but intensive hunting of bushmeat species is also a major concern for conservationists. Although spatial heterogeneity in hunting effort and in prey populations at the landscape level {{plays a key role in}} the sustainability of hunted populations, the role of small-scale heterogeneity within a village hunting territory in the sustainability of hunting has remained understudied. We built a spatially explicit multiagent model to capture the dynamics of a system in which hunters and preys interact within a village hunting territory. We examined the case of hunting of <b>bay</b> <b>duikers</b> (Cephalophus dorsalis) in the village of Ntsi´et´e, northeastern Gabon. The impact of hunting on prey populations depended on the spatial heterogeneity of hunting and prey distribution at small scales within a hunting area. Within a village territory, the existence of areas hunted throughout the year, areas hunted only during certain seasons, and unhunted areas contributed to the sustainability of the system. Prey abundance and offtake per hunter were particularly sensitive to the frequency and length of hunting sessions and to the number of hunters sharing an area. Some biological parameters of the prey species, such as dispersal rate and territory size, determined their spatial distribution in a hunting area, which in turn influenced the sustainability of hunting. Detailed knowledge of species ecology and behavior, and of hunting practices are crucial to understanding the distribution of potential sinks and sources in space and time. Given the recognized failure of simple biological models to assess maximum sustainable yields, multiagent models provide an innovative path toward new approaches for the assessment of hunting sustainability, provided further research is conducted to increase knowledge of prey species' and hunter behavior.

50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is a nocturnal animal, and {{consequently}} {{little is known}} of its behavioural patterns. During the day, the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> rests against trees or in thickets. It tends to remain solitary, but pairs can also be observed. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> exhibits remarkable alertness. It depends heavily on its sense of smell for foraging and detecting potential danger. Individuals communicate through preorbital gland secretions and excrement. The leopard is the main predator of this duiker. Eagles, bonobos and mandrills may also prey on the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker.</b> An alarmed individual becomes motionless, and might leap to flee.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> {{is similar}} to several other duikers. The red duiker can not be readily {{distinguished}} from the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker.</b> Though Ogilby's duiker resembles the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> in size and pelage colour, the ventral side is paler and the dorsal stripe starts from the shoulders instead {{of the back of}} the head. Additionally, the body posture and horn characteristics of the two species differ to a large extent. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> as well as the Ogilby's duiker are remarkably similar to the black duiker, except for the pelage colouration. The dorsal stripe of Peters's duiker also begins at the shoulders but widens to cover the whole of the rump, as does the fainter stripe on the white-bellied duiker. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> can be easily told apart from the black-fronted duiker and Weyns's duiker, that lack stripes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> prefers old-growth or primary forests. It {{has been}} {{historically}} overhunted across its range for bushmeat. The {{survival of the}} <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is also threatened by human settlement and agricultural expansion due to this duiker's preference for old-growth forests, and habitat degradation. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is, however, still a common duiker species, and is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is a nocturnal animal. It {{tends to}} remain solitary, but pairs {{can also be}} observed. The leopard is the main {{predator}} of this duiker. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> mainly prefers fruits, but may also feed on animal matter such as bird eggs. Females may conceive {{by the age of}} eighteen months. Breeding occurs throughout the year. Gestation lasts for about 240 days, following which generally a single offspring is born. The lifespan of the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> averages 17 to 18 years.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> prefers old-growth or primary forests. Home {{ranges of}} females are around 0.2 - 0.4 sqkm sq mi large, {{and those of}} males are {{twice the size of}} those of females. This duiker {{formerly}} occurred in the lowland forested areas (warm, moist rainforests) of Guinea. Nowadays, the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> can be found in moist forested islands and riparian forests in the savannas of Guinea and northeastern Sudan. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is native to several countries in western and southern Africa: Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. It is feared to be extinct in Uganda.|$|E
5000|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. Jentink's duiker {{was classified as}} a giant duiker along with the yellow-backed duiker (C. silvicultor), Abbott's duiker (C. spadix), and the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> (C. dorsalis). In 2012, Anne R. Johnston (of the University of Orleans) and colleagues constructed a cladogram of the subfamily Cephalophinae (duiker) based on mitochondrial analysis. They showed that within the [...] "giant duiker" [...] group, Jentink's duiker formed a clade with the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker,</b> and the zebra duiker is sister to this clade. Similarly, Abbott's duiker and yellow-backed duiker form a clade sister to Sylvicapra. Jentink's duiker and the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> probably evolved during the Pleistocene, less than 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Both sexes have {{a bright}} reddish-brown coat. The ventral parts and the flanks are all reddish brown, and the legs dark brown. A notable {{feature of this}} duiker is the well-pronounced solid stripe of black {{extending}} {{from the back of}} the head to the tail. This stripe is narrower in females. Due to its nocturnal nature, the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> has large conspicuous eyes. Whiskers can be observed above the eyes and around the nostrils. The patches of white fur around the whiskers are in sharp contrast to the dark reddish face. Juveniles have a dark coat, that develops the stripes and chestnut to reddish-brown colour gradually. The face is marked by a dark region from the nose to the forehead, separated from the rest of the face by two light brown furrows extending above or circling its eyes. Above the eyes and on the lips and chin white spots can be seen. The head has a diminutive crest (a tuft of hair), and is dark brown. The eastern <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is larger and heavier than the western <b>bay</b> <b>duiker,</b> with larger ears and darker colouration. The dorsal stripe is wider and lighter in colour in the eastern <b>bay</b> <b>duiker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> mainly prefers fruits. It {{feeds on}} the large fruits of Irvingia species (wild mango), Detarium macrocarpum and the spherical fruits of Mammea africana. Other fruits the duiker may eat are those of Ricinodendron heudelotii and oil-palms, the orange ones of Chrysophyllum beguei, the olive-like ones of Pseudospondias longifolia, the green plums of Panda oleosa and those of Cola rostrata, that {{resemble}} cocoa pods. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> extracts the pulp from the seeds, making a grating sound. If the seeds are large, the duiker spits them out. Smaller seeds {{such as those of}} Antrocaryon species may be ingested. A 1989 study found that the soft seeds of plants such as Drypetes gossweileri, Staudtia gabonensis, Dacryoides buettneri, Ongokea gore, Santiria trimera, Annonidium mannii and Pentaclethra macrophylla are preferred. There have been reports of the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> preying on birds (without feeding on the legs and wings) and the embryo of unhatched eggs, carrion, remains of African porcupines and kusimanses, termites, beetles and ants. Dog food may serve as supplement for captive individuals.|$|E
5000|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. However, {{the status of}} two species, the zebra duiker and the Aders' duiker, remained dubious. In 2012, Anne R. Johnston (of the University of Orleans) and colleagues constructed a cladogram of the subfamily Cephalophinae (duiker) based on mitochondrial analysis.

50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus dorsalis), {{also known}} as the black-striped duiker and the black-backed duiker, is a forest-dwelling duiker native to western and {{southern}} Africa. It was first described by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1846. Two subspecies are identified. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is reddish brown and has a moderate size. Both sexes reach 44 - 49 cm at the shoulder. The sexes do not vary considerably in their weights either; the typical weight range for this duiker is 18 - 23 kg. Both sexes possess a pair of spiky horns, measuring 5 - 8 cm. A notable feature of this duiker is the well-pronounced solid stripe of black extending {{from the back of the}} head to the tail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is a {{moderately}} sized antelope; the typical head-and-body length is 76 - 103 cm. Both sexes reach 44 - 49 cm at the shoulder. The sexes do not vary considerably in their weights either; the typical weight range for this duiker is 18 - 23 kg. Hence, sexual dimorphism in this species {{is not as}} remarkable as in other bovids, though females are often larger than males. The tail, black on the outside but white in the inner parts, is 9 - 11 cm long. The tail of the eastern <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> terminates in a white tuft. Both sexes possess a pair of spiky horns, measuring 5 - 8 cm. Rowland Ward, however, recorded a maximum horn length of 12.3 cm from Yokadouma (Cameroon). The horns of females are generally narrower.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} over 60 mammal species, {{including}} forest buffalos, leopards, hippos, mona monkeys, water chevrotains, bush babies, civets, elephants, and the pygmy flying squirrel (Idiuus zenkeri). Nine species of duikers {{are found in}} the park, including the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus dorsalis). The park has eight primate species and almost 300 butterfly species.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Bay and Peters's duikers can coexist {{because of}} their {{different}} sleep patterns. This allows the Peters's duiker to eat its fruits by day, and the <b>Bay</b> <b>duiker</b> to eat what is left by night. In consequence of such a life pattern, the Bay duiker’s digestive system has evolved to consume remaining, rather poor-quality foods.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Colin Groves and Peter Grubb {{identified}} three subgenera of Cephalophus : Cephalophula, Cephalpia and Cephalophus. They classified C. silvicultor under the third subgenus along with C. spadix (Abbott's duiker), C. dorsalis (<b>bay</b> <b>duiker)</b> and C. jentinki (Jentink's duiker). This subgenus is characterised by minimal sexual dimorphism and spotted coats (of juveniles). C. silvicultor forms a superspecies with C. spadix.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> has {{depleted}} {{to a large}} extent due to deforestation. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker,</b> unlike the other duiker species, is still found in significant numbers, and is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The Washington Convention (CITES) enlists the species in Appendix II. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the total population at 725,000. The most significant population occurs only in the Taï National Park (Côte d'Ivoire). Protected areas where bay duikers occur include: Sapo National Park (Liberia); Kakum National Park (Ghana); Campo Ma'an National Park, Dja Faunal Reserve and Lobéké National Park (Cameroon); Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve and Bangassou (Central African Republic); Monte Alén National Park (Equatorial Guinea); Lopé National Park and Minkébé National Park (Gabon); Odzala National Park and Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (Congo-Brazzaville); Ituri Rainforest, Kahuzi-Biéga, Maiko and Salonga National Parks (Congo-Kinshasa).|$|E
50|$|Gestation {{lasts for}} about 240 days, {{following}} which generally a single offspring is born. The infant weighs nearly 1600 - 1690 g, and its coat is dark reddish brown. The brighter reddish-brown to chestnut colour develops by {{five to six}} months. For {{the first few weeks}} after its birth, the infant is kept concealed in dense vegetation when the mother is away. The offspring can start taking solid food within a few weeks. Weaning occurs at around three-and-a-half months. The lifespan of the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> averages 17 to 18 years.|$|E
50|$|Mammal {{species of}} {{conservation}} concern include chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), king colobus (Colobus polykomos), sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys lunulatus), Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana rolowayi), western palm squirrel (Epixerus ebi), African linsang (Poiana richardsoni liberiensis), African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana africana)), water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), Maxwell's duiker (Philantomba maxwellii), red-flanked duiker (Cephalophus rufilatus), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus silvicultor), <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus dorsalis), royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus), oribi (Ourebia ourebi), bohor reedbuck (Redunca redunca), kob (Kobus kob kob), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa), western hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus major), and roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus).|$|E
50|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. Abbott's duiker (C. spadix), the <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> (C. dorsalis), Jentink's duiker (C. jentinki) and the yellow-backed duiker (C. silvicultor) {{were classified as}} the giant duikers. The east African red duikers include the black-fronted duiker (C. nigrifrons), Harvey's duiker (C. harveyi), red-flanked duiker (C. rufilatus), red forest duiker (C. natalensis), Ruwenzori duiker and white-bellied duiker (C. leucogaster). The third group, the west African red duikers, comprises the black duiker (C. niger), Ogilby's duiker, Peters's duiker (C. callipygus) and Weyns's duiker (C. weynsi). However, the status of two species, Aders' duiker and Zebra duiker, remained dubious.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} zebra duiker is Cephalophus zebra. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> is classified under the genus Cephalophus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1838 in Annals of Natural History. No subspecies are identified. The generic name probably comes from {{the combination of the}} New Latin word cephal, meaning head, and the Greek word lophos, meaning crest. The specific name zebra pertains to the striking resemblance this duiker bears to the zebra due to the presence of dorsal stripes. The word [...] "duiker" [...] comes from the Afrikaans word duik, or Dutch duiker - both mean [...] "diver". The zebra duiker is locally known as the marking deer in Liberia.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{exploitation}} of bushmeat by commercial hunters is fundamental to resolving hunting sustainability issues in African rainforests. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the impact of hunters operating from the village of Sendje in the Monte Mitra region, Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Offtake patterns of 42 hunters were studied over a period of 16 months. A total of 3, 053 animals of 58 species were hunted during 1, 914 hunting days. This represented around 11, 376 kg of bushmeat or 2, 219 animals extracted per annum. Most captures were mammals (43 species, 79 %), constituting 90 % of the biomass hunted, of these 30 % were ungulates and 27 % were rodents. Hunters used 17 hunt camps within the 1, 010 km 2 total study area. Hunting activity fell from the start to the end of the study, with fewer hunting days, biomass and captures being recorded per month. Captures fell from 700 animals in the first month to less than 100 during the last month. Per hunter, returns diminished from 21 in the first month to around 13 animals from the third month. Average body mass of prey also declined throughout the study period. The principal hunting method was cable snaring -over 100 million snare nights were estimated. An average hunter extracted around 50 animals or 271 kg of bushmeat per annum. Hunter and camp differences were significant. Most carcasses were sold for the city market or to villagers, and the proportion of carcasses sold to market was positively correlated with the species body mass. Capture rates and vulnerability were dependent on prey size since medium¿sized animals were more vulnerable to be caught than small or large¿bodied animals. Harvest sustainability was calculated for 14 mammals and it was seen that the situation was unsustainably for 5 species due to the extent and impact of hunting. The <b>bay</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus dorsalis) was by far the most heavily exploited species. Conservation of the Monte Mitra region is impossible unless the hunting for profit issue is resolved in Sendje and adjoining villages...|$|E
