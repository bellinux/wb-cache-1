Some authors have cited Chang's <b>balas</b> <b>ruby</b> identification of langgan (e.g., Needham and Lu 1974: 180); others have used, or even confused, it with ruby, in translations (e.g., [...] "precious rubies" [...] Knoblock 1994: 44).|$|E

There are however some significant differences in the two descriptions: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{transparent}} red spinels {{were called}} spinel-rubies or <b>balas</b> <b>rubies.</b> In the past, {{before the arrival}} of modern science, spinels and rubies were equally known as rubies. After the 18th century the word ruby was only used for the red gem variety of the mineral corundum and the word spinel came to be used. [...] "Balas" [...] is derived from Balascia, the ancient name for Badakhshan, a region in central Asia situated in the upper valley of the Panj River, one of the principal tributaries of the Oxus River. Mines in the Gorno Badakhshan region of Tajikistan constituted for centuries the main source for red and pink spinels.|$|R

Ishkoshim District is a particularly attractive destination in Gorno-Badakhshan for its archeological sites and spectacular scenery.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his account}} Tavernier gives {{details of the}} design in which the balas rubies, emeralds, {{diamonds}} and pearls were arranged on the four horizontal bars connecting the four vertical legs, from which the 12 vertical columns, supporting the canopy arose. In the middle of each bar, a large cabochon-cut <b>balas</b> <b>ruby</b> was placed, surrounded by four emeralds forming a square cross. Such square crosses were situated {{on either side of}} the central large square cross, along the length of the bar, but arranged in such a way, that while in one square cross a <b>balas</b> <b>ruby</b> occupies the center, surrounded by four emeralds, in the next square cross, an emerald occupies the center, surrounded by four balas rubies. The emeralds were table-cut and the intervals between the emeralds and rubies, were covered with diamonds, also table-cut and not exceeding 10 to 12 carats in weight.|$|E
5000|$|Lahori's account {{mentions}} several historical diamonds that {{decorated the}} throne, {{such as the}} 186 carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, the 95 carat Akbar Shah diamond, the 88.77 carat Shah diamond and the 83 carat Jahangir diamond, apart from the 352.50 carat Timur Ruby, the third largest <b>balas</b> <b>ruby</b> in the world. Tavernier {{makes no mention of}} these most precious stones. One explanation is that when Tavernier saw the throne in 1665, all these historical diamonds and the <b>balas</b> <b>ruby</b> were in the possession of Shah Jahan, who was under house arrest at the Fort in Agra. Two months after Tavernier left Delhi and had reached the Bengal, during his sixth and last voyage to India, Shah Jahan died on January 22, 1666, and his son and successor Aurangzeb was able to claim all these diamonds and gemstones. Lahori's descriptions were made during the rule of Shah Jahan, when all these historical diamonds and the Timur Ruby were probably incorporated on the throne.|$|E

6000|$|When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII. of France, {{his horse}} {{was loaded with}} gold leaves, {{according}} to Brantôme, and his cap had double rows of rubles that threw out a great light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II. had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with <b>balas</b> <b>rubies.</b> Hall described Henry VIII., {{on his way to}} the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing [...] "a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses." [...] The favourites of James I. wore earrings of emeralds set in gold filigrane. Edward II. gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap parsemé with pearls. Henry II. wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls, and studded with sapphires.|$|R
2500|$|The {{inventory}} has 3690 {{entries for}} precious metals and stones. These include a coffer of Catherine Parr's jewels which {{remained at the}} Tower of London, amongst its contents were gold headresses set with pearls and diamonds (habillements); girdles with gold links set with diamonds, rubies and pearls; and two jewels fashioned with the initials HK, for Katherine and Henry. One more recent acquisition was a jewel with <b>balas</b> <b>rubies</b> bought from Anton Fugger;"A jewell bought by the kinges Majestie of Anthony fulker and his company of Antewarpe in May 1551 and delivered to t'handes of the Earl of willteshere lorde treasurer of England by the kinges Majestie the VIIth day of June 1551.A fayer flower of golde having sett in the same three table ballaces sett withowte foyle, and between everey ballace a perle, and in the myddes betwene the three ballaces a large pointed Diamounte and a perle pendaunt {{at one of the}} ballaces." [...] Edward VI was obliged to buy this jewel, which he described in his diary, for 100,000 crowns because the English crown owed £60,000 to the Fugger's bank. The enamelled Royal Gold Cup which survives in the British Museum is listed simply as; [...] "a Cuppe of gold with Imagerie, the knopp a crowne Imperiall and aboute the bordre of the cover and the foote a Crowne garnished with lxii garnishing perles weying lxxix oz," [...] and identified by its original number of pearls. The [...] "knopp a crowne Imperiall" [...] and [...] "the bordre of the cover" [...] with its pearls were lost at some point between the 17th and 19th centuries. Notes in the inventory record diplomatic gifts given and some incidents; in the summer of 1552, Edward VI lost a large pearl pendant from a gold chain while riding between Titchfield and Southampton. The pearl was found and returned in May 1553.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Twining {{wrote of}} a tiara of Pope Boniface VIII that {{became known as}} the Tiara of Saint Sylvester: Under Boniface VIII (1294-1303) the hood of the regnum was {{lengthened}} and the circlet was greatly enriched with precious stones, while {{toward the end of his}} papacy a second circlet was added. The increased length had the symbolical meaning of dominion of the una sancta ecclesia over the earth, and demonstrated the meaning of the papal unam sanctum. In the inventory of 1295 the second year of Boniface's papacy the head-dress, which is now usually referred to as a tiara, is described as enriched with 48 <b>rubies</b> <b>balas,</b> 72 sapphires, 45 praxini or emeralds, numerous little <b>balas</b> <b>rubies</b> and emeralds and 66 large pearls. At the summit was a very large ruby.Boniface VIII was succeeded in 1303 by Benedict XI, who took the tiara to Perugia. After his death in 1304 there was a period of eleven months before a new Pope succeeded. The Archbishop of Bordeaux was chosen and took the title of Clement V. He removed the papal seat from Rome to Avignon and the tiara was brought to Lyons from Perugia for his coronation on 14 November 1305. In the inventory which was taken in 1315-16 Boniface VIII's tiara is again described and can be identified by the mention of the large ruby, which is recorded as missing. It is described as having three circlets corona quae vocatur, regnum cum tribus circuitis aureis. It therefore must have been between the taking of the two inventories in 1295 and 1315 that the second and third circlets were added to the tiara. It was during this period that the fleur-de-lis was used to decorate the circlets. The tiara was kept in the Papal Treasury at Avignon until Gregory XI took it back to Rome, which he entered on 17th January 1377. In 1378 Robert of Geneva was elected anti-Pope taking the style Clement VII, and he removed the tiara from Avignon. When the Spaniard, Pedro de Luna, was elected anti-Pope in 1394 styling himself Benedict XIII, he took the tiara from Avignon to Spain, where it remained until Aphonso V of Aragon failed in his attempt to renew the schism, and on his withdrawal of support from the anti-Pope Clement VII in 1419, the tiara was returned to Rome.In the 14th century, the tiara of Boniface VIII began to be called the Tiara of St. Sylvester, and became venerated and considered as a relic. This was no doubt suggested by the Donation of Constantine, but it now came to be used only at the coronation of Popes, starting with Gregory XI in 1370 and his successor Urban VI in 1378. It was used at no other ceremonies and was kept in the Lateran Treasury. It was last used at the coronation of Nicholas V (1446-55), and in 1485 it was stolen and no more is heard of it".|$|R
