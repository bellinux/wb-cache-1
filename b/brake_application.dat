40|$|In the past, wear at {{the disc}} and pads {{interface}} of disc brakes {{has rarely been}} accounted for in a 3 -dimensional finite element (FE) model for studying brake squeal. Thus, its effect on disc brake squeal is only possible to investigate through experimental methods. In the present paper, wear over time at the pads interface is simulated using a modified wear rate formula. Confirmation of the proposed wear formula is made against experimental results. The surface topographies of two brand new pairs of brake pads are measured. The contact tests using pressure-indicating films are carried out in order to capture static pressure distributions. The same brake pads are tested under several <b>braking</b> <b>applications.</b> For each <b>braking</b> <b>application,</b> the static contact pressure distribution is measured.

40|$|Vehicle {{braking system}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most fundamental safety-critical systems in modern vehicles as its main purpose is to stop or decelerate the vehicle. The frictional heat generated during <b>braking</b> <b>application</b> can cause numerous negative effects on the brake assembly such as brake fade, premature wear, thermal cracks and disc thickness variation (DTV). In the past, surface roughness and wear at the pad interface have rarely been considered in studies of thermal analysis of a disc brake assembly using finite element method. This paper attempts to consider these two aspects to predict temperature distributions in a reduced disc brake model. First, two different brake pad interface models, i. e., smooth and rough surfaces are modelled and simulated. Temperature distributions in these two models are then compared. Next, the thermal analysis is performed with the effect of wear at three different <b>braking</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R

40|$|Drivers {{classified}} by sex, accident history, and driving exposure drove a 50 -km route in an instrumented car. Run time, speed changes, fine and coarse steering-wheel reversals, ac-celerator and <b>brake</b> <b>applications,</b> lateral accelerations, gear changes, traffic-free speed, signals, and overtaking were recorded. Aggression and anxiety tests were also administered, and discriminant {{analyses were performed}} on the results. In general, the personality variables did not discriminate between driver groupings. With regard to driving variables, however, significant and important discriminations between groups were made. Accident-involved drivers drove more quickly on clear roads, moved about more, and overtook in traffic. When moderate-exposure drivers were examined, both female and male accident-free drivers were typified by relatively low mean clear speed, infrequent overtaking, and frequently being overtaken. In addition, accident-free females used the brakes relatively infrequently. Acci-dent-free males did not move the car about in traffic. Overall, high-exposure male drivers tended to drive relatively quickly, but those who were accident free were typified by adjusting their car to changing conditions (<b>brake</b> <b>applications,</b> gear changes, accelerator applications, and possibly coarse steering-wheel reversals) ...|$|R

2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during <b>brake</b> <b>application.</b> [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E
