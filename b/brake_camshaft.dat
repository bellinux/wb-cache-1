50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the <b>brake</b> <b>camshaft.</b> Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Equipment {{as built}} {{included}} load sensing [...] "Metacone" [...] air suspension, rheostatic braking, hydraulic parking <b>brake,</b> pneumatic <b>camshaft</b> control by GEC and Brush DC motors of type LT117, with each Dm car having four motors. Air supply was by Reavell reciprocating compressors and braking equipment was by Westinghouse. The guard's door controls {{were in the}} driver's cab; this eased conversion to one-man operation in 1983-4, the first LU line to do so.|$|R
2500|$|... 1927 saw the {{introduction}} of the six-cylinder Alvis 14.75 and this engine became the basis for the long line of luxurious six-cylinder Alvis cars produced up to the outbreak of the Second World War. These cars were elegant and full of technical innovations. Independent front suspension and the world's first all-synchromesh gearbox came in 1933 followed by servo assisted brakes. The Alvis 12/75 model was introduced in 1928, a model bristling with innovation, such as front-wheel drive, in-board <b>brakes,</b> overhead <b>camshaft</b> and, as an option, a Roots type supercharger.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of vehicle}} chassis system parts, especially tires and suspension parts {{is the most}} prominent activity in the industry. Electrical system components are another dominant product group with car batteries and wiring installations {{as the most important}} products. Also, the production of engine components, mostly cast, is very significant, along with forged and machined parts like <b>camshafts,</b> <b>brake</b> discs, valves and flywheels.|$|R
