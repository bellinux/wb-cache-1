50|$|An {{air mover}} systems serve {{the same purpose}} as <b>blower</b> <b>systems</b> at a lower cost. However, this type of system can only be used when {{there is little or}} no back {{pressure}} because they generate lower pressure and airflow. Air mover functionality is based on the Venturi effect. A small amount of high velocity air connected to the side of the casting passes out through a nozzle, creating venturi action. This effect causes a large volume of low velocity air to flow through the venturi and out of the air diffuser. The ratio of air supplied depends on the design of the air mover’s physical structure.|$|R

The development of the controller was designed using PIC controllers. Testing was being conducted to ensure the controller is fully operational. Next, the output data from the hot air <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> (HABS) was captured for analysis. Second, the research focused on the modeling of a hot air <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> using System Identification and Estimation approach. By obtaining the mathematical model of a hot air <b>blower</b> <b>system,</b> tuning can be made possible. The output data was being run on MATLAB to compare between several of model structures. Model structures selected for this research are Auto-Regressive with eXogeneous inputs (ARX), Auto-Regressive Moving-Average with eXogeneous inputs (ARMAX), Output Error (OE) and Box–Jenkins (BJ). Result shows the eXogeneous inputs (ARX) obtained the highest best fit which best resemble the dynamic system of a hot air <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> (HABS) and was selected to be implemented in the controllers.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a condition diagnosis method for a <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> using the rough sets, and a {{fuzzy neural network}} to detect faults and distinguish fault types. In order to solve the ambiguous problem between the symptoms and the fault types, the diagnosis knowledge for the training of the neural network is acquired by using the rough sets. The fuzzy neural network realized by partially-linearized neural network (PNN), which can automatically distinguish the faults. The PNN can quickly converge when learning, and can quickly and high-accurately distinguish fault types {{on the basis of}} the probability distributions of the machine conditions when diagnosing. The non-dimensional symptom parameters are also defined in frequency domain, and those parameters are processed by rough sets to sensitively diagnose machinery conditions. Practical examples of the diagnosis for a <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> are shown in order to verify the efficiency of the method proposed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a pallet loading dust control system designed to lower the dust exposure of workers during the bag stacking process at mineral processing facilities. The system makes bag stacking much easier because the pallet height remains constant throughout the entire bag stacking cycle {{through the use of}} a hydraulic lift table. The system uses a push-pull ventilation technique to capture the dust generated during bag stacking. A low-volume, high-velocity <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> operating at approximately 150 cfm blows a stream of air over the top layer of bags on the pallet. The <b>blower</b> <b>system</b> is composed of two 3 -in air jets (approximately 1, 200 -ftjmin velocity) directed toward an exhaust system on the opposite side of the pallet. As these air jets travel across the pallet, they entrain the dust generated during bag stacking. The exhaust ventilation system pulls approximately 2, 500 cfm of air and dust through the exhaust hood. This exhaust air can then be dumped into a baghouse ventilation system, or filtered before being discharged outside the mill. During a laboratory evaluation, a 70 -pct dust reduction was recorded for the bag stacker. The system was then evaluated in an actual working environment. The first field evaluation was performed at a silica sand operation in which one worker performed the entire loading and bag stacking process. This worker's dust exposure was lowered 76 pet when using the new pallet loading system. The second field evaluation showed only moderate dust reduction, but this was mainly attributed to an overriding problem associated with background dust and the cleanliness of the bags. From both the ergonomic and production standpoint, the system was well received by both the workforce and plant management...|$|E
