A handle is braided {{into the center of}} the rope and is usually stiffened with leather. One side of the rope is tied in an adjustable knot that can be changed for the size of bull. The other side of the rope (the tail) is a flat braid and is usually coated with rosin to keep it from sliding through the rider's hand. A metallic bell is strapped to the knot and hangs directly under the bull throughout the ride. In addition to the sound the bell produces, it also gives the rope some weight, allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted.|$|E

5000|$|In the American {{style of}} the sport, the rider must {{stay on top of}} the bucking bull while holding onto the <b>bull</b> <b>rope</b> with one hand for eight seconds and not {{touching}} the bull with his free hand. A <b>bull</b> <b>rope</b> is a fiber rope wrapped around the chest of the bull directly behind the bull's front legs, which the rider grips while riding. If he does that, it is a qualified ride. If he gets bucked off before eight seconds, it is a no score. In most bull riding circuits, four judges mark scores for the rider and the bull. Two judges score the rider based on his ability up to 25 points each for up to a total of 50 points. The other two judges score the bull on his bucking performance for up to 25 points each for a total of up to 50 points. Thus, the ride is scored up to 100 points.

50|$|Control of {{the bull}} may be done by holding the ring by hand, looping a piece of rope through it, {{clipping}} on a lead rope, or clipping on a stiff bull pole (<b>bull</b> staff). A <b>rope</b> or chain from the ring may be attached to a bull's horns or to a head-collar for additional control.|$|R
50|$|Judges award points {{based on}} several {{key aspects of}} the ride. Judges look for {{constant}} control and rhythm in the rider in matching their movements with the bull. Points are usually deducted if a rider is constantly off balance. For points actually to be awarded the rider must stay mounted {{for a minimum of}} 8 seconds, and they are scored only for actions during those 8 seconds. The ability to control the bull well allows riders to gain extra style points. These are often gained by spurring the animal. A rider is disqualified for touching the <b>bull,</b> the <b>rope,</b> or themselves with their free arm.|$|R

They were also used by Tatars and are still used by the Sami people and Finns in reindeer herding. In Mongolia, {{a variant of the}} lasso called an uurga (уурга) is used, consisting of a rope loop {{at the end of a}} long pole. Lassoes are also mentioned in the Greek Histories of Herodotus; seventh book. Polymnia 7.85 records: [...] "The wandering tribe known by the name of Sagartians- a people Persian in language, and in dress half Persian, half Pactyan, who furnished the army as many as eight thousand horse. It is not the wont of this people to carry arms, either of bronze or steel, except only a dirk; but they use lassoes made of thongs plaited together, and trust to these whenever they go to the wars. Now the manner in which they fight is the following: when they meet their enemy, straightway they discharge their lassoes, which end in a noose; then, whatever the noose encircles, be it man or be it horse, they drag towards them; and the foe, entangled in the toils, is forthwith slain. Such is the manner in which this people fight; and now their horsemen were drawn up with the Persians".|$|R

This <b>rope</b> is to encourage the bull to use its hind legs more in a bucking motion, as this is a true test of a rider's skill in maintaining the ride. If it is applied improperly a rider may request to ride again, as the bull will not buck well if the flank strap is too tight. The flank strap is applied by the stock contractor or his designate.|$|R

5000|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Triple H, The Rock, Mankind, Kane, Big Show and The Undertaker over the vacant WWF Championship. At SummerSlam, Mankind {{defeated}} Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H in a Triple Threat match for Austin's WWF title, only to lose it to Triple H the following night on Raw is War. On the September 13 edition of Raw is War, the WWF CEO Linda McMahon announced that Rock, Kane, Mankind, Big Show and Undertaker would compete in a 5-Way match to determine the #1 contender for the title at Unforgiven. However, the match resulted in a no contest after Mideon and Viscera attacked Mankind. As a result, all the five wrestlers attacked several WWF referees {{and many of the}} WWF wrestlers interfered in the brawl. As a result of the attack, the referees went on an on-screen strike and all the five competitors were named contenders for the title, making it a Six Pack Challenge for the title at Unforgiven, meaning that two wrestlers would begin the match and a wrestler could become legal if he was tagged in. On edition of September 16 of SmackDown!, the WWF Chairman Vince McMahon defeated Triple H for the WWF title, {{with the help of his}} son Shane who served as the special guest referee for the match. However, Vince vacated the title on September 20 episode of Raw is War and named Triple H as the sixth competitor in the Six Pack Challenge at Unforgiven. On the September 23, 1999 edition of SmackDown!, however, McMahon decided to place Triple H in a gauntlet series of matches against the other five competitors in the match. He would have to wrestle Big Show in a Chokeslam Challenge match, Kane in an inferno Match, Undertaker in a casket match, Mankind in a Boiler Room Brawl, and The Rock in a Brahma <b>Bull</b> <b>Rope</b> match, and if he failed to win three of the five matches, he would be out of the match. Triple H lost the first match due to his inability to lift the massive Big Show. He managed to beat Kane when Kane was distracted by Mideon and Viscera, Undertaker's allies, long enough to accidentally set himself on fire but lost the casket match after Undertaker, who orchestrated the distraction on Kane, walked out and was fired after refusing to wrestle; the match became a handicap match and Triple H could not put both Mideon and Viscera in a casket before they did it to him. He managed to escape the boiler room to even up the gauntlet and bring it to the deciding match with The Rock. The British Bulldog, who was named as a replacement for The Undertaker in the Six-Pack Challenge (kayfabe The Undertaker walked out of the WWF, but in reality he needed time off to deal with a severe groin injury and would be gone for nine months while he recovered), served as the guest referee and assisted Triple H's victory by turning on The Rock, giving Triple H the necessary three wins he needed to keep his spot in the main event.|$|E

The Livermore Collegiate Institute {{was founded in}} 1870, and the Union High School (later called Livermore High) graduated its first class of students in 1896. Petroleum was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive coal deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down, and the people rebuilt their homes and businesses nearer the railroad {{in what is now}} downtown Livermore. Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small bullring on many Sundays, and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted against a longhorn <b>bull.</b> Apparently, <b>roping</b> a grizzly was thought then to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, a bank, and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially incorporated by the state as a city on April 15, 1876, its original city limits being the line a block north of 1st Street on the north and Livermore Avenue (then Lizzie Street) on the east. The part of the west side north of 5th Street was bounded by Q Street, and the part of it south of 5th Street by I Street. The part of the south side east of I Street was bounded by 6th Street, and the part of it west of I Street by 5th Street.|$|R

Always moving forward, he mauled and wrestled Leonard, scoring inside with hooks and rights. For three rounds Durán drove at Sugar Ray with a fury, and there were moments when it seemed the fight could not last five. Unable to get away, unable to counter and unable to slide away {{to open up the}} ring, Leonard seemed almost helpless under the assault. Now and then he got loose and countered—left-right-left to Durán's bobbing head—but he missed punches and could not work inside, could not jab, could not mount an offense to keep Durán at bay.|$|R
