5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated he had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve.</b> The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd had not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E

As of 2006, the genre had become far less dominant, representing a two percentage market share as compared to fifteen percent in 1998, but is still commercially viable, with a number of games selling in the millions of units. Since 2010, a variety of endless running platformers for mobile devices have brought renewed popularity to the genre.|$|E

25|$|Just {{after the}} turn of the century, Hill {{returned}} to his native Wales and took over the captaincy of Cardiff Cricket Club. He also took on a large role off the field, organising fund-raising fixtures at Cardiff Arms Park, including an annual Gentlemen v Players match. Glamorgan benefited greatly both socially and financially from these fixtures, and it is likely that without Hill's work, Glamorgan would not have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> first-class status as early as 1921. During this time he was a partner in the firm W R Corfield and Co, ship managers and ship brokers. The partnership was formally dissolved on 1 June 1908, with William Reginald Corfield continuing the business on his own.|$|E
25|$|Many {{visitors}} {{came to him}} {{and some}} became his devotees. Kavyakantha Sri Ganapati Sastri, a Vedic scholar of repute in his age, with a deep knowledge of the Srutis, Sastras, Tantras, Yoga, and Agama systems, but lacking the personal darshan of Shiva, came to visit Ramana in 1907. After receiving upadesa from him on self-enquiry, he proclaimed him as Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. Ramana was known by this name from then on. Ganapati Sastri passed on these instructions to his own students, but later in life confessed {{that he had never}} <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> permanent Self-abidance. Nevertheless, he was highly valued by Ramana Maharshi and {{played an important role in}} his life.|$|E
25|$|Cost recovery. The {{accepted}} {{norm for}} cost recovery in urban {{water supply and}} sanitation in Yemen is for the tariff to be set such that the operation and maintenance costs are recovered at the least, with the government and donors financing investments. However, in some cases, such as Sana’a, credits by international donors are on-lent to the utility. A few utilities have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> full cost recovery. One example is the small town Bait al Faqih which has a new system and low losses, indicating a functional and efficient network, and no inherited staff and thus no overstaffing. Collection efficiency, the share of bills actually paid, increased from 60% in 1999 to 97% in 2007. However, in 2011 it declined again to about 60%.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Czerkas, Gregory S. Paul, {{and others}} {{have argued that the}} fact Microraptor could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid {{suggests}} that the Dromaeosauridae, including later and larger species such as Deinonychus, were secondarily flightless. The work of Xu and colleagues also suggested that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids were probably small, arboreal, and capable of gliding, although later discoveries of more primitive dromaeosaurids with short forelimbs unsuitable for gliding have cast doubt on this view. Work done on the question of flight ability in other paravians, however, showed that most of them probably would not have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> enough lift for powered flight, given their limited flight strokes and relatively smaller wings. These studies concluded that Microraptor probably evolved flight and its associated features (fused sternum, alula, etc.) independently of the ancestors of birds.|$|E
