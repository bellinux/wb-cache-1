5|$|Like most owls, {{the barn}} owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in {{complete}} darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and {{can sometimes be}} seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. In Britain, on various Pacific Islands and perhaps elsewhere, it sometimes hunts <b>by</b> <b>day.</b> This practice may depend on whether the owl is mobbed by other birds if it emerges in daylight. However, in Britain, some birds continue to hunt <b>by</b> <b>day</b> even when mobbed by such birds as magpies, rooks and black-headed gulls, such diurnal activity possibly occurring when the previous night has been wet making hunting difficult. By contrast, in southern Europe and the tropics, the birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal, with the few birds that hunt <b>by</b> <b>day</b> being severely mobbed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{birds are}} diurnal, but some birds, such as {{many species of}} owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during {{twilight}} hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, <b>by</b> <b>day</b> or night.|$|E

5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} <b>by</b> <b>Day</b> 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his acute asthma.

On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. <b>By</b> <b>Day</b> 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E
