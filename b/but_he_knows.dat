5|$|Keith interrogates Aaron {{and threatens}} him. Veronica and Clarence go into Amelia's boyfriend's room and Clarence dangles him off a window ledge, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> nothing. Weevil and Logan {{get into a}} fight at school, partly because of Logan's bail and partly because Logan has just bought Weevil's grandmother's house and kicked her out. Veronica is {{contacted}} by Amelia's friend, who says that the killer is actually a man named Carlos. Clarence decides to track down Carlos, {{despite the fact that}} he is a diplomat's son. Veronica lies to Abel Koontz about Amelia's fate to spare his feelings before his death. Keith goes inside the police station evidence room to examine the remains of the bus that mysteriously went off a cliff and finds the remains of a rat.|$|E
25|$|In {{the process}} of {{escaping}} we learn about the fundamental modes of motion and introduce basic quantum concepts. The message scroll is partially damaged, so David does not know who the space commander is, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{that he needs to}} get to the Cassini Space craft, because something bad will happen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} days, Terry lets {{it be known}} that he knows the ending to The Story. But the tale he tells during the final recess is {{different}} from the one Kennan outlined in his letter: Raul successfully breaks into the Wizard fortress, but half-frozen and overwhelmed by their technology, cannot overcome them. He is forced to escape aboard one of their flying craft. Dobby manages to wrench one arm free, but no more, while Gernisavien is securely fastened. They know their only course of action with Raul's defeat is to have Dobby smash some chemicals together. The resulting explosion levels the mountain. Raul is safely away when it happens, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that the explosion means that the quest is dead, for his friends perished with the key and knowledge necessary to reactivate the farcaster.|$|E

25|$|James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) {{have been}} best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, {{he is also}} boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of {{the events in the}} series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more {{sensible}} and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> Cook and Freddie will always take care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he {{is featured}} wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band [...] "Puscifer". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies [...] "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty <b>but...</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" [...] He also appears in episode 2.6, [...] "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop", {{as one of the}} viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying [...] "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appear in the [...] "music video sex scene" [...] on its DVD. Keenan appeared {{on the cover of the}} May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, [...] "Oh, Manson. He's a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there's so much gray area." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fred Vincy — [...] Rosamond's brother, who has loved Mary Garth from childhood. His family {{hopes that}} he will advance his class {{standing}} by becoming a clergyman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that Mary will not marry him if he does so. Brought up expecting an inheritance from his uncle Mr Featherstone, he is a spendthrift. He later changes because of his love for Mary, and finds, by studying under Mary's father, a profession through which he gains Mary's respect.|$|E

2500|$|Chibuzor of 360Nobs {{commented on}} the song saying: “This one is a feel good {{material}} by many standards, a song cutting across the various demographics and a potential hit given the needed plugging. The entire sounds and lyrical composition fuse in seamless beauty that oozes impeccability and style. Korede’s singing isn’t all that <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> his range and sticks to the script, another plus for the song. God Win is full of cheeriness and drive; a cool number, indigenous, original, repeat-worthy and all.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2016, Tim Craig {{writing for}} The Washington Post, {{described}} Sharif's {{move away from}} social conservatism as [...] "the shift in tone {{can be traced to}} Sharif's ambitious economic agenda, the influence his 42-year-old daughter has over him, and his awareness that Pakistan remains the butt of jokes, according to his friends, senior government officials and analysts". Afrasiab Khattak described Sharif's shift as [...] "Sharif may still be right-of-center, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> extremism is not good for business". Sharif's advisor Miftah Ismail described him as [...] "a very religious guy", adding however [...] "he is perfectly okay with other people not being religious". Writing for The Express Tribune in 2016, Fahd Hussain stated that Sharif will likely will face [...] "blowback from its natural allies among the clergy", adding that with [...] "the bulk of the Punjab conservative voter [...] in the Sharif camp", Sharif is eyeing for the [...] "liberal, progressive, left-of-centre voters".|$|E
2500|$|Don Fabrizio is {{a prince}} from a proud noble family {{of power and}} {{influence}} and a strict code of conduct and ritual. With the Italian [...] "Risorgimento" [...] the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples is under attack and as the people are generally {{in favor of the}} change so the Prince knows that he is the last Leopard - the last in his line, the last who will truly understand and adhere to the old ways, and he finds that the world that is coming is vulgar and distasteful. In his nephew Tancredi he sees a younger version of himself <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that Tancredi will need to in some ways accept the new power and the new ways for there to be any chance of saving some part of that older time. [...] "For everything to stay the same, everything must change" [...] says Tancredi and the Leopard sees there is some truth to this but he is nonetheless reluctant and goes through the motions but with little enthusiasm for it.|$|E
