500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical <b>bearing</b> <b>housing,</b> redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E

5000|$|Also called [...] "ball slides," [...] {{ball bearing}} slides {{are the most}} common type of linear slide. Ball bearing slides offer smooth {{precision}} motion along a single-axis linear design, aided by ball <b>bearings</b> <b>housed</b> in the linear base, with self-lubrication properties that increase reliability. Ball bearing slide applications include delicate instrumentation, robotic assembly, cabinetry, high-end appliances and clean room environments, which primarily serve the manufacturing industry but also the furniture, electronics and construction industries.

5000|$|To {{begin with}} lets {{consider}} a simulator which is fault free {{and is able}} generate controlled faults, it should possess three machine operating parameters, coupling types, amount of misalignment and the motor speed which will be systematically varied while all the other parameters will be held constant. The machine should be fault free {{with the exception of}} deliberate misalignment which is varied systematically. Therefore, baseline vibration data is recorded for each of the test conditions. Vibrations should be monitored via sensors which should be placed in strategic locations to get accurate data. The X, Y, Z coordinate system is used to show direction. For this experiment we can use three different stiffness couplings, four levels of offset should be used on the left <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> to simulate a combination of angular and parallel misalignment. Equivalent offset on the right <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> to get parallel misalignment. The experiment must contain four speeds of rotation and the goal here must be {{to determine the effects of}} coupling stiffness, level and type of misalignment and finally the speed of rotation on vibration spectra.|$|E
50|$|A stave bearing is {{a simple}} journal bearing where a shaft rotates in a <b>bearing</b> <b>housing.</b> Rather than the usual {{arrangement}} where the fixed part of the bearing surrounds most of the circumference of the shaft {{in one or two}} pieces, a stave bearing uses a large number of axial staves to support the shaft. A large housing is made with grooves running along the shaft, these grooves being filled with strips of suitable material, originally wood.|$|E
50|$|Finally, (as {{described}} {{within the}} abstract for US Patent 5257535), if the mechanical system involves {{a right angle}} gearbox, then the axial reaction force experienced by the inputting shaft/pinion {{can be related to}} the torque experienced by the output shaft(s).

50|$|A wire race bearing is a rolling-element bearing, {{where the}} balls or rollers run on races {{resembling}} loops of wire. Roller bearings may use just two races, but ball bearings typically use {{three or four}} races. Wire race bearings can be large yet lightweight and with small profile and good precision. Wire races have little intrinsic structure and must be adequately supported by the <b>bearing</b> <b>housing.</b> Balls, rollers or even cross rollers are used as rolling elements. Due to the design wire race bearings are commonly called '4-point-contact' bearings.|$|E

This Cobra had a footboard surface that was smoother, the <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> was redesigned, the cam shapes were altered slightly, and the baseplate came with a feature called the Cobra Coil. The Cobra coil was a spring mounted beneath the footboard that was supposed to increase speed and responsiveness.

50|$|While the EMU {{is solely}} {{intended}} for the microgravity environment, where weight is not an issue, the I-Suit's planetary role makes weight a critical factor. By replacing the EMU's fiberglass Hard Upper Torso (HUT) section with a soft upper torso, or SUT, and by using lightweight titanium in place of stainless steel for load-bearing metal components, the I-suit weighs only 65 pounds (29 kg) without its life support backpack or thermal/micrometeoroid layer, compared to 107 lbs (49 kg) for the EMU. The suit also features a graphite-epoxy shoulder <b>bearing</b> <b>housing,</b> demonstrating {{the use of this}} material in place of aluminum. Replacing all the suit's bearing housings with graphite-epoxy would save a further ten pounds (5 kg).|$|E
50|$|Oil whirl can be {{prevented}} by a stabilising force applied to the journal. A number of bearing designs seek to use bearing geometry to either provide an obstacle to the whirling fluid or to provide a stabilising load to minimize whirl. One such is called the lemon bore or elliptical bore. In this design, shims are installed between {{the two halves of}} the <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> and then the bore is machined to size. After the shims are removed, the bore resembles a lemon shape, which decreases the clearance in one direction of the bore and increases the pre-load in that direction. The disadvantage of this design is its lower load carrying capacity, as compared to typical journal bearings. It is also still susceptible to oil whirl at high speeds, however its cost is relatively low.|$|E

40|$|The article {{observes the}} amount of {{vibration}} on the <b>bearing</b> <b>house</b> of a turning lathe selected in advance through the change of the revolutions per minute and {{the thickness of the}} removed material in frontal type of lathe processing. Increase in mechanical vibration values depending on the value of nominal thickness of splinter was observed during changing technological parameters of the drilling process as a consequence of rotation speed of the motor. The vibration acceleration amplitude course changes depending on the frequencies are evaluated together for 400, 800 and 1200 motor r/min. A piezoelectric sensor of the type 4507 B- 004 from the Brüel & Kjaer Company was used for monitoring the frequency analysis of the vibration, which was attached to the <b>bearing</b> <b>house</b> of the lathe TOS SV 18 RB. The vibration signal measured during the processing and during the time period is transformed through the means of a quick Fourier transformation to the frequency spectrum in the range of 3. 0 – 10. 0 [*]kHz. Measured values of vibration acceleration amplitude were processed and evaluated by the SignalExpress software. Graphical abstract Unwanted vibration in machine tools like lathe {{is one of the main}} problems as it affects the quality of the machined parts and tool life and creates noise during machining operation.
