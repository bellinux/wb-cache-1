25|$|Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers {{typically}} involves {{looking for}} {{attacks against the}} block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack</b> against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying {{approximately half of the}} possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.|$|E
25|$|In December, 2012, William Cheswick {{wrote an}} article {{published}} in ACM magazine that included the mathematical possibilities of how easy or difficult it would be to break passwords that are constructed using the commonly recommended, and sometimes followed, standards of today. In his article, William showed that a standard eight character alpha-numeric password could withstand a <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack</b> of ten million attempts per second, and remain unbroken for 252 days. Ten million attempts each second is the acceptable rate of attempts using a multi-core system that most users would have access to. A much greater degree of attempts, at the rate of 7 billion per second, could also be achieved when using modern GPUs. At this rate, the same 8 character alpha-numeric password could be broken in approximately 30 seconds. Increasing the password complexity to a 13 character alpha-numeric password increases the time needed to crack it to more than 900,000 years at 7 billion attempts per second. This is, of course, assuming the password does not use a common word that a dictionary attack could break much sooner. Using a password of this strength reduces the obligation to change it as often as many organizations require, including the U.S. Government, as it could not be reasonably broken in such a short period of time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} instance, {{breaking}} the scheme {{is even more}} straightforward. Since {{there are only a}} limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack.</b> One way to do this is to write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts – a technique sometimes known as [...] "completing the plain component". The example given is for the ciphertext [...] "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter. This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.|$|E

2500|$|Information theory {{leads us}} to believe {{it is much more}} {{difficult}} to keep secrets than it might first appear. [...] A <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack</b> can break systems based on asymmetric key algorithms or on most commonly used methods of symmetric key algorithms (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as block ciphers. [...] The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.|$|E
2500|$|Several secret-sharing schemes {{are said}} to be information-theoretically secure and can be proven to be so, while others give up this {{unconditional}} security for improved efficiency while maintaining enough security to be considered as secure as other common cryptographic primitives. [...] For example, they might allow secrets to be protected by shares with 128-bits of entropy each, since each share would be considered enough to stymie any conceivable present-day adversary, requiring a <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack</b> of average size 2127.|$|E
2500|$|In cryptanalysis, entropy {{is often}} roughly {{used as a}} measure of the unpredictability of a {{cryptographic}} key. For example, a 128-bit key that is uniformly randomly generated has 128 bits of entropy. It also takes (on average) [...] guesses to break by brute force. However, entropy fails to capture the number of guesses required if the possible keys are not chosen uniformly. Instead, a measure called guesswork can be used to measure the effort required for a <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Even if DES {{encryption}} is used, as of 2009, 56-bit DES {{is widely}} considered to be obsolete and is subject to <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attacks</b> well within the capabilities of consumer-grade computer equipment.|$|R
30|$|In this algorithm, {{besides the}} control {{parameter}} and initial {{condition of the}} piecewise nonlinear chaotic map, {{the parameters of the}} one-dimensional chaotic map are chosen as the secret keys. From the security point of view, the key space for a cryptographic algorithm should not be less than 2128 in order to resist <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attacks</b> [48, 49]. If the precision 10 - 14 is used, the key space size for two coupling parameters, three initial conditions, and three control parameters of the chaotic map is over 2279, so the key space is very large to resist all kinds of <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R

2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message. Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack,</b> but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, {{as compared to the}} effort needed {{to make use of the}} cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., [...] "work factor", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method to}} read encrypted data without actually decrypting it is a <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack</b> - simply attempting every number, {{up to the}} maximum length of the key. Therefore, {{it is important to}} use a sufficiently long key length; longer keys take exponentially longer to attack, rendering a <b>brute</b> <b>force</b> <b>attack</b> impractical. Currently, key lengths of 128 bits (for symmetric key algorithms) and 1024 bits (for public-key algorithms) are common.|$|E
