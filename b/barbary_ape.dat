"Behold {{yourself}} in this mirror, then; it is a Venetian mirror from Murano, the true nosce teipsum, as I have named it, compared {{with which the}} finest mirror of steel or silver is mere darkness. See now, how by diligent shaving, the nether region of your face may preserve its human outline, instead of presenting no distinction from the physiognomy of a bearded owl or a <b>Barbary</b> <b>ape.</b> I have seen men whose beards have so invaded their cheeks, that one might have pitied them as the victims of a sad, brutalising chastisement befitting our Dante's Inferno, {{if they had not}} seemed to strut with a strange triumph in their extravagant hairiness." ...|$|E
60|$|When he had {{had enough}} of this it {{occurred}} to Loveday that he might get into the house in spite of the locked doors; and by entering the garden, placing a pole from the fork of an apple-tree to the window-sill of a bedroom on that side, and climbing across like a <b>Barbary</b> <b>ape,</b> he entered the window and stepped down inside. There was something anomalous in being close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his father, and its silent, impassive shine was not cheering; it was as if his relations were all dead, and only their tables and chests of drawers left to greet him. He went downstairs and seated himself in the dark parlour. Finding this place, too, rather solitary, and the tick of the invisible clock preternaturally loud, he unearthed the tinder-box, obtained a light, and set about making the house comfortable for his father's return, divining that the miller had gone out to meet him by the wrong road.|$|E

6000|$|The {{master of}} the {{household}} heard them all for some time, and then, motioning for universal silence, he addressed them with all the dignity of Malvolio himself.--"My masters,--not forgetting you, my mistresses,--do not think the worse of me that I proceed with as much care as haste in this matter. Our master is a gallant knight, and will have his sway at home and abroad, in wood and field, in hall and bower, as the saying is. Our Lady, my benison upon her, is also a noble person of long descent, and rightful heir of this place and barony, and she also loves her will; as for that matter, show me the woman who doth not. Now, she hath favoured, doth favour, and will favour, this jack-an-ape,--for what good part about him I know not, save that as one noble lady will love a messan dog, and another a screaming popinjay, and a third a <b>Barbary</b> <b>ape,</b> so doth it please our noble dame to set her affections upon this stray elf of a page, for nought that I can think of, save that she--was {{the cause of his}} being saved (the more's the pity) from drowning." [...] And here Master Wingate made a pause.|$|E
60|$|The Cebus azarae,[11] when rejoiced at again {{seeing a}} beloved person, utters a {{peculiar}} tittering (kichernden) sound. It also expresses agreeable sensations, by drawing back {{the corners of}} its mouth, without producing any sound. Rengger calls this movement laughter, {{but it would be}} more appropriately called a smile. The form of the mouth is different when either pain or terror is expressed, and high shrieks are uttered. Another species of Cebus in the Zoological Gardens (C. hypoleucus) when pleased, makes a reiterated shrill note, and likewise draws back the corners of its mouth, apparently through the contraction of the same muscles as with us. So does the <b>Barbary</b> <b>ape</b> (Inuus ecaudatus) to an extraordinary degree; and I observed in this monkey that the skin of the lower eyelids then became much wrinkled. At the same time it rapidly moved its lower jaw or lips in a spasmodic manner, the teeth being exposed; but the noise produced was hardly more distinct than that which we sometimes call silent laughter. Two of the keepers affirmed that this slight sound was the animal's laughter, and when I expressed some doubt on this head (being at the time quite inexperienced), they made it attack or rather threaten a hated Entellus monkey, living in the same compartment. Instantly the whole expression of the face of the Inuus changed; the mouth was opened much more widely, the canine teeth were more fully exposed, and a hoarse barking noise was uttered.|$|E
60|$|Life those chaps {{out there}} must have, {{stuck in the}} same spot. Irish Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and {{breeches}} buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing {{them up in the}} air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old <b>Barbary</b> <b>ape</b> that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. Buenas noches, señorita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.|$|E

50|$|Another {{version of}} the {{nickname}} rationale was that the German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels heard the legend that, if the <b>barbary</b> <b>apes</b> on the Rock of Gibraltar ever left, the British Empire would crumble. At that stage of the war, when things were not going well for the Axis forces, he decided that a propaganda coup was required and reportedly sent a commando raid to eradicate the apes. The story goes that Winston Churchill heard of the mission and immediately tasked the RAF Regiment with protecting the apes, and thus the nickname was born.|$|R
50|$|The Barbary macaque {{population}} in Gibraltar {{is the only}} wild monkey {{population in}} the European continent.

As they are a tailless species, they are also known locally as <b>Barbary</b> <b>apes</b> or rock apes, despite being monkeys (Macaca sylvanus). The local people simply refer to them as monos (monkeys) when conversing in Spanish or Llanito (the local vernacular).|$|R

This grouping comprises the two families Hylobatidae, the lesser apes or gibbons, and Hominidae, the great apes, including orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, Homo, and related extinct genera, such as the prehuman australopithecines and the giant orangutan relative Gigantopithecus.|$|E

60|$|A {{troop of}} {{handsome}} Egyptians--as the gipsies were termed in those days--then advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross-legs, in a circle, {{began to play}} softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to the tune, and humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air. When they caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, {{and some of them}} looked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the market- place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody. So they played on very gently and just touching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and their heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep. Suddenly, with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro's hand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet and whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and chaunting some wild love-song in their strange guttural language. Then at another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay there quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound that broke the silence. After that they had done this several times, they disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear by a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little <b>Barbary</b> <b>apes.</b> The bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity, and the wizened apes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to be their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and fired off guns, and went through a regular soldier's drill just like the King's own bodyguard. In fact the gipsies were a great success.|$|R

5000|$|According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, {{the word}} [...] "monkey" [...] may {{originate}} in a German {{version of the}} Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580.

5000|$|... "Ape", from Old English apa, {{is a word}} of {{uncertain}} origin. The {{term has}} a history of rather imprecise usage—and of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular. Its earliest meaning was generally of any non-human anthropoid primate, as is still the case for its cognates in other Germanic languages. Later, after the term [...] "monkey" [...] had been introduced into English, [...] "ape" [...] was specialized to refer to a tailless (therefore exceptionally human-like) primate. Two tailless species of macaque still have common names using [...] "ape": the <b>Barbary</b> <b>ape</b> of North Africa (introduced into Gibraltar), Macaca sylvanus, and the Sulawesi black ape or Celebes crested macaque, M. nigra.
