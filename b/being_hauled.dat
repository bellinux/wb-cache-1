5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
25|$|When Nonsuch was <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> into dock in December 1802 at Sulkea (opposite Calcutta), an {{accident}} occurred. She was so damaged {{that decision was}} taken to condemn her rather repair her; she was subsequently broken up.|$|E
50|$|In 1994/95 {{all were}} repainted by A Goninan & Co, Taree into FreightCorp blue. By October 1997 18 had been {{withdrawn}} from service with cracked frames. By this stage {{the amount of}} work requiring electrics was reducing. National Rail decided it would through haul its services and from March 1998 FreightCorp ceased operating them on Main Northern line services. The need for electrics continued to decline with their remaining duties mainly <b>being</b> <b>hauling</b> coal trains from Lithgow to Port Kembla. The last examples were withdrawn in June 2002.|$|R

25|$|Most {{heritage}} railways {{only have}} short lines {{and do not}} often have turntables {{at both ends of}} the line. A tank locomotive has good visibility for the driver in both directions. As the trains <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> are usually light, the tank locomotive is more fuel efficient than a large tender locomotive.|$|E
25|$|The trawler Koraaga {{continued}} to work hard but returned early to Sydney late on Wednesday 2 October 1929 with a broken foremast. As early on the Tuesday, morning, when the ship was 28 miles south of Cape Everard, the mast broke about 10 feet from the deck, under the strain of a trawl full of fish which was <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> in. No one was injured.|$|E
25|$|Providences {{last years}} were spent tied up at Briggs Wharf, Newport. In {{the autumn of}} 1901, the vessel was sold for scrap and towed to Boston for dismantling. After the removal of her {{furnishings}} and machinery, Providence suffered the typical fate of wooden steamers of her time by <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> onto a beach and burned in order to recover the remaining brass, copper, and other metal fittings.|$|E
25|$|The RPSI also {{acquired}} some Mark 2s {{for use in}} its steam hauled {{train in}} Northern Ireland in the early 2000s (decade). These are normally based at the RPSI's Whitehead depot, as well as <b>being</b> steam <b>hauled</b> they are also occasionally hired out for diesel hauled railtours. They also have some ex-NIR and ex-CIE Mk2 stock, some of which formerly operated on the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise service.|$|R
50|$|When {{attacking a}} kite balloon, a {{two-seater}} guarding it advanced to engage him; Lieut. Gillett shot the machine down, and, {{turning to the}} balloon, which was <b>being</b> rapidly <b>hauled</b> down, he dropped two bombs at the winch and fired a drum into the balloon, which deflated but did not catch fire. In addition to this two-seater, this officer has accounted for two other machines and a kite balloon.|$|R
50|$|Tender-first operations, minimalist {{maintenance}} and limited expertise led to problems with W901 in later years, {{with a number}} of trains <b>being</b> diesel <b>hauled,</b> or supported by small diesel power. Following the last train, W901 was left full of water, causing concern regarding the condition of her boiler. Former Steamtown Peterborough Railway Preservation Society members, including those involved with the recommissioning, undertook minor works in 2006 to minimise further deterioration.|$|R
25|$|The Torpoint ferry {{had been}} in {{operation}} since at least 1834, having been developed by J M Rendel. Moorsom appears not to have given much thought to the practicalities of using the crossing, which would have involved through trains being divided and each portion then being propelled down a very steep gradient onto the ferry boat; and each portion <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> up a steep gradient and re-formed on the other side.|$|E
25|$|In the 1996 Western Conference Semi-finals {{against the}} Chicago Blackhawks, Jeremy Roenick {{was stopped by}} Roy on a {{break-away}} during overtime in Game 4, while apparently <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> down by Avalanche defenceman Sandis Ozolinsh. The referees did not call for a penalty shot on the play and the Avalanche won in triple overtime on Joe Sakic's game-winning goal. Earlier in Game 3, Roenick scored on an unchallenged breakaway to tie the score at 3 and send the game to overtime; and the Blackhawks ended up winning.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Thameslink began hiring four Class 317/1 {{units from}} WAGN {{to allow it}} to run {{additional}} Bedford to Moorgate services. Unlike when units were hired to LTS Rail, specific units were not involved. Instead, units were still maintained by WAGN and only hired for a fortnight. Two units each week were transferred in each direction, generally <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> over the non-electrified route by two Class 31 locomotives provided by Fragonset Railways or Class 47 locomotives with barrier vehicles {{at either end of the}} Class 317.|$|E
50|$|During 1904, all six {{locomotives}} were upgraded by the CSAR {{by having}} their cylinder diameter increased by 1 in, which improved their hauling capacity by 15%. This {{resulted in the}} engines <b>being</b> able to <b>haul</b> the same load as a 7th Class locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|While at Soni, Cunningham perpetrated {{sexual abuse}} {{that made the}} school, {{according}} to one pupil, [...] "a loveless, violent and sad hellhole".

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{they also had}} to haul heavy {{excursion}} trains of up to 50 axles from Dresden into Saxon Switzerland. Finally, the engines were used for commuter services around Dresden and there are even records of them <b>being</b> used to <b>haul</b> Leig trains.|$|R
25|$|The {{first years}} of the 20th century saw on the VR (as {{elsewhere}} in the world) a considerable increase in both the amount of traffic and the size and weight of rolling stock <b>being</b> <b>hauled.</b> In 1907, the DD class was supplanted by the much larger and more powerful A2 class on principal mainline services. However, with their light axle load (just 12 t 10 cwt in their original form), they were quickly reassigned to the VR's branchline network, where they became a fixture for the next fifty years.|$|E
25|$|Crops grown include {{traditional}} {{arable crops}} seen {{elsewhere in the}} country but also include rape seed, turf and sugar beet. The last was a familiar sight <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> by tractor in large open-top trailers to York, where it was used by firms such as Nestlé and, until its closure in 2007, British Sugar. Job cuts have reduced the acreage of this crop, although feasibility studies have shown that sugar beet could be used commercially to produce cleaner car fuel. Pocklington is bisected by the largely culverted Pocklington Beck, a small brook that feeds into the Pocklington Canal. The beck and canal are usually good fishing grounds but a sewerage overflow in 2003 killed thousands of fish and severely damaged the ecosystem, from which it is now recovered.|$|E
25|$|Nonsuch was {{launched}} at Calcutta in 1781 {{as the first}} large vessel built there. She was designed to serve as either a merchantman or a man-of-war. She spent the first 12 years of {{her career as a}} merchant vessel, carrying opium to China amongst other cargoes. After the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 her owner frequently hired her out as an armed ship to the British East India Company (EIC). She participated in an engagement with a French naval squadron and recaptured an East Indiaman. She also made two voyages for the EIC. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802 the EIC paid her off; as she was <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> into a dockyard for repairs she was damaged and the decision was taken to break her up.|$|E
50|$|The AFC soon {{established}} a similar post {{to trade with}} the Crow on the Yellowstone. In 1832, the paddle steamer Yellowstone {{was the first to}} reach Fort Union.

500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp. In 1907 a miner died in a shotfiring incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main winding engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} main shaft and trapping 350men underground. All managed to reach a smaller shaft [...] away and were subsequently brought safely to the surface.|$|E
500|$|All Hands on the Bad One was {{released}} on May 2, 2000, by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars, which also released the band's previous two albums. The album cover features a photo of Brownstein <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> off a dance floor. According to Weiss, [...] "She worked herself into a frenzy and passed out. People are laughing in the background because she's wearing a bunny suit." [...] All Hands on the Bad One reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart, #12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, and #5 on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart for 2000. The band promoted the album with a tour across North America and England, featuring old and new songs. The band also did the set-up and sold merchandise themselves. As of August 2002, the album has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of February 2015, All Hands on the Bad One has sold 98,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|The engines {{were placed}} in service on {{mainline}} passenger service between Cape Town and Touws River, where they remained until the loads became too heavy for them.

500|$|The {{earliest}} agreements were {{reached with}} the LNWR. In 1849 an {{agreement was reached}} where LNWR traffic could work over the NSR system but in exchange {{a certain amount of}} the LNWR London trains had to be routed via Stoke. These Manchester to London Euston restaurant car expresses were unique in often <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> by NSR tank engines from Manchester to Stoke-on-Trent where the LNWR express engines took over for the run via Stone, Sandon, Colwich, and the main line to London Euston. The NSR received a payment for every through passenger on these trains and employed a small army of ticket inspectors to examine and clip (with its distinctive 'P' clip) every ticket during the Stoke-on-Trent station stop. The agreement did give the NSR access to destinations such as Llandudno, Manchester, Stafford, Wolverhampton and Buxton. NSR goods trains were able to run to places such as Liverpool and Rugby. [...] The LNWR also used running rights over the Uttoxeter–Ashbourne line to run through coaches from Buxton to London via Nuneaton. As well as the running power agreements with the LNWR there was a very short joint line of [...] at Middlewood and three jointly owned stations; Ashbourne, Colwich and Macclesfield Goods.|$|E
500|$|The AO went {{bankrupt}} {{a few years}} later and was bought by another startup railroad, the Kansas City & Memphis Railroad (KC) in early 1911. It would build from Cave Springs, a few miles west of Rogers, through Fayetteville and towards Memphis, Tennessee. In 1912 the Ozark Land and Lumber Company began construction of a 5-mile extension east of Monte Ne from the White River to the Piney community and leased the line to the KC [...] The White River bridge consisted of 780 feet of trestle and 2,152foot steel spans, making it the longest railroad bridge in Benton County. This extension was used to haul out forestry products. The KC entered receivership in 1914, and in September of that year passenger service to Monte Ne ended. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, many railroads were seized by the United States government. The KC was not seized, and due to unfavorable rulings by the United States Railroad Administration and Arkansas Railroad Commission saw much of its revenue evaporate. In January 1918 Roscoe Hobbs, one of the court-appointed receivers of the KC, went to Washington, D.C. to provide testimony to the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the effects of these decisions on small railroads. As part of that testimony Hobbs reported 215 cars from the Rogers White Lime Company and 216 cars of pit props and railroad ties <b>being</b> <b>hauled</b> on the Monte Ne portion of the railway in 1917. Hobbs was unsuccessful in having the decisions reversed, and most portions of the KC were abandoned by October 1918. The Monte Ne portion was used until 1919. The White River bridge survived longer and was used for horse and foot traffic before becoming unsafe. The steel spans were scrapped during World War II.|$|E
