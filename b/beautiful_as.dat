5|$|In 1980 Chrisye {{appeared}} in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As <b>Beautiful</b> <b>as</b> the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS {{that it would be}} fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical.|$|E

5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as <b>beautiful</b> <b>as</b> any of them.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and <b>beautiful</b> <b>as</b> wealth and skill could make them.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as <b>beautiful</b> <b>as</b> Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|Raven, {{thinking}} McCoy is {{attracted to}} her in her natural form, tells him {{not to use the}} cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is <b>beautiful</b> <b>as</b> she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain.|$|E
