5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison <b>before</b> <b>my</b> trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I felt that I was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E

25|$|Meantime, I {{had found}} me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, <b>before</b> <b>my</b> windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower {{walked up and down}} with his traffic.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die <b>before</b> <b>my</b> own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Concerned at the {{decaying}} {{state of}} the building, King James I appointed England's first classical architect, Inigo Jones, to restore the building. The poet Henry Farley records the king comparing himself to the building at the commencement {{of the work in}} 1621: [...] "I have had more sweeping, brushing and cleaning than in forty years <b>before.</b> <b>My</b> workmen looke like him they call Muldsacke after sweeping of a chimney." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment <b>before</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{turning to}} acting, Behan {{had a brief}} career in journalism in Ireland: [...] "I interviewed {{everyone}} from priests to prostitutes <b>before</b> <b>my</b> Dublin paper folded." [...] Behan was also involved in theatre work [...] he was a costume assistant during the original production of Tom Murphy's adaptation of Liam O'Flaherty's 1925 novel The Informer on 13 October 1981 at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin. He participated in various other plays in Dublin, but finding them [...] "all very over the top, very amateurish, full of people turning up drunk or not turning up at all", he decided to leave Ireland and pursue art studies in Berlin.|$|E
500|$|Later in the year, Lynott {{went on a}} solo {{tour and}} {{released}} his second solo album, which did not sell particularly well. Snowy White left the band in August 1982, having tired of the disorganised schedules and Lynott's drug problems, although {{by his own admission}} he was too restrained and quiet to fit in well with his more raucous bandmates. White went on to achieve top ten chart success in the UK with his single [...] "Bird of Paradise" [...] in 1983. Long-time co-manager Chris O'Donnell also left at this time, later stating, [...] "A once-brilliant band was turning to crap <b>before</b> <b>my</b> very eyes." ...|$|E

He wrote:Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draughtfor their young, not noble ladies. And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs;for injustice is the worst of crimes.And spare the honey which the bees get industriouslyfrom the flowers of fragrant plants;For they did not store it that it might belong to others,Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts.I washed my hands of all this; and wish that IPerceived my way <b>before</b> <b>my</b> hair went gray! ...|$|E
500|$|When Catherine had {{realized}} Francis {{was going to}} die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, Charles IX, {{in return for the}} release of his brother Condé. As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (gouvernante de France), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: [...] "My principal aim is to have the honour of God <b>before</b> <b>my</b> eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from her}} work with Clue and Jay-Z, Carey's {{longtime}} friend and background singer Trey Lorenz also {{took part in the}} song's production. He provided the back-up vocals in the song, and took part in several small areas of the development of Rainbow. When interviewed by Bronson, Carey spoke highly of Lorenz, [...] "He's an amazing writer and singer, he's so influenced by the old school stuff, yet he's so current. He's known me since <b>before</b> <b>my</b> first album, and he's a great, loyal friend." [...] Aside from the use of the sample and Jay-Z's verses, [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] contains strong female-empowering lyrics, which Carey wrote as a sort of anthem, especially because she felt that she personally has been in a similar predicament in the past.|$|E

500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: [...] "I saw the whole piece immediately <b>before</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just <b>before</b> <b>my</b> last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E
500|$|Coward won new {{popularity}} in several notable films {{later in his}} career, such as Around the World in 80 Days (1956), Our Man in Havana (1959), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), Boom! (1968) and The Italian Job (1969). Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of Pygmalion (two years <b>before</b> <b>My</b> Fair Lady was written), and offers of {{the roles of the}} king in the original stage production of The King and I, and Colonel Nicholson in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film Dr. No, he replied, [...] "No, no, no, a thousand times, no." [...] In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in Lolita, saying, [...] "At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a sweet little old lady." ...|$|E
