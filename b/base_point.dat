5|$|Ballast Point got {{its name}} from the {{practice}} of ships discarding their ballast there on arriving in San Diego Bay and taking on ballast as they left for the open ocean. Fort Guijarros was constructed at Ballast Point in 1797. Ballast Point and La Playa are now on the grounds of Naval <b>Base</b> <b>Point</b> Loma.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this table are straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, because any <b>base</b> <b>point</b> preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, which has the same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E

5000|$|Multiple <b>basing</b> <b>points</b> is {{a method}} of {{regional}} pricing in milk marketing orders that would allow more than one <b>basing</b> <b>point,</b> or surplus area, to be used. Surplus areas are administratively defined as areas with low Class I utilization, meaning that a relatively {{small percentage of the}} milk produced in an area is used in that area as Class I (fluid) milk. In a multiple <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system, the order used as the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> has the smallest Class I differential (the difference between the Class I price and the Class III price). The Class I differential for other orders is then based on transportation costs to the nearest <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> plus the minimum differential. Pricing now largely reflects the Upper Midwest as the only <b>basing</b> <b>point,</b> even though the northeast and southwest are surplus areas.|$|R

5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1964 New Year Honours for his work introducing aircraft and weapons systems into the Air Force, including two overseas missions for aircraft and equipment selection. In December 1964 {{he was promoted to}} air commodore, and the following year attended the Imperial Defence College in London.

5|$|In April 1945, {{after months}} of {{lobbying}} by Potts—who was keen {{to get back into}} action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign—the 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island, where the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the island where they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, <b>Base</b> <b>Point</b> 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley. Over {{the course of the next}} three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E
5|$|The {{longtime}} {{association of}} San Diego with the U.S. military began in Point Loma. The southern {{portion of the}} Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852. Over the next several decades the Army set {{up a series of}} coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans. Significant U.S. Navy presence in San Diego began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma. The Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego was commissioned in 1921 and the San Diego Naval Training Center in 1923, both in Point Loma; the Naval Training Center was closed in 1997. During World War II the entire southern portion of the peninsula was closed to civilians and used for military purposes, including a battery of coast artillery. Following the war the area retained multiple Navy commands, including a submarine base and a Naval Electronics Laboratory; they were eventually consolidated into Naval <b>Base</b> <b>Point</b> Loma. Other portions of Fort Rosecrans became Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and Cabrillo National Monument.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> is a {{geographical}} site {{used to establish}} minimum fluid milk prices for federal milk marketing orders. Generally, minimum fluid farm milk prices increase according to {{the distance from the}} <b>basing</b> <b>point.</b> When federal milk marketing orders began in the 1930s, Eau Claire, Wisconsin was viewed as the principal surplus milk production region in the nation and hence served as the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> for most milk priced under federal milk marketing orders. Generally, the further a region is from the Upper Midwest, the higher that region’s minimum price for fluid farm milk. Some have argued that there currently are other surplus production regions in the country (e.g., in the northeast and southwest) which should serve as <b>basing</b> <b>points.</b> An attempt by USDA to establish a pricing structure using multiple <b>basing</b> <b>points</b> was thwarted by legislation in 1999.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{consider}} {{the implications of}} game-theoretic models for the competitive or collusive nature of <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> pricing.

40|$|Abstract. We {{extend to}} the toric case two methods for {{computing}} the implicit equation of a rational parameterized surface. The first approach gives an exact determinantal formula for the implicit equation if the parameterization has no <b>base</b> <b>points.</b> In the case the <b>base</b> <b>points</b> are isolated local complete intersections, we show that the implicit equation can still be recovered by computing any non-zero maximal minor of this matrix. The second method is the toric extension of the method of moving surfaces, and involves finding linear and quadratic relations (syzygies) among the input polynomials. When there are no <b>base</b> <b>points,</b> we show that these can be put together into a square matrix whose determinant is the implicit equation.
