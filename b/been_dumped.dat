5|$|Mercury was {{ingested}} {{through the}} consumption of homemade bread, meat and other animal products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread {{is thought to have}} been the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.|$|E
5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> {{over the years to}} form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending thousands of tons of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh {{on a tour of the}} disaster site.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E

The Queensland Government's steam yacht Lucinda <b>was</b> <b>dumped</b> on 28 January 1937.|$|R
50|$|The first {{conclusive}} locomotive dumpings {{to occur}} at Omoto began in 1957 and continued up to 1961. However, {{it is believed}} that the dumpings started at an earlier date, as LA 312 <b>was</b> <b>dumped</b> in 1929, while the remains of P 135 <b>were</b> <b>dumped</b> in 1933. However, large scale <b>dumping</b> <b>is</b> not known to have started until 1957 when a number of withdrawn locomotives, components of locomotives, and withdrawn wagons of various classes <b>were</b> <b>dumped</b> there.|$|R
50|$|Minerals {{that were}} once thought of as gangue, and <b>were</b> <b>dumped,</b> may later find a {{commercial}} use. When this happens the old <b>dumps</b> <b>are</b> often reworked to extract the wanted mineral. For example, in copper mines in the 19th century the mineral arsenopyrite <b>was</b> <b>dumped</b> until arsenic became popular as an insecticide later in the century.|$|R
5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come {{under the control of the}} Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{two months}} later, on March 4, two men {{gathering}} brush near Fredericksburg discovered the decomposing body of Carroll Jackson in a ditch. He {{had been shot}} in the back of the head. His hands were also tied behind his back. Upon recovering the body, police discovered that Carroll had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> over that of eighteen-month-old Janet Jackson; it was later determined that the child had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> alive in the ditch before her father, and had suffocated under the weight of his body. On March 21, the bodies of Mildred and Susan Jackson were discovered in a forest near Annapolis, showing signs of torture and pre-mortem sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, a {{freshwater}} crocodile {{was seen}} in a river near the desert town of Birdsville, hundreds of kilometres south of their normal range. A local ranger suggested that years of flooding may have washed the animal south, or it may have <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> as a juvenile.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the massive}} tsunami of December 2004, {{there have also}} emerged {{allegations}} that after {{the outbreak of the}} Somali Civil War in the late 1980s, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste. The huge waves that battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tons of nuclear and toxic waste that might have <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> illegally in the country by foreign firms.|$|E

From the beginning, investigators believed the child had suffered a violent death several years before the remains had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> in the suitcase. It was not until October 2015 that the victim was identified as Pearce, aged two, who, with her mother, had been reported missing from Alice Springs more than five years earlier, in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Kelvin's clothed {{body was}} found by a {{geologist}} on 24 July 1983. Little effort was put into concealing the body; Kelvin was found wearing the same Channel 9 shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers which he wore {{on the day of}} his abduction, together with the dog collar fitted around his neck. The {{body was found}} placed in the fetal position, with his legs bent towards his chest and his head forwards and his arms wrapped around his legs. This made police suspect that Kelvin had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> by a single person, most likely after nightfall in order to avoid detection.|$|E
25|$|Officially, Daniil died at 1 AM on November 17, 1962 (1960 in some sources), at Aiud prison hospital, having {{suffered}} a stroke that left him comatose—afflictions which, in themselves, {{seem to suggest that}} he had been severely beaten in confinement. Prison records have it that, since 1959, he had been under medical supervision for hypertonia. However, it is unlikely that he was ever administered the medicine specified in his chart, which appears to have been forged and backdated. The hieromonk's body is said to have <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> at the nearby Trei Plopi burial site, an iron spike driven through his heart by prison guards who meant to certify Tudor's death.|$|E

25|$|On the 5th of June 2009, García ordered Peruvian Police and {{military}} forces to stop Amazonian Indigenous protesters from blocking {{roads in the}} Bagua region. They had been demonstrating against the signing by Alan García of special decrees that allowed foreign corporations to enter Indigenous lands for oil drilling, mining and logging. As {{a result of the}} protests and armed military incursion, more than 100 native civilians and 14 policemen were killed. The government claimed, in a redacted television commercial, that several policemen were killed after being taken prisoner, while protesters claimed the bodies of the murdered amazon Natives have <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> into the river.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{scientists}} were called next {{to give evidence}} first on when Kelvin had died and when his body had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> in the Adelaide Hills area, and a leading entomologist claimed, from the larvae cycle of flies {{that were on the}} body, and comparing these to the larvae cycle of flies on a dead dog that was nearby, that Kelvin's body must have <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> beside the airstrip near Kersbrook on 10 July 1983. Other forensic {{scientists were}} called to testify about the hair and fibre samples collected that were linked to Einem himself and his home. Hairs from Einem were found on and inside Kelvin's clothing and of 925 fibre samples found on Kelvin's clothing, 250 came from Einem's home environment, with just seven from Kelvin's home. The scientists stated that if Einem's story was true, then there should be a very small amount or even none of the fibres and hair samples from that night still on Kelvin's clothing some 36 hours later, let alone five weeks later. Faced with such damning scientific evidence, the defence tried to counter this during cross-examination by floating a possible theory that after Einem's last contact with Kelvin, he had been abducted by other people, who had stored his clothing for five weeks before murdering him and re-dressing him. While the forensic scientists conceded that this was a possible scenario, under renewed cross-examination by the prosecution, they conceded that it would be still unlikely given the whole science of how fibres and hair are transferred from surface to surface over time. The prosecution then rested their case.|$|E
25|$|Dryden Chemical Company {{discharged}} their effluent {{directly into}} the Wabigoon-English River system. In 1970, extensive mercury contamination was discovered in this river system, leading to closure of the commercial fishery and some tourism related businesses. On March 26, 1970, the Ontario provincial government ordered Dryden Chemical Company to cease dumping mercury into the river system, although the order did not place any restrictions on airborne emissions of mercury by the company. It was estimated that over 9,000kg of mercury had <b>been</b> <b>dumped</b> by the company into the Wabigoon-English river system between 1962 and 1970. The airborne emissions of mercury continued unabated until the company stopped using mercury cells in its chloralkali process in October 1975; the company closed down in 1976.|$|E
