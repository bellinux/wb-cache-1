I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who have been the supporters for many generations.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the Treaty of Taipei {{was signed}} {{separately}} between the ROC and Japan that basically {{followed the same}} guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the Taiwanese people and the juridical person should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and the juridical person of the ROC. Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the Japanese Instrument of Surrender which specifically accepted the Potsdam Declaration which refers to the Cairo Declaration. Disputes over the precise de jure sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a de facto basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been {{and continues to be}} exercised by the ROC. Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, the {{geography}} and climate of the Sahara region began to change drastically. The northern part dried out due to the Earth tilting on its axis allowing the region to absorb more solar radiation, thus a desert was formed. The area directly to the south became a humid monsoon region, receiving massive amounts of precipitation due to moisture drawn in from the oceans. By the late 5th millennium BC, the planet had tilted even more on its axis and consequently the desert had spread southward, making previously settled areas unlivable. People began traveling further south, away from the Sahara, some settling in the fringes of the desert, an area known today as the Sahel, a unique type of landscape that forms a buffer zone between desert and savannahs and forests (by this point in time, the Sahara had expanded to approximately the same extent as is today). Other kept traveling south, finding themselves in the humid rainforests of West Africa. These are thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who founded the Kintampo way of life.|$|E

500|$|According to Miller, [...] "The {{succession}} of New World constitutions of which Virginia's, with Mason as its chief architect, was the first, declared {{the source of}} political authority to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>people...</b> in addition to making clear what a government was entitled to do, {{most of them were}} prefaced by a list of individual rights of the citizens... rights whose maintenance was government's primary reason for being. Mason wrote the first of these lists." [...] Diane D. Pikcunas, in her article prepared for the bicentennial of the U.S. Bill of Rights, wrote that Mason [...] "made the declaration of rights as his personal crusade". Tarter deemed Mason [...] "celebrated as a champion of constitutional order and one of the fathers of the Bill of Rights". Justice Sandra Day O'Connor agreed, [...] "George Mason's greatest contribution to present day Constitutional law was his influence on our Bill of Rights".|$|E
500|$|The {{films of}} Paul Thomas Anderson have been {{compared}} to it. Variety compared There Will Be Blood to the film and called it [...] "one that rivals Giant and Citizen Kane in our popular lore as origin stories about how we came to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> we are." [...] The Master has been called [...] "movieland's only spiritual sequel to Citizen Kane that doesn't shrivel under the hefty comparison" [...] and the film's loose depiction of L. Ron Hubbard has {{been compared to}} Citizen Kanes depiction of Hearst. The Social Network {{has been compared to}} the film for its depiction of a media mogul and by the character Erica Albright being similar to [...] "Rosebud". The controversy of the Sony hacking before the release of The Interview brought comparisons of Hearst's attempt to suppress the film. The film's plot structure and some specific shots influenced Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine. Abbas Kiarostami's The Traveler has been called [...] "the Citizen Kane of the Iranian children's cinema." [...] The film's use of overlapping dialogue has influenced the films of Robert Altman and Carol Reed. Reed's films Odd Man Out, The Third Man (in which Welles and Cotten appeared) and Outcast of the Islands were also influenced by the film's cinematography.|$|E
