40|$|Context: <b>Bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> forceps are an {{expensive}} instrument {{and especially in}} Government Medical colleges and Government Hospitals, getting a pair is a very tedious and prolonged task due to official reasons. Aims: To make a cheap and easily obtainable <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> forceps. Settings and Design: The reason for innovation was that the cautery forceps in the department were out of order and we were not getting replacements. Materials and Methods: Made from condemned and damaged forceps or from stainless steel nonsurgical forceps which are very low-cost, very cheap and easy to get hold of, especially in a Government institution with limited resources. Results: It {{has been used for}} the past one {{and a half years in}} our Department for plastic surgical procedures, including microvascular surgery. Initially, it was designed when the cautery forceps in the department were out of order and we were not getting replacements and later on, it became part of the routine set as it was found to be equally good.

30|$|A {{limitation}} of the study may be that experiments were not carried out in a perfused kidney model as in some other studies. The present experiments were performed on ex vivo porcine kidneys {{as a model for}} prostate surgery. Recent studies confirmed that a perfused ex vivo kidney model is a consistent model for prostate surgery (Michel et al. 1996). Studies comparing different therapy modalities such as <b>bipolar</b> electro <b>cautery,</b> diode-, KTP- and thulium-lasers to evaluate the laser damage zones and hemostatic effects of these surgery devices were performed (Heinrich et al. 2010; Wendt-Nordahl et al. 2008; Michel et al. 1996; Wendt-Nordahl et al. 2007). In the present experiments we used a non-perfused kidney model as a model for prostate surgery. It was shown that none-perfused kidneys are sufficient for the examination of laser damage zones as safety criteria for laser surgery because the laser damage zones in perfused and none perfused porcine kidneys are similar (Khoder et al. 2012). The in vivo effects may be different, especially for laser use on prostate tissue.|$|R
40|$|Background : Bile leakage is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of liver resection, and its treatment is very time-consuming. In open liver resection, Glisson 2 ̆ 7 s sheaths are usually disconnected by ligation {{to the extent possible}} during the parenchyma dissection. However, in laparoscopic surgery, the ligation, suture, and hemostasis are more difficult than in open surgery. For this reason, in laparoscopic liver resection, liver parenchyma dissection is generally accomplished using electrosurgical or stapling devices. Purpose : The {{purpose of this study was}} to verify the authenticity of electrosurgical devices attached an automatic irrigation function (AI) and stapling devices for laparoscopic liver parenchymal dissection. Methods : Four devices were used for liver parenchymal dissection in laparoscopic hepatic wedge resection, in pigs : monopolar high-frequency electric cautery attached AI (MCI) (n = 6), <b>bipolar</b> high-frequency electric <b>cautery</b> attached AI (BCI) (n = 6), bipolar tissue sealing system (LigaSure™) attached AI (BSI) and an endoscopic stapling device (ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH®) (ES). In each group, burst pressures were tested using an electronic manometer, paying special attention to the location (s) of the first disruption (s). The dissected tissues were examined histologically. Results : Pressures used in electrosurgical devices attach AI were significantly higher compared to pressures used in a ES (P < 0. 001). While thermal denaturation of the liver parenchyma occurred at approximately 2 - 3 mm of depth when <b>bipolar</b> high-frequency electric <b>cautery</b> was used for dissection, it reached up to more than 10 mm with monopolar high-frequency electric cautery. All of the first disruption points of stapling were at stapling line. Conclusions : Electrosurgical devices with an automatic irrigation function are useful devices to dissect the liver parenchyma. 【背景】術後胆汁漏は肝切除術の重大な合併症の一つであり，一旦発生すると治療に難渋する事も稀ではない．このため開腹下での肝切除においては，Glisson鞘は可能な限り結紮して閉鎖されている．しかし，腹腔鏡下では結紮，縫合の操作は開腹手術に比べ極めて時間を要する．このため腹腔鏡下では肝実質切離も電気手術器機による凝固あるいは吻合器によって行われているのが現状である．【目的】大動物(ブタ) を用いた肝切離において，電気手術器具あるいは吻合器での肝実質切離の安全性と胆汁漏の原因を検討する．【方法】 4 種類の器具①モノポラー高周波凝固器具に自動生理食塩水滴下装置を装着した器具(MCI) ，②バイポーラ高周波凝固器具に自動生理食塩水滴下装置を装着した器具(BCI) ，③バイポーラ血管シーリング装置(LigaSure™) に自動生理食塩水滴下装置を装着した器具(BSI) ，④腹腔鏡下自動吻合器(ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH®) (ES) をを用いて腹腔鏡下に楔状肝切除を行った．切離時間，術中出血量，胆管の耐圧力測定および組織学的に比較検討した．【結果】電気手術器機に比べ吻合器は切離時間は短く，出血量は多く，胆管耐圧力は低い結果であった．上記に関しては 3 種の電気手術器機間での違いは認められなかったが，組織学的にはモノポーラがボイポーラ電気手術器機に比べ，熱による肝実質障害が深い部分にまで及んでいた．【結語】電気手術器具に自動生理食塩水滴下装置を装着した器具での肝実質切離では高い胆管耐圧力が得られ結紮の必要はないと考えられる...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years {{different}} methods of achieving haemostasis in surgery have been developed. Among these methods, bipolar electrothermal coagulation carried out with the "LigaSure Bipolar Vessel Sealing System" has found numerous applications in some types of abdominal and pelvic surgery, especially when performed laparoscopically, where traditional methods of haemostasis sometimes prove more difficult to perform and are often unsafe. The authors also experimented with the use of electrothermal cautery in thyroid surgery, evaluating its efficacy in achieving haemostasis, as well as in reducing a number of complications such as hypoparathyroidism and recurrent palsy, which can be obtained utilizing the ability of the procedure to produce haemostasis without heat dispersion in the adjacent tissues. Analysing their experience with 67 cases of total thyroidectomy performed with the help of <b>bipolar</b> electrothermal <b>cautery,</b> the authors report a 4. 5 % incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism and a 1. 5 % incidence of transient monolateral recurrent lesions. These incidences proved significantly inferior to those reported by the same authors in a recent analysis of 579 total thyroidectomies carried out since 1994. The results, however, were similar to those reported in literature. The authors conclude by confirming the importance of the LigaSure system for haemostasis in thyroid surgery, stressing the fact that the routine use of this method may be limited due to the high cost of the equipment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Cold {{dissection}} (CD) and <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> dissection (BCD) {{techniques are}} two common surgical tonsillectomy procedures {{used in the}} clinic. Obstruction has become more prevalent as the major surgical indication and is most prominently observed in younger children. Case Report:  In this report, we aimed to explain the abovementioned surgical techniques in detail and compare the results in identical twins (monozygote twins). Using low energy electrocautery, irrigating the operation site continuously during cauterization, avoiding unnecessary sutures, and direct cautery to the tonsil bed are all effective measures that have diminished post-op pain in bipolar electrocautery dissection, compared to cold dissection tonsillectomy.

30|$|The ureter is {{identified}} {{at the point}} where it crosses the iliac vessels from the pelvic brim {{to the level of the}} uterine artery. The ureter is left attached to the undersurface of the peritoneum to avoid vascular impairment. The pararectal space is completely developed by gentle blunt dissection between the ureter medially, the hypogastric artery laterally, and the uterine artery ventrally. When both paravesical and pararectal spaces are completely developed to the level of the levator muscle, the cardinal ligament is clearly defined between both the paravesical and pararectal spaces. The uterine artery from the roof of the paracervix and its origin at the hypogastric artery is easily identified, skeletonized, and secured. We prefer using clips rather than <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> to control the uterine artery at this level. However, <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> seems to be safe and has been widely used for this purpose by other authors [1, 4, 10].|$|E

40|$|Objectives: There is no trial {{comparing}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> and ligation for occlusion of vas in non-scalpel vasectomy. This study {{aimed to}} compare {{the effectiveness of these}} vasectomy occlusion techniques. Materials and Methods: Between January 2002 -June 2009, patients were allocated in alternate order. We recruited 100 cases in cautery group and 100 cases in ligation group. Non-scalpel approach was performed during vasectomy and fascial interposition was performed in all cases. First semen analysis was done 3 months after vasectomy. Vasectomy success was defined as azoospermia or non-motile sperm lower than 100. 000 /mL. Results: Four patients from the cautery group were switched to the ligation group due to technical problem of cautery device. Thus, data of 96 patients as cautery group and 104 patients as ligation group were evaluated.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Transurethral {{resection}} {{syndrome is}} an uncommon but potentially life threatening complication. Various irrigating solutions have been used, normal saline {{being the most}} physiological. The recent availability of <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> has permitted the use of normal saline irrigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a randomized prospective study, we compared the safety and efficacy of <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> (using 0. 9 % normal saline irrigation) versus conventional monopolar cautery (using 1. 5 % glycine irrigation). Pre and postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit values were compared. Hemodynamics and arterial oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the study. Safety end points were changes in serum electrolytes, osmolarity and Hb/PCV (packed cell volume). Efficacy parameters were the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Qmax (maximum flow rate in mL/sec) values. RESULTS: Mean preoperative prostate size on ultrasound was 60 ± 20 cc. Mean resected weight was 17. 6 ± 10. 8 g (glycine) and 18. 66 ± 12. 1 g (saline). Mean resection time was 56. 76 ± 14. 51 min (glycine) and 55. 1 ± 13. 3 min (saline). The monopolar glycine group showed a greater decline in serum sodium and osmolarity (4. 12 meq/L and 5. 14 mosmol/L) compared to the bipolar saline group (1. 25 meq/L and 0. 43 mosmol/L). However, this was not considered statistically significant. The monopolar glycine group showed a statistically significant decline in Hb and PCV (0. 97 gm %, 2. 83, p < 0. 005) {{as compared to the}} bipolar saline group (0. 55 gm % and 1. 62, p < 0. 05). Patient follow- up (1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively) demonstrated an improvement in IPSS and Qmax in both the groups. CONCLUSION: We concluded that bipolar transurethral resection of prostate is clinically comparable to monopolar transurethral resection of prostate with an improved safety profile. However, larger number of patients with longer follow up is essential...|$|E

The assessment tool is found to have construct validity and the face validity of the OC model is established. Chapter 5 concludes the thesis and presents several avenues of future research {{for the improvement of}} both the OC model and Wii remote based hand tracking system. iii Acknowledgments First and foremost I would like to thank my thesis supervisor Dr. Grantcharov for his constan...|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{cases of}} cerebellopontine angle epidermoid cysts treated {{over a period}} of 20 years are {{reviewed}} with regard to their clinical features, the pathophysiology of their symptoms and their management. The predominating symptoms were related to the 7 th and 8 th cranial nerves and headaches. The signs and symptoms were present for an average period of 4 months. It was not always possible to determine if the signs and symptoms were due to local involvement by the epidermoid, increased intracranial pressure, or both. Diagnostic procedures evolved from angiography and ventriculography to non-invasive computed tomography and MRI. The posterior cranial fossa approach was used in 27 cases. Total excision of the epidermoid was the aim and was carried out in five (18 %) patients but concern regarding the preservation of nearby important neurovascular structures forced partial removal in 22 patients. To minimise reformation, the residual epidermoid was carefully coagulated with the aid of the operating microscope and <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> without damaging surrounding neurovascular structures...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report a}} {{surgical}} technique for retinal detachment surgery using transconjunctival sutureless 23 -gauge vitrectomy with silicone oil injection. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with retinal detachment underwent vitreoretinal surgery using a transconjunctival sutureless 23 -gauge vitrectomy system. At {{the end of}} the procedure silicone oil was injected into all eyes through a microcannula. After removing the microcannula, a <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> was used in the conjunctiva over the wound to prevent silicone oil reflux. RESULTS: In all patients retinal reattachment and injection of silicone oil through transconjunctival sutureless 23 -gauge vitrectomy system was possible. Retinal re-detachment occurred in 8 patients (25. 80 %) who were submitted to a new vitreoretinal surgery by the technique described above, however, more extensive retinotomy was necessary in all cases, specially inferiorly. Three patients (9. 67 %) presented silicone oil leakage in subconjuntival compartment. Another surgical procedure was necessary to remove the subconjuntival silicone oil. CONCLUSIONS: The retinal detachment surgery with silicone oil injection in transconjunctival sutureless 23 -gauge vitrectomy is a safe and efficient technique to repair retinal detachment and it has the advantage of being minimally invasive...|$|E

Dieulafoy’s lesions are a rare cause of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Extragastric Dieulafoy’s lesions are even more uncommon. We report {{the case of a}} 75 -year-old woman who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding from a transverse colonic Dieulafoy’s lesion. She presented with two episodes of melena followed by one episode of fresh blood per rectum. In addition, there was associated presyncope and anemia (hemoglobin 69 g/L) in the setting of supratherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation (INR 6. 2) for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative for an upper GI source of bleeding but on colonoscopy an actively oozing Dieulafoy’s lesion was identified in the transverse colon. <b>Bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> and hemostatic endoclips were applied to achieve hemostasis. Clinicians should consider this rare entity as a potential cause of potentially life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding and we review the endoscopic modalities effective for managing colonic Dieulafoy’s lesions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Rhinosporidiosis {{is a rare}} chronic granulomatous {{infection}} {{caused by}} Rhinosporidiosis seeberi. Rhinosporidiosis is endemic in parts of Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. They produce large polypoidal lesion that are friable, bleed profusely during resection and have a high tendency to recur. The common site of occurrence is nose and nasopharynx but can present at unusual sites. The occurrence at tracheobronchial tree is rare but can pose challenging problems for surgical excision as well as anaesthetic management. We are presenting {{a case of a}} 30 year old man who had (delete a) recurrent nasopharyngeal Rhinosporidiosis with progressive dyspnoea who was found to have right bronchial involvement. The lesion was excised successfully under general anesthesia using KTP 532 laser and <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery</b> via tracheostoma. Patient had another surgery for nasopharyngeal lesion after 2 weeks. There was no recurrence of the lesion noted after two year follow up. Summary: We report a case of right bronchial rhinosporidiosis which was excised using laser / electric cautery successfully under general anaesthesia usin...|$|E
30|$|A 2.5 -cm-long intraumbilical {{incision}} was taken, and a 20  cm Veress needle {{was inserted}} through it. Pneumoperitoneum was created using prewarmed and humidified CO 2 {{at a rate}} of 4.5  L/min. The temperature of the CO 2 gas at abdominal entry was 35 °C at a preset pressure of 20  mm Hg using a special CO 2 insufflator (Thermoflator, Karl Storz Gmbh & Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany). An 11  mm trocar with reduction to 10 HiCap (Karl Storz Gmbh & Co. KG) was inserted through this incision, and the abdominal cavity was inspected using a zero degree telescope. Two 5  mm trocars were placed in the right and left lower quadrants of the abdomen, medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, and a third 10  mm trocar was placed in the midline 15  cm above the pubic symphysis. An adhesion band was seen extending from the bladder to the rectum, between the two uterine horns. The fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. There were no adhesions in the ovarian fossa. Superficial endometriotic deposits were seen in the pouch of Douglas, which were fulgrated with <b>bipolar</b> <b>cautery.</b> Using bipolar current, the adhesion band was cauterized and then cut with scissors.|$|E
