5|$|Star Breweries {{invested}} {{over four}} million euros into improving its {{factories in the}} 2009-11 period, resulting in a 20% increase in production capacity. These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new <b>bottle</b> <b>conveyor</b> system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} the dynamic behavior of <b>bottles</b> transported by <b>conveyor</b> systems. Such systems are widely applied in numerous industries. However, if {{systems are not}} properly designed or controlled, multiple undesired phenomena, like clogging or severe bottle scuffing, may occur in the bottle bulk. These effects are eventually strongly linked to the dynamic behavior of- and interaction between bottles. In order to propose a simulation model to support the design process needed for <b>bottle</b> <b>conveyors,</b> the plane mechanical behavior of bottles in a parametrically defined plant is considered. Generation of geometry, contact simulations by penalization and Coulomb friction {{is included in the}} model, which is solved by numerical integration of the Newton-Euler equations. The model is developed applying basic concepts from mechanics and numerical analysis and is therefore well-suited for implementation in any software for scientific programming. Results obtained with the model represent the expected physical effects for soft bottles well. A strategy for improvement of the computational efficiency of the method for modeling of high stiffness bottles is outlined...|$|R
40|$|In food, {{beverage}} {{and cosmetic}} packaging industry important issue for production quality {{is that the}} label is present, {{and that it is}} positioned correctly (as example on all of the produced and filled up bottles). There are different solutions in order to satisfy this requirement but the basic parts of the label inspection are almost the same. They are the objects of inspection (<b>bottles),</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt, source of light combined with optical sensor, embedded system and interface. The basic operational principle of similar inspection systems is that optical sensor received part of emitted light of the source. Based on the magnitude of the received signal the inspection system is possible to decide if the label is present and that the label is in correct position. In proposed embedded system TSL 230 sensor has been used together with PIC microcontroller to detect label presence...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, {{hydraulic}} and pneumatic {{devices were}} able to power various mechanical actions, such as positioning tools or work pieces. [...] Pile drivers and steam hammers are examples for heavy work. In food processing, pneumatic or hydraulic devices could start and stop filling of cans or <b>bottles</b> on a <b>conveyor.</b> Power steering for automobiles uses hydraulic mechanisms, as does practically all earth moving equipment and other construction equipment and many attachments to tractors. Pneumatic (usually compressed air) power is widely used to operate industrial valves.|$|R
50|$|Conveyor belt sushi {{was invented}} by Yoshiaki Shiraishi (1914-2001), who had {{problems}} staffing his small sushi restaurant and had difficulties managing the restaurant by himself. He got {{the idea of a}} conveyor belt sushi after watching beer <b>bottles</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> belt in an Asahi brewery. After five years of development, including the design of the conveyor belt and the speed of operations, Shiraishi opened the first conveyor belt sushi Mawaru Genroku Sushi in Higashiosaka in 1958, eventually expanding to up to 250 restaurants all over Japan. However, by 2001, his company had just 11 restaurants. Shiraishi also invented a robotic sushi, served by robots, but this idea has not had commercial success.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Filling {{is a task}} {{carried out}} by a machine that {{packages}} liquid products such as cold drinks or water. Traditional methods of bottle filling involved placing <b>bottles</b> onto a <b>conveyor</b> and filling only one bottle at a time. This method is time consuming and expensive. Our paper aims at filling and capping bottles simultaneously. The filling and capping operation {{takes place in a}} synchronized manner. It also includes a user-defined volume selection menu through which the user can input the desired volume to be filled in the bottles. The entire system is more flexible and time saving. The filling and capping operations are controlled using a Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC’S). This is because PLC’s are very flexible, cost effective, space efficient and reduces complexity. By programming the PLC we control the entire system. SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is used to monitor the process...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The new {{machine vision}} that is {{emerging}} is already generating {{millions of dollars}} per year in thousands of successful applications. Machine vision is becoming established as a successful tool for industrial automation where 100 % inspection of manufactured parts during production is becoming a reality. Two-thirds of applications of machine vision are found in quality control in which objects are categorized using its dimensions in metric measurements that are extracted from its 2 D-pixel image. Building a machine vision system requires careful selection of appropriate sensor, lens, extraction and integration of information from the available cues, sensed data and evaluation of system performance and robustness. In this paper, it is proposed to provide a roadmap with an overview of Imaging system, Radiometric and Geometric Modeling to design a machine vision system with the illustration of design of automated visual inspection system to image new <b>bottles</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> line {{at a distance of}} 100 cm from the camera in order to ensure 30 mm diameter of the bottle neck...|$|R
