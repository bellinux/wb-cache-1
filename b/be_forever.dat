Hershey felt that she would <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> in debt to Rush for fighting with financiers to allow her a part in that film. She also felt The Stunt Man was an important transition for her, from playing girls to playing women.|$|E
5|$|In the series' narrative, Rose is {{introduced}} in the eponymous series one premiere as a teenage working class shop assistant from London, alongside her own supporting cast {{in the form of}} her mother Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri) and her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke). Over the course of the first series Rose's human actions and responses contrast with the Doctor's alien perspectives. Rose grows increasingly trusting of the Doctor and comes to realise she has fallen in love with him. He comes to value and depend on her and sacrifices his Ninth incarnation for her. Rose forms a similar bond with the new Doctor, but the two appear to <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> separated in the series two finale, although Rose's temporary return in the fourth series gives her relationship with the Doctor a resolution.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered at the thought that the crossing the Delaware would <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> free.|$|E

25|$|Pete Beale {{was one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Pete was based on one of his cousins, the twin brother to Pauline and son of Holland's aunt Lou; a family set-up that would eventually be recreated on-screen and would go on to <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> hailed as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers.|$|E

At her call, she summoned all of her ferocious multi-armed forms, the Yoginis arose from her body and {{threatened}} to destroy all. Lord Brahma, being the Creator, naturally had his issues with this, and pleaded that she reconsider her drastic plan.

The novel features many similarities to the styles of writing of such famous authors as Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard, which serve as both homage and satire to their works, along with elements of colonialist attitude, cultism, and general fantasy.|$|E

25|$|Many of today's Biblical scholars, such as N. T. Wright, in {{tracing the}} concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as {{overlapping}} or interlocking. Heaven is known as God's space, his dimension, {{and is not a}} place that can be reached by human technology. This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst being active and working alongside people on Earth. One day when God restores all things, Heaven and Earth will <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> combined into the New Heavens and New Earth of the World to Come.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, lucha libre would <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> {{changed when}} a silver-masked wrestler, {{known simply as}} El Santo (The Saint), first stepped into the ring. He made his debut in Mexico City by winning an 8-man battle royal. The public became enamored by the mystique and secrecy of Santo's personality, and he quickly became the most popular luchador in Mexico. His wrestling career spanned nearly five decades, during which he became a folk hero and a symbol of justice for the common man through his {{appearances}} in comic books and movies, while the sport received an unparalleled degree of mainstream attention.|$|E
25|$|To {{construct}} the focal family, Holland and Smith were helped considerably by Tony Holland's recollections {{of his own}} East End background. Lou was the first EastEnders character to be created. She was based on Holland's aunt Lou Beale, one of four sisters from a large Walthamstow family. Lou was mother to his cousins Peter and Pauline and married to Albert – a family set-up that would eventually be recreated on-screen and {{would go on to}} <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> hailed as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers. Peter Batt, {{who was one of the}} original scriptwriters of EastEnders, has stated that elements of Lou Beale were based on his mother.|$|E

25|$|Although {{considered}} haram in Islamic dietary laws, {{the wolf}} {{is important in}} Moroccan folk medicine. Edvard Westermarck wrote of several remedies derived from the wolf in Morocco, {{including the use of}} its fat as a lotion, the consumption of its meat to treat respiratory ailments, and the burning of its intestines in fumigation rituals meant to increase the fertility of married couples. The wolf's gall bladder was said to have various uses, including curing sexual impotence and serving as a charm for women wishing to divorce their husbands. Westermarck noted, however, that the wolf was also associated with more nefarious qualities: it was said that a child who eats wolf flesh before reaching puberty will <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> cursed with misfortune and that scribes and saintly persons refrain from consuming it even in areas where it is socially acceptable, as doing so would render their charms useless.|$|E
25|$|Susa was {{a wealthy}} city {{by the time}} Alexander the Great invaded it, and {{it is said that}} he {{required}} 10,000 camels and 20,000 donkeys to carry away the treasures. For the most part the architectural wealth of Susa lies in its palaces, and ceremonial structures most of which have been eroded away by time or wear and tear. Today the most important remnants of the Achaemenid contribution to the architecture of ancient Susa are found in remnants of the Palace of Darius the Great in the original excavation site, or hosted in foreign nations' museums as Persian artifacts. Today the archaeological remains of the structure remain exposed to the elements, wear and tear, and human activity, and it seems that remains of Susa would <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> lost to the humankind, except perhaps for few selected pieces on display at the Louvre or foreign nations' museums.|$|E
25|$|At {{the request}} of the reincarnated Saint Sabbat, the Tanith First-and-Only is summoned to the remote and tactically {{insignificant}} world Herodor. The Civitas Beati, a holy city dedicated to the Saint, is under assault from a legion of Blood Pact, led by Enok Innokenti. While the Ghosts prepare to defend the city alongside the local PDF force, Gaunt learns the truth of the situation: the woman posing as the reincarnated Saint is Sanian, an esholi whom the Ghosts encountered on Hagia. Utterly convinced that she is Sabbat, Sanian has clearly lost her mind. Lord-General Lugo – whose career has been unstable since his disgrace at Hagia – plans to use her as propaganda, and does not care that she is an imposter; he believes that he will <b>be</b> <b>forever</b> remembered as the man responsible for a miracle in the Sabbat Worlds. As far as untold thousands of pilgrims, Imperial and archenemy troops are concerned, Sanian is the true Saint.|$|E
