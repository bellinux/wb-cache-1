The method CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) was chosen to analyze these databases {{because it is a}} partitioning technique specifically designed to manage very large data sets. The results obtained allow us to identify two métiers, which are in concordance with knowledge of the fishery, one targeting blue whiting and hake (PTB 1), and another targeting mackerel (PTB 2). PTB 2 shows a seasonal pattern related to the reproductive cycle of mackerel off the Cantabrian coast in the Bay of Biscay. The CLARA method is shown to be useful tool for analyzing this type of large data set, although the coverage level of its sampling algorithm must be taken into account. Publicado...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{acknowledged}} {{the value of}} fleet-based management approaches since the 2001 Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In the 2009 Green Paper, this was again recognized as a key area of interest for future development of the CFP, in particular setting the technical basis for the recent Data Collection Framework (DCF), which specifies the standard for national fishery sampling programs within a pan-European context. These policy changes require deeper and up to date knowledge about European fleets and fisheries, thus encouraging Member States to undertake scientific projects {{in order to obtain}} appropriate fleet segmentations classifying their fishing activities within a hierarchical structure. The work presented in this book is the first comprehensive analysis of the Spanish fleets operating in Atlantic European waters, taking into account both European and national management requirements. This has been possible due to the availability of official logbooks, which provide the broadest perspective on the activity of Spanish fleets in the study area. The only exception to this is small scale fisheries, pursued mainly by vessels of less than 10 m of length and, therefore, not subject to the requirement of keeping logbooks. In order to match better European and Spanish fleet classifications, a new level (“Management Unit”) is proposed here, which is placed between “modalidad”, used in the Spanish regulations, and “métier”, as is defined by the recent DCF. Spanish national waters comprise four fishing grounds, two of which are in the European Atlantic. Nine Management Units have been identified in the Northern Spanish fishing ground: bottom otter trawl (OTB 10), <b>bottom</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> (PTB 10), purse seine (PSN 10), set long line (LLS 10), set gillnet targeting hake (GNS 11), set gillnet targeting anglerfish (GNS 12), trolling (LTL 11) and bait-boats (LHP 11) targeting albacore, and hand line targeting mackerel (LHP 12). Two Management Units have been identified in Southern Spanish waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 20) and purse seine (PSN 20). In European waters outside Spain, six Management Units have been identified in non-Iberian waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 50), <b>bottom</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> (PTB 50), set long line (LLS 50) and set gillnet (GNS 50) by vessels of more than 100 GRT, and set long line (LLS 60) and set gillnet (GNS 60) by vessels of less than 100 GRT. Finally, one Management Unit using bottom otter trawl has been found to operate in Portuguese waters (OTB 70). Unluckily, the analyses made on the logbooks of the Spanish fleet using drifting long line could not be used to categorize this fleet due to the geographical limitations of the logbooks available. After detailed analyses and categorization of the Management Units, the results obtained were used in an exercise to test the usefulness and feasibility of using logbook information to answer some DCF requirements. This revealed that logbooks are an essential tool to deal with bioeconomic challenges posed by the new CFP. Versión del edito...|$|E

Nguyen: 'Willingness of fishermen to use a bycatch reduction device (BRD) and their attitudes toward an indiscriminate fishery' (manuscript) Trawling is an important fishing method used by the inshore fishermen of Nha Trang city, Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam. The inshore trawl fishery in Nha Trang city {{is known to have}} very low selectivity, which may not be a responsible fishing practice. The trawl nets of the fishery retain large numbers of juvenile individuals, which has negative effects on the marine resources. The goal of this thesis is to provide initial suggestions to improve the selectivity of the inshore trawl fishery of Nha Trang city {{in order to reduce the}} catch of trash fish and juveniles of economically important species. 			To fulfil this goal, I performed the following steps: (1) studied the current status of juvenile and trash fish caught by the fishery in order to gather information on the composition and sizes of untargeted species; (2) studied the selectivity of conventional codends with different diamond mesh sizes and with a square mesh panel; (3) aimed to determine the willingness of fishermen to use a bycatch reduction device (BRD) to reduce the catch of juvenile individuals. 			The status of juvenile specimens caught by the fishery was determined by: (1) direct access to trash fish samples from the trawlers of the fishery; and (2) catch notes made by the wives of fishermen who were responsible for selling the catch at landing points. The selectivity of the codends tested was studied during sea trials on chartered trawlers from the fishery where the cover codend method was used. I also interviewed the captains of the trawlers to collect information about their willingness to test future versions of a BRD. 			We found that trash fish accounted for reasonable part of the catch by trawlers from the fishery and played an important role in the incomes of fishermen, especially fishermen from small trawler fleets (i. e., trawlers with an engine power of less than 33 Hp). The trash fish comprised several economically important species (i. e., Cephalopoda spp., Portunidae spp., Penaeidae spp., Trichiurus lepturus, Saurida tumbil, and Epinephelus spp.). Most of the economically important species in the trash fish category measured less than 13 cm in total length (TL), except for Trichiurus lepturus where TL could reach 15 cm. This project also showed that the current mesh size of the diamond mesh at the codend had very poor selectivity performance. An increase in the mesh sizes used by the fishery to the legal mesh size would help to increase the selectivity for lizardfish, shrimp, squid, and threadfin bream. In addition, increasing the current codend mesh size to match the legal mesh size would help to reduce the catch of trash fish significantly. However, the legal mesh size is not sufficient to totally protect juveniles caught by the gears. With the current situation, the legal mesh size would be accepted to compromise between the protection of juveniles and the economic loss of fishermen. In the future, mesh sizes which is larger than current legal mesh sizes are suggested. The square mesh panel also helped to reduce the catch of trash fish and increased the selectivity for squid and lizardfish. Fishermen from the small trawler fleet refused to use the BRD to release the juvenile individuals. Fishermen from the larger trawler fleets may use the BRD provided there is no reduction in their catch of small squid. Information learnt from interviews with fishermen showed that the fish stocks exploited by the studied trawl fishery are declining sharply and it is necessary to deliver suitable measures to protect the fish stocks. Improving selectivity of the trawls used in the fishery is one of the measures...|$|E

40|$|The {{demersal}} fish stocks in southern Brazil were assessed from landings and catchper-unit effort data trends between 1975 and 1994, available {{information on the}} life history patterns, and population dynamics {{of the most important}} species. The fishing gears, mostly otter and <b>pair</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> in the 1970 s, diversified towards double-rig trawls for fish and shrimp and bottom gill nets in the mid 1980 s, and bottom longlines in the upper slope in the early 1990 s. There were also some less successful attempts with traps for fish and crabs. The {{demersal fish}}eries are more intensive in winter when migratory species move northward, associated with the seasonal displacement of the western boundary of the Subtropical Convergence. Landings between 1975 and 1994 were mostly of sciaenid fishes (> 70 %) and elasmobranchs (10 %) and oscillated around 59 000 t. There was not a decrease in total landings but a shift from more to less exploited stocks. Since 1989, 4 % of the landings came from depleted stocks of Pagrus pagrus (L.), Netuma barba (Lacépède), Pogonias cromis (L.) and Rhinobatos horkelli (Muller & Henle); 37 % from overexploited stocks: Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest), Paralichthys patagonicus Jordan, Squatina guggenheim Marini, and Galeorhinus galeus (L.); 24 % from heavily exploited stocks of Umbrina canosai Berg, and Macrodon ancylodon (Bloch & Schneider); and 35 % of Cynoscion guatucupa (Cuvier) and small stocks with unclear status.
