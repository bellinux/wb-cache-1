5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring {{element in the}} Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of its own radioactivity.|$|E

Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E

The mutagenic principles in the pyrolyzates of amino acids have been isolated and identified by Sugimura et al. We have isolated and identified amino-a-carbolines from pyrolyzed soybean globulin as mutagens. The yield of mutagens <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> of food constituents is changed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> method. Effects of <b>heating</b> methods on <b>the</b> yield of amino-a-carbolines were studied {{in a series of}} experiments, and the results are shown in this paper. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> of creatinesugar mixtures imidazoquinoline or quinoxaline mutagens are formed. We demonstrated previously that the pyrolysis products of amino acids and proteins in model systems are mutagenic (1, 2). The mutagenic principles in the pyrolyzates of amino acids have been isolated and identified by Sugimura et al. (3, 4). We have isolated and identified amino-a-carbolines from pyrolyzed soybean globulin as mutagens (5).

5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E
5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, {{many of which are}} associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E

5|$|In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Bowen {{signed with}} the Philadelphia 76ers, and was later traded to the Chicago Bulls and {{immediately}} waived, then picked up off waivers by the Miami Heat. In that season, he wore jersey #12 instead of #30 and appeared in 69 games, averaging 2.8 points and 1.4 rebounds in 12.7 minutes per game, and scored in double-figures six times. In the following year, Bowen was retained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heat.</b> In that year, he had his breakout season. For {{the first time in}} his career, he played in all 82 regular season games, averaged 7.6 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.01 steals in 32.7 minutes per game and set new single season career-highs in games, points, rebounds, assists, blocks, minutes, field goals made and attempted, three-point goals made and attempted and free throws made and attempted. Bowen logged more minutes (2,685 vs. 2,678), scored more points (623 vs. 606) and hit more threes (103 vs. 54) than he had in his first four seasons combined. Especially, Bowen earned himself a reputation as a defensive stopper. For his strong perimeter defense, he was voted into the All-Defensive Second Team.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{made his}} debut for the Hornets in the team's season opener against the Miami Heat on October 28, scoring 17 points {{off the bench}} in a 104–94 loss. On December 17, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 109–99 {{overtime}} win over the Toronto Raptors. On March 21, 2016, he scored 15 of his 29 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to help Charlotte rally from a 30–7 deficit in the second quarter for a 91–88 comeback victory over San Antonio, snapping the Spurs' six-game winning streak. Charlotte was the first team to score seven points or fewer in the opening quarter and come back to win since 2008. It was also the largest comeback surrendered by the Spurs in the Tim Duncan era, which began in 1997. Lin was 11-of-18 from the field and hit all four three-point attempts, including three in the fourth quarter, and provided the go-ahead jumper with 48 seconds left. Lin's first and only season with the Hornets came to an end after the Hornets were defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|It was {{probably}} William the Conqueror {{who gave the}} city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification {{was probably}} abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were abandoned after the conclusion of the siege and have since vanished.|$|E
