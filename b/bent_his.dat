5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back <b>bent,</b> <b>his</b> face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
25|$|Ignaz Gyulai marched {{north from}} Zagreb, {{reaching}} Maibor on 15 June. His {{goal was to}} bring food and munitions to the besieged garrison of Graz. Marmont arrived at Celje (Cilly) on 19 June. Gyulai feinted to the west, then took the direct road north to Graz via the Mur River valley. Reacting to his opponent's move, Marmont <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> march to the west through Dravograd (Unterdrauberg).|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Ratzinger was {{appointed}} to a chair in dogmatic theology at the University of Tübingen, {{where he was a}} colleague of Hans Küng. In his 1968 book Introduction to Christianity, he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Despite his reformist <b>bent,</b> <b>his</b> views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.|$|E

25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
25|$|Horton's article {{includes}} an account by Shaker Aamer, a detainee and legal resident of Britain. His lawyer, Zachary Katznelson, had filed an affidavit {{in federal court}} in which Aamer said that he had been taken to the black site on 9 June 2006, where he was beaten and nearly asphyxiated. This was the same evening that the three prisoners died. Aamer said that during his interrogation, he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body. They also inflicted pain to his eyes, <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> fingers until he screamed and then pressed against his throat and put a mask over him so he could not cry out. He said he could hardly breathe. Although Aamer was cleared for repatriation to Britain in 2009, as of 2015 he is still detained at Guantanamo, where he has been held for almost 15 years without charge or trial. He is the last British resident to be held there.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, the First Continental Congress convened, {{and both}} Ward and Hopkins were {{chosen as the}} {{delegate}}s from Rhode Island. [...] Hopkins, at age 68, was senior to every delegate there, and {{was only one of}} two of the 55 delegates (the other being Benjamin Franklin) who had attended the Albany Congress 20 years earlier. [...] Over the previous several years Hopkins had developed palsy in his hands, and this greatly affected his ability to write. [...] At the seating of this congress, Henry Arniett Brown wrote, [...] "yonder sits the oldest of them all. [...] His form is <b>bent,</b> <b>his</b> thin locks, fringing a forehead bowed with age and honorable service, and his hands shake tremulously as he folds them in his lap. [...] It is Stephen Hopkins." ...|$|E

2500|$|The copilot {{suffered}} fatal injuries, {{striking a}} tree [...] {{away from the}} main crash site. The pilot landed in a tree [...] above the ground. He survived the night, with temperatures reaching almost , in his survival-kit sleeping bag atop his life raft. The navigator's parachute did not deploy upon ejection. He impacted the snow-covered ground before separating from his ejection seat about [...] from the wreckage with an impact estimated at 16 times the force of gravity. He suffered a fractured skull and three broken ribs. The force <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> ejection seat {{and he could not}} get his survival kit out. He survived the night by wrapping himself in his parachute.|$|E
2500|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{was well}} known for his {{trademark}} [...] "skyhook", a hook shot in which he <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without goaltending. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him {{even more difficult to}} defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was [...] "the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face".|$|E
2500|$|Caesar's munus of 46 BC {{included}} {{at least}} one equestrian, son of a Praetor, and possibly two senatorial volunteers. Under Augustus, senators and equestrians and their descendants were formally excluded from the infamia of association with the arena and its personnel (arenarii). However, some magistrates– and some later Emperors– tacitly or openly condoned such transgressions and some volunteers were prepared to embrace the resulting loss of status. Some did so for payment, some for military glory and, in one recorded case, for personal honour. In 11 AD, Augustus, who enjoyed the games, <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because [...] "the prohibition was no use". Under Tiberius, the Larinum decree (19AD) reiterated the laws which Augustus himself had waived. Thereafter, Caligula flouted them and Claudius strengthened them. Nero and Commodus ignored them. Valentinian II, some hundreds of years later, protested against the same infractions and repeated similar laws: his was an officially Christian empire.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, a Midrash {{reported}} that two teachers offered different explanations of [...] “He (God) has <b>bent</b> <b>His</b> bow, and set me ( [...] , vayatziveni) as a mark for the arrow.” One taught that the verse compared Israel to a wedge used to split a log (as the wedge, Israel, is struck, but the log, the enemy, is split). [...] The other taught that the verse compared Israel to a post {{on which a}} target for arrows is placed, at which all shoot but which remains standing. [...] Rabbi Judan taught that the verse meant that God strengthened the writer (representing the people of God) to withstand all afflictions (reading , vayatziveni, to mean “He has made me stand firm”). [...] Rabbi Judan noted that after the 98 reproofs in [...] says, “You are standing ( [...] , nizavim) this day all of you,” which Rabbi Judan taught we render (according to Onkelos), “you endure this day all of you,” and thus to mean, “you are strong men to withstand all these reproofs.” ...|$|E
