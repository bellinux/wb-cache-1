50|$|While {{the maximum}} number of {{transitions}} is reduced by half, the average number has a smaller decrease. For an 8-bit bus for example, the average number of transitions, using bus-invert coding becomes 3.27 (instead of 4), or 0.41 (instead of 0.5) transitions per <b>bus-line</b> per time-slot. This means that the average number of transitions is 81.8% of the number with an unencoded bus. This is because the invert line contributes some transitions and the distribution of the Hamming distances is not uniform.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the average I/O power dissipation for wide buses the observation that the bus-invert method performs better for small bus sizes {{can be used to}} partition the bus into several narrower subbuses. Each of these subbuses can then be coded independently with its own invert signal. For example a 64-bit bus could be partitioned into eight 8-bit subbuses with a total of 8 added invert signals. Because of the assumption that the data to be transferred over the wide bus is uniformly distributed, the statistics for the narrower subbuses will be independent and the sequence of data for each subbus will be uniformly distributed. For example for a 64-bit bus partitioned into eight 8-bit subbuses the average number of transitions per time-slot will be 26.16 (8 times 3.27, the average for one 8-bit subbus) and the average number of transitions per <b>bus-line</b> per time-slot will be [...]41 (as for an 8-bit bus with one invert line). The maximum number of transitions is not improved by partitioning the bus and remains the same at n/2. However, there is always an extra overhead of using more lines, but computationally, it has been found that the inversion bus encoding works well for most purposes.|$|E

For these reasons the Municipality of Bologna has committed the ultimate design of the underground line with a high standard level of precision; this aspect forces the Project Group to choose a survey method that has to be both accurate and not too expensive. In order to achieve a precise high resolution survey in a short time, a Mobile Mapping System vehicle has been used. The Road-Scanner ” system is equipped with 2 GPS+IMU sensors for navigation (Applanix POSLV), four cameras for close range photogrammetric survey and a Laser scanner FARO LS 880.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cryogenic}} {{system for}} the KSTAR superconducting magnets has been commissioned. It consists of a cold box, distribution boxes (DB) and cryogenic transfer lines. The cold box and DB # 1 provide 600 g/s of supercritical helium to cool the superconducting (SC) magnets, their SC <b>bus-lines,</b> and the magnet support structures. It also provides 17. 5 g/s of liquid helium to the current leads and supplies cold helium flow to the thermal shields. The cooling power of the cold box at 4. 5 K equivalent is 9 kW which is extracted by 6 turboexpanders. The DB # 1 includes 49 cryogenic valves, 2 supercritical helium circulators, 1 cold compressor, and 7 heat exchangers immersed in a 6 m 3 liquid helium storage bath. The main duties of the DB # 2 are the relative distribution of the cryogenic helium among the cooling channels of each KSTAR cold component and the emergency release of over-pressurized helium during abnormal events such as quenches of the SC magnets. After individual commissioning, the system was integrated and cooled down with the KSTAR device. In this paper, the construction and commissioning results of the KSTAR cryogenic system will be introduced. In addition, we will present the cool-down results of the KSTAR device. 1...|$|R

Bloomberg reported that the central government once again intervened in the stock market to ensure stability ahead of the anniversary; there were traffic curfews and closures of public facilities including seven parks and some hospitals. Line 1, Beijing Subway, which passes underneath Changan Avenue, was shut down; 256 <b>bus-lines</b> in Beijing were placed under tight transport restrictions from September 2-4. On the day of the parade, hospitals restricted most of their activities beyond emergencies, the stock markets were closed. Areas in the city centre were placed under martial law, and 850,000 [...] "citizen guards" [...] were deployed to ensure security within the city. The city authorities sent in trained macaques and falcons to make sure the skies over central Beijing were free of birds that would put the flypast at risk. The trained macaque monkeys climbed trees and dismantled birds nests in advance of the parade. Hot air balloons and hang gliders were equally barred from the city; those residing along Changan Avenue were forbidden from opening their windows during the lock-down period. Domestic satellite televisions were restricted from playing entertainment programs between September 1-5. China Central Television ceased the broadcasting of all entertainment programming, only playing films and TV series about the Second World War. Xi Jinping decreed the creation of two new public holidays targeted at Japan, the first being September 3 - Victory over Japan Day, officially named The 70th anniversary of Chinese People’s Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War Victory Commemoration Day. The second one was declared for December 13, marking the Japanese takeover of Nanjing, China's then capital under the Nationalists and the Nanking Massacre that followed, which resulted in many Chinese deaths by Japanese military personnel garrisoned in the city. The CY Leung administration in Hong Kong argued for a holiday to facilitate participation in commemorative events, thus it tabled the [...] "Special Holiday (3 September 2015) Ordinance" [...] - designating the day as a one-off holiday - for debate in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) in July.

40|$|Coding was {{proposed}} {{as a general}} method of decreasing power dissipation for the I/O [4, 5]. Lower power dissipation {{can be obtained by}} using extra bus lines for coding the data. This paper presents an application of the general theory of limited-weight codes for a class of parallel terminated buses with pull-up terminators (e. g. Rambus). Power dissipation on such a <b>bus-line</b> is larger for a logical 1 and it follows that patterns with few 1 s should be chosen. A perfect k 2 -limited weight code equivalent to the previously proposed BusInvert method and a novel non-perfect 3 -limited weight code are described. Both codes can be algorithmically generated and practical issues related to their implementation on the Rambus are discussed. 1 Introduction Coding buses for low-power and low-noise was independently proposed in [1, 4, 5, 6].

40|$|There are {{two reasons}} which necessitate an {{immediate}} decision : — One is the indications of the 1982 census, which shows the rapid increase of urban sprawl between the two towns, even {{with a loss of}} 30 000 inhabitants for Marseille. This intermediate urbanization demands better planning and organization of this space and must not be left to whatever comes about through individuals particular needs or desires, at issue is the immediate and obvious disappearance of the open country and natural landscapes of the area. — The other reason which imposes a quick choice is the saturation of the existing routes. The North Freeway has a traffic of 120 000 véhicules for day with a capacity of 90 000. The single way railway line Marseille-Aix is known for its slopes and difficult curves as well as its poor traffic flow. The automobile has a huge place in the heart of Metropolitan Marseille traffic, this is to the detriment of a balanced development of public transportation. The solutions : Elected officials from the « department » or « region » thought of : first, the construction of an « aerotrain », secondly, the railway solution meaning the electrification and the construction of a second way for Marseille-Aix, with an antenna to Plan de Campagne (a large shopping-center) and Marignane (Airport), thirdly, a special <b>bus-line</b> running along the two ways of the Aix-Marseille freeway. These solutions seem to be abandonned now to the profit of a north-coastal highway through the Chaîne de l'Estaque. This would allow for a junction with the highways for Martigues and Paris. As such the traffic of the proposed route would permit better circulation of buses going towards Aix or Marignane. This solution is not perhaps the happiest, nor in the long run the most economic. But in any case {{it seems to be the}} future of transports and urbanization for the present time. Le problème des relations entre Aix et Marseille se pose depuis plus d'un siècle. Le développement de l'urbanisation entre les deux villes rend nécessaire l'amélioration de l'organisation actuelle, en raison de : — la croissance rapide de l'urbanisation entre les deux villes, alors que Marseille même perd près de 30 000 habitants; — la saturation des voies existantes.
