But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office in 1956, when he sought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This quasi-judicial post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Rossio, with the pouring {{of the populace}} into the streets, was very confusing but advantageous to the republicans, given the obvious public support. Machado Santos spoke to General Gorjão Henriques and invited him to keep the role of commandant of the division, but he refused. António Carvalhal, known to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> sympathiser, then received command. Soon afterwards, at 9 o'clock in the morning, the Republic was proclaimed by José Relvas from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho.

25|$|Roosevelt's plan to {{convince}} Hoover {{to run for}} the Democratic nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican,</b> but Roosevelt nonetheless decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the party formally nominated Roosevelt by acclamation. Although his nomination surprised most people, Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance to the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name. Roosevelt had just turned 38, four years younger than Theodore had been when he received the same nomination from his party. Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the Cox–Roosevelt ticket.|$|E

500|$|Johnson.....was {{all over}} the Cerro Grande Fire last week. He helped reporters {{understand}} where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn't, ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting {{state and federal agencies}} and the National Guard involved, and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet. On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car. He jumped out and stomped on the flames, as did his wife and some of his staffers. [...] Johnson's leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall, who said: [...] "I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this. He's called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here." [...] Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> with no interest in running for president.|$|E

Eager to gain full representation in Congress and the Electoral College, residents actively campaigned for statehood. [...] In Washington there was talk that Hawaii would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Party stronghold so it was matched with the admission of Alaska, seen as a Democratic Party stronghold.
