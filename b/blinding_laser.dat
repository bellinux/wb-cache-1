40|$|Laser {{drilling}} {{has emerged}} {{in the last five}} years as the most widely accepted method of creating microvias in high-density electronic interconnect and chip packaging devices. Most commercially available laser drilling tools are currently based on one of two laser types: far-IR CO 2 lasers and UV solid state lasers at 355 nm. While CO 2 lasers are recognized for their high average power and drilling throughput, UV lasers are known for high precision material removal and their ability to drill the smallest vias, with diameters down to about 25 – 30 �m now achievable in production. This paper presents an historical overview of techniques for drilling microvias with UV solid state <b>lasers.</b> <b>Blind</b> and through via formation by percussion drilling, trepanning, spiralling, and image projection with a shaped beam are discussed.

40|$|The {{most costly}} {{process in the}} {{fabrication}} of today's {{multilayer printed circuit board}} (PCB) is the process of making z-axis interconnections or vias. This is driven at the fabrication level by two factors, the size of the vias including microvias (< 0. 150 mm diameter) being demanded and the growing number of vias that are on a panel. There area several methods for producing <b>blind</b> microvias, including <b>laser</b> microvia drilling, photo-microvia formation, plasma etched microvia and mechanical microvia drilling. The two that are now clearly leading as emerging technologies are photovia formation and laser drilling.

40|$|Sensory {{information}} {{is critical to}} the telerobotic operation of mobile robots. In particular, visual sensors are a key component of the sensor package on a robot engaged in urban military operations. Visual sensors provide the robot operator with a wealth of information including robot navigation and threat assessment. However, simple countermeasures such as darkness, smoke, or <b>blinding</b> by a <b>laser,</b> can easily neutralize visual sensors. In order to provide a robust visual sensing system, an infrared sensor is required to augment the primary visual sensor. An infrared sensor can acquire useful imagery in conditions that incapacitate a visual sensor. A simple approach to incorporating an infrared sensor into the visual sensing system is to display two images to the operator: side-by-side visual and infrared images. However, dual images might overwhelm the operator with information, and result in degraded robot performance. A better solution is to combine the visual and infrared images into a single image that maximizes scene information. Fusing visual and infrared images into a single image demands balancing the mixture of visual and infrared information. Humans are accustom to viewing and interpreting visual images. They are not accustom to viewing or interpreting infrared images. Hence, the infrared image must be used to enhance the visual image, not obfuscate it...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis describes {{the use of}} a prototype Tactile Situational Awareness System (TSAS) as an approach to aid pilot performance following simulated laser blindness modeled during a virtual approach in an SH- 60 helicopter. Situational awareness and spatial awareness remain critical factors for successful control of manned aircraft. Helicopters and fixed winged aircraft pilots react to spatial orientation challenges during take-off, and landing phases of flight. U. S. and NATO aircraft pilot surveys examined the human machine interaction and revealed degraded vision as an important human factor contributing to mishaps or near mishaps. Vision was identified as an information chokepoint limiting command and control of the aircraft. Fortunately, vision can be augmented with an available technology called "haptics" during restricted or limited human vision. Therefore, an experiment using X-Plane output for haptics-generated input from a torso-worn TSAS was developed. Participants received haptic cues during runway approaches after experiencing simulated loss of vision. Participant performance after simulated <b>laser</b> <b>blinding</b> with and without the TSAS compared time advantage and navigation accuracy. Simulator performance data indicated pilots using TSAS following simulated laser blindness responded to haptic cues, had more time to prevent the aircraft from obtaining an unsafe pitch or roll condition, and could position the aircraft closer to the landing zone.

40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, laser {{technology}} has had a strong impact on our society, providing important contributions to materials processing, data storage, communications, medicine, and defense applications. However, the progress in laser technology has also brought {{about the development of}} harmful portable high‐power lasers and tactical laser weapons. As a result, the hazard of being <b>blinded</b> by <b>lasers</b> (accidentally or from hostile use) has increased significantly. Hence, the need for protection against lasers has emerged. In order to protect optical sensors against harmful laser radiation, materials that absorb high intensity light, such as nonlinear absorbing chromophores, are employed. The concept of controlling the intensity of an optical light beam is usually referred to as optical power limiting and can be used efficiently in sensor protection devices. In this thesis, various nonlinear absorbing platinum(II) acetylides have been synthesized and characterized regarding their photophysical and optical limiting properties. Dendronized platinum(II) acetylides were prepared in order to evaluate the site isolation effect offered by the dendritic surrounding. The photophysical measurements reveal that the dendritic encapsulation enhances the phosphorescence, increases the luminescence lifetimes, and improves the optical limiting performance due to reduced quenching of the excited states. Triazole‐containing chromophores were synthesized using click chemistry to achieve functionalized platinum(II) acetylides. It was found that the position of the triazole unit affects the photophysical properties of these chromophores. The most promising results were obtained for the chromophore with the triazole located {{at the end of the}} conjugation where it may act as an electron donor, thus contributing to improved two‐photon absorption. A branched platinum(II) acetylide was also prepared in order to investigate the effect of multiple conjugated arms as well as multiple heavy atoms within the same molecule on the optical limiting performance. The star shaped chromophore reached the lowest clamping level of all compounds included in this thesis and constitutes a highly suitable chromophore for optical power limiting applications. The nonlinear absorbing chromophores were also incorporated into novel solid state materials based on PMMA. The actual device fabrication of doped organic glasses as optical limiters for sensor protection is presented, and their optical limiting performance is reported. The obtained organic glasses can reduce the transmission of high intensity light by 97 %. QC 2010092...|$|R
