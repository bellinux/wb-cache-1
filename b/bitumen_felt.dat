50|$|The Irish National Inventory of Architectural Heritage {{describes}} the house as:Detached three-bay single-storey over basement gate lodge, c.1850, with three-bay two-storey rear elevation to south. Renovated and refenestrated, c.1950, with single-bay single-storey flat-roofed projecting porch added. Now disused. Hipped slate roof with clay ridge tiles, rendered chimney stacks, and cast-iron rainwater goods on timber eaves. Flat <b>bitumen</b> <b>felt</b> roof to porch with metal rainwater goods. Painted rendered walls with rendered quoins to corners. Square-headed window openings with stone sills, {{and one with}} rendered surround having hood moulding over on consoles. Replacement timber casement windows, c.1950. Square-headed door opening with glazed tongue-and-groove timber panelled door, c.1950. Set back from road in grounds shared with Woodhouse at entrance to estate with side (east) elevation fronting on to road.|$|E
40|$|Two new Finnish {{mitigation}} guides {{have been}} issued. The first guide gives basic information and practical examples on all mitigation {{methods and results}} achieved. The second guide is a detailed guide for design and implementation of sub-slab-depressurization (SSD) in low-rise residential houses. The presentation includes many examples from the guide for SSD and radon well and other methods. The most efficient methods are SSD and radon well, typical radon concentration reduction factors being 70 - 90 %. Radon well is effective only on soils where air permeability is high enough; e. g., on gravel and in esker areas. A single radon well can reduce radon concentration in many dwellings at a distance up to 20 - 30 meters. Sealing entry routes and ventilation or pressure-reduction-based measures resulted in lower reduction factors but {{play an important role}} in mitigation practices. The national prevention guide and results achieved are presented. The guide is based on the following measures: use of <b>bitumen</b> <b>felt</b> in the joint of foundation wall and floor slab, sealing of penetrations and installation of radon piping. Radon prevention is essential and required in the whole country. 1...|$|E
50|$|In modern turf roof construction, <b>bitumen</b> roofing <b>felt</b> {{combined}} with dimpled plastic drainage membranes are usually used {{in place of}} birch bark. <b>Bitumen</b> roofing <b>felt</b> is nailed to the sarking and a dimpled cavity drainage membrane is laid over the top (dimples face down) to form a drainage layer. The turf is then laid over this drainage layer. Turf roofs are still widely used on newly built cabins in Norway.|$|R

It deals with the factors affecting the choice of <b>bitumens</b> and <b>felts</b> for the roof covering only, and compares several methods of felt application.

40|$|Diffuse {{pollution}} {{sources have}} been recognised by the European Water Framework Directive to significantly contribute to pollution of stormwater receivers. Stormwater runoff {{is considered to}} represent diffuse pollution sources. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the contributions of specific sources in the urban environment to the content of organic and inorganic pollutants in stormwater. This was done by conducting laboratory screening tests of several conventional roofing materials and coatings to determine which pollutants they release and how they might contribute to the deterioration of stormwater quality. The studied pollutants include metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, pesticides, nonylphenols and –ethoxylates. Many of the studied roofing materials, e. g. roofing shingle, a PVC sheet and a <b>bitumen</b> paste for <b>felt</b> roof maintenance, exhibited the potential to release several of these substances into stormwater runoff. However, phthalates were not released from any of the studied materials under the tested conditions. In addition, quite similar materials exhibited rather different substance release profiles.
