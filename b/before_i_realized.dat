500|$|Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was {{recommended}} {{by a friend}} of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed {{the sound of the}} nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, [...] "We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined." [...] On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage {{for the first time at}} the Cabaret Metro.|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E
60|$|She was comforted {{long before}} I left her. But as I {{stepped out into}} the street again a man accosted me. Evidently he had been on the watch, {{awaiting}} me. He fell into step beside me almost <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> his presence. It was Escovedo.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, the Chicago band TURNT {{mentions}} St. Cecilia in its song, [...] "Girls": [...] "Saint Cecilia {{shows her}} psalms; And {{makes me laugh}} till <b>I</b> feel dumb; <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it's wrong; The record needle lifts and she's gone." ...|$|R
60|$|Thurid {{was beside}} her now--pushing past to reach me first, {{and then what}} {{happened}} happened so quickly that it was all over <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>realize</b> the truth of it.|$|R
60|$|Hardly {{five minutes}} passed <b>before</b> <b>I</b> {{heard a sound}} that filled me with alarm. The ropes holding the {{schooner}} fast to the dock were loosed, the sails were hoisted, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>realize</b> it we were once more under way.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{with a quick}} movement, {{he flung}} open the shutter and had leaped through almost <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> his purpose. His swift bound served to bewilder me, and I stood gazing out, with my rifle raised, not realizing the {{necessity}} of closing the opening.|$|E
60|$|I started violently at {{the sound}} of my name, at the new note in her voice, at the change in the woman as I turned. And then <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> what she had done she had come to me swiftly and laid her hand upon my arm.|$|E
60|$|We {{had hardly}} got well upon the street <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> the {{enormous}} change that total prohibition had effected. Everywhere were the bright smiling faces of working people, laughing and singing at their tasks, and, early though it was, cracking jokes and asking one another riddles as they worked.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{then brought}} from a {{cupboard}} a most curious instrument, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>realize</b> {{what had happened}} I found myself thrown upon a screen in a highly-magnified state--even as you now behold me.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time I {{do not wish to}} be the means of making you unhappy, as surely would be the result were I to marry you without love. Let us wait until I know myself better. Though you have spoken to me of the matter <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> now that <b>I</b> never have made any effort to {{determine}} whether or not I really can love you. There is time enough before we reach civilization, if ever we are fortunate enough to do so at all. Will you not be as generous as you are brave, and give me a few days <b>before</b> <b>I</b> must make you a final answer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You be? Well, I don't see why I say that, eitha! You're full lahge {{enough for}} your age, but not seein' you in long dresses <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>realize</b> your age so much. My, {{but you do}} all of {{you know how to}} do things!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> {{what had}} happened, the iron {{had been struck}} from my leg, I was mounted on a horse, and, with Gil at my side, I was {{galloping}} out of Saragossa by the gate of Santa Engracia, and breasting the slopes with little cause to fear pursuit just yet, such was the disorder we had left behind.|$|E
60|$|I {{must have}} {{remained}} there fully two minutes, shouting at intervals, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> the truth. Then I dropped {{the receiver and}} leaned limply against the wall. For the moment I was as stunned as if I had received a blow. I could not even think. It was only by degrees that I recovered sufficiently to understand that Audrey was speaking to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> {{the initial}} steps of my undertaking, {{anticipated}} perplexities had been {{absorbed by the}} novel conditions of our journey. Four days away from the old home and New York found me happier than for months, when I saw {{for the first time}} a flush upon the pallid cheeks of my child, the faintest reflection of the coveted boon I sought.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "You {{were out of}} the door <b>before</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>realized</b> what was going on, and it didn't seem {{altogether}} wise to commence talking when you came back, but that's not the point. You haven't answered my question." ...|$|R
60|$|Turning {{over all}} these various {{considerations}} {{in my mind}} with anxious hesitancy, the ten minutes managed to pass away almost <b>before</b> <b>I</b> had thoroughly <b>realized</b> the deep gravity of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was a {{long time}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>realize</b> my horrible position. For several minutes I had no idea of {{attempting}} to escape the consequences of my deed. Then a light broke upon me. Had anybody seen her since she left the Three Tranters? Had they not, she was already believed by the parishioners to be dust and ashes. I should never be found out.|$|R
60|$|When I {{started down}} towards the lake, after baiting the bull's fury awhile by shaking the paddle and {{splashing}} water at him, he followed me along the bank, keeping up his threatening demonstrations. Down near the lake he plunged suddenly ahead <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> the danger, splashed {{out into the}} narrow opening {{in front of the}} canoe--and there I was, trapped.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} say. I asked them and, of course, they were vague. Or {{perhaps it was}} just that I could not understand. It {{involves}} a projector for the focussing of thought and, even more than that, conscious attention {{on the part of both}} projector and receptor. It was quite a while <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> they were trying to think at me. Such thought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Sergeant Mackay, and he {{must not}} come in here," [...] said my {{companion}} with a nervous laugh, as {{she glanced at the}} shattered bureau. [...] "Is it quite impossible for you to hurry?" [...] Then <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> what was happening, she had placed one hand on my shoulder and positively hustled me out of the door. Hardly knowing what I did, I clutched at the little fingers, and missed them, and the next moment I plunged violently into the astonished sergeant.|$|E
60|$|A shaggy Indian pony came ambling {{around the}} corner between the long shafts of a charette. A bareheaded young man in tow shirt and {{trousers}} was driving, and three laughing girls were seated on the stools in the cart behind him. Suddenly, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>realized</b> what had happened, the young man pulled up the pony, the girls fell silent, and Nick {{was standing in the}} middle of the road, with his hat in his hand, bowing elaborately.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked me}} over rather sharply <b>before</b> replying. Then <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> {{for the first}} time that my {{appearance}} was not of the best. My clothes were considerably the worse for having rolled over and over in the old tool house, and in escaping from my prison I had made several rents in my coat.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the fair}} opened, {{a few minutes}} before 5 p.m., Leona Rostenberg {{wondered}} out loud what we had all wondered silently: would our fair attract any visitors at all? Then, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> had <b>realized</b> it, she had ducked outside to see whether anyone had come. When she returned, her face reflected radiance and disbelief. ‘They're standing in line to get in! There are crowds outside!’ Despite rain and storm, the jams of people on opening night filled us with incredulity and exuberance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{that was}} a sad experience," [...] {{asserted}} the Tin Woodman soberly. [...] "I {{was caught in a}} rainstorm while chopping down a tree for exercise, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> it, I was firmly rusted in every joint. There I stood, axe in hand, but unable to move, for days and weeks and months! Indeed, I have never known exactly how long the time was; but finally along came Dorothy and I was saved. See! This is the very tree I was chopping at the time I rusted." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> it I was at {{the foot}} of the slope, in a narrow canyon bed, full of rocks and trees, with the din of roaring water in my ears. I could hear nothing else. Tracks were everywhere, and when I came to the first open place I was thrilled. The grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into the water, and there he had fought the hounds. Signs of that battle were easy to read. I saw where his huge tracks, still wet, led up the {{opposite}} sandy bank.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{and then}} the most {{legitimate}} business runs out of luck. It was out in Arkansas I made the wrong turn at a cross-road, and drives into this town of Peavine by mistake. It seems I had already assaulted and disfigured Peavine the spring of the year before. I had sold $600 worth of young fruit trees there--plums, cherries, peaches and pears. The Peaviners were {{keeping an eye on}} the country road and hoping I might pass that way again. I drove down Main street as far as the Crystal Palace drugstore <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> I had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse Bill.|$|E
5000|$|After {{nine years}} in Hollywood, he {{returned}} home and left his career. [...] "I realized that God had moved in my life like never <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> really <b>realized</b> what God {{and the power of}} Jesus Christ was," [...] he said on The 700 Club. By 1986, he was divorced and became a born-again Christian and began to devote much of his time to working with charitable causes. He is married to his second wife, Kimberlee Autry; the couple have three children.|$|R
5000|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one thing I noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct ... But <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it, <b>I</b> was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. ... I looked at all the people on the set ... and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes I think I {{might have}} tried harder," [...] she said. [...] "At least I might have {{understood}} better. I was stupid. But everything went wrong. And I saw you growing {{away from me}} all the time, Hugh, growing away from the friends who were fond of you, as though you were fading in the distance. It wasn't wholly because--because of Nancy that I left you. That gave me an excuse--an excuse for myself. Long <b>before</b> that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> my helplessness, <b>I</b> knew that whatever I might have done was past doing." ...|$|R
60|$|The song ceased with a {{sound that}} was half laughter, half sigh. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> what he was doing, Nick, instead of {{retracing}} his steps towards the house, started forward. The path led through a dense thicket which became a casino hedge, and suddenly I found myself peering over his shoulder into a little garden bewildering in color. In {{the centre of the}} garden a great live-oak spread its sheltering branches. Around the gnarled trunk was a seat. And on the seat,--her sewing fallen into her lap, her lips parted, her eyes staring wide, sat the young lady whom we had seen on the levee the evening before. And Nick was making a bow in his grandest manner.|$|E
60|$|The doctor, I believe, relied chiefly on the scavengers. He {{thought they}} were sure to pounce upon the scrap soon. I did not, however, see why I should fear them. They came into the square so seldom, and stayed so short {{a time when they}} did come, that I disregarded them. If the doctor knew how much they kept away he might say I bribed them. But perhaps he knew their ways. I got a fright one day from a dog. It was one of those low-looking animals that infest the square {{occasionally}} in half-dozens, but seldom alone. It ran up one of the side streets, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> what had happened it had the paper in its mouth. Then it stood still and looked around. For me that was indeed a trying moment. I stood at the window.|$|E
6000|$|With {{all these}} anxieties I loved {{the school and}} could hardly be wrested from it even for a day. I bent to my books with eagerness, I joined a debating society, and I took a hand at all the games. The days went by on golden, noiseless, {{ball-bearing}} axles--and almost <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> it, winter was upon the land. But oh! the luxury of that winter, with no snow drifts to climb, no corn-stalks to gather and no long walk to school. It was sweet to wake each morning in the shelter of our little house and know that another day of delightful schooling was ours. Our hands softened and lightened. Our walk became each day less of a [...] "galumping plod." [...] The companionship of bright and interesting young people, {{and the study of}} well-dressed men and women in attendance upon lectures and socials was a part of our instruction and had their refining effect upon us, graceless colts though we were.|$|E
6000|$|... “I am sure, my dear. I {{would not}} admit it, but I knew it then—and still, perhaps, I had excuses. The man was {{of my own}} blood, and I had meant, when he had proved his right to it, to do {{something}} for him. Tony is generous, and would not have grudged what I purposed to spare for him. It was a crushing blow, and left me scarcely capable of thinking, while <b>before</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>realized</b> it the thing was done, and I had become an accessory to the escape of a criminal.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Anita Pointer recalled, [...] "'Fire' became Pointer Sisters' first gold single: {{we had had}} gold albums <b>before</b> but <b>I</b> didn't <b>realize</b> what a {{difference}} a gold single made 'causethat one song played over and over all over the world. 'Fire' really became a major hit for us and made a total difference in our career." ...|$|R
