5000|$|When drawing, {{the plate}} is held {{securely}} in a vise or other fixture. Annealed wire is filed {{at one end}} to give it an initial taper. The tapered end is inserted into a hole with a final diameter just smaller than its current width. Special pliers, called draw tongs are used to hold {{the tip of the}} wire and pull it through, sometimes with the aid of grease or wax as a lubricant. Small diameter wire may be drawn manually, while very thick wire may require a drawing bench with a crank. Often, a wire can be drawn three times in a row before it needs to be re-annealed. This must be done because drawing wire work-hardens it, which causes the wire to become brittle. <b>Brittle</b> <b>wire</b> that has not been annealed may snap during the drawing process (or develop microscopic or macroscopic cracks, which may weaken the piece or [...] "grow" [...] with further working).|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} used because the {{high-temperature}} superconductors are too <b>brittle</b> for normal <b>wire</b> forming processes. The tubes are metal, often silver. Often the tubes are heated to react {{the mix of}} powders. Once reacted the tubes are sometimes flattened to form a tape-like conductor. The resulting wire is not as flexible as conventional metal wire, but is sufficient for many applications.|$|R
40|$|The United States general {{aviation}} fleet is aging with aircraft manufactured 35 – 39 years ago representing {{the most prevalent}} group. Since older aircraft {{are more prone to}} airframe corrosion, fatigue, and <b>brittle</b> electrical <b>wiring,</b> the present study was undertaken to determine whether malfunction-related accidents for {{general aviation}} aircraft manufactured between 1970 and 1984 were elevated relative to airplanes produced more recently (2000 – 2014). The NTSB aviation accident database was used to identify piston-powered airplane accidents occurring over the 2005 – 2014 period. Aircraft manufacture year and fleet activity data were from the FAA. Statistical analyses employed contingency tables and Poisson distributions. The proportion of malfunction-related accidents was unchanged (p = 0. 219) for aircraft manufactured over the two periods (12. 2...|$|R
30|$|At higher {{operating}} temperature (450  h at 700  °C) the structures formed were more intensive; all {{surfaces of the}} wire had changed; however, the structures were smaller (Fig.  5 d). Wires at the anode side behaved differently. Some faceting was visible, but significant wire area became porous (Fig.  5 c). This part of the wire was only 10  mm from the anode connection (presented in Fig.  4), and after damage to the glass the coating was exposed to the dual atmosphere. The damage to the silver wire microstructure was observed even 10  mm {{from the point of}} wire exposure to the dual air–fuel atmosphere after long operational time. After several hours of operation, silver <b>wires</b> became <b>brittle.</b> This affected the mechanical strength and integrity. Even low physical stress could break the wire. This is important if a stack with silver wires is considered for an APU unit in vehicles where the system must resist vibrational stresses and strains. A cell with such <b>brittle</b> <b>wires</b> would be prone to damage caused by vibration. The risk of breaking the wire connection is significant. All these problems with silver will lead to degradation of the cell structural stability and in long-term operation to the degradation of the cell/stack performance. Zhong et al. [12] using Ag mesh for cathode current collector did not observe this type of degradation. However, they used Pt paste to improve the strength of the connection, and the test time was short. Silver commercially available has the purity of 99.95 %. Silver is rarely used by industry in pure form caused by its softness and susceptibility to damage. Also for SOFC application, silver alloys should be considered instead of pure silver. Where higher strength at elevated temperature is required, silver-palladium alloys are more suitable; however, that would increase the cost. Also the application of Ag(Al) alloys can enhance the thermal stability of silver [31]. The addition of aluminium reduces silver agglomeration at elevated temperature and prevents diffusion of silver into the matrix of support material. Wires with high Ni, Fe or Cr content are less suitable because of formation of a nonconductive oxide layer and reduced conductivity between the cathode and the interconnect. The addition of other elements and alloy formation on the silver surface may be the solution for application of silver current collectors in SOFC. Silver wires coated with gold are slightly more expensive than pure silver.|$|R
2500|$|Initially these {{telegraph}} {{lines were}} only constructed for temporary use {{because of the}} <b>brittle</b> exposed copper <b>wire</b> that was used. [...] But, after insulated wire began to be used, permanent lines were built. [...] The Telegraph Construction Corps would load a coil of this wire on a mule's back and lead it straight forward to unreel the wire. [...] As the mule moved forward unwinding the wire, two men followed and hung the line on fences and bushes {{so that it would}} not be run over until it was propped up with pikes. [...] Because these lines were so vulnerable to Confederate wire tapping and cutting, cavalry patrols kept guard of the wires when they were being built in an area lacking in Union soldiers. [...] Over the course of the war, the Telegraph Construction Corps built a total of 15, 389 miles of field, land, and submarine telegraph lines.|$|R
