5|$|A {{version of}} deep-fried butter {{on a stick}} debuted at the Iowa State Fair 2011, which was {{prepared}} using frozen butter that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until <b>browned,</b> <b>and</b> then topped with a confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction on a stick was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried butter has also been served on a stick at the State Fair of Texas.|$|E
25|$|It is {{traditionally}} shaped by {{hand into the}} form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a <b>browned</b> <b>and</b> sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.|$|E

Any colour will do for some people, if it is <b>browned</b> <b>and</b> shining; but fallacy in dead colour is detected on the instant. I even believe that whenever a painter begins to wish that he could touch any portion of his work with gum, he is going wrong.|$|E

6000|$|There {{never was}} such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, <b>browned,</b> <b>and</b> decorated.

As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was holding out both his hands to me.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{the youth}} returned. His manner had {{changed from a}} boisterous and jaunty {{demeanour}} to one of grave and attentive courtesy—I had become his guest. He led me into the gloomy hall, seated me upon a large carpeted Mastabah, or platform, and told his bara Miyan[FN#2] (great Sir), the Hindustani porter, to bring a light. [p.160] Meanwhile a certain shuffling of slippered feet above informed my ears that the Kabirah,[FN#3] the mistress of the house, was intent on hospitable thoughts. When the camels were unloaded, appeared a dish of fine vermicelli, <b>browned</b> <b>and</b> powdered with loaf sugar. The boy Mohammed, I, and Shaykh Nur, lost no time in exerting our right hands; and truly, after our hungry journey, we found the Kunafah delicious. After the meal we procured cots from a neighbouring coffee-house, and we lay down, weary, and anxious to snatch {{an hour or two}} of repose. At dawn we were expected to perform our Tawaf al-Kudum, or “Circumambulation of Arrival,” at the Harim.|$|E
60|$|The pulp of the bread-fruit {{between the}} rind and the core is all eatable. The core itself, {{which is about}} {{the size and shape of}} the handle of a knife, is uneatable. The bread-fruit is never eaten raw. The usual mode of {{dressing}} it is to remove the rind and the core, divide the pulp into three or four pieces, and bake it in an oven similar to the one just described. When taken out, in somewhat less than an hour, the outside of the fruit is nicely <b>browned,</b> <b>and</b> the inner part so strongly resembles the crumb of wheaten bread as to have suggested the name of the tree. It is not, however, quite so pleasant to the taste, being rather insipid and slightly sweet. Nevertheless it is extremely good for food, and is much prized by the natives, to whom it may almost be said to be the staff of life.|$|E
60|$|On {{the cold}} and rainy evening of Thursday, the 26th of October, in the year {{previously}} indicated, such travellers as might have chanced to be abroad in that bitter night, might have remarked a fellow-wayfarer journeying on the road from Oberwinter to Godesberg. He was a man not tall in stature, but of the most athletic proportions, and Time, which had <b>browned</b> <b>and</b> furrowed his cheek and sprinkled his locks with gray, declared pretty clearly that He must have been acquainted with the warrior for some fifty good years. He was armed in mail, and rode a powerful and active battle-horse, which (though the way the pair had come that day was long and weary indeed,) yet supported the warrior, his armor and luggage, with seeming ease. As {{it was in a}} friend's country, the knight did not think fit to wear his heavy destrier, or helmet, which hung at his saddlebow over his portmanteau. Both were marked with the coronet of a count; and from the crown which surmounted the helmet, rose the crest of his knightly race, an arm proper lifting a naked sword.|$|E
