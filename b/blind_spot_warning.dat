40|$|Detection {{of moving}} objects in a road imagery {{is useful for}} car driving assistance. In this paper, we {{investigate}} the correlation among motion vectors (MV) in onboard-acquired images and develop a method for providing collision warning in lateral directions. By comparing motion vectors in each block, moving objects with different speeds can be separated from a dynamic background. In order to reduce computational load, a from-coarse-to-fine mechanism has been adopted into the block-matching motion estimation process. Furthermore, a dynamic thresholding technique {{has been applied to}} adapt to various environmental conditions such as light variation and image sticking. Experiment results show that the proposed method is effective for <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> collision <b>warning</b> and driving assistance...|$|R
40|$|Car Driver Assisted for <b>Blind</b> <b>Spot</b> System is invented {{to observe}} the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> region and alert the driver {{automatically}} to ensure the driver safety on highway due to the driver inability {{to observe the}} <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> area directly which had caused many accident occur. Eventually, the system is built {{from a combination of}} a circuit and programming software of microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor. In this project, 2 ultrasonic sensors will be put at the right side of a car because the risk of danger in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is higher at the driver side. The sensors will be put on the lateral side of the front and rear side of a car to check the incoming vehicle at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> The sensors will be activated at a certain speed and when both sensors detect a vehicle at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> a <b>warning</b> system will trigger. An indicator light or LED located at the side mirror will be used as visual warning system while a buzzer will be used as audio warning system which can be install inside the car. Hence, the system will help a driver to drive safely and prevent any fatal accident involving <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> As the result, the statistic for accident can be lower. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Vision-based {{intelligent}} vehicle applications {{often require}} {{large amounts of}} memory to handle video streaming and image processing, which in turn increases complexity of hardware and software. This paper presents an FPGA implement of a vision-based <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> <b>warning</b> system. Using video frames, the information of the blind spot area turns into one-dimensional information. Analysis of the estimated entropy of image allows the detection of an object in time. This idea has been implemented in the XtremeDSP video starter kit. The <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> <b>warning</b> system uses only 13 % of its logic resources and 95 k bits block memory, and its frame rate is over 30 frames per sec (fps).

30|$|The ASV (Advanced Safety Vehicle) project, co-funded by the Japanese government, {{focuses on}} {{several aspects of}} road safety (e.g. {{autonomous}} driving technologies, accident avoidance technologies, damage mitigating technologies, and post-collision injury mitigation). The project was articulated in several subsequent phases, each focusing on specific systems. ASV- 3, the third phase of the project, proposed an ARAS System based on inter-vehicle communication able to connect and share considerable information between vehicles (relative position, relative speed and so forth). The associated HMI system is comprised of an Head Up Display, a display for rear view camera, speakers and a microphone integrated in the helmet. The ARAS functions included intersection accident avoidance and <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> assistance, and <b>warnings</b> to the rider were transmitted through visual and acoustic signals. The head up display showed a representation of PTW surrounding area split in several sectors: the enlightened sector indicated {{the direction of the}} oncoming vehicle. Each information/warning on the head up display was also replicated using an audio signal or a short vocal message [11].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{competing}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed for the cortical representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These are: (i) the regions surrounding the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> maintain their spatial values; (ii) the {{opposite sides of the}} <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are represented adjacently at the cortex, so that the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is “sewn-up”; and (iii) the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is sewn-up with compensation occurring in the immediate surround of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> so that spatial values are distorted only in the immediate surround of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> To distinguish between these hypotheses we used a two-dot alignment task, with the two dots straddling the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> at varying dot separations. Thresholds in the two-dot alignment task are limited by the cortical separation of the two dots. When thresholds for alignment across the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are compared with thresholds over intact retina at the same eccentricity, the three hypotheses predict: (i) no change in thresholds; (ii) a lowering of thresholds; and (iii) a lowering of thresholds but only at separations slightly greater than the diameter of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Thresoolds across the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were closely similar to thresholds across intact retina. The results do not support a sewing-up (with or without compensation) of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Rather, our results are consistent with a preservation of spatial values around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{usually do}} not notice the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> a receptor-free region on the retina. Stimuli {{extending}} through the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> appear filled in. However, if an object does not reach through but ends in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> it is perceived as "cut off" at the boundary. Here we show that even {{when there is no}} corresponding stimulation at opposing edges of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> well known motion-induced position shifts also extend into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and elicit a dynamic filling-in process that allows spatial structure to be extrapolated into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> We presented observers with sinusoidal gratings that drifted into or out of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> or flickered in counterphase. Gratings moving into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were perceived to be longer than those moving out of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> or flickering, revealing motion-dependent filling-in. Further, observers could perceive more of a grating's spatial structure inside the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> than would be predicted from simple filling-in of luminance information from the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> edge. This is evidence for a dynamic filling-in process that uses spatiotemporal information from the motion system to extrapolate visual percepts into the scotoma of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Our findings also provide further support for the notion that an explicit spatial shift of topographic representations contributes to motion-induced position illusions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reliability}} of visual filling-in at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{and how it}} is influenced by the distribution of spatial attention in and around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were studied. Our data suggest that visual filling-in at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is 1) less reliable than it has been assumed, and 2) easier under diffused attention around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> than under focal attention restricted in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These findings put important constraints on understanding the filling-in in terms of its neural substantiation. Recent neurophysiological studies suggest that V 1 neurons corresponding to the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> in retinotopic map extend their receptive fields far beyond the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and are not silent during the filling-in (Komatsu, Kinoshita, and Murakami, 2000). For those neurons to subserve filling-in, it may be crucially important for top-down attention to match their receptive fields. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT−This paper {{describes}} a real-time vision-based <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> <b>warning</b> {{system that has}} been specially designed for motorcycles detection in both daytime and nighttime conditions. Motorcycles are fast moving and small vehicles that frequently remain unseen to other drivers, mainly in the blind-spot area. In fact, although {{in recent years the}} number of fatal accidents has decreased overall, motorcycle accidents have increased by 20 %. The risks are primarily linked to the inner characteristics of this mode of travel: motorcycles are fast moving vehicles, light, unstable and fragile. These features make the motorcycle detection problem a difficult but challenging task to be solved from the computer vision point of view. In this paper we present a daytime and nighttime vision-based motorcycle and car detection system in the blind spot area using a single camera installed on the side mirror. On the one hand, daytime vehicle detection is carried out using optical flow features and Support Vector Machine-based (SVM) classification. On the other hand, nighttime vehicle detection is based on head lights detection. The proposed system warns the driver about the presence of vehicles in the blind area, including information about the position and the type of vehicle. Extensive experiments have been carried out in 172 minutes of sequences recorded in real traffic scenarios in both daytime and nighttime conditions, {{in the context of the}} Valencia MotoGP Grand Prix 2009...|$|E
40|$|Inter {{vehicular}} {{collision avoidance}} systems warn vehicle drivers of potential collisions. The U. S Department of Transportation (USDOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in February 2014 {{has decided to}} enable vehicular communication among lightweight vehicles to exchange warning messages to prevent accidents. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is a communication standard that allows short-range communication between vehicles and infrastructure, exchanging critical safety information to avoid collision. DSRC safety applications include forward collision warning, sudden brake warning and <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> <b>warning</b> among many other warnings. It {{is also important to}} exchange location information between vehicles and pedestrians to avoid accidents. To exchange safety messages using DSRC, dedicated equipment is required. Pedestrians may not benefit from DSRC, as they may not carry dedicated DSRC safety equipment with them. Wi-Fi Direct technology can be used as an alternate to DSRC to exchange safety messages. Wi-Fi Direct enabled smartphones can exchange important safety information without the need of additional equipment. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) connections are formed between Wi-Fi Direct devices to exchange safety information. The Group Owner acts as the access point through which all clients communicate. This work examines how Wi-Fi Direct can be used in vehicular environment to exchange basic safety information between smartphones of vehicle drivers. Wi-Fi Direct and DSRC transmission delays are calculated are calculated. The results show, with more devices in a Wi-Fi Direct group the congestion in the network increases due to unnecessary retransmissions through the group owner. As mitigation, a broadcast method is proposed to reduce the delay. The results illustrate that the P 2 P group can now accommodate more vehicles and the delay is lesser. The calculations are extended to compute the transmission delay when P 2 P groups of same size exchange safety messages. The results help analyse the limitations of the system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe human natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{is usually}} filled in {{based on the}} contextual information. When two {{sufficiently}} different images are presented to the two eyes, observers typically perceive an alternation between the two images (binocular rivalry). Both the filling-in process and binocular rivalry {{have been the subject}} of considerable research. This study investigates whether filled information in one eye's natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> can contribute to binocular rivalry. A radial grating (D= 12 °) was presented to one eye, centered on the natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Observers perceived a complete figure in monocular view; the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> area was filled-in based on the surrounding information. Simultaneously, a circular grating smaller than the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> (D= 4 °), was presented to the fellow eye in the region corresponding to the other eye's <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> The amount of rivalry as indexed by how often the smaller circular grating remained visible was measured. The results suggest that the filled information in the area of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> does contribute to the rivalry process...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{mechanism}} that mediates perceptual filling-in of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{is still under}} discussion. One hypothesis proposes that the cortical representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is activated only under conditions that elicit perceptual filling-in, and requires congruent stimulation {{on both sides of}} the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Alternatively, the passive remapping hypothesis proposes that inputs from regions surrounding the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> infiltrate the representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> in cortex. This theory predicts that independent stimuli presented to the left and right of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> should lead to neighboring/overlapping activations in visual cortex when the blind-spot eye is stimulated, but separated activations when the fellow eye is stimulated. Using functional MRI, we directly tested the remapping hypothesis by presenting flickering checkerboard wedges to the left or right of the spatial location of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> either to the blind-spot eye or to the fellow eye. Irrespective of which eye was stimulated, we found separate activations corresponding to the left and right wedges. We identified the centroid of the activations on a cortical flat map and measured the distance between activations. Distance measure...|$|R
