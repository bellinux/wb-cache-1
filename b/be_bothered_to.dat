He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).|$|E
500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> even think about girls' hair styles". At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".|$|E
500|$|Millett's 1971 film Three Lives is a 16mm {{documentary}} {{made by an}} all-woman crew, including co-director Susan Kleckner, cameraperson Lenore Bode, {{and editor}} Robin Mide, under the name Women's Liberation Cinema. The 70-minute film focuses on three women—Mallory Millett-Jones, the director's sister; Lillian Shreve, a chemist; and Robin Mide, an artist—reminiscing about their lives. Vincent Canby, The New York Times art critic, wrote: [...] "Three Lives is a good, simple movie in that it can't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> call attention to itself, only to its three subjects, and to how they grew in the same male-dominated society that Miss Millett, in her Sexual Politics, so systematically tore apart, shook up, ridiculed and undermined—while, apparently, tickling it pink." [...] It received [...] "generally excellent reviews" [...] following its premiere at a New York City theater.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "loose story" [...] of [...] "Tom and Gerri" [...] {{was written}} {{originally}} as a two-hour play while Shearsmith and Pemberton {{were on the}} dole and sharing a flat, prior {{to the production of}} League of Gentlemen. The story was inspired by their experiences in this environment. The character of Tom has his [...] "life energy" [...] drained in the same way that, the writers suggest, is experienced by jobhunters. The [...] "sinister" [...] atmosphere of the episode is meant to evoke the feeling that a person has when they [...] "can't quite manage to leave the flat" [...] and they [...] "can't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> tidy up". [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] ended up [...] "quite different" [...] from the play, which featured a character much like Pauline from The League of Gentlemen. Pemberton described the feel of the episode as Pinteresque, comparing it to Harold Pinter's A Slight Ache. This sentiment was echoed by critic Gareth Lightfoot, writing in Teesside's Evening Gazette.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not allowed {{to say anything about}} anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media {{suggested}} that [...] "the hypertreatment of the voice, {{the way it}} edges into the music, suggests {{that the price of}} fame is identity erasure. We understand her through a filter, and that's how we have to hear her too. The multiple backing vox fragment identity further, turn the song more universal". Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic also picked it as one of the album's highlights. Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone named it the best track of the album along with [...] "Freakshow", deeming it as a [...] "tabloid-bashing banger". Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that [...] "Bloodshy & Avant try desperately to craft a defiant anthem for this tabloid fixture, as she couldn't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> write one on her own". Chris Wasser from the Irish Independent said the song [...] "drowns slowly under cloggy production and a lyrical theme that for all of its close connection with the trials and tribulations Spears has had to deal with, weren't even penned by the singer who could have very easily recorded her fairly unchallenging input on Blackout in less than a week." [...] The song was later included in Rolling Stones 100 Best Songs of 2007 at number fifteen.|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{returned}} to touring, playing larger venues, receiving more profit {{and dealing with}} less friendship, miscommunication, and spiraling drug problems. This culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with the Grateful Dead at Washington's RFK Stadium in June 1973, {{which resulted in the}} firing of three of the band's longtime roadies. The band played arenas and stadiums almost solely as their drug use escalated. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting the Starship, a customized Boeing 720B used by Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. [...] "When [...] got that goddamn plane, {{it was the beginning of}} the end," [...] said Allman. Both Allman and Betts released top-20 solo albums in 1974 (The Gregg Allman Tour and Highway Call). The sessions that produced 1975's Win, Lose or Draw, the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent; Gregg Allman was largely living in Los Angeles and dating pop star Cher, and was, according to biographer Alan Paul, [...] " [...] more famous for being famous than for his music." [...] His vocals were recorded there, as he could not <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> return to Macon much. Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were [...] "embarrassed" [...] about the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{family was}} crudely drawn, because Groening had {{submitted}} basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. The entire Simpson family was {{designed so that}} they would be recognizable in silhouette. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his own initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. Marge's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue. Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and [...] "not thinking that [...] would eventually be drawn in color" [...] gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head. Lisa's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline. While designing Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> even think about girls' hair styles". When designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color". Groening storyboarded and scripted every short (now known as The Simpsons shorts), which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer, both of whom would later become directors on the series.|$|E

2500|$|Grass's {{work has}} tended to divide the critics into those who have {{considered}} his experiments and style to be sublime {{and those who have}} found it to be tied down by his political posturing. Particularly American critics such as John Updike have found the mixture of politics and social critique in his works to diminish its artistic qualities. In his various critiques of Grass's works, Updike wrote that Grass had been consumed by his [...] "strenuous career as celebrity-author-artist-Socialist" [...] and about one of his later novels that [...] "he can't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> write a novel; he just sends dispatches ... from the front lines of his engagement".

2500|$|Vocals were {{recorded}} at Lancaster's house and Duce's flat, which were engineered by Lancaster.

[...] By mid-August, Duce {{said the group}} were [...] "about seven songs in," [...] and were planning on having 10 songs completed.

[...] The deadline for album was during a European tour with You Me at Six, during which, the band were listening to mixes done by Lancaster.

While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to [...] "examine aspects of the human condition", he said the episode was [...] "also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre – 'not-so-science fiction'". Though part of the fun of the show is [...] "obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon", he believed that, [...] "When [...] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn’t <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look like an idiot, and...ruins part of the believability of the show." ...|$|E
