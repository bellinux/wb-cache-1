5|$|After losing {{two teams}} {{at the end}} of the 2008–09 season the Elite League was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> a new {{franchise}} joining the league. Braehead Clan were announced as the ninth team from the 2010–11 season. On 27 April 2010, Dundee Stars were unanimously accepted into the League by the EIHL board as the tenth team.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the arrival}} of serious competitors—namely, the Ford Falcon, Chrysler Valiant, and Japanese cars—in the 1960s, Holden's locally {{produced}} large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to Indonesia, Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa in complete knock down form.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1950s Josquin's {{reputation}} {{has been}} <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> the increasing availability of recordings, {{of which there}} are many, and the rise of ensembles specializing in the performance of 16th century vocal music, many of which place Josquin's output at the heart of their repertoire.|$|E
40|$|Boosting {{has been}} shown to improve the {{performance}} of classifiers in many situations, including when data is im-balanced. There are, however, two possible implementa-tions of boosting, and it is unclear which should be used. <b>Boosting</b> <b>by</b> reweighting is typically used, but can only be applied to base learners which are designed to handle ex-ample weights. On the other hand, <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> resampling can be applied to any base learner. In this work, we empir-ically evaluate the differences between these two boosting implementations using imbalanced training data. Using 10 boosting algorithms, 4 learners and 15 datasets, we find that <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> resampling performs as well as, or signif-icantly better than, <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> reweighting (which is of-ten the default boosting implementation). We therefore con-clude that in general, <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> resampling is preferred over <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> weighting. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{empirical}} comparison of algorithm AdaBoost with its modification called MadaBoost {{suitable for the}} <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> filtering framework. In the <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> filtering one obtains an unweighted sample at each stage that is randomly drawn from the current modified distribution {{in contrast with the}} <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> subsampling where one uses a weighted sample at each stage. A boosting algorithm for the filtering framework might be very useful in situations where we have a very large dataset and we want to reduce the running time of the base learner using random sampling. AdaBoost was originally designed for <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> subsampling and it can be shown that is not suitable for <b>boosting</b> <b>by</b> filtering since generating a new sample at each iteration from the modified distribution might take exponential time. The modification we propose is very simple, we just bound the weights at each step using its initial value as a saturation bound so they weights cannot become arbitrarily [...] ...|$|R

5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> the appearance of Chow Yun-fat early {{on the morning of}} 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E
5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would publicise the campaign and provide a reason to justify preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|As {{oil prices}} rose during the 1990s, Fairbanks' economy improved. The city was also <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> the {{regrowth}} of gold mining in the area. The Fort Knox Gold Mine north of Fairbanks opened in 1997 {{after several years}} of development, and another gold prospect is likely to be developed in the next decade. The same year that Fort Knox Mine opened, Alyeska moved 300 jobs from Anchorage to Fairbanks, making the city the base of its operations {{for the first time in}} several decades.|$|E

5|$|<b>Boosted</b> <b>by</b> this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's five wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, EVA Air was {{providing}} regular service to 22 destinations worldwide, and carrying over 3 million passengers annually. In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> its safety record, {{in contrast to}} its primary competitor, China Airlines. In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification {{in the areas of}} Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.|$|E

5|$|The Tudor era saw {{prominent}} {{artists as}} part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this. Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson. The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of {{rudimentary}} training followed {{under the tutelage of}} members of the Australian Instructional Corps. This was completed by April 1940, and that month the battalion– under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey, a First World War veteran who had previously commanded the 23rd/21st Battalion– embarked for the Middle East on the transport ship Neuralia, departing from Port Melbourne and sailing via Fremantle, Colombo, Aden and the Suez Canal. At this time it was attached to the 17th Brigade, which was assigned to the 6th Division. Recruited from Victoria– although at various times the battalion's composition was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> recruits from other states– the 17th also consisted of the 2/5th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg was {{the largest}} city in Jutland until it was surpassed by Aarhus in the mid-19th century. In 1672, it had 4,181 inhabitants, growing slowly during the 18th century, with 4,425 in 1769, 4,866 in 1787 and 5,579 by 1801. By 1845, there were 7,477 inhabitants, {{increasing}} to 10,069 by 1860. Dramatic growth {{began in the late}} 19th century, with an increase from 14,152 in 1880 to 31,457 in 1901. By 1930, the population had grown to 59,091, although the figure was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> the merging of Nørre Tranders, Rørdal Fabriksby, Øster Sundby and Øster Uttrup into Aalborg. In 1950, it reached 87,883, which grew to 100,587 by 1970.|$|E

5|$|Australia sent 31 {{athletes in}} 1960, its largest team before the 2006 Winter Olympics; their size was <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> an outclassed 18-man ice hockey team, which conceded 83 goals in losing all six matches. They lost to Czechoslovakia 181 and the United States 121 in their two group matches, and were then placed {{into a group}} with Finland and Japan, the last-placed teams in the two other {{preliminary}} groups. The Australians played two matches against {{each of the other}} teams to determine the three worst teams in the nine-country contest. They lost all four matches, conceding a total of 53 goals. The heaviest margins were in the defeats to Czechoslovakia and Finland, 181 and 192 respectively. Australia scored only 10 goals in reply.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs. Early in the century, the area was visited by Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} as the Allies {{approached}} the Persian camp, rumour spread amongst them of an Allied victory at Plataea; Diodorus also claims that Leotychides informed the Allies of victory at Plataea before the battle began. Their morale <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> this omen, they set forth to win their own victory. Various explanations have been attempted to explain this occurrence, and also the alleged fact that Plataea and Mycale {{took place on the}} same day. Green suggests that following the victory at Plataea, the Allied commander Pausanias took control of the Persian beacon system that Xerxes had used to communicate with Asia, and used it to send tidings of Plataea to the Allied fleet. This would explain the rumour of victory and near simultaneous attack, but is only one possible theory.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. <b>Boosted</b> <b>by</b> a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields <b>boosted</b> <b>by</b> 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E
