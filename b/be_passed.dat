5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on.|$|E
5|$|The last Article {{creates the}} {{mechanism}} for future {{changes to the}} Constitution. Any amendment to the Constitution must first <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> by a majority {{in each of the}} two legislative houses. The proposed amendment must then be held over for consideration by the succeeding elected legislature, where it must again <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> by a majority in each house. The amendment then goes on the general ballot and becomes enacted into the Constitution if approved by a majority of the voters.|$|E

This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were to <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E
5|$|Changes in Directive Principles {{require a}} Constitutional {{amendment}} {{which has to}} <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> by a special majority of both houses of the Parliament.

50|$|BRNN can {{be trained}} using similar {{algorithms}} compared to RNN, because the two directional neurons {{do not have any}} interactions. However, when back-propagation is applied, additional processes are needed because updating input and output layers cannot be done at once. General procedures for training are as follows: For forward pass, forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed.</b> For backward <b>pass,</b> output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> next.

5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E
5|$|A death {{sentence}} had to <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed {{up the chain}} of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E

Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E

He recommended that a bill <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.|$|E

5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill.

It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment. It {{was used by the}} Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships.

For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> between individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
