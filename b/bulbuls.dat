Other animals in the state include reptiles such as lizards, cobras, kraits, and gharials. During winter, large numbers of Siberian birds are reported in the sangam and nearby wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, <b>bulbuls,</b> babblers, mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey. In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last sighted in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. Diclofenac, which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.|$|E

25|$|On Oahu, a white morph of {{the monarch}} has emerged. This {{is because of}} the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two bulbul species, Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus jocosus. They are now the most common {{insectivore}} birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be tolerant of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The <b>bulbuls</b> also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e. the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.|$|E
500|$|Their {{habit of}} driving away predators from near their nests is {{believed}} to encourage other birds such as orioles, doves, pigeons, babblers, and especially <b>bulbuls,</b> to nest in the vicinity. In one study 18 of 40 nests had red-vented <b>bulbuls</b> nesting within [...] An abnormal case of interspecific feeding with a red-vented bulbul feeding the chicks of a black drongo at their nest has been recorded.They are so aggressive that they may sometimes land on large birds of prey and peck them when mobbing. It {{has been suggested that}} the Asian drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris) has evolved to mimic this species. The intensity of mobbing predators was studied in Java and observations showed that there was a significant increase in mobbing, during the nesting season, of some predators such as the Javan hawk-eagle but the black eagle, a nest predator is mobbed with equal intensity in all seasons. It has been suggested that this strategy may avoid giving away the location of nests during the breeding season.|$|E

The secrets of the finer cookery were revived in the breasts of matronly house-wives, and daughters were again anxious to be initiated in them.|$|E
50|$|The {{status of}} this rarely seen bird is not known, {{primarily}} {{because it is}} not clear whether it is in fact a distinct species, or a natural hybrid between the black-headed <b>bulbul</b> and the grey-bellied <b>bulbul</b> or other closely related <b>bulbul.</b> Alternate names for the blue-wattled <b>bulbul</b> include the Malayasian wattled <b>bulbul,</b> Nieuwenhuis's <b>bulbul</b> and wattled <b>bulbul.</b>|$|R
