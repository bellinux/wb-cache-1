The Department of Slavonic Languages (later Slavonic Studies) was established in 1933, the teaching of Russian having been introduced in 1916. In 1933–34, the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Zoology and Geography, which had been combined with other subjects, were made independent; and in 1938 a supplemental Charter provided for a much wider representation on the Governing Body. However, further advances were delayed by the outbreak of war in 1939.|$|E

Steve Huey wrote: [...] "Aquemini fulfills all its ambitions, covering more than enough territory to qualify it as a virtuosic masterpiece, and a landmark hip-hop album of the late '90s". Ebony observed that Aquemini is [...] "perhaps OutKast's best effort" [...] and [...] "a huge commercial and artistic success". Matt Wink concluded that OutKast with this album [...] "carved their place in the game and grabbed the world's attention. No two people with a similar background could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> and no two artists could have made this masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|Some fans, however, {{criticized the}} {{introduction}} of Doggett; claiming that the character had been intentionally created to replace Mulder.

As he left the finance ministry, he suggested that Tsakalotos was likely to succeed him, and Tsakalotos was subsequently sworn-in later that day. In the process of this, Tsakalotos relinquished his previous ministerial position of Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations. Tsakalotos was noted for his differences with Varoufakis, for example, the Financial Times noted that he [...] "could hardly <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> from his flamboyant predecessor". At a press conference shortly following his appointment, Tsakalotos said: [...] "I cannot hide from you that I am quite nervous.

[...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters.com said that [...] ""Umbrella" [...] is a monster, so much so that I'll even confess to spending a portion of a rainy afternoon practicing the hook." [...] Jonah Weiner of Blender magazine called the song the album's highlight and stated that it [...] "would be far less engrossing if it wasn't for the way Rihanna disassembles its ungainly title into 11 hypnotic, tongue-flicking syllables". The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh described the song as [...] "a space-age hip-pop song".|$|E

2500|$|Myrna Minkoff, {{referred}} to by Ignatius as [...] "that minx", is a Jewish beatnik from New York City, whom Ignatius met {{while she was in}} college in New Orleans. Though their political, social, religious, and personal orientations could hardly <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different,</b> Myrna and Ignatius fascinate one another. The novel repeatedly refers to Myrna and Ignatius having engaged in tag-team attacks on the teachings of their college professors. For most of the novel, she is seen only in the regular correspondence which the two sustain since her return to New York, a correspondence heavily weighted with sexual analysis on the part of Myrna and contempt for her apparent sacrilegious activity by Ignatius. Officially, they both deplore everything the other stands for. Though neither of them will admit it, their correspondence indicates that, separated though [...] they are by half a continent, many of their actions are meant to impress one another.|$|E
2500|$|Creator Elizabeth Meriwether sees Nick, Schmidt and Winston [...] "on the weirder side of things". The {{producers}} stated {{learning more}} about the characters by seeing the actors' work and that [...] "We probably rely on them more than we should" [...] to define the characters. For example, the producers found more variety in Nick's character in season 1 and enjoyed Johnson's improvisations, so they relayed Coach's attributed rage issues to Nick. Nick is a childhood friend of Winston, has been best friends with Schmidt since his college days and becomes close to Jess, so his character connects the most with the other loftmates and is often part of their stories. Jake Johnson (Nick) noted the contrast to the original plans for his character, as season 1 turned Nick into [...] "an idiot, he's not keeping anyone together", and that he did not fully understand his character in season 1, partly because the character might not have figured himself out at the age of 30. Johnson felt that initially it seemed like Nick hated Schmidt for being a douchebag, but the show later teamed them up like The Odd Couple, showing their genuine friendship and simultaneous idiocy as they get into trouble. According to Johnson, he and Max Greenfield (Schmidt) [...] "couldn't <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> [...] and it's very much like Nick and Schmidt, but we both really {{get a kick out of}} the other guy" [...] on set.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by music critics, although Snow Patrol guitarist Nathan Connolly admitted in November 2008 {{that he still}} had not heard the song: [...] "Nothing against her, but I don't know if I'm going to endorse it either. It is what it is." [...] The following month, Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody described Lewis's version of the song as [...] "phenomenal". He told the Scottish newspaper The Daily Record: [...] Music Radar said that [...] "The two versions couldn't <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different.</b> Snow Patrol's rendering is dark and moody, while Leona Lewis's is big-time pop", and quoted Gary Lightbody as saying [...] "That's what you want a song to do ... Different interpretations and meanings. Songs aren't monolithic, at least the good ones aren't. What Leona Lewis has done has touched hearts." [...] Newsround highly praised Lewis' cover version, stating that [...] "the full gospel choir and orchestra easily match Leona's powerful pipes – and remind listeners why the song made people cry when she first performed it on Radio 1's Live Lounge last year". [...] "Run" [...] received three stars out of five from Digital Spy, who said that Lewis [...] "wrings every last drop of emotion out of Gary Lightbody's lyrics, channeling her inner Mariah for some almighty warbling at the crescendo". The Sentinel described the single as [...] "so much better" [...] than Snow Patrol's original song. [...] "It's powerful, painful and the choir behind it takes it on to another level." [...] Radio presenter James Daniels concurred, saying [...] "Leona just takes it {{to a whole new}} level, which is a phrase I hate to use – but it's true".|$|E

60|$|In the bar parlour he {{rang the}} bell, {{and had to}} wait some little time for a reply to it. The only other person present was a lean man with close red hair and loose, horsey-looking clothes, who was {{drinking}} very bad whisky, but smoking a very good cigar.

In short, Trumbull appeared a perfect specimen of the rigid old Covenanter, who said only what he thought right, acted on no other principle but that of duty, and, if he committed errors, did so under the full impression that he was serving God rather than man.|$|E
60|$|Geoffroy St. Hilaire has {{strongly}} {{insisted on}} the high importance of relative position or connexion in homologous parts; they may differ to almost any extent in form and size, and yet remain connected {{together in the same}} invariable order.

We see the same great law {{in the construction of the}} mouths of insects: what can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such widely different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The same law governs the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the flowers of plants.|$|E

At other times when he had been there, since that day on which he had been accepted, he had been completely master of himself. Perhaps it had almost been deemed a fault in him that he had had none of the timidity or hesitation of a lover. He had seemed to feel, no doubt, that he, with his fortune and position at his back, need feel no scruple in accepting as his own the fair hand for which he had asked.

60|$|A gently sloping saddle, bare of snow, which succeeds the glacier, {{forms the}} top of the Tunkra pass; it unites two snowy mountains, and opens on the great valley of the Machoo, which flows in a part of Tibet between Sikkim and Bhotan; its height is 16,083 feet above the sea by barometer, and 16,137 feet by boiling-point. Nothing can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> than the two slopes of this pass; that by which I had come {{presented}} a gentle snowy acclivity, bounded by precipitous mountains; while that which opened before me was a steep, rocky, broad, grassy valley, where not a particle of snow was to be seen, and yaks were feeding near a small lake not 1000 feet down. Nor were snowy mountains visible anywhere in this direction, except far to the south-east, in Bhotan. This remarkable difference of climate is due to the southerly wind which ascends the Tibetan or Machoo valley being drained by intervening mountains before reaching this pass, whilst the Sikkim current brings abundant vapours up the Teesta and Lachoong valleys.|$|E
60|$|Originally {{nothing could}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> than the Dietrich {{of the old}} legend and the Dietrich of history.

He is oppressed in his youth by his uncle, the famous Ermanrich {9}; he has to spend {{the greater part of}} his life (thirty years) in exile, and only returns to his kingdom {{after the death of his}} enemy. Yet whenever he is called Dietrich of Bern, it is because the real Theodoric, the most successful of Gothic conquerors, ruled at Verona. When his enemy was called Otacher, instead of Sibich, it is because the real Theodoric conquered the real Odoacer. When the king, at whose court he passes his years of exile, is called Etzel, it is because many German heroes had really taken refuge in the camp of Attila. That Attila died two years before Theodoric of Verona was born, is no difficulty to a popular poet, nor even the still more glaring contradiction between the daring and ferocious character of the real Attila and the cowardice of his namesake Etzel, as represented in the poem of the Nibelunge. Thus was legend quickened by history.|$|E

No two things could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>different</b> than the manners of these gentlemen. That of the latter was very highly polished, insinuating, and although far from unpleasantly so, yet slightly artificial; while that of the former was simple, ingenuous, and in the presence of Miss Henly was apt to be at times a little constrained. Charlotte certainly perceived the difference, and she as certainly thought that it was not altogether to the advantage of George Morton. The idea seemed to give her pain, for she showed several little attentions to her old friend, that by their flattering, but unstudied particularity, were adapted to put any man at his ease and assure him of his welcome, still the embarrassment of George did not disappear, but he sat an uneasy listener to the conversation that occurred, as if reluctant to stay, and yet unwilling to depart.
