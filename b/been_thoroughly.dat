5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> cleaned, many of these people could have been saved.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few {{decades of the twentieth}} century, American {{paleontologist}} E. C. Case authored many studies on Dimetrodon and described several new species. He received funding from the Carnegie Institution for his study of many Dimetrodon specimens in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History and several other museums. Many of these fossils had been collected by Cope but had not <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> described, as Cope was known for erecting new species on the basis of only a few bone fragments.|$|E
5|$|The body shell, {{suspension}} and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, two tank {{companies}} and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha, supported with close air support. The Egyptian commando battalion {{in charge of}} Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged, heavy fighting that closed to very short distances. The Israelis lost three tanks, two half-tracks, {{and a large number}} of men. For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during the afternoon and pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal. The Israeli attack had <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> routed.|$|E
5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or the natives. Gracias a Dios and San Pedro were more secure, and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> conquered, and in the remoter areas {{the vast majority of}} the natives were still hostile to the Spanish, and determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{expedition}} concentrated {{its work}} in the Camp of Diocletian while the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities excavated the Temple of Nabu. Most of the hypogea were excavated jointly by the Polish expedition and the Syrian Directorate, while the area of Efqa was excavated by Jean Starcky and Jafar al-Hassani. The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by Jørgen Christian Meyer who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground inspections and satellite images. Most of Palmyra still remains unexplored especially the residential quarters {{in the north and}} south while the necropolis has <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> excavated by the Directorate and the Polish expedition. Excavation expeditions left Palmyra in 2011 due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationships}} of the Myxogastria to other creatures have not <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> researched as of 2012. Their natural predators include many arthropods, including mites and springtails, and especially beetles {{such as the}} rove beetles, round fungus beetles, wrinkled bark beetles, Eucinetidae, Clambidae, Eucnemidae (false click beetles), Sphindidae, Cerylonidae, and minute brown scavenger beetles. Various Nematodes have also been observed to be their predators; they attach their posterior portion on the cytosol of the plasmodia or even live within the strands. Certain Diptera species have evolved to specialise in this way: these are mostly representatives of the Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae and Drosophilidae. The species Epicypta testata was especially frequently found, especially on Enteridium lycoperdon, Enteridium splendens, Lycogala epidendrum and Tubifera ferruginosa.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E

5|$|Ferugliotherium {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth, {{the assignment of}} some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN) in Buenos Aires, with one tooth in the Museo de La Plata (MLP) in La Plata, Argentina, has <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> described; while there are additional Ferugliotherium fossils from the La Colonia Formation, {{they have not been}} described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of Ferugliotherium makes it impossible to determine its dental formula with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of the}} lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with Sudamerica, which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that Ferugliotherium may also have had four lower molars.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had <b>been</b> <b>thoroughly</b> explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so used it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set of circumstances led to the wide use of stereophonic sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E
