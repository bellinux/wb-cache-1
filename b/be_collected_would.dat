It calculates the economic and social effects that this regime will have on the livelihoods of people living inside the reserve. It shows that, if local people are not compensated for lost incomes, the new plans will increase conflict between locals and the reserve management. To find a way to pay compensation, the study investigated whether people living in the province around the reserve {{would be willing to pay}} for conservation in the FNNR through an eco-tax. These people benefit from conservation in the reserve, but at present pay nothing towards it.

40|$|Early-age {{cracking}} can seriously {{compromise the}} performance and aesthetics of concrete structures, and is thus an ongoing major concern to the concrete construction industry. More effective control of this form of cracking requires an improved knowledge of concrete properties. In this paper, currently available test methods for complete stress-strain curves of early-age concrete are first briefly reviewed. A new system specifically designed for early-age tensile testing of concrete is then described. The novel use of digital image correlation in this system enables the desired deformation to be reliably captured in a non-contact way – a significant improvement compared to previous studies. The more reliable data to <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> <b>would</b> result in improved knowledge of concrete at early ages, including the tensile strength, Young’s modulus, strain at peak stress, and fracture mechanics characteristics, {{as well as their}} interrelationships and development with time. This improved understanding would form a solid basis for more effective control of early-age cracking in concrete...|$|E
40|$|The {{study focused}} on a Community Based Organization called DAKIKA. That study was {{conducted}} in order to identify the community Based Organization needs and build the capacity of the CBO members in order to improve the economic condition. The main objective {{of the study was to}} identify the reasons for low income of the CBO and support the local CBO in order to enhance its economic condition. The Community Needs Assessment was conducted through a survey which took a form of a questionnaire. Focused group discussion was also used to assess the capacities of the CBO. The results portrayed that, the CBO had the following challenges; The CBO was producing little quantities of poor quality medicine because it lacked quality grinding machine. CBO members had low level of education. The CBO failed to purchase materials from community members. This situation affected the income of the community members. It was also realized that, the CBO had no reliable market for its products. The recommendation of the study was to conduct capacity building session for CBO group leaders on marketing techniques and write a proposal for fundraising. The funds that would <b>be</b> <b>collected</b> <b>would</b> be used to purchase one grinding machine, 1000 packages and to facilitate a three months English course training for three CBO leaders. During formative evaluation, it was realized that two objectives had been achieved. The seminar for CBO leaders had been conducted as planned and the proposal for fundraising had been prepared. Findings from summative evaluation portrayed that there were some impacts made by the two objectives that had been achieved. Among others were; record keeping and seeking market outside their area which led to an increased income. (Author abstract) Swai, R. J. (2007).

Geographical Information Systems for disease surveillance {{play a major role}} in disease mapping. A GIS can clearly provide spatial analytical capabilities to interrogate the data.

40|$|The {{utility of}} data from {{sequencing}} projects beyond their original purpose is limited by issues in comparing phenotype and exposure data across studies. Great effort {{has been made to}} build dbGaP as a repository for genetic, phenotypic, and exposure data that are widely accessible to the scientific community. One of the most important features of dbGaP is that it facilitates analysis of many samples, which has become increasingly critical for identifying factors that explain heritability beyond genetic variants already identified. Several steps could be taken to increase the utility {{of data from}} large-scale sequencing projects. Harmonize data for existing studies: Harmonizing phenotype and exposure data that have already <b>been</b> <b>collected</b> <b>would</b> facilitate analysis across existing data sets. Retrospective harmonization of existing phenotype and exposure data is usually a multistep, iterative process.

40|$|Background: Every year, {{research}} specimens {{are shipped}} from one institution to another {{as well as}} across national boundaries. A significant proportion of specimens move from poor to rich countries. Concerns are always raised on the future usage of the stored specimens shipped to research insitutions from developing countries. Creating awareness of the processes is required in all sectors involved in biomedical research. To maintain fairness and respect in sharing biomedical specimens and reserch products requires safeguarding by Ethics Review Committees in both provider and recepient institutions. Training in basic ethical principles in research is required to all sectors involved in biomedical research so as to level up the research playing field. Discussion: By agreeing to provide specimens, individuals and communities from whom samples <b>are</b> <b>collected</b> <b>would</b> have placed their trust and all ensuing up-keep of the specimens to the researchers. In most collaborative set-up, laid down material transfer agreements are negotiated and signed before the shipment of specimens.
