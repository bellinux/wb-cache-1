25|$|The IFC {{contained}} {{the search and}} tracking radars and control center (operators, computer, etc.), and various related offices and communications centres for general operations. To operate the Nike-Hercules system on the IFC the crew consisted of about nine operators under command of the <b>Battery</b> <b>Control</b> Officer (BCO). The crew on the LA, also under command of the BCO, was responsible for preparing and erecting the missile. On both the IFC and the LA maintenance people were available.|$|E
500|$|Any {{target with}} a high {{probability}} was then passed to the <b>Battery</b> <b>Control</b> Data Processor (BCDP), which selected missiles and radars for an attack. This started with the assignment of a Target Tracking Radar (TTR) to a target passed to it from the DCC. TTRs operated in the C band from 5250–5750MHz at 10MW, allowing tracking of a 0.1m2 target at , a range they expected {{to be able to}} double with a new maser-based receiver design. Once targets were being successfully tracked and a firing order was received, the BCDP selected available Zeus missiles for launch and assigned a Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) to follow them. These were much smaller radars operating in the X-band between 8500–9600MHz and assisted by a transponder on the missile, using only 300kW to provide missile tracking to [...] The wide variety of available frequencies allowed up to 450 MTRs to be operating in a single Defense Center. Information from the ZDR, TTR and MRTs was all fed to the Target Intercept Computer (TIC) which handled the interceptions. This used twistor memory for ROM and core memory for RAM. Guidance commands were sent to the missiles in-flight via modulation of the MTR signal.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to launch, the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) {{locked on}} to the {{transponder}} in the selected missile. Like the Ajax, the Hercules used a transponder in the missile. A short period after launch the actual location, i.e. azimuth, elevation and range of the missile were displayed on the plotting boards.

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The <b>battery</b> <b>control</b> computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E
