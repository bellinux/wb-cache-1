In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|After {{several members}} of the {{resistance}} are killed by the Gestapo, Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in order not {{to be seen as a}} traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther in the bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.|$|E
25|$|The RPI {{design was}} made for {{clasping}} a bilateral free end extension. These clasps are unique <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take into account extra torque force due to being tissue borne (and not tooth borne) at the posterior.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between science, engineering, and technology {{is not always}} clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the monomer table, many simple {{monomers}} {{are readily}} polymerized by this method, but most must be smaller ionizable species <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be able to go into the plasma state. Though monomers with multiple bonds polymerize readily, it is not a necessary requirement, as ethane, silicones and many others polymerize also.|$|E
25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E
50|$|With the {{invention}} of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1447, it became feasible to print books and maps for a larger customer basis. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be handwritten, books were previously rare and very expensive.|$|R

25|$|War soon {{broke out}} over Nagorno Karabakh {{and ended in}} 1994 with the Armenian separatists gaining control over the territory. Turkic {{nationalism}} is the leading force in Baku and has undoubtedly contributed to the conflict with the Armenians given the historical enmity between Armenians and Turkey. All the major human rights monitors agreed that the status of Armenians, those married to or those who associate with Armenians, {{and those who are}} perceived to be sympathetic to Armenians, is extremely grave. There has also been numerous acts of vandalism against the Armenian Apostolic Church throughout Azerbaijan. The Armenians still remaining in Azerbaijan practically live in virtual hiding, and have also changed their Armenian names and surnames to Azerbaijani names and surnames <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> maintain an extremely low profile to avoid harassment and physical attacks. They have continued to complain (in private due to fear of attacks) that they remain subject to harassmant and human rights violations and therefore have to hide their identity. Armenians and part Armenians living in Azerbaijan were reported as being refused permission to leave the country. They have also reported that the Department of Visas and Registrations took them off of the list of residents.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{criticism}} towards the Avatar spoof [...] "In the Na'Vi" [...] goes towards {{the timing of the}} episode. Surette thought that it was [...] "n Avatar spoof that came about two years too late. This sketch had no redeeming qualities and should be erased from the minds of all Simpsons fans immediately." [...] Similarly, Marnell commented that in the episode [...] "The Simpsons' finally gets around to parodying 'Avatar' — a movie picked to death by 'South Park' and other series a year or two ago" [...] and further elaborated that [...] "t's almost a straight forward retelling of 'Avatar' without the biting satire that made the film parodies of previous years so much fun." [...] In general, Treehouse of Horror episodes take about a year to complete for the staff. This is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do many original designs, such as characters and backgrounds. Prior to the airing of the episode, Jean revealed that the staff was already working on [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXIII".|$|E
500|$|... "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was also}} the first of five Homicide: Life on the Street episodes {{featuring}} Mel Proctor, then the home team sports announcer for the Washington Bullets, as recurring reporter character Grant Besser. Actor Walt MacPherson made a brief appearance as a uniformed police officer who finds an earring at the Adena Watson crime scene and offers it to Bayliss as possible evidence. MacPherson would return in the [...] as the recurring character Detective Roger Gaffney, but there is no indication whether or not the beat cop he played in [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was the same character. The line spoken by Lewis, [...] "Murderers lie <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> witnesses lie because they think they have to, and everyone else lies for the sheer joy of it", is almost a verbatim line from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. The line represents a three-rule theorem about police work Simon created after following a Baltimore Police Department homicide unit for one year while writing his book.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{preserve}} their estates, fugitive business owners had relocated their assets to foreign banks.

500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through these range of emotions, {{but you have to}} keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{political}} pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit {{is the issue of}} whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do {{not take into account the}} interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time. However, for women, when they are working in the paid sector, they are still losing money <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care. Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions. In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time. [...] Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on female employment and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturers {{depended}} on the Chinese workers <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reduce labor cost to save money and the Chinese labor was cheaper than the Caucasian labor.

2500|$|Jung's {{theory has}} become {{enormously}} influential in management theory; {{not just because}} managers and executives have to create an appropriate [...] "management persona" [...] (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity, but also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> evaluate what sort of people the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using personality tests and peer reviews).|$|E

The film {{centers around the}} boys who are working as Santa's helpers in a mall when Drake promises a little girl that her foster family will have [...] "The Best Christmas Ever"—and then try to fulfill that promise while a grumpy police officer interferes.

2500|$|Almost entirely through luck, Mandella survives {{four years}} of {{military}} service, while several centuries elapse in real time. He soon becomes the objectively oldest surviving soldier in the war, attaining high rank through seniority rather than ambition, as he is essentially a pacifist who acts mostly from talent and a melancholic sense of duty. He and Potter (who has remained his last link with the Earth of his youth) are eventually given different assignments, meaning {{that even if they}} both survive the war they will never see one another again due to time dilation. After briefly contemplating suicide, Mandella assumes the post of commanding officer of a [...] "strike force", commanding soldiers who speak a language largely unrecognizable to him, whose ethnicity is now nearly uniform ('vaguely Polynesian' in appearance) and who are exclusively homosexual. He is disliked by his soldiers <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn 21st century English to communicate with him and other senior staff, and because he is heterosexual.|$|E
2500|$|The title [...] "DJ" [...] is also {{commonly}} used by DJs {{in front of}} their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names as a title to denote their profession (e.g., DJ Jazzy Jeff and DJ Q-bert). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use turntablism techniques such as [...] "scratching", in which the DJ or turntablist manipulates the record player turntable to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using audio consoles, professional audio equipment, and, in the 2010s, Digital Audio Workstations and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have charisma and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as house music or hip hop music. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.|$|E
