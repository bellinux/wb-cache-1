40|$|We have {{detected}} antibodies, in the sera of Chagas disease, Kala-azar and Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients, that bind multiple antigens shared {{between the three}} causative agents. The Chagas disease sera showed 98 to 100 % positive results by ELISA when the Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania chagasi antigens were used, respectively. The Kala-azar sera showed 100 % positive results with Trypanosoma cruzi or L. braziliensis antigens by immunofluorescence assays. The antibodies in the sera of Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients showed 100 % positive results by ELISA assays with T. cruzi or L. chagasi antigens. Furthermore, the direct agglutination of L. chagasi promastigotes showed that 95 % of Kala-azar and 35 % of Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis sera agglutinated the parasite in dilutions above 1 : 512. In contrast, 15 % of Chagas sera agglutinated the parasite in dilutions 1 : 16 and below. Western blot analysis showed that the Chagas sera that formed at least 24 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the T. cruzi also formed 13 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the L. chagasi and 17 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the L. braziliensis. The Kala-azar sera that recognized at least 29 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the homologous antigen also formed 14 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the T. cruzi and 10 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the L. braziliensis antigens. Finally, the Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis sera that formed at least 17 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the homologous antigen also formed 10 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the T. cruzi and four <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> the L. chagasi antigens. These results indicate the presence of common antigenic determinants in several protozoal proteins and, therefore, explain the serologic cross-reactions reported here...|$|R

5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport.

When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a few people in the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E

With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new <b>band</b> <b>with</b> Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

Accurate line positions are obtained for the δ (N, 0) <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> N= 2, 3, the ε (N, 0) <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> N= 2, 3, and the Β (N, 0) <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> N= 10, 12, 14.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{intended}} to reveal the differential isoesterase expression in leaves and roots of Vigna unguiculata L. in response to saline stress. Influence of NaCl (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 %) on seedlings of Vigna unguiculata L. was analyzed. The seedlings were grown in the centre {{for a period of}} 30 days. The randomly collected whole plants were used as a source for isoesterase isolation. The seedlings showed the maximum tolerance up to 10 % of NaCl. The Poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by Anbalagan method. The staining and fixation of the enzyme was performed by the Sadasivam and Manickam method. Seedlings treated with various concentrations of NaCl showed different banding profile based on the concentration (0 - 10 %) and duration (5 - 30 days) of salt treatment as follows: 32 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> five active regions, 56 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> eight active regions, 102 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> eight active regions, 47 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> seven active regions, 64 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> nine active regions and 84 <b>bands</b> <b>with</b> nine active regions on 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th and 30 th day respectively. The changing pattern of isozymes during development may be interpreted as evidence for differential timing of gene expression correlated with the physiological stress. The {{results of the present study}} concluded that the isoesterase patterns could serve as a useful biochemical marker of salinity...|$|R

5|$|In 1975, Gillan {{formed the}} Ian Gillan <b>Band</b> <b>with</b> guitarist Ray Fenwick, keyboardist Mike Moran, quickly {{replaced}} with Mickey Lee Soule and then Colin Towns on keyboards, Mark Nauseef on drums and John Gustafson on bass. Their first album, Child in Time {{was released in}} July 1976, followed by Clear Air Turbulence in April 1977 and Scarabus in October. The sound of the band had a distinct jazz-rock aspect which, although interesting to Gillan, proved unpopular, particularly since punk rock was in vogue at that time.|$|E

In this way Lynott was able to align his <b>band</b> <b>with</b> the punk movement and avoid being tagged as a 'dinosaur' as many other 1970s rock bands had been. Other occasional members of The Greedy Bastards included Bob Geldof and Pete Briquette of the Boomtown Rats.|$|E

5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records.
