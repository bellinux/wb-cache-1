5|$|Katrina {{continued}} to track over Central America {{for most of}} October30 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24hours after landfall, the depression moved <b>back</b> <b>over</b> water, in the Gulf of Honduras; however, by this time, there was no convection remaining around the system. The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward. Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed to regenerate convection before moving <b>back</b> <b>over</b> land near the northern Belize-Mexico border. Around this time, forecasters reported that the depression would re-intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Although situated over land, the depression began to regenerate convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. By the evening of November1, the depression weakened again and moved into the Gulf of Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Bess, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Susang, was {{responsible}} for the disappearance of a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance aircraft. Developing out of a poorly organized system on October8 to the east of the Philippines, Bess featured two centers of circulation. Initially the southern low was monitored; however, a low to the north soon became the dominant center. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October11. Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land. After moving <b>back</b> <b>over</b> water the following morning, Bess regained typhoon intensity. This was short-lived though, as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken. Now moving due west, the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October12 before diminishing to a tropical depression. The depression briefly moved <b>back</b> <b>over</b> water before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October14.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post {{because of its}} position on the Limfjord.

These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E

Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E

In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Delfina was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that affected southeastern Africa in January 2003.

Delfina weakened while moving inland, {{and it was}} no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January1, 2003.
