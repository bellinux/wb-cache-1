5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Immunity</b> <b>Agreement</b> of protection for the United States military. Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.|$|E

2500|$|... 12 July 2007 – The European Parliament {{issues the}} 2006 Progress Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Both Greece and the Republic declare a [...] "victory" [...] – The report is {{critical}} of the <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Immunity</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the USA (which violates {{the principles of the}} Rome Statute); failures in the implementation of the Badinter principle; the Khaled El-Masri affair; the renaming of Skopje Airport to [...] "Alexander the Great"; and other issues such as environmental protection and neighborly relations. Two proposed amendments referring to Bulgaria and Greece's failure to recognise a Macedonian minority living in these countries, and one referring to the constitutional name Republic of Macedonia, were rejected. On the other hand, the EU reiterated that the naming issue will not be considered in the accession process (although Greece's ability to veto remains intact). EuroMPs from the ruling Greek New Democracy party voted in favor of the resolution; those from the opposition PASOK party voted against.|$|E

The report details a 2007 incident where a 12-year-old Melgar girl was allegedly drugged and kidnapped by U.S. Sergeant Michael Coen and military contractor César Ruiz who raped her and uploaded video of the assault to a pornography site.

50|$|The {{position}} of the Bush Administration during its first term in office was to unalterably oppose U.S. ratification of the Rome Statute, believing Americans would be unfairly treated for political reasons. Moreover, the Bush Administration actively pursued a policy of hostility towards the Court in its international relations, exceeding merely staying out of the statute, instead seeking to guarantee that U.S. citizens be immune to the Court and to thwart other states from acceding to the statute without taking U.S. concerns into account. The U.S. vigorously pressed states to conclude <b>bilateral</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>agreements</b> (BIAs) with the U.S. that would guarantee its citizens immunity from the Court's jurisdiction, threatening to cut off aid to states that refused to agree.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the Statute of Rome in July 1998, the ICC hasbeen confronted by a number of problems. One such problem is the disagreement which persists among the members of the Assembly of Member States as to whether the crime of Aggression is one over which the Court has competence pursuant to Article 5 of the Statute. Another diffi culty is the opposition of the United States of America which, since the Bush Administration, has deployed a juridical arsenal with the aim of impeding any type of collaboration with theICC; the tools in the arsenal include the American Service Members’Protection Act and <b>bilateral</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>agreements</b> which prevent thetransfer of American citizens to the Court by State membersof the Rome Statute...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on the capabilities of weak states to withstand pressure from strong states suggests that more often than not, weaker states tend to give into the stronger power. What are the motivating factors that enable weak states to withstand pressure from strong states? To ensure that the International Criminal Court (ICC) does not gain jurisdiction over its nationals, the United States is currently seeking to sign <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Immunity</b> <b>Agreements</b> (BIAs) with all countries {{under the rubric of}} the American Servicemembers 2 ̆ 7 Protection Act. This thesis examines through a comparative case study analysis how a number of African Countries are able to withstand the pressure to sign a BIA by taking advantage of internal and external institutional structures and mechanisms. It also fills a gap in the literature by examining one regions response to the BIAs relative to the U. S. position concerning the ICC...|$|R
5000|$|Article 98 of the Rome Statute {{prohibits the}} ICC from {{requesting}} assistance or {{the surrender of}} a person to the ICC if {{to do so would}} require the state to [...] "act inconsistently" [...] with its obligations under international law or international agreements unless the state or the third-party state waives the immunity or grants cooperation. The U.S. has interpreted this article to mean that its citizens cannot be transferred to the ICC by any state that has signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. prohibiting such a transfer, even if the state {{is a member of the}} Rome Statute. The U.S. actively pressured states to conclude such so-called Article 98 agreements, otherwise known as <b>bilateral</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>agreements</b> (BIAs). The Bush Administration claimed that the BIAs were drafted out of concern that existing agreements—particularly the status of forces agreements or status of mission agreements (SOFAs or SOMAs)—did not sufficiently protect Americans from the jurisdiction of the ICC.|$|R

40|$|In 2002, the USA {{asked all}} {{countries}} to sign agreements exempting US citizens from prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and threatened economic sanctions if they refused. Some countries yielded to this pressure even after ratifying the ICC Statute, while others chose to honor their original commitments. Why were some countries {{more responsive to}} US influence than others? This article provides an explanation of state vulnerability to attempts of influence {{through the lens of}} economic sanctions. Assessing the success of sanctions is difficult because of the selection bias in the instances of the use of such strategies observed by the researcher. Since all countries were asked to sign such agreements, one can observe exactly which signed, whether sanctions were enforced, and how quickly countries responded to such pressure. Arguments about sources of influence - shared interests, economic and security dependence, and domestic politics - are tested using an original dataset collected on country decisions to sign <b>bilateral</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>agreements</b> (BIAs). The authors find support for some existing explanations, including relative power and the relationship of dependency, while previously held beliefs about alliance and security relationships appear to be less influential on decisions to ratify BIAs. These findings have implications for existing research programs on economic sanctions, international organizations, and power politics...|$|R

The entry into force of the of the Statute on 1 July 2002 allowed the Court Prosecutor to initiate the fi rst investigations and processes for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the confl icts which have devastated certain African States (D. R. C., The Central African Republic and Uganda). The arrest warrant against the Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir for atrocities committed in Darfur demonstrates the limitations of action on the Court which cannot carry out its mandate without the cooperation of the States. Above all, the Court must confront the criticism of “double standards” and that it is an instrument of “justice for the poor”, while the “powerful” escape. The answers to these problems can be contributed to, in part, through the revision process foreseen by the Statute nine years after its entry into force...|$|R
5000|$|The United States [...] "adopted {{a hostile}} stance towards the Court {{throughout}} most of the Bush presidency." [...] In 2002, Congress enacted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), which was signed into law on August 2, 2002; the act's [...] "overriding purpose of the ASPA was to inhibit the U.S. government from supporting the ICC." [...] Major provisions of the ASPA blocked U.S. funding of the ICC and required the U.S. [...] "to enter into agreements with all ICC signatory states to shield American citizens abroad from ICC jurisdiction, under the auspices of Article 98 of the Rome Statute," [...] which bars the ICC [...] "from prosecuting individuals located on the territory of an ICC member state, where such action by the Court would cause the member state to violate the terms of any other bilateral or multilateral treaty to which it is a party." [...] Traditionally, Article 98 was used in relation to traditional status of forces agreements (SOFAs) and status of mission agreements (SOMAs), in which nations hosting U.S. military personnel by invitation agreed to immunize them from prosecution in foreign courts. [...] The Bush administration, supported by opponents of the ICC in Congress, adopted a new strategy of aggressively pursing <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Immunity</b> <b>Agreements</b> (BIAs), [...] "which guarantee immunity from ICC prosecution for all American citizens in the country with which the agreement is concluded" [...] rather than just U.S. military forces. [...] "Under the original ASPA, nations who refused to conclude BIAs with the United States were subject to sanctions, including the loss of military aid (though these provisions have since been repealed)." [...] As of December 2006, the U.S. State Department of State reported that it had signed 102 BIAs. In 2002, the United States threatened to veto the renewal of all United Nations peacekeeping missions unless its troops were granted immunity from prosecution by the Court. In a compromise move, the Security Council passed Resolution 1422 on 12 July 2002, granting immunity to personnel from ICC non-states parties involved in United Nations established or authorized missions for a renewable twelve-month period. This was renewed for twelve months in 2003 but the Security Council refused to renew the exemption again in 2004, after pictures emerged of US troops abusing Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib, and the US withdrew its demand.|$|R

40|$|With {{the entry}} into force of the Rome Statute in July 2002 and the {{election}} of judges and prosecutors of the Court in 2003, there is need for states parties to the Rome Statute to enact laws to incorporate the crimes defined in the treaty. Currently, 92 states are parties to the treaty. The success of the ICC will depend not only on widespread ratification of the Rome Statute, but also on states parties' compliance with obligations under the treaty. For almost every state this will require some change in national law in accordance with existing laws and proceedings in a given legal system. The experience of most states parties to the treaty is that the Rome Statute will require some form of domestic implementing legislation, even {{if this is not}} the normal practice of the state. There is need for co-operation between the Court and state parties on the administration of justice. For the Court to function properly, the immunity of its personnel should be guaranteed and provisions in national constitutions that are incompatible with the Rome Statute should be amended to bring them in conformity with the provisions of the treaty. [...] . Thus far, South Africa is the only African country that has adopted an implementing legislation domesticating the Rome Statute. Other African countries such as Congo, DRC, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal have draft bills. There is, therefore, the need for African countries that are state parties to the treaty to positiviely confront the above challnges while incorporating the provisions of the Rome Statute into national law. [...] . The first chapter is an introduciton. It sketches the background of the study and reviews the materials that will be used for the study. It focuses on several hypothesis and research questions that the study is set out to answer. It highlights the dearth of materials on the implementation of the Rome Statute in Africa. The second chapter analyses the ICC and the emerging international legal system. It discusses the complementarity principle of the Rome Statute and analysis the crimes {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Court. The effect of the <b>bilateral</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>agreements</b> signed by states parties to the Rome Statute with the United States of America is also highlighted. The third chapter deals with the ICC and indernational approaches to the implementation of the Rome Statute. This involves discussions on compatibility of the Rome Statute with national constitutions. Approaches adopted by states with regards to specific issues of implementation will also come into focus, followed by discussions on the amendment of constitutions and purposive interpretation as adopted by various states parties to the Rome Statute. The fourth chapter will discuss implications of the Rome Statute for domestic constitutions in Africa. The discussion will focus on immunity from prosecution granted to heads of state and government by constitutions, the surrender of persons to the ICC and sentencing of persons convicted by the Court with regards to their relationship in the implementation of the Rome Statute in Africa. The fifth chapter will be a comparative analysis of impelementation strategies adopted by South Africa, Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There will be an analysis of the relationship between the Rome Statute and African human right system. The last chapter is the conclusion with recommendations and arguments on the need for a comprehensive domestic implementation strategy of the Rome Statute in Africa. " [...] Introduction.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} some of {{the inherent}} bottlenecks {{in the exercise of}} ICC jurisdiction that may diminish the Court 2 ̆ 7 s ability to uphold the principle of individual criminal liability. In particular, this paper will analyze the principle of complementarity between the ICC and States Parties to the ICC Statute. Additionally, the legality of the so called Article 98 <b>Immunity</b> <b>Agreement</b> will be discussed. This paper without equivocation contends that the conclusion of Article 98 <b>immunity</b> <b>agreement</b> by ICC States Parties is a clear violation of their obligation to cooperate with the Court and to arrest and surrender suspects to the Court. Preceding the discussion on the bottlenecks in Court jurisdiction is a brief discussion of the provisions of the ICC Statute regarding individual criminal responsibility. In conclusion, this paper will argue that while the establishment of the ICC is one of the remarkable events of the twentieth century, the highlighted obstacles are capable of restricting the reach and effectiveness of the ICC as an institution designed {{to bring an end to}} the culture of impunity. Consequently, this paper advocates the elimination of said bottlenecks...|$|R
