5000|$|The {{machines}} utilise {{the principles}} of a centrifuge to enhance the gravitational force experienced by feed particles to effect separation based on particle density. The key components of the unit are a cone shaped [...] "concentrate" [...] bowl, rotated at high speed by an electric motor and a pressurized water jacket encompassing the <b>bowl.</b> <b>Feed</b> material, typically from a ball mill discharge or cyclone underflow bleed, is fed as a slurry toward {{the centre of the}} bowl from above. The feed slurry contacts the base plate of the vessel and, due to its rotation, is thrust outward. The outer extremities of the concentrate bowl house a series of ribs and between each pair of ribs is a groove. During operation the lighter material flows upward over the grooves and heavy mineral particles (usually of economic value) become trapped within them. Pressurized water is injected through a series of tangential water inlets along the perimeter of each groove to maintain a fluidized bed of particles in which heavy mineral particles can be efficiently concentrated. The Knelson concentrator typically operates as a batch process, with lighter gangue material being continuously discharged via overflow and a heavy mineral concentrate periodically removed by flushing the bowl with water.|$|E
40|$|The {{modelling}} of vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>feed</b> {{systems can}} be considered in two parts, namely the simulation of (a) the bowl feeder structure vibrations and (b) the behaviour of the components under feed conditions. This paper deals with the former problem using a lumped parameter approach, whereby a rigid bowl and rigid base are separated by three banks offexible leaf springs. Natural frequencies and mode shapes computed from the model are compared with those obtained by experimental modal analysis of a parts feeder. The model can be easily implemented on a digital computer using standard NAG routines for matrix manipulation and computation of eigenvalues and eigenuectors. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a flexible and vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>feeding</b> system which is suitable for use in a flexible manufacturing system. The vibratory bowl feeder for automatic assembly, presents a geometric model of the feeder, and develops force analysis, leading to dynamical modeling of the vibratory feeder. Based on the leaf-spring modeling of the three legs of the symmetrically arranged bowl of the feeder, and equating the vibratory feeder to a three-legged parallel mechanism, the paper reveals the geometric property of the feeder. The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation, and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix. This reveals the characteristics of the feeder, that the resultant force is along the z-axis and the resultant moment is about the z direction and further generates the closed-form motion equation. The analysis presents a dynamic model that integrates the angular displacement of the bowl with the displacement of the leaf-spring legs...|$|R

This amphipod {{can also be}} maintained with diets composed of dead or live material of both plant and animal origin, but an addition ofliving zooplankton is necessary for long-term cultivation. Starvation resistance is higher in females than inmales, and it is increased by lower temperatures. The life span of J. falcata increases with decreasing temperature, and it is generally higher in females (maximum: 252 days at 10 °C) than in males. In laboratory culture, a bimodal mortality pattern is typical with high juvenile death rates, low mortality during thereproductive phase, and again increasingly high death rates {{toward the end of}} the life cycle. Growth rate depends on temperature, sex, and individual age. The temperature dependence of growth is particularly high inmales, and it is higher in adults than in juveniles. The total number of moults is lower in males (5 to 6) than infemales (7 to 9). Sexual maturity is attained at moult IV to V. The average incubation time of eggs is about 9 to 16 days (highest value at 10 °C). Three to 4 broods were observed, with largest numbers of offspring at 10 °C...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{concepts}} {{relating to}} animal welfare accept that animals experience affective states. These are notoriously {{difficult to measure}} in non-verbal species, but it is generally agreed that emotional reactions consist of well-coordinated reactions in behaviour, autonomic and brain activation.

To this end, we repeatedly confronted dwarf goats at short intervals with a covered and an uncovered <b>feed</b> <b>bowl</b> (i. e. presumably frustrating and rewarding situations respectively) whilst simultaneously observing their behaviour, measuring heart-rate and heart-rate variability and haemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. When faced with a covered <b>feed</b> <b>bowl,</b> goats occupied themselves at locations away from the bowl and showed increased locomotion, while there was a general increase in prefrontal cortical activity. There was little indication of autonomic changes. In contrast, when feed was accessible, the goats reduced locomotion, focused their behaviour on the <b>feed</b> <b>bowl,</b> showed signs of sympathetically mediated arousal reflecting anticipation and, if any cortical activity at all was present, it was concentrated to the left hemisphere. We thus observed patterns in behaviour, sympathetic reaction and brain activity that distinguished between a situation of frustration and one of reward in dwarf goats.

40|$|Nutritional Positive Deviant (PD) infants grow ‘bigger` and ‘faster` {{than other}} infants {{living in a}} {{similarly}} socio-economically deprived environment. Certain positive feeding and care giving practices adopted by mothers of PD infants enable them rear better nourished and active infants. Limited data is available on using PD mothers as counselors encouraging appropriate and feasible infant feeding practices (IFP) in India. Hence, {{the present study was}} undertaken. The study was conducted in a slum of Delhi (India). Twenty-Five infants aged 6 - 12 months were weighed. Three infants with normal weight for age status (as per Gomez classification) were classified as PD infants. A PD inquiry (PDI) was conducted on current IFP in these families to identify PD behaviours adopted and determinants for the same. PD behaviours identified included: feeding modified family pot (energy dense) complementary food at least two times a day, supervised <b>bowl</b> <b>feeding</b> by the mother and father support to the mother in infant feeding and care giving. Two, of these three PD mothers volunteered to discuss the benefits of PD behaviours they had been practicing with the other 22 members of the group. The strategy promoted collective dialogue and discussion to try the PD behaviours through weekly group discussions over a period of four weeks. After four weeks, feeding modified family pot food with addition of 1 / 2 teaspoon of ghee (milk fat) in food (10 / 22), feeding an extra mid-day cereal snack (12 / 22) were PD behaviours adopted by other members of the group (22).

40|$|This amphipod {{is mainly}} a {{suspension}} feeder, {{but it can}} also switch to deposit feeding. It was cultivated instanding, unaerated finger <b>bowls,</b> <b>feeding</b> on detritus, living or dried algal matter, rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis), or large-sized phytoplankton. A mixture of these items gave best results and hence was used for long-termcultivation. Preliminary results are presented on ingestion rate (suspension feeding), digestion rate, starvationresistance, and elemental and biochemical composition. In the life cycle of C. insidiosum, several factors werefound to play an important role: temperature, individual age, sex, and in contrast to other amphipod speciesthus far studied also the age of the mother animal at the time of breeding. Increasing temperature reduces thetotal life span, the age and size at the time of attaining sexual maturity, and the duration of marsupial development. It increases growth and moulting rate. At increasing individual age, the growth rate, and in males also the moulting rate, decrease, while the number of offspring per brood and surprisingly also the duration ofits marsupial development increase. Females generally have a longer life span than males, and they show a higher number of moults, higher moulting frequency and growth rate, and a larger maximum body size. Body length and age at the time of reaching sexual maturity are smaller in males than in females. Furthermore the age of the mother animal at the time of breeding proved to be of particular importance: Individuals from early broods have an apparently longer life span than those originating from late broods, and they have more moults, mostly a higher growth rate, higher number of offspring and longer incubation of broods...|$|R

40|$|In {{their native}} habitat of Central and South America, {{capuchin}} monkeys (Cebus) spend 45 % to 55 % {{of their day}} foraging and a further 20 % travelling. Once these monkeys are introduced into captive environments their diets are selective, seasonal and presented to them by their keepers. The captive environment often leads to various behavioural abnormalities and compensatory behaviours or stereotypies. To address this issue, environmental enrichment can be employed to reduce, cure or prevent such an occurrence. Enrichment can reduce stress, while increasing animal well-being and health in captivity. Despite previous work {{a better understanding of}} enrichment, for most neo-tropical primate species, is necessary, in order to improve their captive lifestyles. Feeding of captive primates is more complex than providing a balanced nutritional diet as it must also meet their ethological needs. The manipulation of the presentation of the diet has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of resting, while significantly increasing the incidence of playing, grooming, foraging and manual manipulation of dietary items. Eleven capuchin monkeys were presented with four different feeding treatments (i. e. cut food presented in bowls, cut food presented around the enclosure, uncut food presented around the enclosure and novel feeding devices presented around the enclosure) from December 2007 until May 2008. At the start of every month one of three feeding treatments was introduced with the cut food in <b>bowls</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment interleaved between the treatments. The different feeding treatments required the monkeys to search for their food, break-up their food into manageable sizes, and obtain food in touch-, tool- and manipulative-dependent methods in order to allow the monkeys an opportunity to display increased activity more in line with their wild conspecifics. The capuchins displayed a period of intense foraging directly following feeding. This period significantly increased (from 44 to 121 min.), along with foraging events and the proportion of time spent foraging, which was more in line with their wild conspecifics. In addition, the frequency of occurrence and the proportion of time spent on locomotion and resting was shown to decrease. Also, abnormal behaviours ceased to occur during the study. Environmental enrichment is a useful tool for providing stimulation, redistributing activity levels more in line with wild conspecifics and to combat abnormal and compensatory behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Emergency {{management}} organisations recognise {{the vulnerability}} of infants in emergencies, even in developed countries. However, thus far, those who care for infants have not been provided with detailed information on what emergency preparedness entails. Emergency management authorities should provide those who care for infants with accurate and detailed information on the supplies necessary {{to care for them}} in an emergency, distinguishing between the needs of breastfed infants and the needs of formula fed infants. Those who care for formula fed infants should be provided with detailed information on the supplies necessary for an emergency preparedness kit and with information on how to prepare formula feeds in an emergency. An emergency preparedness kit for exclusively breastfed infants should include 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. The contents of an emergency preparedness for formula fed infants will vary depending upon whether ready-to-use liquid infant formula or powdered infant formula is used. If ready-to-use liquid infant formula is used, an emergency kit should include: 56 serves of ready-to-use liquid infant formula, 84 L water, storage container, metal knife, small <b>bowl,</b> 56 <b>feeding</b> bottles and teats/cups, 56 zip-lock plastic bags, 220 paper towels, detergent, 120 antiseptic wipes, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. If powdered infant formula is used, an emergency preparedness kit should include: two 900 g tins powdered infant formula, 170 L drinking water, storage container, large cooking pot with lid, kettle, gas stove, box of matches/lighter, 14 kg liquid petroleum gas, measuring container, metal knife, metal tongs, feeding cup, 300 large sheets paper towel, detergent, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. Great care with regards hygiene should be taken in the preparation of formula feeds. Child protection organisations should ensure that foster carers responsible for infants have the resources necessary to formula feed {{in the event of an}} emergency. Exclusive and continued breastfeeding should be promoted as an emergency preparedness activity by emergency management organisations as well as health authorities. The greater the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed when an emergency occurs, the more resilient the community, and the easier it will be to provide effective aid to the caregivers of formula fed infants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Appropriate {{feeding of}} infants and young {{children}} is necessary to prevent growth faltering and optimize health {{during the first two}} years of life. There is little information on the effects of dietary energy density and feeding frequency of complementary foods on food consumption during individual meals and the amount of caregiver time expended in child feeding. Methods: During nine separate, randomly ordered dietary periods lasting 3 - 6 days each, we measured self-determined intakes of semi-solid cereal porridges by 18 healthy, breastfed children 8 - 11 months of age. The infants were fed coded porridges with energy densities of 0. 5, 1. 0 or 1. 5 kcal/g, during three, four, or five meals/day. Complementary food intake was measured by weighing the <b>feeding</b> <b>bowl</b> before and after every meal. Results: Children consumed greater amounts of complementary foods per meal when they received diets with lower energy density and fewer meals per day. Greater time was expended per meal when fewer meals were offered. The time expended per meal did not vary with dietary energy density, but the children ate more and faster for the lower energy density diets. Conclusions: We conclude that the energy density and feeding frequency of complementary foods affect meal-specific food intake. Meal frequency also influences the duration of individual meals, but energy density does not. These results provide further evidence of young children’s ability to regulate their energy intakes, even during infancy, and convey information on factors that affect the amount of time that caregivers must devote to child feeding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The body {{temperature}} of 10 clinically healthy green iguanas (Iguana iguana) {{was measured using}} a thermographic camera (FLIR E 6, Flir Systems Sweden) {{before and after the}} food was offered. For each animal there were performed a total of 6 measurements (3 before feeding and 3 after the food was offered). The purpose of this experiment was to observe the thermographic pattern of the body before and after the feeding, since herbivore reptiles tend to bask after the feeding to increase the {{body temperature}} that will help them afterwards digest the food. The animals were housed in individual vivariums with every animal having a basking spot available. The pictures were taken outside the vivarium in an adjacent room. The animals were handled with gloves and transported in a cardboard box in order to avoid heat transfer between the handler and the iguana that would have produced thermal artefacts. Each individual was placed on a table on a styrofoam slate, again, to avoid the heat transfer between the table and the animal`s body. For each animal a total of 4 pictures were taken (up, front, left and right). The pictures were analysed with the FLIR Tools program that is provided by the manufacturer and 3 temperatures were taken into consideration (the head temperature, body temperature on the right side and body temperature on the left side). The temperatures were compared between them and with the temperature of the vivariums that consisted of the average between the temperature in 3 different spots (basking spot, the <b>feeding</b> <b>bowl</b> site and the coldest spot) measured with an infrared thermometer GM 300 (Benetech, China). The temperature of the body was dependent on the vivarium temperature and it was a significant temperature difference between the measurements before the feeding and after the feeding. Also we discovered {{a significant difference between the}} head temperature and the body temperature on the left side before the feeding that disappeared after the animals ate. There was also a significant difference between the temperature on right side and on left side of the animals both before and after the feeding. No significant temperature difference was observed between the head and the right side of the body neither before nor after the feeding...|$|R
