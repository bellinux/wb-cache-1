An up-conversion mixer {{has been}} {{designed}} for 0. 7 - 2. 6 GHz multi-mode and multi-standard RF subsystem working under 1. 8 V voltage based on TSMC 0. 18 μm process in this paper. The circuit {{is based on the}} use of pseudo-differential structure of the Gilbert cell, and in order to increase the gain and linearity, is using a complementary trans-conductance current <b>bleeding</b> <b>structure.</b> In addition, a T-type LC networks can reduce the effect of the parasitic capacitance of the LO switching pairs, and make the linearity of the high-frequency greatly improved. Simulation results show that the circuit is working at 0. 7 - 2. 6 GHz, the gain of the up-conversion is 9. 5 - 9. 7 dB, the IIP 3 of the circuit is 11. 4 - 12. 2 dBm, and NF is 13. 1 - 13. 5 dBm...|$|R

40|$|This review studies women's {{preferences}} for shared decision-making about heavy menstrual bleeding treatment and evaluates interventions that support shared decision-making and their effectiveness. PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Medline and ClinicalTrials. gov were searched. Three research questions were predefined: 1) What is {{the range of}} perspectives gathered in studies that examine women facing a decision related to heavy menstrual bleeding management?; 2) What types of interventions {{have been developed to}} support shared decision-making for women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding?; and 3) In what way might women benefit from interventions that support shared decision-making? All original studies were included if the study population consisted of women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. We used the TIDieR (Template for Intervention: Description and Replication) checklist to assess the quality of description and the reproducibility of interventions. Interventions were categorized using Grande et al. guidelines and collated and summarized outcomes measures into three categories: 1) patient-reported outcomes; 2) observer-reported outcomes; and 3) doctor-reported outcomes. Fifteen studies were included. Overall, patients preferred to decide together with their doctor (74 %). Women's previsit preference was the strongest predictor for treatment choice in two studies. Information packages did not have a statistically significant effect on treatment choice or satisfaction. However, adding a structured interview or decision aid to increase patient involvement did show a positive effect on treatment choice and results, patient satisfaction and shared decision-making related outcomes. In conclusion shared decision-making is becoming more important in the care of women with heavy menstrual <b>bleeding.</b> <b>Structured</b> interviews or well-designed (computerized) tools such as decision aids seem to facilitate this process, but there is room for improvement. A shared treatment choice is only possible after careful provision of information, elicitation of patients' preferences and integrating those preferences. Interventions should be designed accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Thrust ball {{bearings}} lubricated with several {{different types of}} grease, including three biodegradable low-toxicity greases, were tested in a modified four-ball machine in order to evaluate the bearing friction torque. At {{the end of each}} test, grease samples were obtained and analysed through ferrography, allowing the quantification and evaluation of the bearing wear. In order to compare the grease performance in terms of friction and wear, a correlation between the grease characteristics (base oil, <b>bleed</b> oil, thickener <b>structure,</b> and rheological parameters) and the experimental results was established...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) {{are rare}} tumours, now more {{frequently}} {{identified with the}} new imaging modalities like computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report a rare presentation of a GIST with an unusual diagnostic workup in a multidisciplinary setting leading to a definitive diagnosis and treatment. Case presentation A 55 -year-old lady was admitted under the general surgeons, with 3 -day history of abdominal pain, three-week history of loss of appetite and weight. The patient was sequentially investigated with ultrasonography, computerised tomography and finally selective angiogram in a multidisciplinary setting. The selective angiogram showed a GIST with intratumour bleed, leading to successful surgical excision and being recurrence free at 22 month follow up. Conclusion Clinical presentation of these tumours can be varied and gastrointestinal bleeding is the commonest mode described in the literature. The clinician needs {{to be aware of}} much more rare presentations of the GIST including an intra tumour <b>bleed.</b> A <b>structured</b> multidisciplinary approach would lead to successful diagnosis and treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aspirin {{chlorzoxazone}} ester linked mutual prodrug was synthesized {{with the}} aim of improving the therapeutic index through prevention of gastrointestinal irritation and <b>bleeding.</b> The <b>structure</b> of the synthesized ester prodrug was conﬁrmed by IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy and their purity was established by elemental analysis, HPLC and TLC. The release of ASP as well as CZX, from the ester prodrug was studied. A validated analytical HPLC method for the estimation of the ASP, and the prodrug was developed. The kinetics of ester hydrolysis was studied in four different non-enzymatic buffer solutions, at pH 3, 4, 5 and 7. 4 as well as in experimental plasma. Study of skeletal muscle relaxant and anti-inﬂammatory properties in comparison with the reference compounds has shown that both skeletal muscle relaxant and anti-inﬂammatory activities were present at the same doses of the investigated compounds. The ester was found to be less irritating to gastric mucosal membrane than the parent drugs. These results suggest that the synthesized prodrug is characterized by better therapeutic index than the parent drugs...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal uterine {{bleeding}} (AUB) is {{a common}} and debilitating condition with high direct and indirect costs. AUB frequently co-exists with fibroids, but {{the relationship between the}} two remains incompletely understood and in many women the identification of fibroids may be incidental to a menstrual <b>bleeding</b> complaint. A <b>structured</b> approach for establishing the cause using the Fédération International de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) PALM-COEIN (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy (and hyperplasia), Coagulopathy, Ovulatory disorders, Endometrial, Iatrogenic and Not otherwise classified) classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. Office hysteroscopy and increasing sophisticated imaging will assist provision of robust evidence for the underlying cause. Increased availability of medical options has expanded the choice for women and many will no longer need to recourse to potentially complicated surgery. Treatment must remain individualised and encompass the impact of pressure symptoms, desire for retention of fertility and contraceptive needs, as well as address the management of AUB in order to achieve improved quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Heterotopic gastric mucosa of the {{proximal}} esophagus (HGMPE), {{also referred to}} as &#x 201 C;inlet patch&#x 201 D; or &#x 201 C;cervical inlet patch&#x 201 D;, is a salmon colored patch that is usually located just distal to the upper esophageal sphincter. HGMPE is uncommon with endoscopic studies reporting a prevalence ranging from less than one percent to 18 %. Most HGMPE are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally during endoscopy for evaluations of other gastrointestinal complaints. Most consider HGMPE as clinically irrelevant entity. The clinical significance of HGMPE is mainly acid related or neoplastic transformation. The reported prevalence of laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms varies from less than 20 % to as high as 73. 1 %. However, most of these symptoms are mild. Clinically significant acid related complications such as <b>bleeding,</b> ulcerations, <b>structure</b> and fistulization have been reported. Although rare, dysplastic changes and malignancies in association with HGMPE have also been reported. Associations with Barrett&#x 2019;s esophagus have also been reported but the findings so far have been conflicting. There are still many areas that are unknown or not well understood and these include the natural history of HGMPE, risk factors for complications, role of Helicobacter pylori infection and factors associated with malignant transformations. Follow-up may need to be considered for patients with complications of HGMPE and surveillance if biopsies show intestinal metaplasia or dysplastic changes. Despite the overall low incidence of clinically relevant manifestations reported in the literature, HGMPE is a clinically significant entity but further researches are required to better understand its clinical significance...|$|R
40|$|Arachnoid cysts are {{the most}} common {{congenital}} cystic lesions in the brain occurring in the middle fossa, suprasellar region and occasionally in the posterior fossa. Conventionally all cysts are considered as benign and symptoms are attributed to expansion of cysts causing compression of adjacent neurological <b>structures,</b> <b>bleeds</b> within the cyst or due to the development of acute hydrocephalus. We are reporting this case of a 15 -year-old female patient with non-progressive weakness in the limbs since the age of seven years who presented with acute onset syncopal attacks and respiratory failure. She was intubated and ventilated. An magnetic resonance imaging scan showed large posterior fossa cyst extending up to mid second cervical vertebra causing compression of the medulla and pons, with mild hydrocephalus. After a failed attempt to wean her from the ventilator a cysto peritoneal shunt surgery was performed following which she was weaned from the ventilator successfully. Weakness in the upper and lower limbs, which had increased in the preceding month, also improved following the surgery...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) {{is still}} {{the most common cause of}} chronic motor {{disability}} in hildhood. Until now, there has not been any previous national study of the anorama of subtypes, severity or risk factors among children with CP in Norway. his is a population based study of a cohort of children with CP born 1996 to 1998 in orway. These children are recorded in the Cerebral Palsy Register of Norway. The P definition and classification system agreed on by the Surveillance of Cerebral alsy in Europe (SCPE) are applied. The study showed that the prevalence of CP in orway was 2. 1 per 1000 live births, comparable with other similar populations. Most children were classified in the spastic bilateral subtype (49 %), about ne third (33 %) in the spastic unilateral subtype and less than 10 % in the dyskinetic r in the ataxic subtype. Both the distribution of subtypes and gross motor function impairments were comparable with other populations in developed countries. More children in our study had fine motor function impairments, as well as associated impairments. The associated impairments included both impairment of speech and feeding, in addition to impairments of vision, hearing, cognition and presence of active epilepsy. We identified both breech presentation and induction of labour as independent risk factors for CP. There was a significant increased risk of CP in children born in breech presentation compared to vertex presentation, in particular for singletons born at term by vaginal delivery. Breech presentation was however not associated with specific subtypes of CP or with the extent of gross or fine motor impairments. There was also an increased risk for CP in children after induction of labour. Induction of labour was associated with a higher proportion of children with the bilateral spastic subtype as well as in those born at term with four-limb involvement. When we studied multiple risk factors (maternal disease, assisted fertilization, plurality, abnormal placental <b>structure,</b> <b>bleeding</b> in pregnancy, small for gestational age, abnormal presentation, Apgar score at 5 minutes < 7 and preterm birth) we found that increasing number of risk factors were associated with an exponentially increased risk for CP. Combinations of these risk factors were more common in children born preterm, while both among term and preterm born children, few shared the same combinations of risk factors. </p...|$|R
