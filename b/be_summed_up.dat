5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} coast of western India {{came into being}} around 100 to 80mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot, a {{volcanic}} hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of Réunion. An eruption here some 66mya {{is thought to have}} laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region {{led to the formation of}} hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three or four of these tribes. Their religious practices could <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as animism.|$|E
25|$|EcM {{communities}} {{continue to}} exhibit rare EcM fungal constituents {{that have not}} been excluded, despite intense competition. Thus, mechanisms must exist that maintain diverse levels of EcM fungi. This coexistence can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in four non-mutually exclusive possibilities illustrated by Bruns: niche partitioning, disturbance-related patch dynamics, density-dependent mortality and competitive networks.|$|E

She led the WCC in both scoring and assists {{on the way to}} a second {{straight}} unbeaten season in conference play. Vandersloot was named WCC Player of the Year for an unprecedented third time. The Zags again won the WCC Tournament, and Vandersloot was named tournament MVP for the third straight time, also becoming the first women's player in WCC history to win that honor three times.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as saying that it suffers from the fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its implications are, has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E
25|$|Mr. T.M. Carnegie's {{abilities}} {{were too}} numerous and complex to <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in a sentence. He {{was a man}} of sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience.|$|E
25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E
25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and {{granular}} (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} integument and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in three words: [...] "work, discipline, and feeding". Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, {{that is to say}} punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.|$|E

Game Informer, along with numerous other publications, rated it higher than Halo: Combat Evolved, citing enhanced multiplayer and less repetitive gameplay. Most critics noted that Halo 2 stuck with the formula that made its predecessor successful, and was alternatively praised and faulted for this decision. Edges review concluded that Halo 2 could <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> with a line from its script: [...] "It's not a new plan. But we know it'll work." ...|$|E
500|$|In the US, James Sandoe, {{writing in}} the New York Herald Tribune thought that For Your Eyes Only had [...] "urban savagery and mighty smooth tale-spinning". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—described what his main issue with Fleming's work was: [...] "his basic {{weakness}} as a storyteller, which can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in two words: 'no story.'" [...] In the short story form, however, Boucher finds that Bond's tales [...] "are proportionate" [...] and that Fleming's [...] "prose... is eminently smooth and readable" [...] even if [...] "Bond's triumphs are too simple and lack... intricate suspense".|$|E
500|$|The New York Daily News Carolina González {{wrote that}} the content on the EP was not {{specifically}} tied to Latin American topics even though Chana performs the songs in Spanish. Ayala Ben-Yehuda of Billboard agreed with González, and reported that Chana's music did not fit into [...] "any rigid Spanish-language genres". González noted that the material crossed several genres, describing it as [...] "boundary-ignoring music that can best <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as pop". She noted that the instrumentation, specifically the guitar, drums, keyboards, synthesizers, and horns, were reminiscent of reggae, power pop, and disco. Agustin Gurza described Chana's vocals as a combination of [...] "soulful inflections" [...] and [...] "electronic staccato phrasing".|$|E

500|$|Ramachandran regards egotism {{as one of}} {{the central}} themes in Mullum Malarum, with Kali, the community's alpha male, {{surrounded}} by sycophants who compliment him. He plays God in allowing the villagers to ride the winch (saving them the exertion of walking), and is jolted when the supervising engineer Kumaran arrives. As a subordinate, Kali cannot oppose Kumaran; his frustration threatens to erupt several times before it finally does and he is suspended. His feelings can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in the line, [...] "Raman aandalum, Ravanan aandalum, enakku oru kavalai illai, naan thaan da en manasukku raaja" [...] (...) , in resistance to Kumaran's authoritarian yoke. J. Ramki, author of the book Rajni: Sapthama? Sagaapthama?, noted that Rajinikanth had displayed resentment at the AIADMK since this film, with those lyrics.|$|E
500|$|... "The D'oh-cial Network" [...] {{was written}} by J. Stewart Burns and {{directed}} by Chris Clements {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–2012). It was the second episode written by Burns that season, the first being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed". According to Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club, the episode satirizes the phenomenon of the social networking website Facebook. He commented that [...] "the thrust of the satire can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> with the age-old cry of parents to their offspring to put that damn thing down and go outside already." [...] Childs added that the episode points out [...] "the most blatant of the many faults of Facebook—namely, its hypnotic ability to distract people in a semi-narcissistic haze [...] ".|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} 1974–1975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to {{approximately}} 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers {{and due to}} desertions. U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC). Authorized a total of 113 officers and men, the team arrived in Phnom Penh in 1971, under the overall command of CINCPAC Admiral John S. McCain, Jr. [...] The attitude of the Nixon administration could <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> by the advice given by Henry Kissinger to the first head of the liaison team, Colonel Jonathan Ladd: [...] "Don't think of victory; just keep it alive."

500|$|The {{main source}} for Ljótólfr is the Orkneyinga saga, which was {{compiled}} sometime around 1200 {{by an unknown}} Icelander. The saga {{is thought to have}} been based upon poetry, oral tradition, and other written material. It can <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as an account of the lives of many of the earls of Orkney between the 9th and 13th centuries. According to research fellow Ian Beuermann, the saga is useful not for the specific events it describes, but rather for what it reveals about [...] "the ideas shaping the texts during the periods of composition or revision". For example, it is possible that even one of the main characters of the saga, Sveinn Ásleifarson, never existed, or at least that the historical Sveinn differed from the saga's portrayal of him. Another source which mentions Ljótólfr is Þormóður Torfason's 17th-century Latin history of Orkney, which follows the Orkneyinga saga.|$|E

Everything I do is related to building a nationalist movement through which peaceful persuasion and through the ballot box can place us in a position whereby those 14 words can be carried out." [...] He reiterated his contention of Jewish control over the media, {{as well as his}} prior stance on Holocaust denial, and said that his aim was to [...] " [...] political power so as to be able to institute changes, to undo the population shift which has taken place since 1948 with the first Immigration Act, to peacefully and as humanely as possible reverse that and to return Britain to being a homogeneous white nation".|$|E
500|$|Five {{days before}} the first PS2 release for Kanon, a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. Kanon {{was one of the}} three games {{supported}} at launch, the other two being America Ōden Ultra Quiz from DigiCube and Marle de Jigsaw from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of Kanons story could <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as [...] "the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end," [...] resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Kanon ranked fifth with 71 votes.|$|E
