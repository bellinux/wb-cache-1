They may have painful associations, and so they inter-breathe with the material you’re using”.|$|E

The grand opening of the atrium and stores was held on February 14, 1983, with the apartments and offices following shortly thereafter. The forty ground floor stores in the tower were opened for business on November 30, 1983. At the building's dedication, Mayor Koch said, [...] "This is not your low-income housing project [...] of which we need many.

500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to {{people like you and}} me", whereas [...] "stars <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E

Of her signing, Beat head coach James Galanis said, [...] "She {{is a fantastic}} midfielder and someone who is fully focused on the game.

She has made a lot of sacrifices off the field to reach her dreams, and she is going to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> professionalism to the team." [...] Lloyd scored two goals in her ten appearances for the Beat. She scored the team's lone goal in a 4–1 defeat by the Boston Breakers on April 9. Her second goal on the season was an equalizer during the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw against the Western New York Flash. The Beat finished their first season in last place with a 1–4–13 record.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.9 out of 10 rating, {{and said that}} Hooks' role as Jenna's mother [...] "helped the half hour, but this Jenna-centric episode still didn't blow me away." [...] He noted that the main plot had funny moments but [...] "there wasn't much else to invest in." [...] Overall, Canning reasoned that this episode {{was very much a}} stand-alone one [...] "built for some good jokes, and not exactly focused on storytelling. [...] An episode like 'Verna' can still <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> laughs, but you can't help but feel like it's missing that extra something." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked both stories from [...] "Verna", and wrote that it was a disappointing episode, and that it was [...] "pretty weak overall." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, reported that despite Hooks' hilarious performance, the episode still felt a [...] "little bit like filler", and that there [...] "wasn't too much that was especially funny or memorable about it".|$|E

[...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably whats going to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability to do whatever he desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do anything... If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics, {{many of whom}} praised the case-of-the-week and the character development of Dick Casablancas. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He lauded the episode's handling of its political subject matter {{and the return of}} older storylines. He argued that [...] "I Know What You'll Do Next Summer" [...] used its political message much better than [...] "Un-American Graffiti", which aired two weeks prior; he thought that this episode's story made its political message more subtle than the previous episode. The reviewer also enjoyed the development of Dick's character that occurred with the return of his father, stating that the scene in which Dick yelled at his father [...] "an excellent moment that helped <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> new shading to the funny, but usually one-note character." [...] Keith's storyline was another center of praise, with the reviewer stating that he thought the Fitzpatricks' plot line had been too rushed earlier in the season. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly was generally positive as well, noting the romantic uncertainty between Veronica and Piz, Logan and Parker, and Mac and Max, drawing parallels between this aspect of the episode and the series' uncertain future. In addition, the reviewer thought highly of Dick's confrontation with his father and the case-of-the-week. Television Without Pity graded the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie {{we do have}} character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but we chose {{to do it this}} way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E

[...] He was critical of the lack of differentiation between the game and its predecessor, arguing [...] "it feels more like an expansion than a true sequel. If you've played the first game, Ties That Bind simply feels like more of the same." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind is a solid action title that should satisfy fans of the original game. Although the game doesn't <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> new experiences to the table, it does do a great job of adding to the experience gamers enjoyed the first time around." [...] Scott Osborne scored the PC version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "the gameplay feels stuck in the past, like a rerun of the first game." [...] He was critical of the port, citing [...] "graphics glitches," [...] "problems loading saved games," [...] and game-breaking bugs. He concluded, [...] "The gameplay and locales aren't particularly exciting, yet the pacing is taut, and the story and acting are above par. Fans of the first game should enjoy learning more about Torque's clouded life, but if you're new to the series, you're probably better off picking up the original." ...|$|E
