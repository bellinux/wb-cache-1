50|$|A {{spill pallet}} is a bunded {{secondary}} containment item {{that is designed}} to hold containers of oil and fuels, typically in either a 205-litre drum or in an intermediate <b>bulk</b> <b>container.</b> It is called a 'secondary containment item' because it is designed to catch the leaks and spill of the container's contents which rest upon it.|$|E
50|$|In wave soldering, {{components}} are prepped (trimmed or modified) and {{installed on the}} PCB. Sometimes, to prevent movement they are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive or secured with a fixture, then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a <b>bulk</b> <b>container.</b> This solder flow is forced to produce a standing wave so the whole PCB is not submerged in solder, but rather just touched. The end result is that solder stays on pins and pads, {{but not on the}} PCB itself.|$|E

50|$|Bulk {{foods are}} food items offered in large quantities, {{which can be}} {{purchased}} in large, bulk lots or transferred from a <b>bulk</b> <b>container</b> into a smaller container for purchase. Bulk foods may be priced less compared to packaged foods because they're typically packaged in large generic bulk containers and packaging for grocery outlets, which utilizes lesser natural resources. Additionally, less packaging is congruent with the environmental conservation {{of natural resources and}} sustainability. One study found a 96% reduction in packaging used for bulk foods compared to packaged foods.|$|E

50|$|Ningbo is {{not just}} an {{ordinary}} city—it has the same authority as provincial governments for economic administration—and has a port second only to Shanghai around {{the world in terms of}} annual cargo throughput. Unlike Shanghai, the port is deep-water and capable of handling 300,000 tonne vessels. The port is located mainly in Beilun district and Zhenhai district. In 2006, Ningbo Port started its expansion to the neighbouring island City of Zhoushan for the purpose of building an even larger port with higher capacity to compete with neighbouring ports in the region, such as Shanghai's Yangshan Deep-Water Port. The statistics in 2010 showed that total cargo throughput was 627,000,000 tonnes and container throughput 13,144,000 TEUs. With <b>bulk</b> <b>container</b> breakdowns, hugely improved logistics, and massive chemical and foodstuff, processing developments, Ningbo could yet win the race with Shanghai as port of choice for servicing the Chinese east coast.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Washington and Oregon became {{important}} {{states in}} the production of apples and pears in the early 1900 's. During these beginning stages, wooden boxes were used for shipping both apples and pears. Apple containerization has progressed through several stages. Today, the most common container for shipment of apples out of the Northwest is the tray-packed corrugated carton. Pear containerization, on the other hand, has changed only slightly. Presently, the container most commonly used for shipment of pears is a wooden box of approximately the same dimensions as its early predecessor. Improvements on the wooden box have been made, but basically the container has remained unchanged. In this study, the tray-packed apple carton and the wooden pear box are referred to as standard containers. These two standard containers will be compared to a five bushel, corrugated container, which will be referred to as a bulk bin. In evaluating the expenses which arise when packing fruit in <b>bulk</b> and standard <b>containers,</b> only the cost differentials were discussed. The major cost categories that were analyzed were: labor, materials, packing house commissions and overhead, and miscellaneous. Due {{to the nature of the}} packing house operations, only labor and material expenses gave rise to cost differentials. The cost differential in favor of <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> over standard containers was l. 4784 per 100 pounds of packed apples and 1. 2995 per 100 pounds of packed pears. In order to determine the shipping quality of <b>bulk</b> <b>containers,</b> three shipments of fruit packed in <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> were inspected. Two shipments of Anjou pears packed in standard and <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> were sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The third shipment was sent to Los Angeles, California and consisted of Red Delicious apples packed in <b>bulk</b> <b>containers.</b> In the pear shipments, three types of damage were recorded. These were: bruising, discoloration, and punctures or skin tears, In the apple shipment, only bruising and puncture damage were recorded. After the containers were inspected and the damages recorded, comparisons between containers were made. Using statistical methods, it was shown that there was no difference in total damage between the <b>bulk</b> and standard <b>containers.</b> In order to determine where the damage was occurring, the <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> were divided by height into three equal layers. Using this procedure, the damages occurring in the top, middle, and bottom layers could be identified and compared. Bruising was found to be most severe in the bottom layer. Discoloration and puncture damage was not affected by the layer treatment. From the information gathered in this study, it appears that two important observations can be made. First, the cost associated with 100 pounds of fruit can be substantially reduced by using bulk bins and second, the arrival condition of apples and pears packed in <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> will be about the same as fruit packed in standard containers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} Bulk Specialty Gas delivery Systems (BSGS) {{were designed}} and tested up to flow rates of 1000 slpm. Conventional gas delivery, conventional liquid delivery and a novel liquid delivery system featuring Total Vaporization (TV) were compared {{in terms of}} product consistency {{and the amount of}} available ammonia from a <b>bulk</b> <b>container.</b> The delivered gas was monitored for moisture fluctuations as a function of flow rate and time. Results from the TV design showed consistent moisture levels at all flow rates, while both the gas and the conventional liquid delivery systems exhibited dramatic fluctuations in moisture concentration. Additionally, liquid delivery systems supply continuous flow rates greater than 5000 slpm, while gas delivery systems can not sustain flow rates higher than 600 slpm due to heat transfer limitations. Furthermore, liquid delivery enables the consumption of nearly the entire product, while maintaining constant moisture levels. Empirical evidence has shown that 96 % of the container's contents can be used if the liquid delivery system is employed. However, with a gas or conventional liquid delivery system the impurity levels are uncontrollable and increase throughout the consumption of the <b>bulk</b> <b>container.</b> As a result, it is uncommon for the product to be completely consumed and purifier lifetime can not be accurately assessed...|$|E

40|$|Abctract In my diploma thesis I {{deal with}} actions that happen around bulk containers, that are {{intended}} to collect larger pieces of domestic waste and that are periodically placed in public space in Prague. I consider the <b>bulk</b> <b>container</b> as an actor, which leads us to particular practices of guarding, disposession and collecting stuff (from the container). I use method of multi-sited ethnography to investigate how the value of disposed objects change according to actions around container and according to change of {{the context in which}} it is newly placed. I identify several kinds of value, that are inscribed to wasted objects by their new owners. Waste can become valuable with regard to its economic potencial (as a thing or material that can be sold), with regard to possibility of its further practic use (as a household equipment or material), with regard to its estethic value (as an indicator of taste or as an artefact) or it can gain some specific kind of value in socially engaged context. It is possible to consider the <b>bulk</b> <b>container</b> as an actor of recyclation.
