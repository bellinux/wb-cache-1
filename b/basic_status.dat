The Stockholm class was a successful design and the ships' <b>basic</b> <b>status</b> was good despite a hard life so the Swedish Defence Administration decided to give the ships a second life. HMS Malmö was the first to be modernised in 1999 with HMS Stockholm following suit 2000. The modernisation included new engines, combat control systems, fire control systems, SIGINT and navigational systems. The ships both went through extensive modification of the mast, hull and superstructure to reduce their radar cross-section. Much of the modification was also made with low maintenance in mind to minimise the need for expensive repairs in the future. The guiding principle for the project was to update as much of the systems as possible to the same level as the Visby Corvettes. Both ships are back in operational condition now, attached to the 31'st Corvette Division of the 3rd Naval Warfare Flotilla.|$|E

A scripting language was thus created that would allow blind programmers to design graphical Microsoft Visual Basic forms by specifying the layout in a text file rather than using the conventional “point and click ” method. The compiler for the language was written in Microsoft Visual C++ and utilizes a table-driven parser to interpret the user’s text file and output its respective form file.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the high {{efficiency}} and security of supply chain information coordination under cloud computing environment, this paper proposes a supply chain information coordination mode based on cloud computing. This mode has two <b>basic</b> <b>statuses</b> which are online status and offline status.

At the offline status, information exchange can be realized among different nodes by using the pre-backup supply chain information and network address of other nodes. This coordination mode coordinates the whole supply chain information through the cloud computing center at the online status and maximizes the overall benefit. Meanwhile, the offline status effectively avoids the risks to the whole supply chain brought by the overdependence of cloud computing on network and the high information concentration. The two statuses have good customers’ satisfaction and higher order finished rate in supply chain.

40|$|Objective　To {{observe the}} effects of four {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) methods on lung ventilation of pigs with respiratory arrest. The four CPR methods included chest compression CPR (C-CPR), compression under the diaphragm CPR (D-CPR), abdominal compression CPR (A-CPR), and abdominal wall lifting and compression CPR (L-CPR). Methods　 A total of 28 healthy domestic pigs were randomly divided into four groups. The pig respiratory arrest model was reproduced by intravenous injection of suxamethonium. Instantly after respiratory arrest, one of the 4 CPR methods was performed immediately on the groups of pigs respectively. After 2 min of CPR, compression was stopped. The experimental pigs were given assisted respiration using a ventilator until autonomous respiration recovered. The tidal volume (VT) in <b>basic</b> <b>status</b> and that during resuscitation by the four respective resuscitation methods was determined, and minute ventilation (MV) was calculated. Furthermore, heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure, and recovery time of autonomous respiration were compared between all the groups. Results In <b>basic</b> <b>status,</b> there was no statistical difference (P > 0. 05) in VT and MV between the four groups. Approximately 2 min after resuscitation, the VT and MV of D-CPR were {{higher than that of}} C-CPR; that of A-CPR was higher than that of D-CPR; and that of L-CPR was higher than that of A-CPR. The differences were statistically significant (P 0. 05). HR in C-CPR and D-CPR were notably lower than the basic value (P < 0. 01). Two minutes after resuscitation, mechanical ventilation was given, and HR in all the groups was close to the basic value 5 min after resuscitation. In the respiratory arrest pig model, L-CPR could provide more effective VT and MV than the other methods. Conclusion　For the porcine respiratory arrest model, L-CPR can provide more effective lung ventilation than the other methods...|$|E

40|$|Cooperative driving {{holds the}} {{potential}} to considerably improve the level of safety and efficiency on our roads. Recent advances in in-vehicle sensing and wireless communication technology have {{paved the way for}} the development of cooperative traffic safety applications based on the exchange of data between vehicles (or between vehicles and road side units) over a wireless link. The access to up-to-date status information from surrounding vehicles is vital to most cooperative driving applications. Other applications rely on the fast dissemination of warning messages in case a hazardous event or certain situation is detected. Both message types put high requirements on timeliness and reliability of the underlying communication protocols. The recently adopted European profile of IEEE 802. 11 p defines two message types, periodic beacons for <b>basic</b> <b>status</b> exchange and event-triggered hazard warnings, both operating at pre-defined send rates and sharing a common control channel. The IEEE 802. 11 p Medium Access Control (MAC) scheme is a random access protocol that does not offer deterministic real-time support, i. e. no guarantee that a packet is granted access to the channel before its deadline can be given.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} basic {{framework}} for understanding {{the decisions of the}} Supreme Court of Canada relating to aboriginal and treaty rights. It argues that the foundations of these rights lie in the common law doctrine of aboriginal rights, which originated in ancient custom generated by historical relations between the Crown and indigenous peoples, as informed by basic principles of justice. This sui generis doctrine is par t of the common law of Canada and operates uniformly across the country, it also provides the context for interpreting section 35 (1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The doctrine of aboriginal rights has a number of distinct branches. One branch governs treaties between indigenous peoples and the Crown, and determines their <b>basic</b> <b>status,</b> existence, interpretation and effects. Another branch deals with the various types of aboriginal rights, including aboriginal title and the right of self-government. Here, the doctrine distinguishes between generic and specific rights, exclusive and non-exclusive rights, and depletable and non-depletable rights. Still other branches of the doctrine articulate the principles governing the operation of aboriginal customary l aw and the fiduciary role of the Crown...|$|E
