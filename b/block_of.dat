On East Chestnut, the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 block is filled with bungalows. St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, a Spanish-flavored neo-Baroque structure with a Moorish-styled rectory, {{is located on the}} 300 <b>block</b> <b>of</b> East Chestnut. Another church is located on the 400 block including the Gothic Revival style First Presbyterian Church (with lancet windows and belltower), and a typical Works Progress Administration Art Modern school whose cruciform plan has a stuccoed facade and metal casement windows.|$|E

We show that their conjecture holds for principal <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> quasi-simple groups, for all <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> finite reductive groups in their defining characteristic, as well as for all covering groups of symmetric and alternating groups. For the proof, we determine the minimal non-trivial character degrees of Sylow p-subgroups of finite reductive groups in characteristic p.

5|$|Tememe Derech built {{a synagogue}} in the 500 <b>block</b> <b>of</b> Carondelet Street in the Central City section of New Orleans in 1867.

Tememe Derech's membership, however, never exceeded 50, and in 1903 or 1904 the synagogue disbanded, and merged with a number of other small Orthodox congregations and a burial society to form Beth Israel. Services were initially held in rented quarters in the same 500 <b>block</b> <b>of</b> Carondelet Street.|$|E
