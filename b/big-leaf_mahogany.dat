50|$|Harvest of wild Handroanthus impetiginosus for lumber to make {{flooring}} and decking (in {{which case}} it {{is referred to as}} ipê in much of the timber trade) has become a major cause of deforestation in the Amazon. Because the trees do not grow in concentrated stands but instead are found scattered throughout the forest, logging roads have to be built long distances to locate and harvest the trees. In most cases, once these trees are logged, the rest of the forest is cleared for agricultural use. Scientific examination of current logging practices, in which 90% of mature trees can be legally harvested, found that recovery from juvenile populations within 60 years was not likely under any feasible scenario (five were modeled). The parallel to the overharvesting of Swietenia macrophylla (<b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany),</b> a tree that grows in a similar distribution in the same areas as ipê, is interesting, yet ipê continues to be logged at prodigious rates with no sign of a listing in the Convention on Trade in International Species or other drastic actions likely necessary to prevent extinction. Swietenia mahagoni and Swietenia humilis (other species yielding mahogany wood) were so thoroughly depleted that by the early 1900s there were essentially none left to harvest in the wild. Unfortunately the current scenario is one in which Handroanthus is headed for similar unsustainable depletion of wild populations.|$|E

Our research was aimed to know the variations of width of growth rings, and growth response of young <b>Big-Leaf</b> <b>Mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla) to the past wet climate in Bengkulu, Indonesia. Wood disc specimens of cross sections were collected from seven different mahogany trees from campus forest, University of Bengkulu, and then were dried, sanded, and digitally photographed. Growth rings were measured to the nearest 0. 001 cm with ImageJ software. The annual ring width data were cross-dated visually by synchronizing and aligning the width patterns of all wood specimens. The results showed that the average of annual growth rings varied from 0. 679 cm/year to 1. 047 cm/year, and was not significantly different among trees.

40|$|<b>Big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} and overharvested timber trees of tropical America. A description of the organization of genetic variation across its broad range would be useful for management of genetic diversity and for understanding its demographic history. Here we report on a phylogeographic analysis of mahogany based on six polymorphic cpDNA simple sequence repeat loci (cpSSRs) genotyped in 16 populations distributed across the Brazilian Amazon and Mesoamerica (N = 245 individuals). Of the 31 cpDNA haplotypes identified, 15 occurred in Amazonia and 16 in Mesoamerica with no single haplotype shared between the two regions. The populations from Central America showed moderate differentiation (FST = 0. 36) while within population genetic diversity was generally high (mean Nei's HE = 0. 639). In contrast, the Amazonian populations were strongly differentiated (FST = 0. 95) and contained low haplotype diversity (mean HE = 0. 176), with the exception of the highly diverse Marajoara population from the Eastern Amazon (HE = 0. 925). SAMOVA identified a single Mesoamerican phylogroup and four Amazonian phylogroups, indicating stronger phylogeographic structure within Amazonia.

40|$|Despite {{increasing}} evidence that plant intra- and inter-specific diversity increases primary productivity, {{and that such}} effect may in turn cascade up to influence herbivores, there is little information about plant diversity effects on plant anti-herbivore defenses, {{the relative importance of}} different sources of plant diversity, and the mechanisms for such effects. For example, increased plant growth at high diversity may lead to reduced investment in defenses via growth-defense trade-offs. Alternatively, positive effects of plant diversity on plant growth may lead to increased herbivore abundance which in turn leads to a greater investment in plant defenses. The magnitude of trait variation underlying diversity effects is usually greater among species than among genotypes within a given species, so plant species diversity effects on resource use by producers as well as on higher trophic levels should be stronger than genotypic diversity effects. Here we compared the relative importance of plant genotypic and species diversity on anti-herbivore defenses and whether such effects are mediated indirectly via diversity effects on plant growth and/or herbivore damage. To this end, we performed a large-scale field experiment where we manipulated genotypic diversity of <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla) and tree species diversity, and measured effects on mahogany growth, damage by the stem-boring specialist caterpillar Hypsipyla grandella, and defensive traits (polyphenolics and condensed tannins in stem and leaves).

Here we assess the genetic structure of the Mesoamerican mahogany Swietenia macrophylla King (<b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany),</b> a Neotropical tree species recently listed as endangered in CITES which is commercially extinct through much of its native range. We used seven variable microsatellite loci to assess genetic diversity and population structure in eight naturally established mahogany populations from six Mesoamerican countries. Measures of genetic differentiation (F ST and R ST) indicated significant differences between most populations. Unrooted dendrograms based on genetic distances between populations provide evidence of strong phylogeographic structure in Mesoamerican mahogany. The two populations on the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica and Panama were genetically distant from all the others, and from one another. The remaining populations formed two clusters, one comprised of the northern populations of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala and the other containing the southern Atlantic populations of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Significant correlation was found between geographical distance and all pairwise measures of genetic divergence, suggesting the importance of regional biogeography and isolation by distance in Mesoamerican mahogany. The results of this study demonstrate greater phylogeographic structure than has been found across Amazon basin S. macrophylla. Our findings suggest a relatively complex Mesoamerican biogeographic history and lead to the prediction that other Central American trees will show similar patterns of regional differentiation. ...|$|E

Nutrient concentrations of leaves and soils were determined spectrophotometrically, and isotope ratios were measured using mass spectrometric techniques. In Pará soils were sandier, and acidic, receiving above 2000 mm of rain, whereas in Quintana Roo soils were predominantly clayey, with neutral to alkaline pH due to the underlying calcareous substrate, with about 1300 mm of rain. Leaf area/weight ratio was similar for both sites, but leaves from Quintana Roo were significantly smaller. Average N and K concentrations of adult leaves were similar, whereas Ca concentration was only slightly lower in Pará in spite of large differences in Ca availability. Leaves from this site had slightly higher P and lower Al concentrations. Differences in water use efficiency as measured by the natural abundance of 13 C were negligible, the main effect of lower rainfall in Quintana Roo seemed to be a reduction in leaf area.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the economic returns of subsistence farmers from small-scale tree farms in Bontoc Municipality, Southern Leyte, and the reasons that influence attitudes of farmers towards tree domestication. Yemani (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) and <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla king.) are the most commonly planted timber species in Southern Leyte. They are frequently planted as intercrops in coconut plantations, and sometimes on farm boundaries and along highways. In recent times, harvesting of yemani has been a common occurrence throughout the municipality. The derived products are widely used by farmers for a variety of purposes. Bolt or sticks are used as boat keels while other parts are further processed into lumber for household construction and repairs. In rare cases, the lumber produced is sold to the market to earn additional income. However, the price is solely dependent on the amount as dictated by the buyer. As revealed by farmers, the market price of lumber ranged from 12 to 14 PhP/board foot. The price of the lumber is much lower than existing prices in commercial lumber yards which are approximately 21 − 25 PhP/bf. Despite the low and unfavourable market prices for their lumber, farmers in Bontoc have earned an additional income of from Php 1184 to PhP 7173 for an 8 -year tending operation. If the farmer were to be given the chance to develop larger areas into plantation, the increase in income might be considerable.

We measured seed dispersal by the endangered neotropical timber species <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla King, Meliaceae) in the Brazilian Amazon at 25 relatively isolated trees using multiple 1 -m wide belt transects extended 100 m downwind. Tree diameter and fecundity correlated positively with increased seed shadow extent; but in combination large, high fecundity trees contributed disproportionately to longer-distance dispersal events (. 60 m). Among three empirical models fitted to seed density vs. distance in one dimension, the Student-t (2 Dt) generally fit best (compared to the negative exponential and inverse power). When seedfall downwind was modelled in two dimensions using a normalised sample, it peaked furthest downwind (c. 25 m) for large, high-fecundity trees; with the inverse Gaussian and Weibull functions providing comparable fits that were slightly better than the lognormal. Although most seeds fell within 30 m of parent trees, relatively few juveniles were found within this distance, resulting in juvenile-to-seed ratios peaking at c. 35 – 45 m.

This study was conducted within a larger experiment consisting of mahogany monocultures and species polycultures of four species and -within each of these two plot types- mahogany was represented by either one or four maternal families. We selected 24 plots spanning these treatment combinations, 10 mahogany plants/plot, and within each plot experimentally reduced ant abundance on half of the selected plants, and surveyed ant and herbivore abundance. There were positive effects of SD on generalist leaf-chewers and sap-feeders, but for the latter group this effect depended on the ant reduction treatment: SD positively influenced sap-feeders under ambient ant abundance but had no effect when ant abundance was reduced; at the same time, ants had negative effects on sap feeders in monoculture but no effect in polyculture. In contrast, SD did not influence specialist stem-borers or leaf-miners and this effect was not contingent upon ant reduction. Finally, GD did not influence any of the herbivore guilds studied, and such effects did {{not depend on the}} ant treatment. Overall, we show that tree species diversity influenced interactions between a focal plant species (mahogany) and ants, and that such effects in turn mediated plant diversity effects on some (sap-feeders) but not all the herbivores guilds studied.

These teleodynamic consequences reveal the problems in institutional fit, i. e. how the institutional arrangements, particular customary circumstances and habitual actors fit together. We abduct three types of emerging order springing from the reactions to national biodiversity policies: (i) the practice of faking the institutional fit, (ii) the practice of disobedience; and, (iii) willingness {{to take part in the}} making of new institutional arrangements. These vary according to the purpose, working rules (set of rights) and motivation.

40|$|<b>Big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla King) is an {{important}} species for timber production that is considered the most valuable in the world. For this reason its exploitation is indiscriminate and leads this species {{to the risk of}} extinction. Moreover, mahogany is difficult to regenerate naturally and, when used in reforestation programs, plants are severely damaged by the shoot-borer (Hypsipyla grandella Zellar). This work aimed at developing the multiplication stage of micropropagation of Swietenia macrophylla King using juvenile material. After desinfestation, seeds were germinated in MS solid culture medium. Shoot formation from seeds occurred during five months, giving 5. 54 nodal segments per seed. These explants were excised, each containing one axillary bud, and transferred on multiplication media. Four experiments with cytokinins were conducted, using media supplemented with 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) (2. 5 to 50. 0 &# 956;M), 2 - isopentenyladenine (2 -iP) (0; 1. 1 to 8. 8 &# 956;M), combinations of BAP (0; 2. 5 to 50. 0 &# 956;M) and 2 -iP (2. 2 &# 956;M). For the first treatments the basal culture medium was MS medium and in the last one MS and QL media were used in separate experiments.

Spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) identified a single Central American phylogroup and four Amazonian phylogroups, indicating stronger phylogeographic structure within Amazonia. The results demonstrate distinctive regional patterns of S. macrophylla differentiation, and the first evidence of a strong phylogeographic break between Central American and South American mahogany populations.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is using SPOT 5 multi-spectral {{satellite}} images and a land-use map to estimate the distribution of <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macropnylla) in Hsin-Hua Experimental Forest Station. Mahogany has a specific mechanism, which was completely deciduous and germinates during a short period around March or April each year. This mechanism made the spectral variance. We collected two periods SPOT 5 images and obtained status and change of Mahogany with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and image differencing algorithm. The training areas were chosen based on land-use map to set the ranges of threshold. We compared the classification results with ground truth (temporal and permanent sample plots) to determine the accuracy assessment. The results showed that it was not suitable to estimate the Mahogany area with SPOT images only (the overall accuracy was 63. 58 % and Kappa coefficient was 0. 28). After we removed the non-vegetation and no mahogany areas accorded to the landuse map, the overall accuracy increased to 85. 87 % and the Kappa coefficient became 0. 71. The reason might be the change of environmental factors and other physiological characteristics made the spectral variance either. The results also showed that the stand neighbor could reduce the overall accuracy, and the method was could not be used in the lower density stand. If we could realize the periods between leave falling and sprouting clearly, the method helps us to estimate the areas of mahogany in pure and mixed forest in very short time. 本研究主要目的為利用SPOT 5 多光譜衛星影像與土地利用型圖，推估新化林場大葉桃花心木（簡稱大桃）面積。每年 3 月底至 4 月初，大桃有在極短時間內完全落葉，並在 1 至 2 星期內快速發芽的植物生理特徵，此物候現象造成影像光譜產生明顯變異，故研究計算兩期SPOT 5 衛星影像的常態化植生指標（normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI）值與進行影像差異演算法，得到現況與變遷資料，以 2009 年的土地利用型為依據設定大桃門檻值，推估大桃分布與面積。為確認分類結果適合性，研究以永久樣區（ 36 個）與臨時樣區（ 148 個）做地真，計算整體分類準確度與Kappa統計值。結果顯示，單以多時期SPOT 5 影像計算大桃面積，會有高估情形產生，整體分類準確度約 63. 58 %（Kappa值 0. 28 ），可能係外在環境或其他植物生理特徵影響光譜，故研究將土地利用型圖納入分析，將非植生或無大桃區域去除後，分類準確度提升至 85. 87 %（Kappa值 0. 71 ），屬分類良好的結果。研究也發現，林分邊界產生的混淆像元，以及林分密度太低區域會降低分類結果。如果使用者可以準確掌握大桃的落葉與萌芽時間，配合此法可在短時間內，將大面積的大桃於混淆林中選取出來，減少調查所需之人力與物力...|$|E
40|$|The global {{biodiversity}} is {{in decline}} because modern societies are organized for that purpose. The design, {{implementation and enforcement}} of international, regional and national environmental policies have not helped to reverse the trend. In our paper, we analyze the hardship of protecting the gray wolf in Finland, the <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> in Peru, and the Amur tiger in Russia. Our comparative approach {{is based on the}} old institutional economics, and our key concept - the unit of analysis - is a transaction, i. e. enactment, practice and transfer of formal and informal rights to future benefits. Transactions challenge, disturb and re-organize the existing institutional scaffold. William Connolly (The Fragility of Things, 2013) and Terrence Deacon (Incomplete Nature, 2012) have recently argued that teleodynamics, the purposeful and end-directed behaviors and the reactions and disturbances in other related ententional behaviors are key to understand not only the dynamics of institutional change per se but also, and especially so, the emergent patterns of behavior resulting from resistance and adaptation. These teleodynamic consequences reveal the problems in institutional fit, i. e. how the institutional arrangements, particular customary circumstances and habitual actors fit together. We abduct three types of emerging order springing from the reactions to national biodiversity policies: (i) the practice of faking the institutional fit, (ii) the practice of disobedience; and, (iii) willingness {{to take part in the}} making of new institutional arrangements. These vary according to the purpose, working rules (set of rights) and motivation. We explain the interrelated meaning of purpose, working rules and motivation in the context of institutional fit in detail. In our cases, the fit is not exactly the one envisioned through the authoritative rules and the purpose of institutional conservation, but it is an order nevertheless, and that order is not necessarily good for endangered species. 201...|$|E
40|$|Stocks of the {{valuable}} <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla King) are declining, and trials {{for growth and}} pest resistance are needed to select material for plantations. Seeds were collected from 67 open-pollinated trees from five provenances in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and planted in three provenance/progeny trials {{in the state of}} Quintana Roo, Mexico, in order to characterize genetic variation in growth traits and for Hypsipyla resistance or recovery, and to assess the potential for genetic gain. Differentiation among provenances was found only for relative height growth rate (RHGR). The total years of apical attack by Hypsipyla grandella varied by a magnitude of 100 % among families but showed little heritability. After 4 years, mean height per family ranged from 328 to 564 cm, 160 to 381 cm, and 253 to 390 cm at each site. Although heritabilities for height were too low for cross-site selection, sufficient heritability (h 2 I¼ 0 : 26), additive genetic coefficients of variation (AGCV = 22 %), and type B genetic correlations (rb(f) = 0. 74) for RHGR across the two sites with poorer growth indicated that this trait might be used as a surrogate. This would yield an estimated gain of about 17 % for the best 15 % of trees. At the site with better growth, there was sufficient heritability (h 2 /I 0 : 31) and AGCV (20 %) for height at year 5 to obtain an estimated gain of 15 % for the best 15 % of trees. We suggest a selection strategy using the best germplasm from the best performing trial to exploit the resources on high quality sites, and the best material from the poorer sites for lower quality areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of current harvest practices for high-value Meliaceae {{can be assessed}} by quantifying logging intensity and projecting growth and survival by post-logging populations over anticipated intervals between harvests. From 100 %-area inventories of <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla) covering 204 ha or more at eight logged and unlogged forest sites across southern Brazilian Amazonia, we report generally higher landscape-scale densities and smaller population-level mean diameters in eastern forests compared to western forests, where most commercial stocks survive. Density of trees >= 20 cm diameter varied by two orders of magnitude and peaked at 1. 17 ha(- 1). Size class frequency distributions appeared unimodal at two high-density sites, but were essentially arnodal or flat elsewhere; diameter increment patterns indicate that populations were multi- or all-aged. At two high-density sites, conventional logging removed 93 - 95 % of commercial trees (>= 45 cm diameter {{at the time of}} logging), illegally eliminated 31 - 47 % of sub-merchantable trees, and targeted trees as small as 20 cm diameter. Projected recovery by commercial stems during 30 years after conventional logging represented 9. 9 - 37. 5 % of initial densities and was highly dependent on initial logging intensity and size class frequency distributions of commercial trees. We simulated post-logging recovery over the same period at all sites according to the 2003 regulatory framework for mahogany in Brazil, which raised the minimum diameter cutting limit to 60 cm and requires retention during the first harvest of 20 % of commercial-sized trees. Recovery during 30 years ranged from approximately 0 to 31 % over 20 % retention densities at seven of eight sites. At only one site where sub-merchantable trees dominated the population did the simulated density of harvestable stems after 30 years exceed initial commercial densities. These results indicate that 80 % harvest intensity will not be sustainable over multiple cutting cycles for most populations without silvicultural interventions ensuring establishment and long-term growth of artificial regeneration to augment depleted natural stocks, including repeated tending of outplanted seedlings. Without improved harvest protocols for mahogany in Brazil as explored in this paper, future commercial supplies of this species as well as other high-value tropical timbers are endangered. Rapid changes in the timber industry and land-use in the Amazon are also significant challenges to sustainable management of mahogany. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by diverse assemblages {{of plant and animal}} species compared to temperate forests. Corollary to this general rule is that most tree species, whether valued for timber or not, occur at low densities (< 1 adult tree ha(- 1)) or may be locally rare. In the Brazilian Amazon, many of the most highly valued timber species occur at extremely low densities yet are intensively harvested with little regard for impacts on population structures and dynamics. These include <b>big-leaf</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla), ipe (Tabebuia serratifolia and Tabebuia impetiginosa), jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril), and freijo cinza (Cordia goeldiana). Brazilian forest regulations prohibit harvests of species that meet the legal definition of rare - fewer than three trees per 100 ha - but treat all species populations exceeding this density threshold equally. In this paper we simulate logging impacts on a group of timber species occurring at low densities that are widely distributed across eastern and southern Amazonia, based on field data collected at four research sites since 1997, asking: under current Brazilian forest legislation, what are the prospects for second harvests on 30 -year cutting cycles given observed population structures, growth, and mortality rates? Ecologically `rare` species constitute majorities in commercial species assemblages in {{all but one of the}} seven large-scale inventories we analyzed from sites spanning the Amazon (range 49 - 100 % of total commercial species). Although densities of only six of 37 study species populations met the Brazilian legal definition of a rare species, timber stocks of five of the six timber species declined substantially at all sites between first and second harvests in simulations based on legally allowable harvest intensities. Reducing species-level harvest intensity by increasing minimum felling diameters or increasing seed tree retention levels improved prospects for second harvests of those populations with a relatively high proportion of submerchantable stems, but did not dramatically improve projections for populations with relatively flat diameter distributions. We argue that restrictions on logging very low-density timber tree populations, such as the current Brazilian standard, provide inadequate minimum protection for vulnerable species. Population declines, even if reduced-impact logging (RIL) is eventually adopted uniformly, can be anticipated for a large pool of high-value timber species unless harvest intensities are adapted to timber species population ecology, and silvicultural treatments are adopted to remedy poor natural stocking in logged stands.
