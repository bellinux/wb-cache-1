50|$|The ANFD {{class of}} filter dryer {{consists}} of a main insulated jacketed vessel and filtration base which can be lowered for inspection and replacement of the filter media. The vessel base is secured to the main vessel body via manually operated c-clamps or an automated <b>bayonet</b> <b>locking</b> system. The vessel is sealed with an O-ring sealing system utilizing FDA approved materials such as perfluoroelastomer.|$|E
50|$|While most {{focus in}} the bearing is on the load {{carrying}} components, locking is equally as important since these components must be held securely on the roll neck. HB (hydraulic <b>bayonet)</b> <b>locking</b> was introduced in 1980 provides safe and repeatable performance. Later locking concepts such as the RM (removable mount) and CB (compact bayonet) have been more recently introduced, but they all share hydraulic mount and dismount functions.|$|E
50|$|Some {{connector}} housings {{are designed with}} locking mechanisms to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. Locking mechanism designs include locking levers of various sorts, screw locking, and toggle or <b>bayonet</b> <b>locking.</b> Depending on application requirements, housings with locking mechanisms may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure {{the integrity of the}} electrical connection and housing seals.|$|E
5000|$|In Leica M series {{cameras that}} have seen little use (i.e. those in {{pristine}} condition), the spring securing the lensmount <b>bayonet</b> <b>lock</b> may be weak or have its motion impaired. This {{can create the}} risk of a lens disengaging and dropping from the camera body while focusing.|$|R
5000|$|ST {{connectors}} {{have a key}} {{which prevents}} rotation of the ceramic ferrule, and a <b>bayonet</b> <b>lock</b> similar to a BNC shell. The single index tab must be properly aligned with a slot on the mating receptacle before insertion; then the bayonet interlock can be engaged, by pushing and twisting, locking {{at the end of}} travel which maintains spring-loaded engagement force on the core optical junction.|$|R
40|$|WO 200141980 A UPAB: 20010719 NOVELTY - The {{drive unit}} has a first {{cogwheel}} (8) and second cogwheel (4) rotatably mounted in a housing (2, 3) and coupled together, {{with the second}} cogwheel having connecting elements such as <b>bayonet</b> <b>locks</b> for detachably fixing the rotary knife (1). The first cogwheel rotates about a first axis parallel to a second axis about which the second cogwheel rotates. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The first cogwheel can be coupled to the second by a toothed belt (6). USE - for meat slicers etc ADVANTAGE - the drive mechanism is encapsulated for better hygienic cutting conditions...|$|R
50|$|There is no {{fundamental}} {{reason why}} a video connector with similar properties to MUSA but with 75 Ω impedance could not be devised, however this has not happened, which may suggest that market demand for such a connector is low. Often, 75 Ω BNC connectors are used, however these are not freely pluggable like MUSA connectors, due to the <b>bayonet</b> <b>locking</b> action, except for specially engineered patch panels which omit the bayonet function, just relying upon the friction of the connector's mating surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Screw-locking {{versions}} of this connector have also been used in instrumentation, process control and professional audio. In North America this variant is often called a [...] "small Tuchel" [...] connector {{after one of the}} major manufacturers. Tuchel is now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a <b>bayonet</b> <b>locking</b> ring was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines and lighting dimmers and controls through the from the 1960's to the 1980's, an example of this is the microphone input connector and some others on the [...] "Report" [...] family of UHER (brand) tape recorders. The <b>bayonet</b> <b>locking</b> version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bleecon", an example of its use is the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and control desks. A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable mounted socket was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard DIN plugs.|$|E
50|$|In 1962 MZ had {{introduced}} the ES 150 motorcycle, and the scooter {{version of its}} 143 cc engine supplied for the Troll 1 had its power increased to 9.5 bhp. The rear chain runs in an oilbath in a patent MZ hard-rubber enclosure, which keeps oil in and dirt out and greatly prolongs chain life. IWL revised the bodywork, giving a tail unit {{like that of the}} Heinkel Tourist model A2 and quickly detachable side panels like a Dürkopp Diana. Each side panel is secured by a central <b>bayonet</b> <b>lock</b> and is simple to undo and light to remove, easing access to the engine, gearbox and rear chain.|$|R
5000|$|... "While this {{extraordinary}} scene was transacting, the members, hardly believing their own ears and eyes, sat in mute amazement, horror, and pity of the maniac traitor who was storming and raving before them. At length Vane rose to remonstrate, {{and call him}} to his senses; but Cromwell, instead of listening to him, drowned his voice, repeating with great vehemence, and as though with the desperate excitement of the moment, [...] "Sir Harry Vane! Sir Harry Vane! Good Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!" [...] He then seized the records, snatched the bill {{from the hands of}} the clerk, drove the members out at the point of the <b>bayonet,</b> <b>locked</b> the doors, put the key in his pocket, and returned to Whitehall.|$|R
50|$|The {{connector}} {{was named}} the BNC (for Bayonet Neill-Concelman) after its <b>bayonet</b> mount <b>locking</b> mechanism and its inventors, Paul Neill and Carl Concelman. Neill worked at Bell Labs and also invented the N connector; Concelman worked at Amphenol and also invented the C connector. A backronym has been mistakenly applied to it: British Naval Connector. Another common incorrectly attributed origin is Berkeley Nucleonics Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|After the French Revolutionary Wars, first consul Napoleon Bonaparte {{commissioned}} a rework; some minor modifications on the <b>lock,</b> <b>bayonet</b> and stock resulted in 1800 in the [...] "corrected" [...] model, also called [...] "Modèle 1777 corrigé".|$|R
40|$|Matched pair of washers {{with broad}} surface ramps is <b>locking</b> {{mechanism}} in <b>bayonet</b> plug. It {{can be used}} where threaded springs and fasteners are impractical because of extreme temperatures or other environmental incompatibility. Matched pair of ramped washers is placed on plug and bayonet inserted. Inner slot of one washer matches contour of plug; this washer is stationary. Inner slot of second washer is circular. When second washer is rotated, washers push against <b>bayonet</b> plug, <b>locking</b> it in place. Retaining wire secures plug...|$|R
60|$|Terrible was {{the sight}} indeed. In many places the dead lay thickly piled on the ground, {{and the manner}} in which Englishmen, Russians, and Frenchmen lay mixed {{together}} showed how the tide of battle had ebbed and flowed, and how each patch of ground had been taken and retaken again and again. Here Russians and grenadiers lay stretched side by side, sometimes with their <b>bayonets</b> still <b>locked</b> in each other's bodies. Here, where the shot and shell swept most fiercely, lay the dead, whose very nationality was scarcely distinguishable, so torn and mutilated were they.|$|R
60|$|Little Rogers {{had engaged}} an enemy who towered over him. They feinted, swung, and cracked their guns together, then <b>locked</b> <b>bayonets.</b> Another German striding from behind stabbed Rogers in the back. He writhed off the bloody bayonet, falling toward Dorn, showing a white face that changed as he fell, with quiver {{of torture and}} dying eyes.|$|R
50|$|Arri {{standard}} is a lens mount developed by Arri {{for use with}} both 16 mm and 35 mm movie cameras. Lenses are distinguished by a tab inside an outer ring. Because of the weak seating strength and ability of the aluminum mount to gradually become poorly seated, the stainless steel Arri bayonet mount superseded the Arri standard mount in 1965, debuting on the 16BL. However, cameras with the bayonet mount are also able to accommodate Arri standard lenses due to both mounts having the same flange focal distance and diameter. Unfortunately, cameras with Arri standard mounts are unable to fit lenses with Arri bayonet mounts, due to the <b>bayonet</b> mount's <b>locking</b> mechanism.|$|R
500|$|Lafayette, in the meantime, {{was expecting}} the {{imminent}} arrival of long-delayed reinforcements. [...] Several battalions of Pennsylvania Continentals under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne {{had also been}} authorized by Congress for service in Virginia in February. [...] However, Wayne {{had to deal with}} the aftereffects of a mutiny in January that nearly wiped out the Pennsylvania Line as a fighting force, and it was May before he had rebuilt the line and begun the march to Virginia. [...] Even then, there was a great deal of mistrust between Wayne and his men; Wayne had to keep his ammunition and <b>bayonets</b> under <b>lock</b> and key except when they were needed. Although Wayne was ready to march on May 19, the force's departure was delayed by a day because of a renewed threat of mutiny after the units were paid with devalued Continental dollars. [...] Lafayette and Wayne's 800 men joined forces at Raccoon Ford on the Rappahannock River on June 10. [...] A few days later, Lafayette was further reinforced by 1,000 militia under the command of William Campbell.|$|R
5000|$|The first Petri SLR was the [...] "Penta" [...] (1959). After {{the first}} model, the {{original}} product line cameras were named Penta for the domestic Japanese market and PetriFlex for export. The original Penta {{came with a}} 'universal' M42 screw type mount, while most subsequent models in the Penta, Flex and FT lines used the proprietary Petri breech <b>lock</b> <b>bayonet.</b> Adapters were manufactured to allow interchangeability, albeit with some loss of function. A very limited range of lenses was produced. They returned to the M42 mount in 1974 with the Petri FTX body, continuing to use it on low cost bodies such as the FT1000/500 and the compact MFT1000 and Micro MF-1 bodies.|$|R
40|$|Vid tillverkning av den kulglass som säljs i glassbarer och på restauranger används en hårdglassmaskin. Glassmaskinen kyler och blandar glassmassan till rätt temperatur och konsistens innan glassen kan serveras. Oceanpower är ett kinesiskt företag som bland annat utvecklar och tillverkar glassmaskiner. Ett nytt konstruktionsförslag har tagits fram för dörren som försluter kylcylindern på deras hårdglassmaskin OPH 42. Genom studiebesök och egna {{analyser}} har förbättringsmöjligheter kunnat lokaliseras hos den befintliga förslutningsdörren. Dessa har främst varit kopplade till hygienen och den dagliga rengörningen av maskinen. En mängd olika koncept för en ny konstruktion av dörren togs fram och utvärderades mot en kravspecifikation. Konceptet som valdes som det mest passande byggde på att ett munstycke monteras på förslutningsdörren med hjälp av en bajonettlåsning vilket kan lossas varje gång glassmaskinen skall rengöras. Således kan det gallerförsedda munstycket diskas för hand eller i maskin istället för att gallret rengörs på plats på maskinen. Förslutningsdörren som tidigare var fäst på maskinfronten med en fast led på ena sidan konstruerades om så att rotationsleden kunde glida i ett spår. Detta gör att dörren kan tryckas på plats rakt framifrån och på så sätt minska belastningen på den gummipackning som tätar förslutningsdörren. Dörren spänns åt med två handtag på var sida för att sprida trycket på packningen. When the gelato sold in {{ice cream}} {{bars and restaurants}} is manufactured, an ice cream machine is used. The ice cream machine cools and mixes the ice cream to the right temperature and consistency {{before it can be}} served. Oceanpower is a Chinese company that, among other things, develops and manufactures ice cream machines. A new design proposal to the door that seals the cooling cylinder on their ice cream machine OPH 42 has been developed. Through interviews, visits and analysis of the ice cream machine has opportunities for improvement been localized in the existing sealing door. These have mainly been linked to hygiene and the daily cleaning of the machine. A variety of concepts for a new design of the door was developed and evaluated against a set of requirements. The concept that was chosen as the most fitting was based on a nozzle mounted on the sealing door with a <b>bayonet</b> <b>lock</b> which can be released each time the ice cream machine should be cleaned. Accordingly, the nozzle can be washed by hand or machine instead of that the grill must be cleaned in place on the machine. The sealing door which was previously attached to the machine front with a fixed point on one side was reconstructed so that the rotation point could slip in a groove. This means that the door can be pushed into place from the front, thus reducing the load on the rubber gasket that seals the door. The door is clamped by two handles on each side to spread the pressure on the gasket...|$|R
