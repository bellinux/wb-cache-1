500|$|The {{placement}} {{of a character}} of indigenous peoples descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media. Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was [...] "erhaps the most well-known". Of Chakotay's origin, he said, [...] "They never actually say what nation he is, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> it's some Central American tribe." [...] Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the Twilight film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction. Chakotay was also described as [...] "the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting" [...] in the 2005 book, [...] "Indian" [...] Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction: First Nations' Voices Speak Out, but was {{also referred to as}} the [...] "quintessential Tonto in outer space". A similar criticism was highlighted of the character in Medicine Bags and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War (2008), which called Chakotay [...] "a creature of white fantasies" [...] and suggested that he was [...] "far more stereotypical than Tonto" [...] as [...] "at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in awhile".|$|E

I feel it particularly when I'm out in nature. It's just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is. I feel it. And it's enough for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said [...] "it doesn't {{look as if}} justice ... is done," [...] {{concerning}} the killing of an unarmed man. He elaborated, [...] "I don't know full details any {{more than anyone else}} does. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that in such circumstances when we are faced with someone who was manifestly a war criminal, in terms of the atrocities inflicted, it is important that justice is seen to be observed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{subsequent}} {{interviews with}} Brian Williams on October 29, 2008, Palin {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "I {{am not going to}} label myself anything, Brian, and I think that's what annoys a lot of Americans, especially in a political campaign is start trying to label different parts of America, different backgrounds. I'm not going to label myself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in women's rights; I believe in equal rights, and I am so thankful I was brought up in where really gender has never been an issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the January 2, 2007, {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson said that God {{spoke to him}} and told him that [...] "mass killings" [...] were to come during 2007, due to a terrorist attack on the United States. He added, [...] "The Lord didn't say nuclear. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> it will be something like that." [...] When a terrorist attack failed to happen in 2007, Robertson said, in January 2008, [...] "All I can think is that somehow the people of God prayed and God in his mercy spared us." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the unified}} formula that {{controls}} and organizes {{the forces that}} make the city what it is, what it was, and what it will become ... In this compact schema that concentrates prescriptions of scale, density, and serviceability all in one, the play {{between public and private}} interests is in the inevitable balance that transcends speculation without restricting liberty. [...] It is the mechanism that has allowed mediocrity to coexist with greatness in a cohesive whole. ... Manhattan ... doesn't need architecture to be validated; it is the consequence of a free game in which the rules are clear and effective to produce it. ...

2500|$|Sanders is a {{self-described}} democratic socialist, and progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy {{and is a}} proponent of workplace democracy. In November 2015, Sanders gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including {{its place in the}} policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: [...] "I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad." [...] Based on Sanders's positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as [...] "a New Dealer".|$|E
