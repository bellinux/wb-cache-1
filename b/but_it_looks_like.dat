500|$|We {{want to stay}} in New York, New York {{has been}} {{incredibly}} good to us. It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show... Our New York crew is spectacular, they've worked their [...] off to make the show look great. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, President Bush {{dismissed}} Arafat as {{a negotiating}} partner, {{saying he had}} [...] "failed as a leader" [...] and accused him of undercutting Abbas when he was prime minister (Abbas resigned the same year {{he was given the}} position). Arafat had a mixed relationship with the leaders of other Arab nations. His support from Arab leaders tended to increase whenever he was pressured by Israel; for example, when Israel declared in 2003 it had made the decision, in principle, to remove him from the Israeli-controlled West Bank. In an interview with the Arabic news network Al Jazeera, Arafat responded to Ariel Sharon's suggestion that he be exiled from the Palestinian territories permanently, by stating, [...] "Is it his [...] homeland or ours? We were planted here before the Prophet Abraham came, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> they [...] don't understand history or geography." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{structure}} in subdomain 2 {{that is called}} the “D-loop” because it binds with DNase I, it is located between the His40 and Gly48 residues. It has {{the appearance of a}} disorderly element in the majority of crystals, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a β-sheet when it is complexed with DNase I. Domínguez “et al.” suggest that the key event in polymerization is probably the propagation of a conformational change from the centre of the bond with the nucleotide to this domain, which changes from a loop to a spiral. [...] However, this hypothesis has been refuted by other studies.|$|E
50|$|Swarm {{recently}} {{appeared and}} fought Spider-Man in Marvel Adventures #38. He/they supposedly {{wanted to take}} over the world (or at least kill a few jocks), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> he/they just wanted some ice cream.|$|R
6000|$|Sammy nodded. [...] "I've seen Farmer Brown dig {{one over}} on the Green Meadows, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{a great deal of}} work. I didn't suppose that anyone else could do it. Do you really mean that you can dig a canal, Paddy?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{once heard}} a gouty {{northern}} invalid {{say that a}} cocoanut tree might be poetical, possibly <b>it</b> was; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a feather-duster struck by lightning. I think that describes it better than a picture--and yet, without any question, there is something fascinating about a cocoa-nut tree--and graceful, too.|$|R
2500|$|Gabriel grossed {{approximately}} [...] in its Australian opening week, ranking fifth at the Australian box office. Gabriel's opening week gross {{represented the}} second highest of an Australian-made film released in 2007, behind Rogue which opened the previous week with approximately A$667 000. In its opening weekend, Gabriel opened on 98 screens and averaged $4,797 per screen, the third highest per screen average of the top 20 grossing films for the weekend. The Age journalist Jim Schembri described Gabriel's opening week as [...] "impressive," [...] writing that [...] "The gloom-laden film may not be for all tastes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> it's hitting the right spots with its intended audience of goths, emos {{and people who have}} trouble sleeping at night." [...] In its five weeks playing in theaters, Gabriel grossed $1,462,320. Gabriels earnings ranked it at 110th among all the 295 films released in Australia in 2007.|$|E
60|$|MR. ROBERTS (astutely). There's a bonnet {{hanging from}} the hook at the top. I'm not sure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> my wife's bonnet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father thinks {{something}} of doing that, Dave, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> rather a hopeless case," [...] returned Phil Lawrence. He {{arose from the}} camp-chair on {{which he had been}} sitting, and stretched himself. [...] "But come on, fellows," [...] he continued. [...] "There is no use of your worrying over our troubles. We came on this little trip to enjoy ourselves, and I want all of you to have the best time possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Fanny," [...] he said. [...] "Again, {{many thanks}} for your care and your watchfulness--especially the latter. I am very glad," [...] he said, with what he meant for the sweetest smile, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a grin, [...] "that it has been rewarded {{in such a way}} as you hardly perhaps expected." ...|$|R
60|$|Something fell {{past him}} out of the vast darknesses above and {{vanished}} into the tumults below, going obliquely downward. It was a German drachenflieger. The thing was going so fast he had but an instant apprehension of the dark figure of the aeronaut crouched together clutching at his wheel. It might be a manoeuvre, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a catastrophe.|$|R
50|$|A disappointing 1m 38.320 for David Coulthard in the Red Bull, the Scot was {{complaining}} of poor balance. Jacques Villeneuve {{was the first}} man to put on the dry tyre <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> he'd got <b>it</b> wrong as he spun wildly on his out lap. He brought his Sauber home for 3rd place before Giancarlo Fisichella put in a 1m 33.171 to take fastest time before the rain.|$|R
6000|$|... "The surgeon has {{him in his}} hands. We {{will send}} another from Portsmouth, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a bad case. He made his {{confession}} bravely, though evidently in terrible suffering, seeming to keep up by force of will till he had totally exonerated Archfield and signed the deposition, and then he fainted, so that I thought him dead, but I fear he has more to go through. Can {{you come to the}} hall, or shall I bring Lord Cutts to you? We must hasten in starting that we may bring the news to Winchester to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|And, first, {{there is}} evidently {{capability}} of separating color and form, and considering either separately. Form we find abstractedly {{considered by the}} sculptor, how far {{it would be possible}} to advantage a statue by the addition of color, I venture not to affirm; the question is too extensive to be here discussed. High authorities and ancient practice, are in favor of color; so the sculpture of the middle ages: the two statues of Mino da Fiesole in the church of St^a. Caterina at Pisa have been colored, the irises of the eyes painted dark, and the hair gilded, as also I think the Madonna in St^a. Maria della Spina; the eyes have been painted in the sculptures of Orcagna in Or San Michele, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a remnant of barbarism, (compare the pulpit of Guida da Como, in the church of San Bartolomeo at Pistoja,) and I have never seen color on any solid forms, that did not, to my mind, neutralize all other power; the porcelains of Luca della Robbia are painful examples, and in lower art, Florentine mosaic in relief; gilding is more admissible, and tells sometimes sweetly upon figures of quaint design, as on the pulpit of St^a. Maria Novella, while it spoils the classical ornaments of the mouldings. But the truest grandeur of sculpture I believe to be in the white form; something of this feeling may be owing to the difficulty, or rather the immediately, of obtaining truly noble color upon it, but if we could color the Elgin marbles with the flesh tint of Giorgione, I had rather not have it done.|$|E

5000|$|On August 5, 2007, the filly won the Grade II Clement L. Hirsch Handicap on Del Mar Racetrack's new Polytrack. Nashoba's Key was bumped at {{the start}} of the race and was then boxed in on the stretch, but she escaped and outkicked Balance for another win. Owner-breeder Warren B. Williamson commented on the race, [...] "I don't know if you'd call <b>it</b> a conspiracy, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> They tried {{everything}} to beat her and it didn't work. She was gone." ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{there is}} also the fate of Colonel Konopka, who - against {{explicit}} orders - placed the regiment's banners in the wagons of the train. He risked a lot, even the loss of his position, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> nothing happened: his travel to France (surely connected with the investigation into the case) took a long time, but without any visible consequences. After the Battle of Albuera - he was supposedly nominated a French General and Baron, and disappeared from the Vistula Lancers forever.|$|R
60|$|This {{figure was}} too far off to be {{identified}} with absolute certainty, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> and might well be, Francois Sarzeau. Whoever he was, the man was evidently uncertain which way he should proceed. When he moved forward, it was first to advance several paces toward the Merchant's Table; then he went back again toward the distant cottages and the church. Twice he hesitated thus; the second time pausing long before he appeared finally to take the way that led to the village.|$|R
50|$|It's {{the city}} where the Earthly ones live. Its name is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> European metropolis.|$|E
50|$|The Latin letter P {{represents}} the same sound as the Greek letter Pi, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the Greek letter Rho.|$|E
50|$|The album {{has spawned}} 3 singles; Doppelgänger (I Love You), which spawned a music video, Im Yours To Lose, and It Sounds Like Love (<b>But</b> <b>It</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>Like</b> Sex).|$|E
50|$|Raymond is {{murdered by}} Councilor Frank Paton <b>but</b> makes <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> suicide, then DI Donald is soon on his case, leading him to arrest Frank. DCI Rachel Grant returns to Shieldinch.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Republican Party {{activists in}} Northern Virginia tried to recruit McCain {{to run for}} the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 8th congressional {{district}} against the incumbent Democrat Jim Moran. [...] They believed McCain's personal characteristics, combined with his brother's name and appeal to moderate voters, would allow an effective challenge. [...] McCain declined to run, however, due to the growing Democratic tilt of the district, saying, [...] "I don't mind running uphill for anything. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to be a}} vertical wall." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rachel had to {{deal with}} Carl's change of character. She wanted to trust her husband, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> he was {{reverting}} to his old ways. However, Rachel had to mourn one more dead husband when Carl was shot by Scott Guthrie and [...] "burned alive" [...] in the hospital's ICU unit. From then on, Rachel concentrated on restoring Cory Publishing to its former glory. Carl turned out to be alive and suffering from a brain tumor. He had an operation to have it removed and they reunited.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{released}} the It Sounds Like Love (<b>But</b> <b>It</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>Like</b> Sex) EP, in October 2009. It contains remixes of tracks from Sinners International {{and of their}} Depeche Mode cover [...] "Photographic".|$|E
50|$|Lawson and Schwantz leave Rainey {{behind as}} {{they start to}} {{encounter}} back-marker traffic. Lawson need only finish just behind Rainey in the remaining two races, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he wants the win today, staying fast enough to keep Schwantz behind him for a little, until Schwantz overtakes again.|$|E

2500|$|... "The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like {{a city in}} {{a rather}} gloomy Victorian novel... We had now arrived {{in the heart of}} the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone {{emphasised}} that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once..." [...] – J.B. Priestley, English Journey, 1934 ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1980, {{the house}} had gone through 27 owners. It was {{restored}} in the early 1980s, though the original stained glass {{in the front door}} transom was removed for use in a restaurant near Disneyland. After touring the house in 1980, Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith called it [...] "tall and lacy, with a plush, ornate and comfortably cluttered interior in Victorian style." [...] Commenting on the removal of the stained glass to an Orange County restaurant, Smith noted: [...] "There was new glass in its place, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> that wooden leg must have looked on Sara Bernhardt." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{and by the}} {{mosquitoes}} that had followed Thirlwell got more numerous and when, {{in spite of the}} smoke, they settled upon his face and neck he reeled up his line ready to start. As he did so he thought he saw something move where the forest ran down to the river. The object was indistinct, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a man walking cautiously upon a ledge between the pools, and Thirlwell wondered what the fellow was doing there. The big gray trout had stopped rising, there were no Indians about, and the miners had not left the camp.|$|R
50|$|At {{the foot}} of the east hill of Mt. Enai (恩愛山) and the west of Shaoziao (小紫澳), the {{straight}} up huge stone is named Mountain Facing Guanyin (朝山觀音). From at sea, the stone looks like a cross-legged Guanyin, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a standing Guanyin facing the mountain, when seen from the mountains.|$|E
5000|$|If Player A {{follows the}} game theory payoff matrix {{to achieve the}} optimal payoff, {{he or she will}} have a lower payoff than with the [...] "deterrence" [...] strategy. This creates an {{apparent}} game theory paradox: game theory states that induction strategy should be optimal, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> [...] "deterrence strategy" [...] is optimal instead.|$|E
5000|$|Social outcast Jenna Hamilton has an accident, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> {{she tried}} to commit suicide after getting a [...] "carefrontation" [...] letter. She begins a blog that helps her deal with {{different}} high school issues such as boy troubles, peer-pressure, and trying to fit in. By making changes and embracing her misfortune, she becomes well-known to her peers.|$|E
6000|$|... "He acted pretty startled {{when we put}} it up to him," [...] {{returned}} Songbird. He {{heaved a}} deep sigh. [...] "Well, maybe some day this matter will be cleared up, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> doesn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Master Trench, I do not; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> marvellously <b>like</b> a deer of some sort," [...] said Paul, as he hastily fitted {{an arrow}} to his bow. But {{before he could}} {{discharge}} it the animal wisely retired into the shelter of its native wilds.|$|R
