5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling {{that she would not}} be able to integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, Baroness Symons, {{a junior}} {{minister}} in the MoD, told the House of Lords that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the evacuation point in Freetown to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of Freetown {{in an attempt to}} reassure residents. HMS Illustrious, with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from Illustrious began flying reassurance patrols over Freetown and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, should it be necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and Freetown might not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President Ahmad Kabbah formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled Civil Defence Force and the West Side Boys) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by Harriers and a Nimrod R1.|$|E

When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Walsh was {{responsible}} for creating True Detective artwork. His work for the show consists of over 100 individual [...] "devil's nests"—twig sculptures created by the killer—along with wall paintings and miniature sculptures of men made of beer cans, among others. According to DiGerlando, Walsh's interests in hunting and taxidermy made him [...] "the perfect dude for the job". A blueprint for the devil's nests was not well established in the script, other than specifications that the structures <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> {{on their own and}} feature a spiral motif. DiGerlando and Walsh went with a tripod design that showed a spiral when viewed from the base, and contained ladder-like crossing elements that symbolized the killer's desire to ascend to a dark spiritual plane. Each design had subtle differences from one another. DiGerlando cited the work of Henry Darger and James Charles Castle as strong stylistic influences and sought a primitive look for the sculptures, one that revealed the workings of a man with [...] "some deep inner urge to express himself". To reflect this, Walsh built devil's nests using mud, secondhand children's clothing, reeds, roots, and other materials he felt the killer would use.|$|E

He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day {{progresses}} Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by [...] "Avian Bone Syndrome," [...] a result {{of which is that}} her purportedly brittle bones would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz is on to her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz, who is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known written {{version of}} the Laws of Cricket, dating from 1744, does not include an lbw rule. At the time, batsmen in English cricket used curved bats, which made it unlikely that they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> {{directly in front of}} the wickets. However, a clause in the 1744 laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batsman was [...] "standing unfair to strike". Cricket bats were modified to become straighter over the following years, allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets. Subsequently, some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets. Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. However, critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen. The 1788 {{version of the}} laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman's intent; now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that [...] "pitch straight". Further clarification of the law came in 1823, when a condition was added that [...] "the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket". The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket, endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps.|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
