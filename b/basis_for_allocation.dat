40|$|Nonuniform {{memory access}} time (referred to as NUMA) is an {{important}} feature {{in the design of}} large scale shared memory multiprocessors. However, one implication of the NUMA architecture is that locality of the data is crucial to performance. In the absence of any system support, the programmer is forced to explicitly manage these locality issues, significantly increasing the development time for parallel applications. We have enhanced the Uniform System programming environment of BBN to allow a programmer to easily separate data structures based on expected reference patterns instead of requiring an understanding of the NUMA memory architecture as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>allocation</b> decisions.

40|$|Background Allocating {{national}} resources to regions based on {{need is a}} key policy issue in most health systems. Many systems utilise proxy measures of need as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>allocation</b> formulae. Increasingly these are underpinned by complex statistical methods to separate need from supplier induced utilisation. Assessment of need is then used to allocate existing global budgets to geographic areas. Many low and middle income countries beginning to use formula methods for funding however these attempts are often hampered {{by a lack of}} information on utilisation, relative needs and whether the budgets allocated bear any relationship to cost. An alternative is to develop bottom-up estimates of the cost of providing for local need. This method is viable where public funding is focused on {{a relatively small number of}} targeted services. We describe a bottom-up approach to developing a formula for the allocation of resources. The method is illustrated in the context of the state minimum package mandated to be provided by the Indonesian public health system. Method...|$|E
40|$|Before the {{spacecraft}} returned to Earth in September, the Genesis mission had a preliminary assessment {{plan in place}} for the purpose of providing information on the condition and availability of collector materials to the science community as a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>allocation</b> requests. One important component of that plan was the evaluation of collector surfaces for molecular contamination. Sources of molecular contamination might be the on-orbit outgassing of spacecraft and science canister components, the condensation of thruster by-products during spacecraft maneuvers, or the condensation of volatile species associated with reentry. Although the non-nominal return of the Genesis spacecraft introduced particulate contamination to the collectors, such as dust and heatshield carbon-carbon, it is unlikely to have caused any molecular deposition. The contingency team's quick action in returning the damaged payload the UTTR cleanroom by 6 PM the evening of recovery help to ensure that exposure to weather conditions and the environment were kept to a minimum...|$|E

Two issues were considered in the present study: one, the relationship between understanding of the concept of proportionality and reward allocation behavior; and two, the relationship between level of cognitive ability and the use of information regarding work inputs, effort, and size of the workers as a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> reward <b>allocations.</b> In order to insure the range of cognitive abilities needed for this study, children ranging from first through fourth grades were chosen as subjects. There were three cognitive tasks, understanding of proportionality, physical-perceptual perspective-taking and cognitive-social perspective-taking, and six reward allocation story situations to which children responded. As predicted, boys and girls who demonstrated a conceptual understanding of proportionality gave a significantly greater amount of reward to the more productive worker in the unequal work input stories than to workers in the equal work input stories. However, boys who failed to demonstrate an understanding of proportionality also gave more rewards to the worker with the greater work input, whereas girls who did not understand proportional relationships allocated rewards equally. Using a multiple regression procedure, it was found that regardless of performance on the cognitive tasks, children took work inputs into consideration when making their allocation decisions. However, use of effort as a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> reward <b>allocations</b> was found to be related to cognitive ability, especially cognitive-social perspective-taking ability. Contrary to expectation, children were almost never influenced by size of the workers when making their allocation decisions...|$|R

40|$|The {{allocation}} of lock objects to critical sections in concurrent programs affects both performance and correctness. Traditionally, this allocation is done manually by the programmer. Recent work explores automatic lock allocation, aiming primarily to minimize conflicts and maximize parallelism by allocating locks to individual critical sections. We investigate several modes of lock allocation, using connected components (groups) of interfering critical sections on a critical section interference graph as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>allocation</b> decisions. Our allocator uses thread-based side effect analysis which is built from several pluggable component analyses. It benefits from precise points-to and may happen in parallel information. Thread-local object information provides a small improvement over points-to analysis alone. Our framework minimizes {{the restrictions on}} input programs, dealing gracefully with nesting and deadlock, and requiring only simple annotations identifying critical sections. Legacy programs using synchronized regions can be processed without alteration.

The subaccounts to synthetic account number 93 "Expenses for sale" have been proposed to reflect allocation of cost of sales between the reporting and future periods for actual realized and unrealized products (goods, works, services) resulting in a more accurate reflection of financial results from realisation of production (goods, works, services).

40|$|In the inter-war {{period the}} traditions of the liberal economy were {{dominating}} in the Polish bourgeois economic thought. However, the Polish liberal concepts were considerably differentiated. This differentiation was directly expressed in postulates concerning the scope of the state intervention in the economic life. Adam Krzyżanowski and Adam Heydel voice their views conforming to the spirit of the 19 th century liberalism that any state intervention distorts the market parameters providing a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>allocation</b> decisions, and consequently leads to disturbances in the free-competition mechanism, which ensures maximum profit and social welfare. Władysław Zawadzki and Edward Taylor, adherents of moderate liberalism, taking into account the monopolization process and perceiving complexity of economic processes, admit simultaneously the necessity of restricting the economic freedom and expanding the state intervention. On the other hand, Ferdynand Zweig's concept is of a pronounced neo-liberal character. Zweig represents a trend in liberalism often referred to as social or democratic liberalism and postulates quite radical social reforms admitting a considerable scope of the interventionist policy.

Among the models fitted, the best were chosen based on the analysis of deviance and the negative binomial generalized linear model was clearly preferable. The model contains additive effects associated with the season of the year, district, age group and the malaria incidence rates in previous months, and can be used to provide useful short-term forecasts.
