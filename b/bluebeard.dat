25|$|In 1901, Méliès {{continued}} producing successful {{films and}} was {{at the peak of}} his popularity. His films that year included The Brahmin and the Butterfly, in which Méliès portrays a Brahmin who transforms a caterpillar into a beautiful woman with wings, but is himself turned into a caterpillar. He also made the féerie Red Riding Hood and <b>Bluebeard,</b> both based on stories from Charles Perrault. In <b>Bluebeard,</b> Méliès plays the eponymous wife-murderer and co-stars with Jeanne d'Alcy and Bleuette Bernon. The film is an early example of parallel cross-cutting and match cuts of characters moving from one room to the next. The Edison Company's 1902 film Jack and the Beanstalk, directed by Edwin S. Porter, was considered a less successful American version of several Méliès films, particularly <b>Bluebeard.</b> That year, he also made Off to Bloomingdale Asylum, a blackface burlesque that includes four white bus passengers transforming into one large black passenger who is then shot by the bus driver.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Britain, she {{continued}} her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics.

25|$|Canterbury's {{mayor and}} {{corporation}} were grateful to this martyr to the Revolt who had built them an additional attraction for pilgrims, {{and they would}} pray at his tomb or under the Westgate. The head of the rebellious <b>Bluebeard</b> the Hermit was displayed on Westgate in 1450 after he was caught by local people and sent to Henry VI. It is thought that Geoffrey Chaucer may have undertaken a pilgrimage and passed through the gate.|$|E
25|$|From November 1927 to July 1933, Ninette de Valois was {{responsible}} for the setting up and the programming of the Abbey Theatre School of Ballet in Dublin, at the request of W. B. Yeats, {{one of the founders of}} the Abbey Theatre. During these years she produced a number of ballets each year, mostly to her own choreography. She also worked with music especially commissioned from Irish contemporary composers such as Harold R. White's The Faun (April 1928), Arthur Duff's The Drinking Horn and John F. Larchet's <b>Bluebeard</b> (both in July 1933).|$|E
25|$|French {{literature}} and poetry flourished {{even more in}} the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, philosophy) and to present them to the people, in order to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and <b>Bluebeard.</b> At {{the start of the}} 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, Victor de Cottens asked Méliès to {{collaborate}} with him on The Merry Deeds of Satan, a theatrical revue for the Théâtre du Châtelet. Méliès contributed two short films for the performances, Le Voyage dans l'espace (The Space Trip) and Le Cyclone (The Cyclone), and co-wrote the scenario with de Cottons for the entire revue. 1905 was also the 100th birthday of Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin created a special celebration performance, including Méliès' first new stage trick in several years, Les Phénomènes du Spiritisme. At the same time, he was again remodeling and expanding his studio at Montreuil by installing electric lights, adding a second stage and buying costumes from other sources. Méliès's films for 1905 include the adventure The Palace of the Arabian Nights and the féerie Rip's Dream, based on the Rip Van Winkle legend and the opera by Robert Planquette. In 1906, his output included an updated, comedic adaptation of the Faust legend The Merry Frolics of Satan and The Witch. But the féerie style that Méliès was best known for was beginning to lose popularity {{and he began to}} make films in other genres, such as crime and family films. In the U.S., Gaston Méliès had to reduce the sale prices of three of Méliès' earlier popular féeries, Cinderella, <b>Bluebeard</b> and Robinson Crusoe. By the end of 1905 Gaston had cut the prices of all films on the Star Films catalog by 20%, which did improve sales.|$|E
500|$|Leno {{considered}} the dame roles {{in two of}} his last pantomimes, <b>Bluebeard</b> (1901) and Mother Goose (1902), written by J. Hickory Wood, to be his favourites. He was paid £200 (£ in [...] adjusted for inflation) {{for each of the}} pantomime seasons. Leno appeared at Drury Lane as Sister Anne in <b>Bluebeard,</b> a character described by Wood as [...] "a sprightly, somewhat below middle aged person who was of a coming on disposition and who had not yet abandoned hope" [...] The Times drama critic noted: [...] "It is a quite peculiar and original Sister Anne, who dances breakdowns and sings strange ballads to a still stranger harp and plays ping-pong with a frying-pan and potatoes and burlesques Sherlock Holmes and wears the oddest of garments and dresses her hair like Miss Morleena Kenwigs, and speaks in a piping voice– in short it is none other than Dan Leno whom we all know". [...] Mother Goose provided Leno {{with one of the most}} challenging roles of his career, in which he was required to portray the same woman in several different guises. [...] Wood's idea, that neither fortune nor beauty would bring happiness, was illustrated by a series of magical character transformations. [...] The poor, unkempt and generally ugly Mother Goose eventually became a rich and beautiful but tasteless parvenu, searching for a suitor. The production was one of Drury Lane's most successful pantomimes, running until 28 March 1903.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Vonnegut married Jill Krementz, a {{photographer}} {{whom he met}} while {{she was working on}} a series about writers in the early 1970s. [...] With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old. In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including Jailbird (1979), Deadeye Dick (1982), Galápagos (1985), <b>Bluebeard</b> (1987), and Hocus Pocus (1990). In 1986, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in Rodney Dangerfield's film Back to School. The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, Timequake (1997), was, as University of Detroit history professor and Vonnegut biographer Gregory Sumner said, [...] "a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency." [...] Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled A Man Without a Country (2005), became a bestseller.|$|E

500|$|Grimaldi {{returned}} to Drury Lane late in 1802 {{and starred in}} a production of <b>Bluebeard,</b> followed by the Christmas pantomime Love and Magic. [...] In 1803 Grimaldi's contract at Sadler's Wells was extended for another three years. [...] He starred as Rufo the Robber in Red Riding Hood, as Sir John Bull in New Broom and Aminadab in Susanna Centlivre's A Bold Stroke for a Wife. The Napoleonic Wars had started, and the new proprietors of Sadler's Wells and Drury Lane looked to Grimaldi to satisfy audiences eager for comic relief. Cinderella; or, the Little Glass Slipper was presented at Drury Lane on 3 January 1804. [...] Grimaldi played the part of Pedro, a servant to Cinderella's sisters. The production was a major success for the theatre, enhanced by Michael Kelly's musical score; however Grimaldi and the critics grew concerned that the theatre was underusing his talents {{and that he was}} miscast in the role.|$|E
500|$|... "What is {{the point}} of life?" [...] is a {{question}} Vonnegut often pondered in his works. When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question [...] "What is the purpose of life?" [...] written in a bathroom, his response is, [...] "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." [...] Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, [...] " [...] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in." [...] In the epigraph to <b>Bluebeard,</b> Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: [...] "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of <b>Bluebeard,</b> Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate you and you deserve it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On [...] Petipa {{presented}} what {{is arguably}} the most lavish ballet he ever staged: <b>Bluebeard,</b> based on the Perrault fairytale to the music of Pyotr Schenk. The ballet consisted of a myriad of dances in the context of such a sumptuous production that many of the critics and balletomanes felt that the work was merely a gargantuan excuse for spectacle and dances, something made all the more apparent with the spectacular showcasing of Pierina Legnani in the principal role. The final tableau consisted of a three-part astrological divertissement titled The Temple of the Past, Present & Futures. The Temple of the Future rounded out the scene with its Pas de deux éléctrique performed by Legnani and Nikolai Legat to storms of applause. In spite of the criticisms of <b>Bluebeard,</b> the critics unanimously praised the seventy-eight-year-old Petipa's seemingly limitless imagination in the creation of classical dances, proving once again that no other choreographer in Europe could claim to be his rival.|$|E
