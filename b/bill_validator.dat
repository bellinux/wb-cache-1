50|$|Cleaning {{cards are}} {{disposable}} products designed {{to clean the}} interior contact points of a device that facilitates an electronic information transaction (point of sale terminal, automated teller machine, remote deposit check scanners, micr readers, magnetic stripe reader, bill acceptor, <b>bill</b> <b>validator,</b> access control locks, etc.). In order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device, the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media - such as a credit card, check, or currency. As the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device, it will clean components that would normally {{come in contact with}} the transaction media such as readers, lenses, read/write chip and pins, belts, rollers, and paths. Cleaning card products are widely accepted and endorsed by device manufacturers and industry professionals. Many have developed their own cleaning cards to better clean their particular devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, {{there was a}} trend in the U.S. for large {{national}} retailers to have contracts with the national vending companies to provide full line vending services to all their branches' lunch / meal rooms. In most cases, managers and staff of individual stores objected to this, because the national vending companies were not necessarily responsive when making the product choices for the machines. As a result, this trend began to reverse. Most full line vending operators are independent and are small operations. Often, they can have the existing vending machines removed and get permission to install their own machines by promising to lower prices, stock the machine with the manager's favorite candies, or provide better service (e.g. servicing the machine the same day if a coin jam or <b>bill</b> <b>validator</b> becomes jammed).|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{these devices}} are {{typically}} {{seen in the}} vicinity of machines that will not accept paper currency. This can be in a parking facility that has parking meters, in laundromats, or near vending machines that lack <b>bill</b> <b>validators</b> and don't accept paper currency.|$|R
50|$|The Coin Coalition is an {{organization}} supporting the elimination of pennies and dollar bills from U.S. currency. It is funded by vending machine companies, video-arcade owners, and the soft-drink industry, who all {{have an interest in}} eliminating maintenance costs associated with <b>bill</b> <b>validators.</b> The National Bulk Vendors Association supports the Coalition.|$|R
5000|$|Clayton {{pointed out}} the {{continuing}} costs associated with <b>bill</b> <b>validators,</b> saying, [...] "They have made great strides and improved the bill acceptors over the years, but, at the same time, the bulk of, I would say, about 40 percent of my service calls and maintenance and upkeep, those calls are still on bill acceptors. So, they're costing us not only to install, to accept the dollar bill in the beginning, but also to maintain and keep them working so that our customers aren't unhappy." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{card was}} originally patented by Stanley H. Eyler and the patent (US#5525417 A) {{was assigned to}} his employer, the Clean Team Company. The Clean Team Company later {{changed its name to}} KICTeam, Inc.,which continues to be the leading manufacturer of cleaning cards. The cleaning card has evolved with the equipment they need to clean. A good example is the bill acceptor. Initially, the bill acceptor was designed for vending machines as a means of selling candy to the public. It includes a device that recognizes that a US one dollar bank note has been inserted. The cleaning card was required to be the same shape as US currency in order to be accepted into the device to clean it. Vending machines began accepting higher denominations as well as having the ability to make change. Specialized sensors were introduced into the bill acceptors to recognize multiple denominations and to only accept media that contained bank note characteristics. The bill acceptor cleaning card was redeveloped to contain magnetic ink and bank note characteristics so as to be accepted by the equipment. The development of bill acceptors for slot machines in the gaming and casino industry required the bill acceptor to be more sophisticated. The <b>bill</b> <b>validators</b> needed to validate currency of multiple denominations up to a one hundred dollar bank note. Fraud was now a critical issue and was addressed by multiple sensors and optics throughout the inserted currency pathway. These sensors and optics were recessed so as to keep currency from running across them with each insertion and wearing down sensitive lenses.|$|R
