5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E

25|$|Metro is {{publicly}} owned, receiving {{funding from}} council tax payers and government. Nexus, which owns and manages Metro, contracted out operations and train maintenance {{as part of}} a deal with the UK Government to secure modernisation investment and operating subsidy for the system between 2010 and 2021. Nexus continued to set fares, set frequency of services and Metro operating hours. Opponents say this was privatisation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> though some services had already been contracted out, such as cleaning of stations and ticket inspections. On 3 November 2008, Nexus invited potential bidders to declare an interest in a contract to run the operations side of the business on its behalf. The successful bidder was to obtain a seven-year contract commencing on 1 April 2010, with up to an additional two years depending on performance. In February 2009 four bids were shortlisted; DB Regio, MTR Corporation, Serco-Abellio, and an in-house bid by Metro. By October 2009 the shortlist had been reduced to bids from DB Regio and Nexus. In December 2009, DB Regio was named as the preferred bidder. The contract for operating the system was signed on 2 February 2010, and the service was handed over to DB Regio on 1 April 2010.|$|E

40|$|Institutions {{constrain}} political {{choices and}} thus commit the future path of policy. Welldesigned institutions square {{the circle of}} generating commitment that is both credible and flexible. This essay develops an audience-cost theory of flexible commitment that addresses some vexing questions. Where does institutional commitment comes from? Why is institutional commitment feasible when policy commitment is not? How can an institution achieve credible and flexible commitment without flexibility undermining credibility <b>by</b> opening <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> to defections? How does partial commitment work, or {{how is it possible}} for defections to occur in an equilibrium with credible commitment? Why do policy-makers sometimes respect institutional constraints and other times defect on institutional commitments? Why are some defections punished severely, while others are instantly forgiven and forgotten?...|$|R

Mahoney attempts a rescue but is taken as a second hostage. Just as both are about to be killed, Hightower suddenly appears on the rooftop. The former cadet manages to fool the madman into thinking he is a fellow crook and demands that he kill Harris. When the criminal tries to pull the trigger, Hightower knocks him unconscious and he falls onto the stairs.

500|$|The pair {{were married}} in Boulogne on 25 January. Edward gave Isabella a psalter as a wedding gift, and her father gave her gifts worth over 21,000 livres and a {{fragment}} of the True Cross. The pair returned to England in February, where Edward had ordered Westminster Palace to be lavishly restored in readiness for their coronation and wedding feast, complete with marble tables, forty ovens and a fountain that produced wine and pimento, a spiced medieval drink. After some delays, the ceremony went ahead on 25 February, {{under the guidance of}} Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of the coronation, Edward swore to uphold [...] "the rightful laws and customs which the community of the realm shall have chosen". It is uncertain what this meant: it might have been intended to force Edward to accept future legislation, it may have been inserted to prevent him from overturning any future vows he might take, or it may have been an attempt by the King to ingratiate himself with the barons. The event was marred by the large crowds of eager spectators who surged into the palace, knocking down a wall and forcing Edward to flee <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1927 when Cameron met Norman Bruhn (1894â€“1927), a Melbourne-born {{dockworker}} and gunman, thief, standover man and pimp {{feared for}} his garroting skills, {{who was forced}} to leave Melbourne by rival gunman Squizzy Taylor in November 1926, she was described as [...] "a redhead with a ripe figure and provocative china blue eyes". At that time Cameron was a street prostitute on William and Palmer Streets with no connection to Tilly Devine or any other madam. Despite having a wife and children, Bruhn soon became Cameron's lover and pimp, although she also worked as a dance instructor at Professor Bolot's Academy in Sydney's Oxford Street, commuting between Sydney and Queensland on a regular basis. According to Larry Writer, Cameron [...] "perfected the age-old game called 'gingering' in Australia. During sex with one of her clients, an accomplice would emerge from beneath the bed and take the client's wallet from his pants or jacket. At that point, coitus would be interrupted by angry banging on the door by another involved in the scam, Cameron, feigning panic, would exclaim it was the police or her irate husband, and urge the client to dress and depart <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Keen to avoid the embarrassment of public prosecution or a beating, the customer would flee and usually not notice until later that his wallet was missing." [...] Cameron also was a cocaine runner and a fence for stolen property. Bruhn, who attempted to dominate the duopolised gangland milieu, was shot twice in the stomach outside a sly grog den in Charlotte Lane, Darlinghurst on 22 June 1927 by a hit squad sent by either Devine or Kate Leigh. and subsequently died {{in the early hours of}} 23 June 1927.|$|E

50|$|It is {{critical}} for the bottom practitioner {{to be able to}} defend a mount by an opponent. Typical escapes include <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> escape (escaping <b>by</b> moving under <b>the</b> opponent), bridging (also called the upa escape; escaping <b>by</b> thrusting <b>the</b> hips upwards and to the side). An alternative also commonly used is the elbow escape, also referred to as the shrimp or shrimping, this involves using the elbows or hands to create space in between the opponent and the practitioner so that the practitioner can work one leg, then the other in between himself and his opponent, hence obtaining the half guard, or full guard. Another option for the defending practitioner is to rotate the body so that the face points downwards. This will however place the practitioner in a very disadvantageous position, defending <b>the</b> <b>back</b> mount, but it is possible to escape while turning, if the opponent has not yet stabilized <b>the</b> position. <b>By</b> simultaneously escaping <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> or <b>by</b> standing up in an attempt to dislodge the opponent, a practitioner may successfully escape. Still another technique is for the defending practitioner to sweep his opponent, thereby moving from a defensive position to neutral one, or in a best-case scenario a dominant position.|$|R
60|$|Has it ever {{occurred}} to you to think {{what you would do}} if your house took fire at night?

Do you know how you would attempt to throw water on the walls of one of your rooms, if it were on fire near the ceiling? A tea-cup would be of no use! A sauce-pan would not be much better. As for buckets or basins, the strongest man could not heave such weights of water to the ceiling with any precision or effect.

60|$|During {{my second}} visit to Baltimore I {{went over to}} Washington {{for a day or}} two, and found the capital still under the empire of King Mud. How the elite of a nation--for the {{inhabitants}} of Washington consider themselves to be the elite--can consent to live in such a state of thraldom, a foreigner cannot understand. Were I {{to say that it was}} intended to be typical of the condition of the government, I might be considered cynical; but undoubtedly the sloughs of despond which were deepest in their despondency were to be found in localities which gave an appearance of truth to such a surmise. The Secretary of State's office, in which Mr. Seward was still reigning, though with diminished glory, was divided from the headquarters of the commander-in-chief, which are immediately opposite to it, by an opaque river which admitted of no transit. These buildings stand at the corner of President Square, and it had been long understood that any close intercourse between them had not been considered desirable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> occupants of the military side of the causeway. But the Secretary of State's office was altogether unapproachable without a long circuit and begrimed legs. The Secretary of War's department was, if possible, in a worse condition. This is situated on the other side of the President's house, and the mud lay, if possible, thicker in this quarter than it did round Mr. Seward's chambers. The passage over Pennsylvania Avenue, immediately in front of the War Office, was a thing not to be attempted in those days. Mr. Cameron, it is true, had gone, and Mr. Stanton was installed; but the labor of cleansing the interior of that establishment had hitherto allowed no time for a glance at the exterior dirt, and Mr. Stanton should, perhaps, be held as excused. That the Navy Office should be buried in mud, and quite debarred from approach, was to be expected. The space immediately in front of Mr. Lincoln's own residence was still kept fairly clean, and I am happy to be able to give testimony to this effect. Long may it remain so. I could not, however, but think that an energetic and careful President would have seen to the removal of the dirt from his own immediate neighborhood. It was something that his own shoes should remain unpolluted; but the foul mud always clinging to the boots and leggings of those by whom he was daily surrounded must, I should think, have been offensive to him. The entrance to the Treasury was difficult to achieve by those who had not learned <b>by</b> practice <b>the</b> ways of the place; but I must confess that a tolerably clear passage was maintained on that side which led immediately down to the halls of Congress. Up at the Capitol the mud was again triumphant in the front of the building; this however was not of great importance, as the legislative chambers of the States are always reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors.</b> I, on this occasion, attempted to leave <b>the</b> building <b>by</b> <b>the</b> grand entrance, but I soon became entangled among rivers of mud and mazes of shifting sand. With difficulty I recovered my steps, and finding my way <b>back</b> to <b>the</b> building was forced to content myself by an exit among the crowd of Senators and Representatives who were thronging down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> stairs.|$|R

50|$|At the {{residence}} of Fylfot the Necromancer, he is unknowingly the victim of an invisible imp, keeping Fylfot's ears plugged up with its fingers. Unable to get Fylfot's attention, Marco whistles, so loudly in fact that it drives away the imp {{that none of them}} could see. Able to hear again, and feeling compelled to help Marco, Fylfot agrees to lend them his magic boots. He also warns them about the two-headed giant that is under orders to kill any young man that comes to its gates. Sylvia calculates how many steps/strides to take in the boots (as a league is 5 km, one footstep = one league, but a stride = 35 km), and 9 strides later, they are 1 km away from the tower. When the tower is within sight, Marco finds that he has lost his father's written instructions. Sylvia takes matters into her own hands and goes into the tower herself, reasoning that the giant is only under orders to kill any young man and she is a girl. Inside the tower, Sylvia learns from the tower's caretaker that Princess Aurelia was just rescued <b>the</b> day before <b>by</b> a young man who had apparently found written instructions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> roadside which said to come <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tower's <b>back</b> <b>door</b> where there's no giant. Sylvia informs Marco, who now doesn't what to tell his father. Thoughtfully, Sylvia asks if it had to be Princess Aurelia he had to rescue or if any princess would do, and Marco explains that the custom is simply to rescue a princess. Sylvia reveals that she herself is in fact a princess, and that he has already rescued her from boredom; she'd been going stir-crazy back in her father's castle before Marco had arrived, and that she hasn't been bored since. Together, Prince Marco and Princess Sylvia make their way to Lirripipe.|$|R

[...] In Lvov, the female concierge in the building where Ginczanka resided, resentful of having allocated space in her building to a refugee like Ginczanka in the first place, saw her opportunity to rid herself of the unwelcome tenant and at the same time to enrich herself. In the summer of 1942 she denounced Ginczanka to the Nazi authorities newly in power in town as a Jew hiding in her building on false papers. The Nazi police immediately made an attempt to arrest Ginczanka, but other residents of the building helped her avoid arrest <b>by</b> slipping out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> etc. On one single day the Schupo made three separate raids on the building in an effort to arrest Ginczanka.

According to the court documents from the post-War trial of Zofja Chomin, as reported in the press (see Aftermath below), she managed to give her captors a slip after having been brought to the police station but before being securely imprisoned; according to other sources, her friends managed to redeem her from Nazi hands <b>by</b> bribery.

Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time along with everyone else's, and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours. [...] Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution is to learn and remember the alien language themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behavior {{as a means of}} dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time. The pair play golf through the active Stargate (much to General Hammond's irritation in at least one loop), Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops <b>by</b> slamming <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>back</b> in <b>the</b> face of the airman who accidentally hit him with it in the beginning of each loop, O'Neill tries pottery-making (clearly improving with each progressive loop), bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force whilst wearing an outrageous sweatshirt {{for the sole purpose of}} grabbing Carter and kissing her in the seconds before the loop resets.|$|R
