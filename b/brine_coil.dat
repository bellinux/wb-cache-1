50|$|Caspar Pfaudler {{invented a}} method of lining cast iron tanks with glass while working with the brewing industry. The first glass-lined tanks were built by the Dickson Manufacturing Company in 1887; and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 {{increased}} use of these tanks for milk products. The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M) was using a milk car with glass-lined steel tanks in 1910. Pfaudler designed what became a standard milk car with two 3000 gal tanks inside a closed car. Earlier cars featured a removable roof to replace damaged tanks, but the tanks proved durable enough to eliminate that feature from later production. Pfaudler cars included <b>brine</b> <b>coils</b> to cool the car at the creamery, and an electric stirring mechanism to keep butterfat distributed through the milk and minimize deposition on {{the interior of the}} tank. Stirring also helped maintain a uniform temperature throughout the tank.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for the {{analysis}} of energy systems not only on the bases of their operational life, but also on the basis of considerations for the manufacturing and recycling phases. Environmental {{and to a lesser extent}} resource scarcity factors sould also be taken into consideration. A general unified thermodynamic approach based on exergy was recently proposed [1, 2, 3] and is briefly summarized. The main idea of this approach is to minimize the cumulated exergetic losses of operation, manufacture and recycling distributing the exergy of manufactrue (the so-called gray exergy) and recycling over the life time of the system. Additional levels of analysis consist of introducing pollution and resource scarcity factors and using these to artificially penalize the above mentioned exergy terms. In this paper, the first level of analysis (exergy analysis with gray exergy) is applied to four domestic heat pumps operating with different evaporators (direct expansion horizontal ground <b>coil,</b> <b>brine</b> horizontal ground <b>coil,</b> <b>brine</b> geothermal U tubes and air-source) ...|$|R

The heart of CoBRA is an evaporator that produces water vapor from brine. This evaporator leverages a novel design that enables passive transport of brine from place to place within the system. While {{it will be necessary to}} build or modify a system for testing the CoBRA concept, the emphasis of this project will be on developing the evaporator itself. This project will utilize a test early, test often approach, building at least one trial evaporator to guide the design of the final product...|$|R
40|$|Brine water {{recovery}} represents a current technology gap in water recycling for human spaceflight. The {{role of a}} brine processor {{is to take the}} concentrated discharge from a primary wastewater processor, called brine, and recover most of the remaining water from it. The current stateoftheart primary processor is the ISS Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) that currently achieves 70 % {{water recovery}}. Recent advancements in chemical pretreatments are expected to increase this to 85 % in the near future. This is a welcome improvement, yet is still not high enough for deep space transit. Mission architecture studies indicate that at least 95 % is necessary for a Mars mission, as an example. Brine water recovery is the technology that bridges the gap between 85 % and 95 %, and moves life support systems one step closer to full closure of the water loop. Several brine water recovery systems have been proposed for human spaceflight, most of them focused on solving two major problems: operation in a weightless environment, and management and containment of brine residual. Brine residual is the leftover byproduct of the brine recovery process, and is often a viscous, sticky paste, laden with crystallized solid particles. Due to the chemical pretreatments added to wastewater prior to distillation in a primary processor, these residuals are typically toxic, which further complicates matters. Isolation of crewmembers from these hazardous materials is paramount. The <b>Coiled</b> <b>Brine</b> Recovery Assembly (CoBRA) is a recently developed concept from the Johnson Space Center that offers solutions to these challenges. CoBRA is centered on a softgoods evaporator that enables a passive fill with brine, and regeneration by discharging liquid brine residual to a collection bag. This evaporator is meant to be lightweight, which allows it to be discarded along with the accumulated brine solids contained within it. This paper discusses design and development of a first CoBRA prototype, and reports initial test results...|$|R
