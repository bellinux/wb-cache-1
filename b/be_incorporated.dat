5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity {{in the press and}} led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the new complex.|$|E
5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England.

5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to <b>be</b> <b>incorporated,</b> once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} campaigns of World War II, Germany's light tanks, {{including}} the PanzerI, formed {{the bulk of}} its armoured strength. In March1938, the German Army marched into Austria, experiencing a mechanical breakdown rate of up to thirty percent. However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German Panzerkorps and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, and {{the remainder of the}} country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the Panzer 38(t), and their subsequent variants and production, to <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the German Army's strength. It also prepared German forces for the invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Following European settlement, {{the growth}} of the new colony of New South Wales led to an {{increasing}} demand for arable land.
