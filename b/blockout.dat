A single full-scale crash test was conducted with the 2270 P pickup truck in accordance with MASH test no. 3 - 11. The small car test, test no. 3 - 10, was deemed unnecessary as the pickup truck test would result in higher rail loads, a greater propensity for rail rupture, and {{a greater risk of}} failure. The test installation utilized standard 6 -ft (1. 8 -m) long steel guardrail posts with 12 -in. (305 -mm) deep <b>blockouts.</b> A single post was omitted {{near the center of the}} 175 -ft (53. 3 -m) long installation. Test no. MGSMP- 1 resulted in the guardrail capturing and smoothly redirecting the 2270 P vehicle. The vehicle remained upright, and all vehicle decelerations were within the recommended occupant risk limits. As such, the MGS with an omitted post satisfied the TL- 3 safety performance criteria found in MASH. Following the full-scale crash testing, implementation guidance and recommendations were provided regarding the omission of a post within various MGS configurations, including MGS adjacent to 2 : 1 fill slopes, MGS on 8 : 1 approach slopes, MGS in combination with curbs, wood post MGS, non-blocked MGS, terminals and anchorages, MGS stiffness transition to thrie beam approach guardrail transitions, and MGS long-span systems...|$|R

5000|$|In traffic engineering, highway {{guardrail}} {{may prevent}} an errant vehicle from hitting roadside obstacles {{which may be}} either man-made (sign structures, culvert inlets, utility poles) or natural (trees, rock croppings), running {{off the road and}} going down a steep embankment, or veering off the roadway into oncoming traffic (commonly referred to as a median barrier). Roadside obstacles are typically referred to as fixed objects. A secondary objective is keeping the vehicle upright while deflected along the guardrail. The most common type of guardrail in use today is the Blocked-Out W-beam (Strong Post). [...] Strong-post W-beam guardrail consists of wood posts and wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. The wood or plastic blockouts reduce or minimize a vehicle snagging on the posts upon impact. In addition, a <b>blockout</b> may be used to increase the offset of guardrail with an obstacle such as a curb.The posts' primary purpose is to maintain the height of the guardrail during the initial stages of post deflection. [...] Maintaining guardrail height also reduces the potential for a vehicle to vault over the guardrail upon initial impact. The posts also {{play a role in the}} amount of resistance and deflection a guardrail may experience during impact. Resistance in a strong post system results from a combination of tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending and shearing resistance of the posts. [...] One of the main concerns with strong-post W-beam guardrail has been the ability of the system to contain and redirect modern vehicles that have a higher center of gravity along with the increased weight of those vehicles. The problem with this is that a guardrail of the optimum height for a car might not keep a truck from toppling over it, while a motorbike might slip under a higher rail. To address these concerns, significant research and development of a system that could contain and redirect vehicles of varying weights and heights was developed and crash tested (both controlled and simulated). As a result, the Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) was developed and successfully crash tested per NCHRP Report 350 TL-3 criteria. [...] MGS has a higher mounting height, uses larger posts and blockouts as compared to the strong-post W-beam guardrail. One other significant difference is that MGS rail splices occur at mid-span compared to at the posts like the strong-post w-beam guardrail.|$|E

In the first step, a detailed finite element model of the G 4 (1 S) guardrail system was created. The model incorporated the details of the rail, connections, the post, the <b>blockout,</b> and the soil in which the post was embedded. To validate the model of the w-beam guardrail system, a model of the setup of this w-beam system in previous full-scale crash tests was created.

First, we identify formally the group of majority-party members who are net policy losers.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this work is to {{evaluate}} and to improve the response of guardrail system during a lateral impact. The problem was analyzed in the first step at the component level, which consists of a single post embedded in a cohesionless soil and laterally loaded by an impactor.

An improved subgrade method for soil-post interaction which includes the stiffness, damping and inertia effect involved during the crash, was proposed in this thesis.

While the G 4 (2 W) is used in a number of states, the G 4 (1 W) is now common only in the state of Iowa. Though the performance of the two guardrails have been presumed to be equivalent, only one full-scale crash test has ever been performed on the G 4 (1 W) and that test was performed over 30 years ago using a now-obsolete test vehicle. The non-linear finite element analysis program LS-DYNA was used to evaluate the crashworthiness of the two guardrails.

40|$|The current {{edition of}} the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) {{provides}} limited guidance {{for the design of}} composite bridges with precast concrete deck panels and steel girders. The shear connection is critical in determining the overall performance of the composite superstructure and is commonly achieved with a grout <b>blockout</b> in a precast concrete deck panel, which accepts a cluster of tightly spaced steel shear studs. No specific equations are found in the CHBDC for the design of shear studs used in this system. Furthermore, the current longitudinal spacing limitation of 600 mm for shear studs in the CHBDC is not conducive to the construction of precast concrete decks where an increased spacing of the stud cluster is desirable. An experimental testing regime was conducted using push-test specimens constructed with precast concrete panels connected to steel flanges with steel studs within a circular grout pocket. Specimens were tested to failure to determine the ultimate capacity of a stud cluster and to investigate the reduction in ultimate strength after cyclic loading. A 36 m simple span composite superstructure was designed to the CHBDC. A parametric study is being conducted on the spacing of stud clusters to investigate the serviceability limit state of the composite superstructure using data captured from the push test specimens.

40|$|The ends of {{prestressed}} concrete beams under expansion joints are often exposed to moisture and chlorides.

Once deterioration begins, it progresses unless some process is employed to address it. Deterioration can lead to loss of bearing area and therefore a reduction in bridge capacity. Previous research has looked into the use of concrete coatings (silanes, epoxies, fiber-reinforced polymers, etc.) for protecting {{prestressed concrete}} beam ends but found that little to no laboratory research has been done related to the performance of these coatings in this specific type of application. The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) currently specifies coating the ends of exposed prestressed concrete beams with Sikagard 62 (a high-build, protective, solvent-free, epoxy coating) at the precast plant prior to installation on the bridge. However, no physical testing of Sikagard 62 in this application has been completed. In addition, the Iowa DOT continues to see deterioration in the prestressed concrete beam ends, even those treated with Sikagard 62. The goals of this project were to evaluate the performance of the Iowa DOT-specified beam-end coating as well as other concrete coating alternatives based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) T 259 - 80 chloride ion penetration test and to test their performance on in-service bridges throughout the duration of the project. In addition, alternative beam-end forming details were developed and evaluated for their potential to mitigate and/or eliminate the deterioration caused by corrosion of the prestressing strands on prestressed concrete beam ends used in bridges with expansion joints. The alternative beam-end details consisted of individual strand blockouts, an individual <b>blockout</b> for a cluster of strands, dual blockouts for two clusters of strands, and drilling out the strands after they are flush cut.
