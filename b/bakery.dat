5|$|Angel {{improved}} the bread-making operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines. He often slept overnight at the <b>bakery</b> {{during the week}} {{and returned to his}} home in Talpiot when the <b>bakery</b> was closed on Shabbat. Later he built an apartment over the <b>bakery</b> to house his family. In the 1930s, the <b>bakery</b> employed 25 workers and had one production line that turned out 8,500 loaves per day. It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and a horse and wagon. During World War II, the <b>bakery</b> contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens that could turn out 540 loaves per hour.|$|E

5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} <b>bakery</b> overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the <b>bakery</b> acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the <b>bakery</b> to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose:Consumption {{of baking}} soda, {{as a primary}} {{material}} for preparation of bread dough, has been banned due to its health complications in Iran. So bread production in our country faced difficulties and one part of them is related to health issues which are bread production. Also, in some cases, baking soda {{is used in the}} bread production. This study was done to study the environmental health status and consumption of baking soda in the military and urban Lavash <b>bakeries</b> of Tehran in 2012. Materials and methods:This is a descriptive comparative study done on Lavash bread production of 14 military <b>bakeries</b> and 14 corresponding urban <b>bakeries</b> near them. PH in the samples was tested based on Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran No. 2628. To check the status of environmental health and personal hygiene of <b>bakeries,</b> the check list of Cereal Research Center was used. Results:In terms of environmental health status, 28. 6 % military <b>bakeries</b> and 7. 1 % urban <b>bakeries</b> were at good level. In terms of personal hygiene, all <b>bakeries</b> were in the poor category. Also, 42. 9 % of military Lavash <b>bakeries</b> and 14. 3 % of urban Lavash <b>bakeries</b> used baking soda in their bread production. Conclusion:Environment health and personal hygiene status in military <b>bakeries</b> are better than the urban <b>bakeries</b> however, hygiene status was not desirable in military <b>bakeries.</b> Also, baking soda consumption in military <b>bakeries</b> was more common than the urban <b>bakeries.</b> According to the results of this study, control of health status and avoiding baking soda consumption in the <b>bakeries</b> are necessary...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the food}} industry, quality {{assurance}} (QA) systems {{are applied to}} ensure food safety and food quality to prevent liability claims and to build and maintain trust of consumers. <b>Bakeries</b> apply QA systems such as Hygiene code, HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points), ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and BRC (British Retail Consortium), but {{for them to be}} able to decide which system suits their specific situation (i. e., context) most and how this system should be implemented, they lack the necessary insight into the interdependence of contextual factors of <b>bakeries</b> and the quality management level at which these <b>bakeries</b> operate. This article reports on these aspects. The contextual factors that were studied include QA system, size of organization, degree of automation and type of product group. The level of food quality management between groups of <b>bakeries</b> differing in these contextual factors was analysed. Differences between groups of <b>bakeries</b> were found in the level of the quality management activities, control of strategy, allocation of supplying raw materials, supply control, planning of production and control of execution of production tasks. <b>Bakeries</b> that applied BRC, <b>bakeries</b> with 150 employees or more, industrial <b>bakeries,</b> and confectionery and biscuit <b>bakeries</b> performed some of these activities at a higher quality level than the other groups of <b>bakeries.</b> The study shows that by using the instrument IMAQE-Food, <b>bakeries</b> can select suitable quality management activities and QA systems for their specific situation to achieve effective quality management...|$|R

Built in 1854, Ellis Cottage is a single room stone building built by John Stevens, founder of Steventon Estate that later become the suburb of Tea Tree Gully.
