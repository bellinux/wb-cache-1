40|$|AbstractRecent EU {{transportation}} sector actions focus {{towards the}} development of integrated, technology–based transportation systems to support co–modality operations. These may contribute significantly towards the minimization of operational costs and improvement of customer satisfaction, while being energy efficient and environmental friendly. This paper presents the design, implementation and pilot testing of an innovative web tool that helps shippers and freight forwarders in seeking near optimal combined transport solutions taking into account trip costs, transportation durations, risk and CO 2 emissions. The paper analyses {{the architecture of the}} platform, which is based on user requirements, as mapped through an extensive elicitation process. Subsequently, it describes the methods used to: a) generate transportation routes using available data and related OR techniques, <b>b)</b> <b>request</b> offers from registered providers, and c) monitor delivery.

40|$|Modern storage {{systems are}} {{required}} to scale to large storage capacities and I/O throughput in a cost effective manner. For this reason, they are increasingly being built out of commodity components, mainly PCs equipped {{with large numbers of}} disks and interconnected of high-performance system area networks. A main issue in these efforts is to achieve high I/O throughput over commodity, low-cost system area networks and commodity operating systems. In this work, we examine in detail the performance of remote block-level storage I/O over commodity, RDMA-capable network interfaces and networks. We examine the support that is required from the network interface for achieving high throughput. We also examine in detail the overheads associated in kernel-level protocols for networked storage access. We find that base system performance is limited by (a) interrupt cost, (<b>b)</b> <b>request</b> size, and (c) protocol message size. We examine the impact of techniques to alleviate these factors and find that our techniques combined can improve throughput by up to 100 % over a simpler unoptimized configuration. Our current prototype is able to achieve a throughput of about 200 MBytes/s over a network that is capable of delivering about 500 MBytes/s. We identify major limiting factors, mostly at the I/O target-side...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Flash-crowd {{attacks are}} the most vicious form of {{distributed}} denial of service (DDoS). They flood the victim with service requests generated from numerous bots. Attack requests are identical in content to those generated by legitimate, human users, and bots send {{at a low rate}} to appear non-aggressive — these features defeat many existing DDoS defenses. We propose defenses against flash-crowd attacks via human behavior modeling, which differentiate DDoS bots from human users. Current approaches to human-vs-bot differentiation, such as graphical puzzles, are insufficient and annoying to humans, whereas our defenses are highly transparent. We model three aspects of human behavior: a) request dynamics, by learning several chosen features of human interaction dynamics, and detecting bots that exhibit higher aggressiveness in {{one or more of these}} features, <b>b)</b> <b>request</b> semantics, by learning transitional probabilities of user requests, and detecting bots that generate valid but low-probability sequences, and c) ability to process visual cues, by embedding into server replies human-invisible objects, which cannot be detected by automated analysis, and flagging users that visit them as bots. We evaluate our defenses’ performance on a series of web traffic logs, interlaced with synthetically generated attacks, and conclude that they raise the bar for a successful, sustained attack to botnets whose size is larger than the size observed in 1 - 5 % of DDoS attacks today.

This research background is {{the placement of}} criminal children at Societal Institution Class II B Tasikmalaya that is not relevant with Section 18 article (1) Act Number 12 Year 1995 on Societal Activity and Section 17 article (1) letter a of the Act Number 23 Year 2002 on Children Protection. The problems which come are : 1) How is the implementation of prison criminal sanction towards Children Prisoner at Societal Institution Class II B Tasikmalaya?; and 2) What are the reasons of imprisoning the Children Prisoner at Societal Institution Class II B Tasikmalaya? This is normative law research which focuses on positive law norm in form of regulation rules. This research was conducted at Societal Institution Class II B Tasikmalaya. The research result indicates that the implementation of prison criminal sanction towards children prisoner was done by giving mental, social and skill development. Furthermore, the reasons of imprisoning the Children Prisoner at Societal Institution Class II B Tasikmalaya are general reasons, which are : a) Tasikmalaya Region and City has not built Children Societal Institution; b) Temporal placement; and c) The rest of the prisoner’s criminal act less than one year.

[...] Conservatory of Music and Dance. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Research in language, neurology, and music suggests that constructs {{of music to}} provide organization, such as rhythm and melody, may facilitate language skill development and sensory organization for children with autism. This project inquired whether rhythmic speech or melody during free-play and intervention sessions could help increase language production and organize sensory systems, displayed by Restricted, Repetitive Stereotypical behaviors (RRS), for children diagnosed with autism. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} determined that neither language skills nor RRS behaviors were significantly influenced by rhythmic speech or rhythmic speech with melody. While statistical analysis did not suggest an effect, observational data collected during the sessions did suggest that auditory perception and orientation toward language might have been positively effected by rhythm and melody. Further research is necessary to determine how the organizing principles of rhythm and melody might affect the language development of children with autism. Anecdotal evidence is discussed to support future research in this field. Introduction [...] Review of literature [...] Method [...] Results [...] Discussion [...] Appendix A.

40|$|The phenomenal dotcom burst {{during early}} 2000 has now almost been {{completely}} forgotten by groundbreaking {{changes in the}} way the internet works – in both innovative business models and means of reaching customers. Even before the inception of the popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Linkedin, Kenny & Marshall (2000) wrote in their popular HBR article about the ubiquitous nature of the internet – “ New technologies are emerging that will enable businesses to reach customers whenever and wherever they are ready to buy. The focus of e-commerce will shift from content to context, knocking many corporate Web sites into irrelevance. ” This internship dissertation report seeks to look at the company Negotiation Power which started as the brainchild of Mr. Mark Bartrick and look to evaluate the future prospects of making the web based service (currently an IT Procurement forum). The main focus of the research is evaluating the company contextually. A strategic marketing plan is the intended end result. From an academic perspective, this report attempts to initially look at the strengths of various perspectives in strategic management literature. This is then followed by a look at the B 2 B context in which the business is placed, albeit in an online environ. A review of the B 2 B marketing literature and viral marketing (which has been the prime medium of marketing in the modern internet success stories) is carried out. We also look at IS literature that look at success factors for online business and more importantly also add a Web 2. 0 theme to the entire analysis. Wherever there is a gap that academic studies have identified, this dissertation looks to carry out original research to fill them up. Three levels of surveys were carried out including semi-structured personal/telephonic interviews of the procurement heads of various companies in the UK, web based interview of procurement personnel in the UK and a web based survey of the general public to understand emerging trends in social networking usage. The project has a plethora of recommendations both academic and practitioner research. The focus of technology and the individual in B 2 B interactions are major themes around which the results are centred. The study has helped determine that technology (internet in specific) does play an important part in B 2 B exchanges. It has helped re-establish the importance of trust both in online and offline B 2 B exchanges.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to developing a better understanding of the actual conditions in which guidance is provided to apprentices in ordinary work situations. It develops methodological tools and categories for analysing guidance at work and reflects, in a critical perspective, about the contributions and limitations of a practice-based learning system as it is implemented in Switzerland. On the basis of empirical material consisting of audio-video recordings, and drawing on analytical tools borrowed from various approaches in applied linguistics, we propose to investigate how discourse and verbal interaction contribute to the accomplishment of guidance in ordinary work activities. More specifically, we describe various ways of accomplishing direct guidance at work by distinguishing what we call a) spontaneous guidance, <b>b)</b> <b>requested</b> guidance, c) distributed guidance, and d) denied guidance.

40|$|Hospitals {{around the}} country are {{struggling}} to provide timely access to inpatient beds. We use discrete event simulation to study the inpatient admission and discharge processes in US hospitals. Demand for inpatient beds comes from two sources: the Emergency Department (ED) and elective surgeries (NonED). <b>Bed</b> <b>request</b> and discharge rates vary from hour to hour; furthermore, weekday demand is different from weekend demand. We use empirically collected data from national and local (Massachusetts) sources on different-sized community and referral hospitals, demand rates for ED and NonED patients, patient length of stay (LOS), and bed turnover times to calibrate our discrete event simulation model. In our computational experiments, we find that expanding hours of discharge, increasing the number of days elective patients are admitted in a week, and decreasing length of stay all showed statistically significant results in decreasing the average waiting time for patients. We discuss the implications of these results in practice, and list the key limitations of the model...|$|R
