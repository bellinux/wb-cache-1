The Wabanaki Confederacy, which included the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes, also pre-dates European contact in the region.

Attainment of this designation is highly prized among all corpsmen. The enlisted fleet marine force warfare designation for hospital corpsmen is the only US Navy warfare device awarded solely by a US Marine Corps general officer.

2500|$|On January 1, 1989, South Florida's first network {{affiliation}} switch occurred, with NBC {{moving to}} WTVJ full-time and WSVN taking the Fox affiliation. Channel 7 had far fewer network shows to preempt as a result, as Fox only ran primetime programming on weekends {{at the time}} and would not air an entire week's worth of programming until 1993. As a result, WSVN was for essential intents and purposes programmed as a de facto independent station (even referring to itself as such in promotions regarding the switch, despite still being affiliated with a network). Until Fox began airing programming every weeknight, WSVN aired a movie in primetime at 8:00p.m. on nights where network programming was not scheduled to air. WSVN's affiliation with Fox could be seen as a major coup for the fledgling network, as WSVN had been a longtime NBC affiliate and Fox was pleased to affiliate with a station that had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Big Three" [...] network for years. At the time, WSVN was one of the largest heritage [...] "Big Three" [...] stations to join Fox. The combination of WSVN not following a similar pattern to other Fox affiliates at the time (which focused more on syndicated programming and movies, than news), and WCIX becoming a [...] "Big Three" [...] affiliate had also led then-struggling independent WDZL (channel 39, now CW affiliate WSFL-TV) to rise to a higher profile, as WDZL had picked up many shows that were formerly seen on WCIX (now WFOR-TV on channel 4). WSVN, meanwhile, picked up some of WCIX's movie packages, as well as a couple of cartoons that it aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings.|$|E

One sighting of Nelson, at 5.15pm, reported that she had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man who was [...] "very drunk" [...] and was being violent towards her, [...] "punching her on the head". Another witness said he saw Nelson walk past his garden in Newmains {{in the company of}} a man with a tattooed face. A third witness had seen Nelson and a man of similar appearance in Newmains, and said: [...] "He just looked angry," [...] punching a lamp post as he walked past and saying he was going to [...] "kill some cunt tonight." [...] One witness said he had overheard the man, who was [...] "angry and agitated," [...] saying that he would [...] "end up killing someone tonight." [...] Another witness heard him tell Nelson: [...] "This is all your fucking fault" [...] while pointing angrily in her face. A fourteen-year-old girl also saw the pair together [...] "boozing behind Newmains Asda." [...] She said he was bare-chested and sunburnt and told her his name was [...] "Rab Bayne" [...] and had [...] "asked me to rate his body, like out of ten." [...] She described how the pair were drinking alcohol that they claimed was stolen – the male drinking tequila and Nelson drinking vodka. A passer-by reported seeing Nelson with a man with a facial tattoo outside the Scotmid store in Newmains, where she was rubbing suntan lotion into his sunburned back which was [...] "red as a lobster". He said: [...] "She didn't look too happy. I thought it was a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. They must have got something in the shop, sun tan lotion, because as they were walking away the girl was rubbing something onto his shoulders." [...] A shirtless, sunburned man with a tattooed face was also seen [...] "wandering aimlessly" [...] in Cambusnethan on the evening of 22 May, attracting the attention of a family who had gathered to watch the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on television. One of the group said: [...] "What attracted attention was his hairstyle and his back was very, very red from the sun." [...] Police also received information that Robert Bayne had telephoned an acquaintance on 24 May and asked for help to [...] "batter" [...] the last people to see Nelson. Crucially, the call was made before the body had been identified. The witness said: [...] "He asked me to help him batter [...] I don't know why he said this because we didn't know it was Zoe who was found." ...|$|E
