5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying {{one night in}} 1823. Smith said that this angel {{revealed}} {{the location of a}} buried book made of golden plates, as well as other artifacts, including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> in a hill near his home. Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E
5|$|Outside of China, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} texts to mention gunpowder is Roger Bacon's Opus Majus (1267) and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as a reference to firecrackers. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. These claims have been disputed by science historians. The formula itself, claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> within the text through encryption, is not useful for firearm or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.|$|E
5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the game's 84 locations, deciding whether to ally themselves {{with one of the}} four factions or remain neutral. The game's plot concerns an apprentice Shaper and an Agent (whose name is Shanti), both members of a secretive sect of wizards who can create life by using their own life energy. They are sent on a mission to investigate a failing Shaper colony called Drypeak. When they arrive not all is well, the player becomes drawn into a four-way war which has <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> from the outside world.|$|E

In 2005, Serbian media reported he might <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in a Serbian Orthodox monastery in Irig or in Bijela, Montenegro. Nenad Čanak, the leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, claimed in 2006 that Hadžić <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in a monastery somewhere on Fruška mountain. At one point he was also rumoured to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in Belarus.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Matsui was executed, he was cremated and the US Army {{took away}} his ashes {{to prevent a}} {{memorial}} from being created. However, unbeknownst to them, some of the ashes had <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> by {{the owner of the}} crematorium. He later brought these ashes to the shrine Matsui had founded, the Koa Kannon, and they remain there to this day. In 1978, all seven war criminals executed by the IMTFE, including Iwane Matsui, were officially enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in a secret ceremony conducted by head priest Nagayoshi Matsudaira. This event did not become publicly known until the following year.|$|E

5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, {{as long as it}} is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have <b>been</b> <b>hidden.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|Halotus is {{primarily}} remembered for his suspected {{involvement in the}} conspiracy and poisoning of Emperor Claudius on 13 October (times of death are in dispute; see below) 54 AD. It is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, and the actual manner of the poisoning, in regards to which poison may have been used, in which food it could have <b>been</b> <b>hidden,</b> etc., remains unclear. It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was {{known to have been}} particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought to have been the most likely to have instigated the murder or to have been the lead conspirator in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had <b>been</b> <b>hidden.</b> Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E
5|$|The force {{reached the}} Bulganak River that day, where skirmishers found {{a force of}} Cossacks and Russian {{infantry}}, with a light battery of artillery. The infantry and artillery had <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> in {{a dip in the}} terrain while the British formed up, and their placement put the British cavalry in heavy danger. Raglan decided to withdraw, and sent a troop forward to cover the retreat; this body's confidence deceived the Russians into thinking that there was a larger British force than there was, and they failed to pursue the retreating cavalry. A day later, the British force, together with the French under General St Arnaud, defeated the Russians at the Battle of Alma. Nolan spent the battle as a liaison due to his fluent French, and was often galloping between the two allied armies. They resumed marching on 26 September and entered the plains of Balaclava, near Sevastopol.|$|E
5|$|Jill {{is later}} kidnapped by Colin, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} released from jail. He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, {{the meaning of the}} music box continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let go of it.|$|E
