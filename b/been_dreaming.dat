As {{a graduate student at}} Berkeley he assisted {{in the construction of the}} California Digital Computer project CALDIC. His graduate work led to eight patents. After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, Inc., to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> of since 1951.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster. Before she can leave the mall, a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She encounters Claudia, who hints about Heather's fate. Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version of the mall — monster-filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas, who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her. Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home. Having arrived at her residence, Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia, who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt like she had <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E

But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E
500|$|Banquo's {{status as}} a {{contrast}} to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ("Hold, take my sword... Take thee that too"). He also explains {{that he has been}} having trouble sleeping due to [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Alexandru Macedonski {{frequently}} {{changed his}} style and views on literary matters, {{a number of}} constants have been traced throughout his work.

[...] Traian Demetrescu too recalled that his mentor had <b>been</b> <b>dreaming</b> of becoming a visual artist, and had eventually settled for turning his son Alexis into one.
