50|$|More currently, the {{microbial}} loop {{is considered to}} be more extended (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003). Chemical compounds in typical bacteria (such as DNA, lipids, sugars, etc.) and similar values of C:N ratios per particle are found in the microparticles formed abiotically. Microparticles are a potentially attractive food source to bacterivorous plankton. If this is the case, {{the microbial}} loop can be extended by the pathway of direct transfer of dissolved organic matter (DOM) via abiotic microparticle formation to higher trophic levels. This has ecological importance in two ways. First, it occurs without carbon loss, and makes organic matter more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms, rather than only heterotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, abiotic transformation in the extended microbial loop depends only on temperature and the capacity of DOM to aggregate, while biotic transformation is dependent on its <b>biological</b> <b>availability</b> (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003).|$|E

This study characterises the main categories of critical issues in collecting available national utilisation data on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitors in different European countries. METHODS: Data were collected on characteristics {{of the nature of}} TNFalpha usage data and on usage of TNFalpha itself (2003 - 2007). Utilisation rates were expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) / 1000 inhabitants/day. Data from Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal were included. RESULTS: Characteristics of TNFalpha (usage settings and ways of distribution to patients) and databases (type of data collected, public availability and data sources) influenced the way data were collected and determined the type of research and policy questions that can validly be addressed. The prevailing differences in the structure of national databases are prohibitive for critical aspects of medicines utilisation studies. An increase in TNFalpha usage over time was observed in all countries and varied widely from 0. 32 (Portugal) to 1. 89 (Norway) DDDs/ 1000 inhabitants/day (2007). CONCLUSIONS: In the European countries studied data on national TNFalpha usage is not easily, if at all accessible. Intercountry collaboration and sharing of technical resources will facilitate harmonisation of data collection allowing independent, population based, health and outcomes research. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Such compounds will be incorporated differently into the food web, influencing primary (PP) and bacterial (BP) production, phytoplankton and zooplankton composition as well as food web efficiency (FWE), which are our 3 tested hypotheses. Riverine inflow was simulated by the addition of natural soil extracts (one from a southerly (Daugava) and one from a northerly (Öre) site on a daily basis to 2000 L indoor mesocosms (at Umeå Marine Sciences Centre).

Results showed that the input of soil matter from both sites created a lower PP:BP ratio, increased net heterotrophy in the systems, and in general resulted in changes to the phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition.

40|$|Some of the {{key factors}} that {{regulate}} growth and remodeling of tissues are fundamentally mechanical. However, {{it is important to}} take into account the role of bioavailability together with the stresses and strains in the processes of normal or pathological growth. In this sense, the model presented in this work is oriented to describe the growth of soft biological tissue under "stress driven growth" and depending on the <b>biological</b> <b>availability</b> of the organism. The general theoretical framework is given by a kinematic formulation in large strain combined with the thermodynamic basis of open systems. The formulation uses a multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient, splitting it in a growth part and viscoelastic part. The strains due to growth are incompatible and are controlled by an unbalanced stresses related to a homeostatic state. Growth implies a volume change with an increase of mass maintaining constant the density. One of the most interesting features of the proposed model is the generation of new tissue taking into account the contribution of mass to the system controlled through <b>biological</b> <b>availability.</b> Because soft biological tissues in general have a hierarchical structure with several components (usually a soft matrix reinforced with collagen fibers), the developed growth model is suitable for the characterization of the growth of each component.

Finally, we illustrate the response of the model in case of growth and atrophy with an application example. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

Experiment one was conducted to determine the Cu status of mature ewes fed two sources Of CU (CUS 04 VS CU proteinate) at one of three levels (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg). Ewes were fed a basal diet containing cottonseed hulls, cottonseed meal, and cracked corn at 2. 5 % BW to meet NRC requirements for protein, energy, macroninerals, and macrominerals excluding Cu. Ewes fed Cu proteinate had higher (P <. 05) ceruloplasmin (Cp) than those fed Cu sulfate (33. 2 VS 28. 2 []M/min/L). Feeding up to 30 mg/kg Cu from these sources did not cause an observable Cu toxicity during the 73 -d period. These data support the hypothesis that Cu from Cu proteinate and Cu sulfate have different <b>biological</b> <b>availabilities.</b> The primary goal of experiment two was to observe the effects of Cu deprivation in ewes during gestation on the thermogenic capabilities of neonate lambs.

Ewes fed low-Cu diets received an oral drench containing ammonium tetrathiomolybdate beginning 2 mo prior to parturition.
