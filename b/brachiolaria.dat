"It {{is obvious}} that my {{hypothesis}} is apparently very similar to Darwin's, inasmuch as I also consider that {{the various forms of}} animals have proceeded directly from one another. My hypothesis of the creation of organisms by heterogeneous generation, however, is distinguished very essentially from Darwin's by the entire absence of the principle of useful variations and their natural selection: and my fundamental conception is this, that a great plan of development lies at the foundation of the origin of the whole organic world, impelling the simpler forms to more and more complex developments. How this law operates, what influences determine the development of the eggs and germs, and impel them to assume constantly new forms, I naturally cannot pretend to say; but I can at least adduce the great analogy of the alternation of generations. If a Bipinnaria, a <b>Brachiolaria,</b> a Pluteus, is competent to produce the Echinoderm, which is so widely different from it; if a hydroid polype can produce the higher Medusa; if the vermiform Trematode 'nurse' can develop within itself the very unlike Cercaria, it will not appear impossible that the egg, or ciliated embryo, of a sponge, for once, under special conditions, might become a hydroid polype, or the embryo of a Medusa, an Echinoderm." ...|$|E
40|$|Salinity {{fluctuations}} {{are expected}} to become increasingly frequent in the Salish Sea due to glacial melting caused by global warming. Pisaster ochraceus, a keystone predator of the intertidal zone will be especially affected by these fluctuations since they lack the ability to ion- or osmo-regulate. We examined the impact of prior exposure to low salinity {{and the presence of}} a food patch on the behavior of P. ochraceus larvae in a halocline. In the gastrula stage, P. ochraceus larvae were split into a low salinity treatment (reared in 20 - 22 ‰ filtered sea water) and a control treatment (reared in 30 - 32 ‰ filtered sea water). In the first experiment, bipinnariae were introduced into the top or bottom of 20 / 30 haloclines. In the second experiment <b>brachiolariae</b> were introduced into control columns with and without the algae Isochrysis galbana, and into 20 / 30 haloclines with and without I. galbana patches at the halocline. The halocline posed a major barrier to larval vertical migration, especially for the younger bipinnaria stage. Low salinity larvae changed their distribution in the water column at a much slower rate than control larvae, indicating that they may have impaired swimming abilities. <b>Brachiolariae</b> from the controls aggregated in the halocline when a food patch was present but those from low salinity swam right through the food patch {{to the top of the}} column. Lowered salinity in the Salish Sea could result in larvae arriving in unsuitable habitats since their different vertical distribution in the water column may result in currents carrying them to unsuitable habitats. Smaller adult P. ochraceus populations in the rocky intertidal could result in drastic changes to the ecosystem including a reduction in species diversity...|$|R
40|$|Sea star larvae (Echinodermata: Asteroidea), {{collected}} from the subtropical Northwest Atlantic Ocean, exhibited three distinct modes of asexual reproduction. A number of different bipinnariae and <b>brachiolariae</b> reproduced by paratomous cloning of the posterolateral arms. This morphogenesis was identical to that of larvae assignable to the genus Luidia. A second mode of asexual reproduction involves the autotomization of an anterior portion of the preoral lobe. Primary larvae with preoral lobes of varying sizes and free-swimming preoral lobes of various stages of morphological development were simultaneously collected. The free-swimming preoral lobes developed complete digestive systems and ultimately assumed the form of typical bipinnaria larvae. Asexual reproduction by larvae may also {{take the form of}} budding. The released individual is either a blastula- or gastrulastage embryo. Subsequent development to a bipinnariastage secondary larva, {{with the possible exception of}} coelom formation, appears to occur through the events associated with normal larval development. These diverse methods of asexual propagation provide a common mechanism to increase the length of larval life and amplify the number of individuals. Thus asexual reproduction by larvae should increase the likelihood of genet representation in the next generation. Originally published in Biological Bulletin and used with permission...|$|R

50|$|By Day 1 {{the embryo}} has hatched as a ciliated {{gastrula}} stage (photograph). By Day 2 the gut is complete and the larva {{is now known}} as a bipinnaria (photographs). It has ciliated bands along the body and uses these to swim and filter feed on microscopic particles, particularly unicellular green flagellates (phytoplankton). The SEM photograph is a scanning electron micrograph, which clearly shows the complex ciliated bands of the bipinnaria larva. By Day 5 it is an early <b>brachiolaria</b> larva. The arms of the bipinnaria have further elongated, there are two stump-like projections in the anterior (not evident in the photograph) and structures are developing within the posterior of the larva. In the late <b>brachiolaria</b> larva (Day 11)(photograph) the larval arms are elongate and there are three distinctive arms at the anterior with small structures on their inner surfaces (photographs). To this stage the larva has been virtually transparent, but the posterior section is now opaque with the initial development of a starfish. The late <b>brachiolaria</b> is 1-1.5 mm. It tends to sink to the bottom and test the substrate with its brachiolar arms, including flexing the anterior body to orient the brachiolar arms against the substrate.|$|E
50|$|A bipinnaria is {{the first}} stage in the larval {{development}} of most starfish, and is usually followed by a <b>brachiolaria</b> stage.

50|$|The <b>brachiolaria</b> {{develops}} {{from the}} bipinnaria larva when the latter grows three short arms at {{the underside of}} its anterior end.

50|$|In Florida, Echinaster echinophorus spawns in {{late spring}} and early summer.

5000|$|Cryptasterina hystera is a hermaphrodite; the gonads {{can produce}} both sperm and eggs and {{are known as}} ovotestes.

50|$|The eggs of Asterina gibbosa {{are laid}} {{in a mass}} and glued to the {{substrate}} by their jelly-like coating.

Later the mouth of the juvenile starfish develops and it is able to start feeding.|$|E
5000|$|Starfish {{commonly}} reproduce using {{a method}} called free-spawning. This {{means that they}} release their gametes into the water, where they will hopefully be fertilized by the gamete from the opposite sex. It is thought that groups, when {{they are ready to}} spawn, use environmental signals to coordinate their timing. Once fertilization has occurred the egg develops from an embryo into a larva which feeds on small algae. During its planktic period the larva proceeds through several developmental phases going from gastrula to bipinnaria to <b>brachiolaria.</b> Towards {{the end of the last}} stage the larva develops a large sack like structure, a primordium, and begins searching for a suitable surface on which to settle.|$|E
50|$|Fertilization {{rates were}} high for all gamete combinations, thus no {{evidence}} of gamete incompatibility between the species was noted. The larvae were reared according to the methods employed for A. planci and developed through the typical larval stages of bipinnaria and <b>brachiolaria.</b> Numbers of late-stage larvae were 10-29% of the original numbers of eggs, except for the A. brevispinus batch in which only a few normal late <b>brachiolaria</b> were seen. The subsequent development of the A planci batch and reciprocal hybrid batches followed the typical pattern of A. planci. There was settlement and metamorphosis into a five-armed starfish, 0.4-1 mm in diameter. They fed on encrusting algae. Many failed to develop normally, and six weeks after metamorphosis, 60 A. planci, 30 A. planci hybrids, six A. brevispinus hybrids, and no A. brevispinus starfish remained. It was impossible to distinguish the hybrids from A. planci during {{the early months of}} development, but when the hybrids were 200 mm in diameter, they were conspicuously different from this species. Hybrids showed intermediate features between the parent species. Spines were the immediately obvious feature, being intermediate in length between the species. In other features that distinguish A. planci and A. brevispinus, the hybrids were intermediate. The hybrids were variable, but no consistent {{differences were found between the}} two hybrids. Juvenile A. planci animals tended to have a 'bull's-eye' pattern on their aboral disks and this persisted in some adults. One of three adult A. brevispinus hybrids showed this pattern. None of the 12 adult A. planci hybrids showed it. None of the hybrids showed the pale marks between the bases of the arms that are characteristic of A. brevispinus.|$|E
5000|$|L. ciliaris breeds {{in early}} summer. Each female {{releases}} millions of eggs {{into the water}} column and this stimulates the release of sperm by the males. About four days after fertilisation, the zygotes develop into bipinnaria larva which form part of the plankton. After several moults the seven arms can be seen developing in {{what is called the}} [...] "rudiment" [...] which is connected to a stalk which has several bands of cilia. The larva reaches a length of thirty-five millimetres in 3 to 4 months. It does not become a <b>brachiolaria</b> larva {{as is the case in}} most sea star taxa. Instead, it settles on the sea bed and metamorphosis takes place. Functional tube feet appear in the juvenile before the larval tissue is fully reabsorbed.|$|E
50|$|Astropecten scoparius mostly breeds between June and August. Both {{females and}} males {{liberate}} gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place. The bipinnaria larvae that hatch from the eggs are planktonic. They are bilaterally symmetrical and have a pair of body processes, a gut and two bands of cilia which are used for swimming. They feed and grow but do not pass through a <b>brachiolaria</b> stage as do most starfish larvae. After about eighteen days they settle on the seabed where they undergo metamorphosis. At this stage they become radially symmetrical, each one having a single central plate, a madreporite plate, five radial and five interradial plates, and five terminal plates which are the first stage {{in the development of}} the arms. A central mouth also develops on the oral (under) surface and the juvenile starts to feed.|$|E
5000|$|Odontaster validus takes 3 to 6 {{years to}} reach {{maturity}} but may live for 100 years.

Spawning takes place between May and September and may be linked to seasonal changes in light levels, sunrise taking place in McMurdo Sound in August. The larval development is also slow with the first, bipinnaria, stage lasting 2 months. The larvae remain near the seabed during this time but become pelagic for up to 6 months as <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae which allows them to disperse widely. They then return to the seabed, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juvenile starfish.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are {{separate}} in Cryptasterina pentagona, {{and it has}} the typical life cycle of a broadcast spawner. This involves the release by the female of buoyant, golden, yolky eggs, which are fertilised externally, and the development of <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae. At first these rise to the surface but as they further develop, they sink to the seabed. Here they explore the surface with their rays before deciding on a suitable spot for metamorphosis. Now about nine days old, they attach themselves to the substrate with an adhesive disc. After a complex rearrangement of tissues during metamorphosis, they detach themselves and crawl away as miniature, five-rayed starfish. These new juveniles have two pairs of tube feet on each ray and are an amber colour, indicating that they still have yolk reserves on which to feed. Their mouths do not open for a further three weeks and by that time they have used up the maternal food reserves and the colour has gone.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} of the breeding behaviour of Leptasterias tenera at Block Island near Rhode Island {{at a site}} about 30 m deep where the sea floor was fine muddy sand. The area was dominated {{by the presence of}} tube-building amphipods and there were some bivalve molluscs. Leptasterias tenera was the most numerous predatory species but also present were other starfish Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens and the Jonah crab Cancer borealis. Up to twelve Leptasterias tenera were found per square metre (ten per square yard). Examination of the stomach contents showed that the main items of diet were the numerous amphipods. Breeding took place in the winter. The eggs were large and yolky and few in number. The fertilised eggs were at first retained within the pyloric stomach of the female where the embryos underwent the first stages of their development. Later they emerged and the <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae were brooded underneath the arched disc of the starfish. The breeding season lasted about four months but it was unclear for how long any individual female brooded her young. While brooding, feeding either stopped or was restricted but a few brooding females were found to have prey items in their pyloric stomachs.|$|E
50|$|The late <b>brachiolaria</b> search {{substrates}} {{with their}} arms and, when offered a choice of substrates, tend to settle on coralline algae, which they will subsequently feed on. In the classic pattern for echinoderms, the bilaterally symmetrical larva {{is replaced by a}} pentamerously symmetrical stage at metamorphosis, with the latter's body axis bearing no relationship to that of the larva. Thus the newly metamorphosed starfish are five-armed and are 0.4-1 mm diameter. (Note the size of the tube feet relative {{to the size of the}} animal.) They feed on the thin coating layers of hard encrusting algae (coralline algae) on the undersides of dead coral rubble and other concealed surfaces. They extend their stomach over the surface of the encrusting algae and digest the tissue, as in the feeding by larger crown-of-thorns starfish on hard corals. The living tissue of the encrusting algae is approximately pink to dark red and feeding by these early juveniles results in white scars on the surface of the algae (photograph). During the next months, the juveniles grow and add arms and associated madreporites in the pattern described by Yamaguchi until the adult numbers is attained 5-7 months after metamorphosis. Two hard corals with small polyps, Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora acunimata, were included in the aquaria with the encrusting algae and at about the time the juvenile starfish achieved their full number of arms they began feeding on the corals.|$|E

The morphology of the coeloms in a late <b>brachiolaria</b> larva of an asteroid has application in the search for morphological homology between the echinoderm classes and the deuterostome phyla. ***** Late <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae of P. exigua were fixed seven days after fertilization in 2. 5 % (v/v) glutaraldehyde in filtered sea water for 1 - 2 hours, dehydrated in an ethanol series to 100 % ethanol, then cleared in 2 : 1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol.

40|$|Neuropeptides are {{an ancient}} class of {{neuronal}} signaling molecules that regulate {{a variety of}} physiological and behavioral processes in animals. The life cycle of many animals includes a larval stage(s) that precedes metamorphic transition to a reproductively active adult stage but, {{with the exception of}} Drosophila melanogaster and other insects, research on neuropeptide signaling has hitherto largely focused on adult animals. However, recent advances in genome/transcriptome sequencing have facilitated investigation of neuropeptide expression/function in the larvae of protostomian (e. g. the annelid Platynereis dumerilii) and deuterostomian (e. g. the urochordate Ciona intestinalis) invertebrates. Accordingly, here we report the first multi-gene investigation of larval neuropeptide precursor expression in a species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata - the starfish Asterias rubens. Whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization was used to visualize in bipinnaria and <b>brachiolaria</b> stage larvae the expression of eight neuropeptide precursors: L-type SALMFamide (S 1), F-type SALMFamide (S 2), vasopressin/oxytocin-type, NGFFYamide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone-type, gonadotropin-releasing hormone-type, calcitonin-type and corticotropin-releasing hormone-type. Expression of only three of the precursors (S 1, S 2, NGFFYamide) was observed in bipinnaria larvae but by the <b>brachiolaria</b> stage expression of all eight precursors was detected. An evolutionarily conserved feature of larval nervous systems is the apical organ and in starfish larvae this comprises the bilaterally symmetrical lateral ganglia, but only the S 1 and S 2 precursors were found to be expressed in these ganglia. A prominent feature of <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae is the attachment complex, comprising the brachia and adhesive disk, which mediates larval attachment to a substratum prior to metamorphosis. Interestingly, all of the neuropeptide precursors examined here are expressed in the attachment complex, with distinctive patterns of expression suggesting potential roles for neuropeptides in the attachment process. Lastly, expression of several neuropeptide precursors is associated with ciliary bands, suggesting potential roles for the neuropeptides derived from these precursors in control of larval locomotion and/or feeding. In conclusion, our findings provide novel perspectives on the evolution and development of neuropeptide signaling systems and neuroanatomical insights into neuropeptide function in echinoderm larvae...|$|E

It has also been proposed that non-particulate sources of nutrition (e. g. dissolved organic matter, DOM) may fuel part of the nutritional requirements of the larval development of A, planci as well. The present study addresses the ability of A, planci larvae to take up several DOM species and compares rates of DOM uptake to the energy requirements of the larvae. Substrates transported in this study have been previously reported to be transported by larval asteroids from temperate and antarctic waters. Transport rates (per larval A, planci) increased steadily during larval development and some substrates had among the highest mass-specific transport rates ever reported for invertebrate larvae.

The instantaneous metabolic demand for substrates by gastrula, bipinnaria and <b>brachiolaria</b> stage larvae could be completely satisfied by alanine concentrations of 11, 1. 6 and 0. 8 mu M, respectively. Similar rates were measured in this study for the essential amino acid leucine, with rates increasing from 11. 0 pmol larva(- 1) h(- 1) (or 9. 4 pmol mu g(- 1) h(- 1)) for gastrulas (J(max) (in) = 110. 5 pmol larva(- 1) h(- 1) or 94. 4 pmol mu g(- 1) h(- 1)) to 34. 0 pmol larva(- 1) h(- 1) (or 13. 0 pmol mu g(- 1) h(- 1)) for late <b>brachiolaria</b> (J(max) (in) = 288. 9 pmol larva(- 1) h(- 1) or 110. 3 pmol mu g(- 1) h(- 1)) at 1 mu M substrate concentrations.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{generally}} {{used to measure}} the adhesive strength of invertebrate larvae: direct measurement with a force transducer connected to the organisms and indirect measurement with a water flow used to dislodge the organisms. Each of these methods, however, has its drawbacks. The present study aimed to design a simple and straightforward method to measure the adhesion strength of marine invertebrate larvae based on centrifugation. This centrifuge technique works in immersed conditions and applies forces acting at 45 ° to the substratum, therefore mimicking natural conditions. It was tested with three different substrata on two developmental stages of the sea star Asterina gibbosa: the <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae, which use temporary adhesion, and the metamorphic individuals which use permanent adhesion. Measurements were completed by SEM and TEM observations of the larval adhesive organs. The critical detachment force (force required to detach 50 % of the larvae) of <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae attached to glass (36 ± 9  μN) and rough PMMA (43 ± 16  μN) were equivalent and both significantly higher than the critical detachment force measured on smooth PMMA (11 ± 8  μN). Most metamorphic individuals, on the other hand, resisted to the highest centrifugation speed used, corresponding to a force of 2. 13  mN. For the hydrodynamics of larval settlement and metamorphosis, force is the ecologically relevant factor, and adhesion forces obtained by centrifugation are strikingly similar to forces measured for other marine invertebrate larvae with other methods. This indicates the usefulness of the centrifugation technique to compare adhesion of larvae between different species or development stages, or between different treatments. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Like most {{coral reef}} organisms, crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) are {{expected}} to be highly vulnerable to predation as they transition from a planktonic larval phase to settling among reef habitats. Accordingly, crown-of-thorns starfish might be expected to exhibit behavioural adaptations which moderate exposure to predation at this critical stage in their life history. Using pairwise choice experiments and settlement assays, we explored the ability of competent larvae of Acanthaster cf. solaris to first detect and then actively avoid benthic predators during settlement. Pairwise choice experiments revealed that late stage <b>brachiolaria</b> larvae are able to detect predators in the substrate and where possible, will preferentially settle in microhabitats without predators. Settlement assays (without choices) revealed that larvae do not necessarily delay settlement in the presence of predators, but high levels of predation on settling larvae by benthic predators significantly reduce the number of larvae that settle successfully. Taken together, these results show that crown-of-thorns starfish are highly vulnerable to benthic predators during settlement, and that variation in the abundance of benthic predators may exert a significant influence on patterns of settlement for crown-of-thorns starfis...|$|E
