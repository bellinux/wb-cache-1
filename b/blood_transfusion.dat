5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundBlood transfusions {{can reduce}} {{mortality}} among children with severe malarial anaemia, {{but there is}} limited evidence quantifying the relationship between paediatric malaria and <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> This study explores {{the extent to which}} the use of paediatric <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> is affected by the number of paediatric malaria visits and admissions. It assesses whether the scale-up of malaria control interventions in a facility catchment area explains the use of paediatric <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> MethodsThe study was conducted at a referral hospital for 13 rural health centres in rural Zambia. Data were used from facility and patient records covering all paediatric malaria admissions from 2000 to 2008. An interrupted time series analysis using an autoregression-moving-average model was conducted to assess the relationship between paediatric malaria outpatient visits and admissions and the use of paediatric <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> Further investigation explored whether the use of paediatric <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> over time was consistent with the roll out of malaria control interventions in the hospital catchment area.

5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> was {{formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took {{a holiday}} and planned an autumn tour in America, {{scheduled}} to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen {{were involved in a}} serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Hergé was {{diagnosed}} with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week. On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir. In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation. In 1988, Tintin magazine was discontinued.|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} AAE among our patient cohort was {{bleeding}} requiring a <b>transfusion.</b> Although <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> are {{generally considered to}} be safe, numerous concerns still remain. <b>Blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> pose unique risks to the pediatric population. Specifically, the incidence of acute transfusion reactions, usually allergic in nature, is much higher for children than adults. Also, in sickle cell or oncology pediatric patients, iron overload syndrome is worrisome [21]. Thus, <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> in pediatric patients must be utilized cautiously with close monitoring.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Antigen {{pre-treatment}} {{in animals}} undoubt-edly prolongs graft survival.

5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections.

5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was {{appointed}} Minister of Health {{in the federal}} Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E
