By contrast, Unionists in Northern Ireland made the war {{a key part of}} their political narrative, emphasising their role in events such as the Battle of the Somme.

The split Democrats were soundly defeated for the presidency <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede.
