40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a six-variable VAR {{model and}} simulates generalized impulse response functions to assess dynamic interactions between <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> and stock prices and evaluate whether <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> {{play a role}} in transmitting financial shocks to the real sector. We find evidence that <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> react positively to the increase in stock prices but {{there seems to be no}} influence from <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> to stock prices. Similarly, <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> seem to accommodate expansion in real output with, again, no influence of <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> on real economic activity. Interestingly, despite the noted currency mismatch of bank assets and liabilities as a factor that aggravates the currency crisis, we find no evidence that the exchange rate fluctuations have impact on bank lending. If anything, the exchange rate seems to affect bank lending activities through its effects on real output and stock prices. From the dynamic responses, we tend to conclude that <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> play no significant role in transmitting stock market shocks to the real sector. An important implication from our analysis is that the health of the banking sector depends crucially on stock market stability and real output stability. Additionally, policy attempts to stimulate <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> as a way to boost stock market activities as well as to expand real activities may be futile. bank lending, stock prices, VAR, generalized impulse responses...|$|R
30|$|Different from {{firms in}} {{developed}} countries, Chinese firms mainly rely on <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> for debt financing. The choice of debt financing is largely {{affected by the}} accessibility of <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> (Wu and Yue, 2009). We find that managers {{are more likely to}} avoid ROE dilution related to debt-versus-equity choice when their performance-vested stock option plans are explicitly tied to ROE performance and when firms have a high level of access to <b>bank</b> <b>loans.</b> However, there is no such link when firms have a low level of access to <b>bank</b> <b>loans.</b> The results hold after controlling for potential endogeneity in executive compensation and corporate financing decisions.|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>Bank</b> <b>loans</b> are an {{important}} tool in a government’s financing toolkit. For purposes of this Best Practice, the term “bank loans ” includes fixed-rate loans with defined maturities and loans or lines of credit that have variable interest rates and flexible payment provisions. One potential advantage of <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> is that the process for execution of <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> generally is simpler than a bond issue that is marketed to the public market, with fewer issuance costs and ongoing compliance requirements. Additionally, <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> can often be structured {{in a manner that}} more closely conforms to specific project or repayment considerations than is the case with bond issues. However, because <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> are typically not executed in an environment that is as transparent as the bond market, an issuer may have limited ability to assess whether the proposed interest rate(s), fees and terms are consistent with reasonable market comparables. Governments should develop specific policies and procedures that address the proper legal and financial aspects of using <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> for their jurisdiction. Governments also should become familiar with the various types of terms used in these financial products. Governments need to know how <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> are characterized for legal and accounting purposes, including how they are treated in your financial statements, and what types of disclosures should be made about these loans. State and local laws should be reviewed to ensure these financings are within legal limits and the financing is characterized appropriately...|$|R

He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E

The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he {{wanted to build a}} larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added tax refund, NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK30 to 40 million in a <b>bank</b> <b>loan,</b> and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E

40|$|The {{access to}} finance is {{indispensable}} for the efficient allocation of capital and the enterprise development. However, when compared with large enterprises, small and medium enterprises face many difficulties when pursuing to procure financial resources. In Romania, the financial system is focused on <b>banks</b> so <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> have an overwhelming share from the resources of external finance for SMEs. However, these companies face many obstacles in terms of applying for <b>bank</b> <b>loans.</b> Thus, we may notice that some banks refuse to grant loans or increase interest rates for operational SMEs that do not offer adequate guarantees or {{do not have a}} credit history, because they have just started their activity or they have a degree of solvency that does not fall into the limits imposed by the banks in question. In crisis conditions, SMEs face increasing difficulties in contracting <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> because the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and the uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook causes banks to show a greater reluctance in lending to these enterprises. Our paper aims to highlight the main constraints faced by SMEs in accessing <b>bank</b> <b>loans,</b> the implications of the current crisis on SMEs' access to <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> and the measures taken by public authorities to support bank lending to these enterprises.

He took out a $10,000 <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges.

He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw nothing wrong with the book.|$|E

Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth.
