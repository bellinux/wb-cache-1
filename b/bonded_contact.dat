MHBS samples were first biaxially compressed to different deviator stress levels to model different in-situ stress conditions. With the deviator stress maintained at constant, the temperature was then raised to simulate the thermal recovery process or the pore water pressure (i. e. confining pressure for MH bond) was decreased to simulate the depressurization process. DEM simulation results showed that: during exploitation, the axial strain increased {{with the increase of}} temperature (in the thermal recovery method) or decrease of pore water pressure (in the depressurization method); sample collapsed during MH dissociation if the deviator stress applied was larger than the compression strength of a pure host sand sample; sample experienced volume contraction but its void ratio was slightly larger than the pure host sand sample at the same axial strain throughout the test. By comparison with the laboratory test results, the new model was validated to be capable of reproducing the exploitation process by thermal recovery and depressurization methods.

Few studies have assessed these modular implants quantitatively from a mechanical standpoint. Methods Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models were developed to mimic a hip implant alone (Construct A) and a hip implant-femur configuration (Construct B). <b>Bonded</b> <b>contact</b> was assumed for all interfaces to simulate long-term bony ongrowth and stability. The hip implants modeled were a Modular stem having two interlocking parts (Zimmer Modular Revision Hip System, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) and a Monoblock stem made from {{a single piece of}} material (Stryker Restoration HA Hip System, Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA). Axial loads of 700 and 2000 N were applied to Construct A and 2000 N to Construct B models. Stiffness, strain, and stress were computed. Mechanical tests using axial loads were used for Construct A to validate the FE model. Strain gages were placed along the medial and lateral side of the hip implants at 8 locations to measure axial strain distribution. Results There was approximately a 3 % average difference between FE and experimental strains for Construct A at all locations for the Modular implant and in the proximal region for the Monoblock implant. FE results for Construct B showed that both implants carried the majority (Modular, 76 %; Monoblock, 66 %) of the 2000 N load relative to the femur. FE analysis and experiments demonstrated that the Modular implant was 3 to 4. 5 times mechanically stiffer than the Monoblock due primarily to geometric differences.

40|$|Squirrel cage {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industrial applications such as in industrial drives, pumps, lathe machine and turbines due to its simple and rugged construction and low maintenance requirements. The rotor of the squirrel cage induction motor determines the motor torque and operational efficiency. Failures of the motor occur due to the failure in the rotor and its components. For designing of the rotor with good performance and mechanical durability the causes of those failures should be minimized. The main objective of this thesis is to study structural rigidity of squirrel cage rotor with different surface contact between the rotor components. The active part of squirrel cage rotor which is an assembly of the copper bar, end ring and shaft are simulated with the commercial finite element analysis software ANSYS Workbench 18. 0. Two designs of the rotors are introduced and with different surface contacts, the active parts are simulated and analyzed to investigate and obtain the research objectives.

40|$|Devoid of any science based evidence, {{the neck}} of dental {{implants}} was firstly chosen to be smooth. Recent finite element studies reveal that a smooth implant neck induces high stress peaks in bone at the retention elements. Implant threads were, therefore, extended to include the neck as well. In more recent applications of immediately loaded implant more retention, less micro-motion, and larger support areas are needed. Consequently, new implant designs presenting threaded neck with different thread sizes have been introduced. However. to date, such designs have not been realistically and satisfactorily tested. Therefore. {{the aim of this}} study is to compare the outcome of smooth neck and threaded neck designs in terms of stress distribution in bone as well as implant's micro motions. Axisymmetric 3 D models of an implant and the surrounding bone are developed on FEM software (ABAQUS). The models mimic smooth neck implant in addition to three different thread configurations (macro-thread and 2 different sizes of micro•threads). For each model, two simulations are carried out; one with regards of a fully osseointegrated implant (<b>bonded</b> <b>contact)</b> condition while the other concerns an immediately loaded implant (free contact) condition.

However, Von•Mises stresses in the cancellous bone did not change significantly (about 27 MPa). In the inunediale loading case, the Von•Mises stresses in the cortical bone in all threaded implants increased by a fold of 3 or more while it decreased in the cancellous bone by a factor of 2 or more, depending on the thread size.

40|$|Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) {{has grown}} rapidly {{during the past}} decade as part of {{mainstream}} processing method in submicron integrated circuit manufacturing because of its global or near-global planarization ability. However, CMP process is influenced by many factors and is poorly understood. It makes process control and optimization very difficult. This study focuses on the modeling and simulation to facilitate better understanding and better control of the CMP process. The thesis outlines the modeling of CMP process in three scales: particle scale for material removal mechanism, wafer scale for within wafer nonuniformity issues and feature scale for dishing and erosion in metal CMP.;At the particle scale, material removal mechanism is assumed to be due to local plastic deformation of wafer surface at the abrasive - wafer interface. Pad is assumed to deform like a beam to obtain an approximate force partition between abrasives and direct wafer-pad contact. A mechanistic material removal model is derived that delineates the influence of abrasive (shape, size and concentration), pad (rigidity) and process parameters (pressure and relative velocity) on the material removal rate (MRR).;Wafer scale model is based on the solution of indentation of elastic half space by a rigid frictionless polynomial punch. The elastic solution is derived through potential theory and complex analysis method. It is valid for any polynomial punch with integer power or non-integer power. The load-displacement relationship is also derived and the conditions for unbonded or <b>bonded</b> <b>contact</b> are obtained from the boundary condition at punch edge. The corresponding viscoelastic solution is obtained through Laplace transform and elastic-viscoelastic analogy. The elastic solution is used to explain the edge effect. The elastic analytical solution is first verified against numerical results from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation. It shows wafer curvature, indentation depth and load will influence the interface pressure distribution throughout the wafer surface and it introduces parameters control as a potential avenue for completely eliminating the within wafer nonumiformity. Viscoelastic solution is used to explain within wafer nonuniformity, i. e., edge effect and wafer to wafer nonuniformity, i. e., removal rate decay for unconditioned pad. The relationships among wafer-pad interface pressure, wafer shape and wafer loading condition are also investigated.;Feature scale model for dishing and erosion is based on Preston 2 ̆ 7 s relationship for material removal and constant downforce. It shows dishing will reach a limit and is governed by polishing conditions (overpolishing, pressure, velocity), slurry (selectivity), pad character istics (pad stiffness and bending ability), as well as wafer surface feature topography (pattern density, linewidth and pitch). This model is also valid for step height reduction when the same surface material is polished.;Due to process complexity and coupling of various parameters, more fundamental research needs to be carried out and carefully designed experiments need to be done to verify the models.

40|$|Risk {{management}} is increasingly used in dam safety and includes risk analysis, risk evaluation and risk reduction. Structural Reliability Analysis (SRA) is a probabilistic methodology {{that may be}} used in the risk assessment process. SRA has been frequently used for calibration of partial factors in limit state design codes for structures (not dams). In a reliability analysis a mathematical description of the failure mode, a limit state function, is defined. All parameters describing the limit state function should be random variables and are described by stochastic distributions (or, where appropriate, a deterministic value). The safety index (or probability of failure) may be determined by e. g. First Order Reliability Method and the result is compared to a target safety index to determine if the structure is safe enough. Several difficulties exists in the use of SRA for concrete dams, mainly {{due to the fact that}} only a few examples of such analysis for dams exist. One difficulty is how to define the failure modes. In this thesis a complete system of failure modes is identified, where failure is considered as a series system of “failure in the concrete part”, “failure in the concrete-rock interface” and “failure in the rock mass”. Failure in the concrete-rock interface may occur due to sliding or overturning. Sliding is the joint occurrence of sliding with a partially <b>bonded</b> <b>contact</b> (fails at very small displacement) and sliding with broken contact (fails at larger displacement) and both have to occur for sliding to occur, hence they are treated as a parallel system. Adjusted overturning is a combination of overturning and crushing of the concrete or crushing of the rock. A substantial part of the work has been to define the necessary input data. - Cohesion in the interface is very important. Due to the expected brittle failure in a partly intact interface, treatment of the shear resistance as a brittle parallel system is proposed. - Description of the headwater results in a series system; either failure occurs for water levels at retention water level (rwl) or for water levels above rwl, the latter described by an exponential distribution. - Uplift is one of the most important loads. A geostatistical simulation procedure is presented, where the hydraulic conductivity field of the foundation is described by a variogram and uplift is simulated by a FE-analysis. This methodology is demonstrated to be very useful and gives estimates of the statistical distribution of uplift. Three papers on this subject are included; the first is a description of the methodology, the second presents a sensitivity analysis performed for a large number of different combinations of input data and the last is an application to a Brazilian dam, where water pressure tests and monitoring results are available. In two papers SRA is applied to concrete dams and the system reliability is determined. In the first paper a spillway section where information of e. g. cohesion, friction angles etc. were available is analysed. In the last paper an idealized dam and a power intake structure are analysed. The conclusions are that SRA may be used for assessment of concrete dam stability and that it is well fitted for the dam safety risk management process. Every dam is a unique prototype and SRA enables specific behaviour and properties of a certain structure to be taken to consideration. The system reliability analysis is a very valuable tool in understanding the relationship between failure modes and enables the safety for the whole structure to be determined. In a reliability analysis the most important parameters may be identified and thus safety measures can be focused where it gives the best possible output. A general safety consideration is that development of the safety concept for concrete dams, from deterministic to probabilistic or semi-probabilistic, will give a known and more uniform level of safety...|$|E

Applying both transducer frequencies (100 kHz and 128 kHz), the goal was again to make thermosonic gold wire <b>bond</b> <b>contacts</b> reliably at 80 C process temperature. The results of the research project prove both objectives to be achieved. Evaluating long-term reliability tests, no significant differences to conventional wire <b>bond</b> <b>contacts</b> could be found. The project results can be transferred directly to regular manufacturing process without any delay because the research has already been done with automatic wire bond equipment. (orig.)
