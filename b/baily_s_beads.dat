40|$|Colour {{removal from}} phenplic {{industrial}} effluents by phenol oxidase enzymes and white-rot fungi was compared. Soluble laccase and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) removed colour from pulp mill (E), cotton mill hydroxide (OH) and cotton mill sulphide (S) effluents, but rapid and irreversible enzyme inactivation took place. Entrapment of laccase in alginate beads improved decolorization by factors of 3. 5 (OH) and 2 (E); entrapment of HRP improved decolorization by 36 (OH), 20 (E) and 9 (<b>S).</b> <b>Beads</b> were unsuitable for continuous use because the enzymes were rapidly released into solution. Co-polymerization of laccase or HRP with L-tyrosine gave insoluble polymers with enzyme activity. Entrapment of the co-polymers in gel beads further increased {{the efficiency of}} decolorization of E by 28 (laccase) and by 132 (HRP) compared with soluble enzymes. Maximum decolorization of all three effluents by batch cultures of Coriolus versicolor (70 %– 80 % in 8 days) was greater than the maximum enzymic decolorization (48 % of OH in 3 days by entrapped laccase). Soluble laccase (222 units ml− 1) precipitated 1. 2 g l− 1 phenol from artificial coal conversion effluent at pH 6. 0 {{and the rate of}} precipitation and enzyme inactivation was faster at pH 6. 0 than at pH 8. 5...|$|R

40|$|Intergeneric {{bacterial}} adherence {{is responsible}} for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to enable some extraneous bacteria to initially colonize the human oral cavity. Some current evidence indicates that Streptococcus sanguis, an early colonizer of teeth, enhances subsequent colonization by Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, a bacterium associated with advanced adult periodontitis. In this study, selected strains of P. gingivalis and S. sanguis were tested for their adherence activities in vitro. A differential filtration assay was devised in which one member of the test pair was radiolabeled. Heterogeneous aggregates that formed in mixed suspensions were collected on polycarbonate filters (8 -microns pore size) and were washed free of individual bacteria and small homologous clumps. P. gingivalis 381, W 50, JKG 7, and 33277 adhered to S. sanguis G 9 B, M 5, Challis 6, and 38. P. gingivalis A 7 A 1 - 28 did not adhere well to S. sanguis under these conditions. More precise measurements of intergeneric adherence were obtained with an alternative assay with radiolabeled P. gingivalis and an artificial dental plaque composed of S. sanguis coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads. CNBr-agarose was selected as the supporting matrix for the plaque because it was uniformly and permanently coated with S. sanguis and because P. gingivalis had negligible adherence activity for streptococcus-free beads. P. gingivalis W 50 grown to the early stationary phase adhered to <b>S.</b> sanguis-coated <b>beads</b> in higher numbers than either midlogarithmic- or late-stationary-phase cells. Intergeneric adherence was not inhibited or reversed by the presence of lactose or other monosaccharides or disaccharides. Pretreatment of either bacterium with trypsin or proteinase K reduced subsequent adherence by 86 to 100 %. Neuraminidase treatment of P. gingivalis caused 98 % reduction of adherence, whereas similar treatment of S. sanguis caused only a 2 % loss. Preincubation of P. gingivalis at 60 degrees C for 30 min decreased subsequent adherence to <b>S.</b> sanguis-coated <b>beads</b> by 94 %. Adherence was reduced by 96 % when bacteria were assayed while suspended in human whole saliva or when pretreated with saliva and subsequently assayed in buffer. The concentration of whole human saliva required to inhibit 50 % adherence in this assay was 23 micrograms per ml (1 : 200 dilution). Suspension of the bacteria in normal rabbit serum resulted in 94 % inhibition of adherence. These data indicate that saliva and serum may be important host defense factors for controlling Porphyromonas-Streptococcus adherence...|$|R

Traditional extraction techniques often produce poor lipid yields particularly from microalgae with robust cell walls. This project investigated the role of power ultrasound as a cell disruption step in lipid extraction from four microalgal species. Nile Red staining {{was used to assess}} the time when ultrasound induced increased membrane permeability in each species and lipids were extracted using an ultrasound assisted Bligh and Dyer extraction method. A 20 kHz probe system (40 % amplitude, 0. 086 W/cm 3) caused increased lipid recovery from dry biomass in all cases; D. salina (no cell wall) from 15 to 22. 5 % of dry biomass after 1 minute (26 % when stressed with 35 g/L NaCl). C. concordia (thin cell wall) from 7. 5 to 10. 5 % of dry biomass after 2 minutes (27 % with 25 % nitrogen reduction in growth media). N. oculata (thick cell wall) from 6. 5 to 10 % of dry biomass after 16 minutes (31. 5 % when stressed with 30 g/L NaCl). The stressed cultures yield could be improved to 35 % when ultrasound was combined with <b>S</b> 070 beating <b>beads.</b> Chlorella sp. (thick cell wall) from 6. 3 to 8. 7 % of dry biomass, after 16 minutes (44 % was achieved when harvested at day 9 instead of 15). A Dual Frequency Reactor (16 and 20 kHz, 0. 01 W/cm 3) flow system with <b>S</b> 070 <b>beads</b> demonstrated that high lipid extraction yields could be achieved on a larger level with N. oculata. After 4 : 48 minutes sonication 24 % lipid recovery was achieved. This system could theoretically increase daily microalgal oil production from 3. 96 to 5. 76 L per day when compared to conventional techniques, at an extra production cost of only 2. 9 p/litre (1. 5 % increase). D. salina, N. oculata and C. concordia resumed normal growth following sonication at 20 kHz after 1 - 20 days (8 minutes treatment for D. salina, 60 minutes treatment for N. oculata and 16 minutes treatment for C. concordia). It was found that the supernatant of sonicated D. salina and C. concordia when added to established cultures were able to boost their growth...|$|R
40|$|Bead beating’’ is {{commonly}} used to release DNA from cells for genomic studies but it was used here to prepare suspensions of plant nuclei for measurement of DNA amounts by flow cytometry. Plant material was placed in 2 -ml screw-capped tubes containing beads of zirconia/silica (2. 5 mm diameter) or glass (2. 5 or 1. 0 mm diameter) and 1 ml of lysis buffer. The tubes were mechanically shaken with an FP 120 FastPrep Cell Disrupter to release intact nuclei from plant tissue by {{the impact of the}} beads. The nuclei were then stained with propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The method was tested using fresh leaves, fresh petals and herbarium leaves of Rosa canina, leaves and pollen of R. rugosa, and fresh leaves of Petroselinum crispum, Nicotiana tabacum, and Allium cepa. Batches of 12 samples of fresh leaves were prepared, simultaneously, in 45 <b>s</b> by <b>bead</b> beating in the Cell Disrupter. In flow cytometry histograms, nuclei of fresh leaves gave G 1 /G 0 peaks with CVs of less than 3. 0 % and nuclei from fresh petals and herbarium leaves of R. canina, and pollen of the generative nuclei of R. rugosa gave peaks with coefficients of variation (CVs) of less than 4. 0 %. DNA amounts estimated from 24 -month-old herbarium leaves, using P. crispum as an internal standard, were less than those of fresh leaves by a small but significant amount. Suspensions of nuclei can be prepared rapidly and conveniently from a diversity of tissues by bead beating.

40|$|With the {{new concept}} of 'individualized {{treatment}} and targeted therapies', tumour tissue-associated biomarkers {{have been given}} a new role in selection of cancer patients for treatment and in cancer patient management. Tumour biomarkers can give support to cancer patient stratification and risk assessment, treatment response identification, or to identifying those patients who are expected to respond to certain anticancer drugs. As the field of tumour-associated biomarkers has expanded rapidly over the last years, it has become increasingly apparent that a strong need exists to establish guidelines on how to easily disintegrate the tumour tissue for assessment of the presence of tumour tissue-associated biomarkers. Several mechanical tissue (cell) disruption techniques exist, ranging from bead mill homogenisation and freeze-fracturing through to blade or pestle-type homogenisation, to grinding and ultrasonics. Still, only a few directives have been given on how fresh-frozen tumour tissues should be processed for the extraction and determination of tumour biomarkers. The PathoBiology Group of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer therefore has devised a standard operating procedure for the standardised preparation of human tumour tissue extracts which is designed for the quantitative analysis of tumour tissue-associated biomarkers. The easy to follow technical steps involved require 50 - 300 mg of deep-frozen cancer tissue placed into small size (1. 2 ml) cryogenic tubes. These are placed into the shaking flask of a Mikro-Dismembrator <b>S</b> machine (<b>bead</b> mill) to pulverise the tumour tissue in the capped tubes in the deep-frozen state by use of a stainless steel ball, all within 30 s of exposure. RNA is isolated from the pulverised tissue following standard procedures. Proteins are extracted from the still frozen pulverised tissue by addition of Tris-buffered saline to obtain the cytosol fraction of the tumour or by the Tris buffer supplemented with the non-ionic detergent Triton X- 100, and, after high-speed centrifugation, are found in the tissue supernatant. The resulting tissue cell debris sediment is a rich source of genomic DNA...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, a number of {{technologies}} have been described with the overall goal of profiling SH 2 domain binding sites (Table S 2). The {{strengths and weaknesses of}} the various approaches are outlined here and compared to the SH 2 Rosette strategy. MacBeath’s group developed a forward-phase assay using Microarrays In Microtiter plates (MIMs) technology, in which a virtually complete set of human SH 2 and PTB domains was immobilized in microarrays aligned with the wells of a 96 -well plate, thereby allowing simultaneous probing of multiple microarrays (Jones et al., 2006). Using synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites of EGF receptor family members, they quantitatively analyzed more than 5, 000 interactions with SH 2 and PTB domains. Panomics has introduced a conceptually similar membrane-based SH 2 domain macro-array with 34 SH 2 domains, and described its use for phosphorylated peptides, recombinant proteins and cell lysates (Panomics). Taking advantage of the Luminex fluorescent bead technology, this group also reported a forward-phase bead-based assay in which different SH 2 domains are conjugated to microspheres with distinct fluorophore labels. Unlike traditional pull-down experiments, where one immobilized SH 2 domain can be analyzed per assay, this format allows competitive binding conditions (SH 2 <b>s</b> on different <b>bead...</b>|$|R
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), {{particularly}} the USA 300 strain, {{is a highly}} virulent pathogen responsible for {{an increasing number of}} skin and soft tissue infections globally. Furthermore, MRSA-induced soft tissue infections can rapidly progress into life-threatening conditions, such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. The importance of neutrophils in these devastating soft tissue infections remains ambiguous, partly because of our incomplete understanding of their behaviour. Spinning disk confocal microscopy was used to visualize the behaviour of GR 1 -labelled neutrophils in subcutaneous tissue in response to GFP-expressing MRSA attached to a foreign particle (agarose bead). We observed significant directional neutrophil recruitment towards the <b>S.</b> aureus agarose <b>bead</b> but not a control agarose bead. A significant increase in neutrophil crawling within the capillaries surrounding the infectious nidus was noted, with impaired capillary perfusion in these vessels and increased parenchymal cell death. No neutrophils were able to emigrate from capillaries. The crawling within these capillaries was mediated by the β(2) and α(4) integrins and blocking these integrins 2 hours post infection eliminated neutrophil crawling, improved capillary perfusion, reduced cell death and reduced lesion size. Blocking prior to infection increased pathology. Neutrophil crawling within capillaries during MRSA soft tissue infections, while potentially contributing to walling off or preventing early dissemination of the pathogen, resulted in impaired perfusion and increased tissue injury with time...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is {{a central}} mediator of the immune response to pathogens, but may also exert neurotoxic effects, thereby contributing to immunopathology. To define the role of TNF {{during the course of}} brain abscess, TNF-deficient (TNF(0 / 0) mice were stereotaxically infected with Staphylococcus (<b>S.)</b> aureus-laden agarose <b>beads.</b> In comparison to 100 % survival of wild type (WT) mice, TNF(0 / 0) mice displayed high mortality rates (54 %) in the initial phase of abscess development as well as significantly increased morbidity {{in the course of the}} disease. The worse clinical outcome was due to an increased intracerebral (i. c.) bacterial load in TNF(0 / 0) mice as compared to WT mice. The impaired control of S. aureus was associated with reduced inductible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein expression in TNF(0 / 0) mice. Similarly, numbers of inflammatory leukocytes, cytokine expression of IL- 6, IL- 12 p 40, IFNgamma IL-beta mRNA, and brain edema were significantly increased in TNF(0 / 0) mice as compared to WT animals. In addition, resolution of i. c. infiltrates was delayed in TNF(0 / 0) mice correlating with reduced apoptosis of inflammatory leukocytes and formation of a fibrous abscess capsule. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TNF is of key importance for the control of S. aureus-induced brain abscess and regulates the ensuing host immune response...|$|R

Total RNA was extracted from subsurface sediments and interrogated directly, without a PCR step. Bead array validation studies with total RNA derived from 24 isolates indicated that the behavior and response of the 16 S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes could not be predicted based on the primary nucleic acid sequence. Likewise, signal intensity (absolute or normalized) {{could not be used}} to assess the abundance of one organism (or rRNA) relative to the abundance of another organism (or rRNA). Nevertheless, the microbial community structure and dynamics through time and space and as measured by the rRNA-targeted bead array were consistent with previous data acquired at the site, where indigenous sulfate- and iron-reducing bacteria and near neighbors of Desulfotomaculum were the organisms that were most responsive to a change in injected acetate concentrations. Bead array data were best interpreted by analyzing the relative changes in the probe responses for spatially and temporally related samples and by considering only the response of one probe to itself in relation to a background (reference) environmental sample. By limiting the interpretation of the data in this manner and placing {{it in the context of}} supporting geochemical and microbiological analyses, we concluded that ecologically relevant and meaningful information can be derived from direct microarra...|$|R
30|$|Biomass smoke {{exposure}} is also implicated in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection through several mechanisms, including alterations in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and/or upregulation of host surface receptors on the respiratory epithelium [102, 103]. In an in vitro study, the phagosomal function of wood smoke particle exposed human alveolar macrophages was tested {{with respect to}} uptake of fluorescently-labelled beads, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [102]. Wood smoke exposed macrophages demonstrated reduced phagocytosis of fluorescent <b>beads,</b> <b>S.</b> pneumoniae and M. tuberculosis with a negative linear correlation between macrophage particulate content and phagocytosis [104]. Furthermore, oxidative stress is believed to upregulate expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), and platelet activating factor receptors (PAFR) allowing attachment and invasion of respiratory bacteria, including S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are also important bacterial pathogens in COPD [105 – 107]. Although airway ICAM- 1 and PAFR expression were markedly upregulated in tobacco smokers and COPD patients, further studies are warranted to demonstrate the effect of biomass smoke exposure on inducing the expression of these host surface receptors [108 – 110]. Recently, KC et al. developed a method to generate batches of biomass smoke extracts that can be preserved for longer periods for use in multiple exposure experiments, thus minimizing inter-assay variation [103]. This will facilitate further research on mechanistic role of smoke extracts in the inflammatory response and the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases including COPD, lung cancer and LRI.|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional flow is {{considered}} in a fluid bead {{located in the}} gap between a pair of contra-rotating cylinders and bounded by two curved menisci. The stability of such bead flows with two inlet films, and hence no contact line, are analysed as the roll speed ratio S is increased. One of the inlet films {{can be regarded as}} an ‘input flux’ whilst the other is a ‘returning film’ whose thickness is specified as a fraction [zeta] of the outlet film on that roll. The flow is modelled via lubrication theory and for Ca [double less-than sign] 1, where Ca represents the capillary number, boundary conditions are formally developed that account for S [not equal] 1 and the non-constant gap. It is shown that there is a qualitative difference in the results between the single and double inlet film models unless small correction terms to the pressure drops at the interfaces are taken into account. Futhermore, it is shown that the inclusion of these small terms produces an O(1) effect on the prediction of the critical value of <b>S</b> at which <b>bead</b> break occurs. When the limits of the returning film fraction are examined it is found that as [zeta] [rightward arrow] 0 results are in good agreement with those for the single inlet film. Further it is shown for a fixed input flux that as [zeta] [rightward arrow] 1 a transition from bead break to upstream flooding of the nip can occur and multiple two-dimensionally stable solutions exist. For a varying input flux and fixed and ‘sufficiently large’ values of [zeta] there is a critical input flux &[lambda]macr;([zeta]) such that as S is increased from zero: (i) bead break occurs for [lambda] &[lambda]macr;; (iii) when [lambda] = &[lambda]macr; the flow becomes neutrally stable at a specific value of S beyond which there exist two steady solutions (two-dimensionally stable) leading to bead break and upstream flooding, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Applications of {{lead and}} {{strontium}} isotope analysis {{were made on}} archaeological materials from three different contexts in both the Old and New Worlds. These materials comprised pre-Hispanic glaze painted ceramics from Arizona, U. <b>S.</b> A., glass <b>beads</b> from late first millennium AD Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria, and copper-based metals from early first millennium AD Kissi, Burkina Faso. All materials contain lead at major, minor, or trace concentrations, and lead isotope analysis was employed to determine a provenance for that lead. Strontium isotope analysis also was applied to glass beads from Igbo-Ukwu to determine provenance(s) for strontium found in the glass. Furthermore, application of elemental composition analysis was or had been employed on all samples for additional data comparisons within assemblages and with comparable archaeological materials. Results of these analyses determined, in most cases, regional provenance with high degrees of confidence for lead contained in the analyzed samples. Strontium and elemental composition analysis data also proved valuable in confirming the regional provenance of the raw glass used to produce the glass beads. Leads in the glaze paints from Arizona, which demonstrated a range of resources exploitation, were confidently restricted to a few regions for their procurement. Likewise leads in most glass beads from Igbo-Ukwu were confidently restricted to two main source regions, with a third strong contender also being identified. The elemental composition and strontium isotope data determined with confidence the production regions for the primary raw glasses {{used to make the}} glass beads. Finally, leads in copper-based metals from Burkina Faso also were restricted to a few regions, although some inconclusiveness in provenance determination was attributed to mixing of metals from difference sources. These results confirm the utility of heavy isotope analysis of archaeological materials for provenance determination. The combination of these data with elemental composition analyses further confirm the interpretive strength of combining independent but related sets of analytical data for exploring questions of archaeological provenance. With improvements in instrument technology and application in the past two decades, very high precision and high accuracy analyses can be made which eliminate some earlier concerns of heavy isotope applications in archaeology...|$|R
