5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 61, West became romantically {{involved}} {{with one of}} the muscle men in her Las Vegas stage show, wrestler, former Mr. California, and former merchant marine Chester Rybinski. He was 30 years younger than West, and later changed his name to Paul Novak. He soon moved in with her, and their romance continued until West's death in 1980 at age 87. Novak once commented, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> put on this Earth to take care of Mae West." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the other}} quarter-finals McCulloch {{defeated}} Maguire 5–2 after an error from Maguire, when {{he missed the}} pink for a probable 2–0 lead. The match included a 137 clearance from McCulloch. After the match Maguire said [...] "I went for a crazy one and paid the price but I think today I was just a bit too cocky. I didn't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to lose." [...] Judge beat Perry 5–1 to face McCulloch in his first ranking event semi-final, and became the fourth Irish player to achieve this feat after Eugene Hughes, Doherty and Fergal O'Brien.|$|E
2500|$|Compton was {{evacuated}} {{for severe}} trench foot; Stephen E. Ambrose concluded that Compton witnessing the carnage involving {{two of his}} closest friends, Joe Toye and William Guarnere [...] "unnerved" [...] him. Compton wrote in his autobiography, [...] "...although I was affected by the horrors of Bastogne, I do not <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> clinically shell shocked, as the series portrays me. In real life, while I was hollering for the medic, {{trying to figure out}} what to do, I remember two distinct thoughts: How are we going to help the wounded guys?...Maybe this is the time the Germans are really going to get us all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael {{stated that}} his early fantasies were about women, which [...] "led me to <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{on the path}} to heterosexuality", but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said [...] "had {{something}} to do with my environment". At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley and close friends that he was bisexual. Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised by friends not to tell his parents about his sexuality. In a 1999 interview with The Advocate, Michael told the Editor in Chief, Judy Wieder, that it was [...] "falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality".|$|E
2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I {{thought she was going to}} be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1975, he {{audition}}ed for the Broadway play A Matter of Gravity. Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her character's grandson in the play. With Hepburn's {{influence over the}} CBS network, Reeve worked out the schedules of Love of Life and the play {{so that he would}} be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals, and suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition. On the first night of the play's run, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, [...] "This boy's a goddamn fool. He doesn't eat enough red meat." [...] The understudy finished the play for him, and Reeve was treated by a doctor who advised him to eat a more healthy diet. He stayed with the play throughout its year-long run and was given very favorable reviews. He and Hepburn became very close. She said, [...] "You're going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age." [...] He replied, [...] "I can't wait that long." [...] A romance between the two was rumored in some gossip columns. Reeve said, [...] "She was sixty-seven and I was twenty-two, but I thought that was quite an honor...I <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her." [...] Reeve said that his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in 1976, Reeve— to Hepburn's disappointment— dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play's run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer instead of just sending messages back and forth.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, she {{released}} [...] "Jikele" [...] as the album's third single. Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana. Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. She came into the competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. All I knew was that I started getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to have twins." ...|$|E
