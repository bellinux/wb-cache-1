6000|$|I {{have not}} met with any notice {{of one of}} these MAN-LIKE APES of earlier date than that {{contained}} in Pigafetta's 'Description of the Kingdom of Congo,' [1] drawn up from the notes of a Portuguese sailor, Eduardo Lopez, and published in 1598. The tenth chapter of this work is entitled [...] "De Animalibus quae in hac provincia reperiuntur," [...] and contains a brief passage to the effect that [...] "in the Songan country, on the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Zaire,</b> there are multitudes of apes, which afford great delight to the nobles by imitating human gestures." [...] As this might apply to almost any kind of apes, I should have thought little of it, had not the brothers De Bry, whose engravings illustrate the work, thought fit, in their eleventh 'Argumentum,' to figure two of these [...] "Simiae magnatum deliciae." [...] So much of the plate as contains these apes is faithfully copied in the woodcut (Fig. 1), and it will be observed that they are tail-less, long-armed, and large-eared; and about the size of Chimpanzees.|$|R
