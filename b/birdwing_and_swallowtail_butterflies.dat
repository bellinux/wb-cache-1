50|$|Clarke {{answered}} an advert in {{an insect}} magazine for <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterfly</b> pupae {{that had been}} placed by Philip Sheppard. They met and began working together in their common interest of lepidoptery. From 1959 they started running a moth trap in Caldy Common near West Kirby, Wirral, England. They studied the peppered moth, the scarlet tiger moth <b>and</b> <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterfly.</b> They published papers on the genetics of Lepidoptera and also on Rh disease. Clarke continued research in his retirement and in 1988 he rediscovered a scarlet tiger moth colony on the Wirral Way, West Kirby, that had been started in 1961 by Philip Sheppard. The colony was useful for study of the genetics of changes in populations.|$|R
40|$|Central to many {{explanations}} of latitudinal diversity gradients {{is the idea}} that rates of species diversification increase towards the equator. However, there have been few explicit tests of whether or not this pattern exists. Using sister-group analyses to compare 48 clades of passerine birds <b>and</b> <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> from different latitudes, I found evidence that relative rates of diversification per unit time are indeed higher towards the equator. This pattern is explicable in terms of abiotic factors which vary continuously with latitude, and may be further enhanced by diversity-dependent speciation and extinction processes...|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} Trelawny {{is part of}} the Cockpit Country, and is uninhabitable. It is therefore a natural reserve for flora and fauna; most of Jamaica's 27 endemic bird species can be found there, along with yellow snakes, <b>and</b> the giant <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterfly,</b> the largest butterfly in the western hemisphere.|$|R
40|$|According to theory, homoploid hybrid {{speciation}}, {{which is}} hybrid speciation without {{a change in}} chromosome number, is facilitated by adaptation to a novel or extreme habitat. Using molecular and ecological data, {{we found that the}} alpine-adapted butterflies in the genus Lycaeides are the product of hybrid speciation. The alpine populations possess a mosaic genome derived from both L. melissa and L. idas and are differentiated from and younger than their putative parental species. As predicted, adaptive traits may allow for persistence in the environmentally extreme alpine habitat and reproductively isolate these populations from their parental species. Homoploid hybrid speciation is character-ized by hybridization between parentalspecies that results in a derivative hybrid species without a change in chromosome number (1 – 6). A growing list of possible examples, such as African cichlids (7), cyprinid fishes (8), Rhagoletis fruit flies (9), Heliconius <b>butterflies</b> (10), <b>and</b> <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> (11), suggest that homoploid hybrid speciation in animals may be more common than previously thought.

5000|$|Popular with fishermen, Rattlesnake Creek hosts bull trout, {{cutthroat}} trout, {{and mountain}} whitefish. Along the trail, green comma <b>and</b> western tiger <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> may be found, amongst others. Mammals which frequent the National Recreation Area include elk, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, and grizzly bear. Birdwatchers visiting the Rattlesnake may find over forty bird species including pileated woodpecker, great grey owl, ruffed grouse, and American dipper. Visitors should exercise caution, for black bear and mountain lion frequent the area.|$|R
50|$|The Aristolochia genera {{are known}} for fly {{pollination}} and are similar to other pitcher plants and flytraps. The main difference is that those plants digest the insects for nutrients, while the Aristolochia use them mainly for pollination. Every part of the plant is also poisonous if ingested by humans or animals. Caterpillars <b>and</b> the <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterfly</b> actually feed on the leaves, flowers, and shoots of the plant. Caterpillars can especially tolerate the acids contained within the plant and, in turn, cause them to become poisonous to predators. The plant is also zygomorphic and usually has foetid flowers to attract pollinators (flies) while repelling predators. The aroma of the flower especially helps with its survival.|$|R
50|$|Larva: Larvae {{are very}} similar to those of O. richmondia, with {{colouration}} varying from light to dark grey. Food plants known to be utilised by the larvae are Aristolochia acuminata, A. indica, A. pubera, A. thoszetti, Pararistolochia australopithecurus, P. deltantha and P. sparusifolia. The leaves of the introduced Dutchman's pipe (Aristolochia littoralis) will kill the larvae of this species <b>and</b> several other <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> in Australia. Consequently, it is discouraged to plant Dutchman's pipe in Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.|$|R
50|$|The broad is {{situated}} {{just off the}} river and attracts little through traffic. It lies south of Hoveton Great Broad and approximately half a mile north of the village of Salhouse. Salhouse Broad is accessible from the landward side and moorings are also permitted to fee-paying boat visitors. It is privately owned and managed {{in conjunction with the}} community of Salhouse. The broad covers an area of 32 acre and is home to many forms of wildlife including the Norfolk hawker dragonfly <b>and</b> the <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterfly.</b> Black swans have been recorded on this broad. Salhouse Broad is unusual in being the result of the flooding of tenth century sand and gravel diggings, not of peat diggings like most of the broads.|$|R
5000|$|Callawassie's {{butterfly}} garden, on {{the southeast}} corner of Callawassie Drive and South Oak Forest Drive, was expanded and replanted in 2010. It provides a colorful floral display from spring through late fall. The 6500-square-foot garden contains a variety of host and nectar plants to support butterflies throughout their life cycle. Caterpillars feed on host plants such as milkweed, parsley, butterfly weed, and snapdragons. Nectar plants in the garden include butterfly bushes, shasta daisies, zinnias, Joe Pye weed, yarrows, lantanas, sages, abelias, bee balm, and a vitex tree. Other plantings provide color to attract butterflies. Frequent visitors to the garden include monarch, swallowtail, little sulphur, cloudless sulphur, <b>and</b> tiger <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies.</b> In 2011, the garden was certified by the North American Butterfly Association as a garden [...] "that provides resources to increase the world's population of butterflies." ...|$|R
40|$|The daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) and nightlily (H. citrina) {{are typical}} {{examples}} of a butterfly-pollination system and a hawkmoth-pollination system, respectively. H. fulva has diurnal, reddish or orange-colored flowers and is mainly pollinated by diurnal <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies.</b> H. citrina has nocturnal, yellowish flowers with a sweet fragrance and is pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths. We evaluated the relative roles of flower color and scent on the evolutionary shift from a diurnally flowering ancestor to H. citrina. We {{conducted a series of}} experiments that mimic situations in which mutants differing in either flower color, floral scent or both appeared in a diurnally flowering population. An experimental array of 6 × 6 potted plants, mixed with 24 plants of H. fulva and 12 plants of either F 1 or F 2 hybrids, were placed in the field, <b>and</b> visitations of <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> nocturnal hawkmoths were recorded with camcorders. <b>Swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> preferentially visited reddish or orange-colored flowers and hawkmoths preferentially visited yellowish flowers. Neither <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterflies</b> nor nocturnal hawkmoths showed significant preferences for overall scent emission. Our results suggest that mutations in flower color would be more relevant to the adaptive shift from a diurnally flowering ancestor to H. citrina than that in floral scent...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} in pupal colour {{occurs in}} three families of butterflies (the Nymphalidae, Papilionidae and Pieridae), typically in species whose pupation sites vary unpredictably in colour. In all species studied to date, larvae ready for pupation respond to environmental cues {{associated with the}} colour of their pupation sites and moult into cryptic light (yellow–green) or dark (brown–black) pupae. In nymphalids and pierids, pupal colour is controlled by a neuroendocrine factor, pupal melanization-reducing factor (PMRF), the release of which inhibits the melanization of the pupal cuticle resulting in light pupae. In contrast, the neuroendocrine factor controlling pupal colour in papilionid butterflies results {{in the production of}} brown pupae. PMRF was extracted from the ventral nerve chains of the peacock butterfly Inachis io (Nymphalidae) <b>and</b> black <b>swallowtail</b> <b>butterfly</b> Papilio polyxenes (Papilionidae). When injected into pre-pupae, the extracts resulted in yellow pupae in I. io but brown pupae in P. polyxenes. These results suggest that the same neuroendocrine factor controls the plasticity in pupal colour, but that plasticity in pupal colour in these species has evolved independently (convergently) ...|$|R
50|$|Lantanas {{are useful}} as honey plants, and Spanish flag (L. camara), L. lilacina and L. trifolia are {{sometimes}} planted for this purpose, or in butterfly gardening. Butterflies which {{are attracted to}} lantana flowers are most notably Papilioninae (<b>swallowtail</b> <b>and</b> <b>birdwing</b> <b>butterflies).</b> Hesperiidae (skippers) and certain brush-footed butterflies (namely Danainae and Heliconiinae), {{as well as some}} Pieridae (e.g. cloudless sulphur, Phoebis sennae) and Lycaenidae (e.g. the aforementioned lantana scrub-hairstreak), also like to visit the plants' flowers. Consequently, as total eradication of Lantana seems often impossible, it may in many cases be better to simply remove plants with immature (green) fruit to prevent them from spreading.|$|R
