40|$|A Josephson 256 -word x 16 -bit RAM that {{includes}} a power circuit has been developed to enable high-frequency clock operation. This RAM consists of a 4 x 4 matrix array of 256 RAM blocks, impedance matching lines, and signal amplifiers. A power-supply circuit, composed of a transformer and a Josephson regulator, is included in each 256 RAM block. Fail bit maps for the 256 RAM block were measured, and perfect operation with a 100 % <b>bit</b> <b>yield</b> was obtained. The 256 RAM block functioned up to a clock frequency of 1. 07 GHz. We succeeded in feeding a large high-frequency current of more than 2 A into the entire 256 -word x 16 -bit RAM. The 256 -word x 16 -bit RAM therefore functioned up to a clock frequency of 620 MHz. I. INTRODUCTION Many Josephson RAMs have been developed [1]-[6]. However, RAM operation at a clock frequency of about 1 GHz has not been actually realized, because high-frequency powering for large currents reaching several amperes is very difficult.

40|$|Cache {{replacement}} policies play a {{key role}} in determining hit rates in set-associative caches. Cache replacement algorithms use runtime trace history and most a least recently used (LRU) policy, and neither programmers nor compilers can explicitly control cache replacement. This paper describes a novel mechanism to improve cache replacement decisions without the hardware costs of higher set-associativity. We develop compiler-generated auxiliary information using dependence testing and locality analysis to improve cache replacement decisions for scientific programs. We present an ideal theoretical model of our new cache replacement algorithm and prove that it matches or improves LRU for set-associative caches. We present a 16 and 1 -bit cache line tag implementation of this model. We call the one bit tag the evict-me (EM) bit. On a miss, the architecture replaces a line if its EM bit is set, or, if no bit is set, it uses the LRU bits. We prove that the EM <b>bit</b> <b>yields</b> replacement decisions at least as good as those of LRU. The EM bit is practical and easy to implement in current set-associative cache architectures. Simulation results on 7 programs show that the EM bit can reduce miss rates in set-associative caches by up to 45 % over LRU. On 6 of the 7 programs, it achieves the same or better hit rates with 2 -way set associative as compared to a 4 -way cache without an EM bit. A comparison with victim cache shows that the two strategies can work together to further improve cache performance. 1...|$|R

We obtain publicly verifiable non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for circuit satisfiability with adaptive and unconditional soundness where the size grows quasi-linearly in the number of gates. The zero-knowledge property relies on the existence of trapdoor permutations, or it can be based on a specific number theoretic assumption related to factoring to get better efficiency. As an example of the latter, we suggest a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof for circuit satisfiability based on the Naccache-Stern cryptosystem consisting of a quasi-linear number of <b>bits.</b> This <b>yields</b> the shortest known non-interactive zero-knowledge proof for circuit satisfiability.

40|$|Predictions for {{measurement}} {{outcomes in}} physical theories are usually computed by combining two distinct notions: a state, describing the physical system, and an observable, describing the measurement which is performed. In quantum theory, however, both notions {{are in some}} sense identical: outcome probabilities are given by the overlap between two state vectors - quantum theory is self-dual. In this paper, we show that this notion of self-duality can be understood from a dynamical point of view. We prove that self-duality follows from a computational primitive called bit symmetry: every logical bit can be mapped to any other logical bit by a reversible transformation. Specifically, we consider probabilistic theories more general than quantum theory, and prove that every bit-symmetric theory must necessarily be self-dual.

The normalization is needed to adjust the result so that it conforms to the floating-point number format. In normalization, if a shift is required, it is either a one place right shift or a multiple-place left shift.

To do so, a 25 -bit reversible right shift register is designed to include the guard <b>bit</b> to <b>yield</b> the correct result. Otherwise, one or several places of left shift is needed in conjunction with a corresponding decrement of the 8 -bit exponent. Thus, a reversible 8 -bit Subtractor unit using TR gates is used to adjust the output exponent depending on the number of shifts required.

Randomness {{is at the}} heart of today's computing. There are two categorical methods to generate random numbers: pseudorandom number generation (PRNG) methods and true random number generation (TRNG) methods. While PRNGs operate orders of magnitude faster than TRNGs, the strength of PRNGs lies in their initial seed. TRNGs can function to generate such a seed. This thesis will focus on studying the feasibility of using the next generation Naval Postgraduate School Femto Satellite (NPSFS) as a TRNG. The hardware for the next generation will come from the Intel Quark D 2000 along with its onboard BMC 150 6 -axis eCompass. We simulated 3 -dimensional motion to see if any raw data from the BMC 150 could be used as an entropy source for random number generation.
