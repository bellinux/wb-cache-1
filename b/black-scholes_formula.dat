40|$|Purpose – Firms grant non-tradable {{stock options}} to their {{employees}} as an incentive device. Is the cost of issuing these options equal to the amount the company would receive if it sold the same options to outside investors? The evaluation of this cost is the main objective of this article. The options granted to employees are not tradable, due to the incentive scheme {{to which they are}} related. A non-tradable option is an asset that cannot be evaluated with standard <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>formulas.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The article adopts standard option pricing, introducing some corrections since <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>formulae</b> do not apply. The new formulae show the dependence of option values on how diversified both the employees and the firm are; and the influence that the incentive to work by employees has on the stock price. Findings – Once stock options satisfy a participation constraint, they can be granted to employees who stand to gain. However, they do not provide a net benefit in all circumstances to shareholders since they may gain, break even, or lose. Even though in many cases stock options may appear to be an inefficient way to stimulate work effort, in start-ups and entrepreneurial firms they turn out to be quite beneficial. Practical implications – Stock option opportunity costs have to be valued taking into account the extent of their non-tradability and the incentive they provide to employees. Originality/value – The article introduces a correction for valuing non-tradable stock options. This permits us to measure properly the opportunity cost of stock options, which is often mis-specified. Costs, Employees, Stock options...|$|R

2500|$|In many cases, {{options are}} traded on futures, {{sometimes}} called simply [...] "futures options". A put is {{the option to}} sell a futures contract, and a call is the option to buy a futures contract. For both, the option strike price is the specified futures price at which the future is traded if the option is exercised. Futures are often used since they are delta one instruments. Calls and options on futures may be priced similarly to those on traded assets by using {{an extension of the}} <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>formula,</b> namely the Black–Scholes model for futures. For options on futures, where the premium is not due until unwound, the positions are commonly referred to as a fution, as they act like options, however, they settle like futures.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an alternative options pricing method {{which uses a}} binomial tree linked to an innovative stochastic volatility model. The volatility model is based on wavelets and artificial neural networks. Wavelets provide a convenient signal/noise decomposition of the volatility in the nonlinear feature space.

Market options prices as quoted on the Chicago Board Options Exchange are used for performance comparison between the Black-Scholes model and a new options pricing scheme.

The main advantage of our method is that we propose using an orthogonal expansion method to derive a closed–form expression for the self–financing strategy {{that is associated with}} some gen-eral underlying asset processes. As a consequence, a replication strategy is obtained for a European option.

40|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{applications}} of GP to finance is to use genetic programming to derive option pricing formulas. Earlier studies take the Black-Scholes model as the true model and use the artificial data generated by it to train and to test GP. This paper may be regarded as the first attempt to provide some initial evidence of the empirical relevance of GP to option pricing. By using the real data from S&P 500 index options, we train and test two styles of GP, one-stage GP which does not distinguish the case in-the-money from the case out-of-the-money, and two-stage GP, which does. The GP pricing formulas derived are then compared with the <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>formulas,</b> linear regression models and feedforward neural nets. Based on the post-sample performance, it is found that while the Black-Scholes model still takes the lead, twostage GP can outperform the rest of the models in our limited experiments.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{simplified}} means of pricing Asian options using partial differential equations (PDEs). We first provide a concise derivation of the well-known similarity reduction and exact Laplace transform solution. We then analyse the problem afresh as a power series in the volatility-scaled contract duration, {{with a view to}} obtaining an asymptotic solution for the low-volatility limit, a limit which presents difficulties {{in the context of the}} general Laplace transform solution. The problem is approached anew from the point of view of asymptotic expansions and the results are compared with direct, high precision, inversion of the Laplace transform and with numerical results obtained by V. Linetsky and J. Vecer. Our asymptotic formulae are little more complicated than the standard <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>formulae</b> and, working to third order in the volatility-scaled expiry, are accurate to at least four significant figures for standard test problems.

40|$|In this {{research}} we examine a new method for pricing European call options {{based on a}} nonparametric estimate of the probability density of the underlying asset’s returns. Such an approach allows the use of asymmetric and leptokurtic distributions. We estimate the density using a kernel estimation technique applied to random samples drawn from three particular underlying distributions: the Gaussian, asymmetric Laplace and mixed normal distributions. By assuming an exponential-affine form of the stochastic discount factor, three closed-form pricing formulas for each respective distribution allow for an exact calculation of the option price. Option prices calculated using the three analytic formulas are subsequently compared with option prices calculated using the nonparametric approach. It is thus possible to compare the nonparametric technique with both the exact and <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>formulas.</b> In {{the case of the}} normal distribution we find excellent agreement between all three pricing formulas. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} asymmetric Laplace distribution, we find clear evidence of over-pricing in the Black-Scholes scenario for atthe-money call options. Finally by using a weighted combination of two Gaussian distributions, the nonparametric estimation shows evidence of over-pricing by the Black-Scholes model for at-the-money options. In all cases nonparametric estimates of the option price are calculated without making any a priori assumption regarding the form of the underlying return distribution. ...|$|R
