5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just {{inside of it}} at 52,526km, {{may play a role}} in the ring's confinement <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> as a shepherd.|$|E
5|$|The officers' reports also commended Porter, {{stating that}} he had saved Experiment and her convoy <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> on his own {{initiative}} to ignore Maley's defeatism, urging the crew to fight. Other American officials, such as the American consul at Leonge who was aboard the Experiment during the action, disagreed with Porter's accusations and instead lauded Maley for his bravery. Threats of court-martial were made against Maley, but no formal charges regarding the incident were ever brought. On 16 July 1800 he was replaced as commander of Experiment by Charles Stewart. The incident haunted his career until his retirement.|$|E

5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{focused his}} {{political}} agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential {{in a republican}} government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former protégé John Hancock; {{the two men had}} a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress. The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> like an aristocrat and courting popularity. Adams favored James Bowdoin for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} the 60 games, Tipton was {{suspended}} after an argument with Chickasaws manager Jack Cassini, and after the season ended {{he retired from the}} game to work at his service station. He returned to baseball in 1957 and spent a season with the Birmingham Barons, and partway through the 1958 season, he joined the Panama City Fliers as manager. He was fired a month later, and in protest the Fliers refused to play their next game. Tipton retired afterwards, and a year later was banned for life from the minor leagues after it came to light that he accepted payouts <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> as a liaison for Jesse Levan, who was intentionally fouling off balls in order for gamblers in the stands to take advantage of them.|$|E

5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E
5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{extend from}} the Satpura Range in the north, {{stretching}} from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu. It traverses south past {{the states of}} Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala. Major gaps in the range are the Goa Gap, between the Maharashtra and Karnataka sections, and the Palghat Gap on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border between the Nilgiri Hills and the Anaimalai Hills. The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly monsoon winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests {{also contribute to the}} precipitation of the area <b>by</b> <b>acting</b> as a substrate for condensation of moist rising orographic winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via transpiration, allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.|$|E
