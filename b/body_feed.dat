40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study was}} to find out the {{suitable}} coupling for the regeneration of a complex concentrated ternary brine (salt/corn syrup/water) after fish fillet salting using separation technologies. Experiments were designed for analytical purposes with three selected waste brines originating from different clean solutions and salting process conditions, and processing as well as plant parameters (for example, economics, environment, technical availabilities) were considered. In this regard, several chemical and physical pretreatments were first conducted to increase the size of suspended solids (SS) and to reduce the proteinaceous matters in the suspension. Treated suspensions and their separated phases after settling were subjected to various filtration experiments. Crossflow micro- and ultra-filtration pilot trials (tubular ceramic membranes) showed their inefficiency in terms of permeation flux density, even at high temperature. This was mainly because of the high viscosity of solutions which in turn lowered the shear stress near the membrane. Laboratory- and industrial-scale cake filtration experiments using a rotary vacuum precoat filter (RVPF) were also conducted to find the optimal filtration conditions with the help of a unifying filterability parameter. The best coupling appeared to be pH pretreatment, followed by a settling time adjusted to the salting process conditions. Using <b>body</b> <b>feed</b> for the SS-rich phase, a differential RVPF filtration of the settled phases allowed the regeneration of solution with minimal filter-aid consumption...|$|E
40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} of lignocellulosic polymers {{is likely}} {{to become one of the}} key technologies enabling industrial production of liquid biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. Certain types of enzymes are able to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose polymers to shorter units and finally to sugar monomers. These monomeric sugars are environmentally acceptable carbon sources for the production of liquid biofuels, such as bioethanol, and other chemicals, such as organic acids. Liquid biofuels in particular have been shown to contribute to the reduction of net emissions of greenhouse gases. The solid residue of enzymatic hydrolysis is composed mainly of lignin and partially degraded fibers, while the liquid phase contains the produced sugars. It is usually necessary to separate these two phases at some point after the hydrolysis stage. Pressure filtration is an efficient technique for this separation. Solid-liquid separation of biomass suspensions is difficult, because biomass solids are able to retain high amounts of water, which cannot be readily liberated by mechanical separation techniques. Most importantly, the filter cakes formed from biomaterials are compressible, which ultimately means that the separation may not be much improved by increasing the filtration pressure. The use of filter aids can therefore facilitate the filtration significantly. On the other hand, the upstream process conditions have a major influence on the filtration process. This thesis investigates how enzymatic hydrolysis and related process conditions affect the filtration properties of a cardboard suspension. The experimental work consists of pressure filtration and characterization of hydrolysates. The study provides novel information about both issues, as the relationship between enzymatic hydrolysis conditions and subsequent filtration properties has so far not been considered in academic studies. The results of the work reveal that the final degree of hydrolysis is an important factor in the filtration stage. High hydrolysis yield generally increases the average specific cake resistance. Mixing during the hydrolysis stage resulted in undefined changes in the physical properties of the solid residue, causing a high filtration resistance when the mixing intensity was high. Theoretical processing of the mixing data led to an interesting observation: the average specific cake resistance was observed to be linearly proportional to the mixer shear stress. Another finding worth attention is that the size distributions of the solids did not change very dramatically during enzymatic hydrolysis. There was an observable size reduction during the first couple of hours, but after that the size reduction was minimal. Similarly, the size distribution of the suspended solids remained almost constant when the hydrolyzed suspension was subjected to intensive mixing. It was also found that the average specific cake resistance was successfully reduced by the use of filter aids. This reduction depended on the method of how the filter aids were applied. In order to obtain high filtration capacity, it is recommended to use the <b>body</b> <b>feed</b> mode, i. e. to mix the filter aid with the slurry prior to filtration. Regarding the quality of the filtrate, precoat filtration was observed to produce a clear filtrate with negligible suspended solids content, while the <b>body</b> <b>feed</b> filtrates were turbid, irrespective of which type of filter aid was used...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid DNA was {{originally}} produced {{in small amounts}} for genetic modification for protein production purposes. However since the rapid advances in gene therapy and DNA vaccines, plasmid DNA became a therapeutic product. The use of non-viral vectors for safety purposes implied the necessity of producing large amounts at high purity level. The established techniques for small scale were unsuitable for the large-scale requirements. We therefore designed a plasmid purification process specially aimed for the large scale. Few studies have been published for producing high concentration of plasmid DNA in culture. The common feature for high plasmid production {{was the use of}} conditions of culture far from optimal for bacteria growth. We investigated therefore several cultivation techniques. It was tried to produce high amounts of plasmid by optimising the culture media, by growing bacteria in conditions of pH or temperature far from optimal bacterial growth. It was also tested to produce plasmids by growing bacteria in bioreactors by batch culture in different conditions. It was finally also tested to grow bacteria by fed batch techniques, both by linear or controlled feed. Highest plasmid amounts could be obtained with the fed batch using a controlled feed that finally produced 240 mg/L of plasmid DNA. A new method for harvesting bacteria has been developed. The aim was to harvest bacteria by <b>body</b> <b>feed</b> filtration. However no efficient bacteria capture in industrial compatible conditions could be obtained with conventional filter aids, either cellulose or diatomaceous earth. The filtration was therefore proposed to be done by using cross-linking agents for interacting the bacteria to the filter aids. Those methods yielded much better recoveries, but leaded to filter cakes that were of poor quality. The filtration could be finally be produced in industrial compatible conditions by the addition of a mineral (bentonite) to the bacteria prior to filtration with diatomaceous earth. This method yielded 100 % recovery of the bacteria in industrial compatible conditions. The critical step for plasmid purification is its extraction from the bacteria cell, the lysis step. The lysis will define in what conditions the plasmid will {{have to be dealt with}} for further purification steps. Previous method were efficient however difficult to apply at large scale. They would also produce high amounts of contaminants that are difficult to remove at large scale. Therefore a new method for lysis at high temperature was designed. A range of conditions was obtained for selectively precipitate the plasmid during the lysis while other bacterial contaminants remain in solution. Then plasmid can be redissolved in a following step. Several conditions have proven being efficient. Finally the different steps of the process were linked together. The filtration method was adapted for a complex culture provided by the fed batch technique. The lysis steps were applied by pumping the different lysis buffers through the filter cake for releasing the plasmid from the filter while the cell debris remain trapped. Several conditions were elaborated for precipitating or binding the plasmid to the filter cake in order to be able to wash out first the contaminants while the plasmid can be eluted in the following step in a clarified lysate compatible with chromatography requirements...|$|E

40|$|In the {{interest}} of accelerating waste treatment processing, the DOE has funded studies to better understand filtration {{with the goal of}} improving filter fluxes in existing cross-flow equipment. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was included in those studies, with a focus on start-up techniques, filter cake development, the application of filter aids (cake forming solid precoats), and <b>body</b> <b>feeds</b> (flux enhancing polymers). This paper discusses the progress of those filter studies. Cross-flow filtration is a key process step in many operating and planned waste treatment facilities to separate undissolved solids from supernate slurries. This separation technology generally has the advantage of self-cleaning through the action of wall shear stress created by the flow of waste slurry through the filter tubes. However, the ability of filter wall self-cleaning depends on the slurry being filtered. Many of the alkaline radioactive wastes are extremely challenging to filtration, e. g., those containing compounds of aluminum and iron, which have particles whose size and morphology reduce permeability. Unfortunately, low filter flux can be a bottleneck in waste processing facilities such as the Savannah River Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit and the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant. Any improvement to the filtration rate would lead directly to increased throughput of the entire process. To date increased rates are generally realized by either increasing the cross-flow filter axial flowrate, limited by pump capacity, or by increasing filter surface area, limited by space and increasing the required pump load. SRNL set up both dead-end and cross-flow filter tests to better understand filter performance based on filter media structure, flow conditions, filter cleaning, and several different types of filter aids and <b>body</b> <b>feeds.</b> Using non-radioactive simulated wastes, both chemically and physically similar to the actual radioactive wastes, the authors performed several tests to demonstrate increases in filter performance. With the proper use of filter flow conditions and filter enhancers, filter flow rates can be increased over rates currently realized today...|$|R
