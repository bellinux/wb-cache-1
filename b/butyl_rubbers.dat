During high energy irradiation, most of the radicals {{were found to be}} generated on the halogenated isoprene units. A higher radiation yield for scission was observed in chlorinated butyl rubber than in brominated butyl rubber. This is due to the ready abstraction of hydrogen from the main chain by the chlorine radicals to give main-chain radicals which are known to contribute to scission in <b>butyl</b> <b>rubbers.</b> However, in both polymers, crosslinking predominates over scission up to a limiting dose...|$|E

40|$|Transparent <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> {{is a new}} {{elastomer}} {{that has}} the potential to revolutionize stretchable electronics due to its intrinsically low gas permeability. Encapsulating organic electronic materials and devices with transparent <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> protects them from problematic degradation due to oxygen and moisture, preventing premature device failure and enabling the fabrication of stretchable organic electronic devices with practical lifetimes. Here, we report a methodology to alter the surface chemistry of transparent <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> to advance this material from acting as a simple device encapsulant to functioning as a substrate primed for direct device fabrication on its surface. We demonstrate a combination of plasma and chemical treatment to deposit a hydrophilic silicate layer on the transparent <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> surface to create a new layered composite that combines Si-OH surface chemistry with the favorable gas-barrier properties of bulk transparent <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber.</b> We demonstrate that these surface Si-OH groups react with organosilanes to form self-assembled monolayers necessary for the deposition of electronic materials, and furthermore demonstrate the fabrication of stretchable gold wires using nanotransfer printing of gold films onto transparent <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> modified with a thiol-terminated self-assembled monolayer.

40|$|Collective Protection Shelters have {{historically}} been heavy, cumbersome, carried a high logistic burden, and above all been very expensive. Through the years several advances {{have been made in}} barrier materials to improve the protective capabilities of collective protection shelters. These barrier materials generally fall into several categories including <b>butyl</b> <b>rubbers,</b> chlorinated aliphatics, and fluorinated polymers. The degree of protection these barrier materials provide against the permeation of a “challenge agent ” is often overshadowed by several factors including thermal stability, flame resistance, ease of decontamination, longevity of the material, leakage points due to closures/seams and cost. However, when human lives are at stake the most important factor is the degree of protection the material provides against permeation of a chemical or biological threat. Unfortunately, the exact nature of the threat is often unknown and a particular material may vary in protective properties from one challenge to another.

5000|$|<b>Butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> is a {{synthetic}} rubber, a copolymer of isobutylene with isoprene. The abbreviation IIR stands for isobutylene isoprene rubber. Polyisobutylene, {{also known as}} [...] "PIB" [...] or polyisobutene, (C4H8)n, is the homopolymer of isobutylene, or 2-methyl-1-propene, on which <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> is based. <b>Butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> is produced by polymerization of about 98% of isobutylene with about 2% of isoprene. Structurally, polyisobutylene resembles polypropylene, having two methyl groups substituted on every other carbon atom. Polyisobutylene is a colorless to light yellow viscoelastic material. It is generally odorless and tasteless, though it may exhibit a slight characteristic odor.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of screening methods for the identification and quantification of plastic additives, their degradation products, residual solvents and degrada-tion products of the polymer materials. After having done comprehensive researches on the subject in literature and communication with different manufacturers of plastics and elastom-ers an overview was compiled about commonly used plastic additives and additionally degra-dation products and residual solvents which often migrate. For volatile extractables and leach-ables a HS-GC-FID was developed and for semi volatile components the GC-MS with direct injection was used. The HPLC-UV and the UPLC-UV-MS were applied for the determination of non volatile compounds. With these screening methods 64 potential extractables like anti-oxidants, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants, silicone derivates or residual solvents could be identified. By means of selected substances which represented {{a broad range of}} chemical and physical properties it could be shown that these methods are amenable to validation. Solely the contrast medium led to difficulties during validation of the HPLC-UV method caused by the highly concentrated radio-opaque substance which results in overloading of the column. An optimized sample preparation shall avoid these effects. Extraction with non polar solvents could be an opportunity. Additionally extraction methods for the investigation of different plastic and elastomers con-cerning their extractable profiles after extraction with water, isopropanol and hexane were developed. The plastic additives Irganox 1010, BHT, Irganox 1076, MTBC, DEHP, stearic acid, sulphur, as well as residual solvents and degradation products like different tertiary alco-hols (p. a. t-butanole), 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanole, various hydrocarbons (p. a. dodecane, tetradecane, eicosane, tetracosane), Irgafos 168 oxide, palmitic-, myristic acid, benzyls and silicone deri-vates were the commonly extracted substances. These extractable profiles serve as an essential basis for assessing the suitability of materials as primary packaging materials during the development of new container closure systems. Thus COP, COC, PC and PP as plastics and the chlorinated <b>butyl</b> <b>rubbers</b> C and D would be appropriated. The extractable profiles of these materials are least comprehensive. Among these properties additional factors are important during the development of packaging, p. a. process ability and barrier properties. A compromise between these claims shall be identified. Afterwards one’s own hand assembled devices, filled with water or rather contrast medium, was investigated concerning their migration profiles. These devices (cartridges and vials with different composition) were being stored at 40 °C and 75 % relatively humidity for six months. After sterilization, tri- and the storage for six month the devices were investigated with the developed analytical methods. T-butanole, BHT, m-Xylene, o-Xylene, Ethylbenzene and silicone derivates were migrated compounds. With the help of statutory provisions the toxicological assessment didn`t show any health haz-ard neither for water nor for contrast medium as filling. For the assessment of migrated un-known substances the Kunststoffrichtlinie 2002 / 72 /EG was used. According to FDA using regulations from the food sector is possible. Concentrations of known leachables as well as the global migration limits, summarizing concentrations of known and unknown substances were not exceeded. The toxicological risk was estimated being harmless. For unknown sub-stances identification should be conducted to exclude any toxicological risk if a registration as primary packaging material is targeted. When comparing extractable and leachable profiles in many cases a similar screen was shown concerning known compounds. However a quantitative correlation couldn’t be demonstrated. The reason was the use of different moulded articles. The different moulding processes caused an allocation of plastic additives in plastics and elastomers which wasn’t comparable. Within the scope of this work screening methods to investigate plastics and elastomers con-cerning their extractable and leachable profiles has been developed successfully. It is possible to select materials already during the development process considering the potential of migra-tion of the used plastic additives. The following toxicological assessment allows an early de-cision about the suitability as primary packaging material. Caused by the multiplicity of plas-tic additives which are currently on the market and their possibility to create reaction products with the filling it is necessary to adapt or amend the developed methods...|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) rates in aquatic environments are {{often based on}} the incubation of water samples, during which the consumption of methane (CH 4) is monitored. Typically, incubation vessels are sealed with <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> because these elastomers are essentially impermeable for gases. We report on the potential toxicity of five different commercially available, lab-grade butyl stoppers on MOx activity in samples from marine and lacustrine environments. MOx rates in incubations sealed with non-halogenated butyl were > 50 % lower compared to parallel incubations with halogenated <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> stoppers, suggesting toxic effects {{associated with the use}} of the non-halogenated butyl type. Aqueous extracts of non-halogenated <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> were contaminated with high amounts of various organic compounds including potential bactericides such as benzyltoluenes and phenylalkanes. Comparably small amounts of organic contaminants were liberated from the halogenated <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> stoppers but only two halogenated stopper types were found that did not seem to leach any organics into the incubation medium. Furthermore, the non-halogenated and two types of the halogenated butyl elastomers additionally leached comparably high amounts of zinc. While the source of the apparent toxicity with the use of the non-halogenated rubber stoppers remains elusive, our results indicate that leaching of contaminants from some <b>butyl</b> <b>rubber</b> stoppers can severely interfere with the activity of MOx communities, highlighting the importance of testing rubber stoppers for their respective contamination potential.
