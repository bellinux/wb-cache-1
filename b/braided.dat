40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{structure}} of the virtual <b>braid</b> group. It is shown that the virtual <b>braid</b> group is a semi–direct product of the virtual pure <b>braid</b> group and the symmetric group. Also, it is shown that the virtual pure <b>braid</b> group is a semi–direct product of free groups. From these results we obtain a normal form of words in the virtual <b>braid</b> group. We introduce the concept of a universal <b>braid</b> group. This group contains the classical <b>braid</b> group and has as its quotient groups the singular <b>braid</b> group, virtual <b>braid</b> group, welded <b>braid</b> group, and classical <b>braid</b> group. Recently some generalizations of classical knots and links were defined and studied: singular links [1, 2], virtual links [3, 4] and welded links [5]. One of the ways to study classical links is to study the <b>braid</b> group. Singular <b>braids</b> [6, 2], virtual <b>braids</b> [3, 7], welded <b>braids</b> [5] were defined similar to the classical <b>braid</b> group. Theorem of A. A. Markov [8, Ch. 2. 2] reduces the problem of classification of links to some algebraic problems of the theory of <b>braid</b> groups. These problems include the word problem and the conjugacy problem. There are generalizations of Markov theorem for singular links [9], virtual links, and welded links [10]. There are some different ways to solve the word problem for the singular <b>braid</b> monoid and singular <b>braid</b> group [11, 12, 13]. The solution of the word problem for the welded <b>braid</b> group follows from the fact that this group is a subgroup of the automorphism group of the free group [5]. A normal form of words in the welded <b>braid</b> group was constructed in [14]. In this paper we study {{the structure of}} the virtual <b>braid</b> group V Bn.

We then describe an injection of the B-type <b>braid</b> group into the A-type <b>braid</b> group which allows us finally to give a definition of affine links, as closures of affine <b>braids</b> viewed as A-type <b>braids</b> after composing the above injections, and we prove that the two conditions of Markov are necessary and sufficient {{to get the same}} affine closure of any two affine <b>braids...</b>|$|R

I-695 interchanges with MD 26 (Liberty Road) east of Randallstown and resumes north, narrowing to six lanes. It intersects the southern terminus of I-795 (Northwest Expressway), which serves as a bypass of MD 140 in the Owings Mills area.

5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white <b>braided</b> hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E

Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
