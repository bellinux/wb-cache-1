Through the privatization of airports, there are various types of airport operation. Consequently, we set three alternative airport operations: (PP) separate operation by two private firms; (M) integrated operation by a single private firm; (G) integrated operation by the government. Moreover, airport operators face the several types of regulations such as on airport charges, allocation of services, or both: therefore, we examine three types of allocation such as the decentralized decision-making <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> on the provision of service, the airport charges, and both.

40|$|Many {{airports}} {{around the}} world have co-located or {{are in the process of}} reallocating alliance aligned carriers to their designated terminals or terminal areas, to promote flight connectivity, common user facilities and airport-airlines relationships. While operational and financial benefits on the part of the airlines have been made clear by existing literatures on airline alliances and alliance-hubbing, but the tangible benefits to be derived <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> are less obvious. In order to better understand why airport operators have come onboard with the concept in the first place, this paper considered existing cases of London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Tokyo Narita Airport. These airports were selected for the qualitative case analysis primarily because of the relevance of their operating environment (i. e. alliance network hubs) and their early implementation of alliance terminal co-location.

30|$|There is {{sufficient}} {{evidence in this}} paper to support further assessment of optimized flight paths which provide flexibility where problems of flight concentration exist. Annoyance is strongly influenced {{by the number of}} aircraft. Noise policies and measures, taking into account the traffic increase, have contributed to the communities living around airports. Limiting the number of the population impacted by aircraft noise can {{improve the quality of life}} for them and reduce the effect of concentrated flight paths. Noise problem has evolved over the last decades and become sensitive because it is now associated to air pollution problems affecting health population. Air traffic increase, new aircraft technology and airspace management associated to local action <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> makes the environmental policy reliable. Because of air traffic increase, the difficulty in modifying flight paths location and protecting the population have all added to the complexity of this environmental problem. A new policy needs to consider these issues, and a perpetual revision should be a high priority. We recommend that the policy needs to include a general environmental duty in performing its operational actions. Airport authorities and the policy need to have a sharp regard for environmental factors alongside the safety and consumer objectives. Failure to do this will leave airport authorities to explain what is reasonable when taking decisions on matters such as airspace changes.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), {{through an}} interagency {{agreement}} with the U. S.

40|$|For {{some years}} now, {{problems}} relating to gas emissions that affect climate and result from human activities have assumed a global dimension of large importance. The climate is, indeed, {{influenced by the}} concentrations of some pollutants in the atmosphere; these pollutants trap the long wave radiation emitted by the Earth and alter the energy balance, causing an accentuation of the natural greenhouse effect. In this view an inventory of greenhouse gases can become the benchmark against which to measure the achievement of quantitative targets set at the political level {{in the fight against}} climate change. Contrary to a general inventory of emissions related with air quality objectives and local effects of pollutants, a greenhouse gas inventory does not set objectives purely local, but it directs efforts towards the quantification of the liability of an area compared to a global problem as climate change, also in view of possible improvements. The inventory is thus the reference for the evaluation of pre-and post-operam actions aimed at reducing the greenhouse effect as well as for their monitoring over time. The article in an overview of the main issues of air pollution associated with airport operations and a review of the airport sources and components contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. After an brief description of the most recent international and national standard and recommendations on this topic, the article focuses on reasons for developing a greenhouse gas emission inventories and traces the essential elements in the methodology to be followed <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> for preparing an airport-specific inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|AbstractAirport {{locations}} are increasingly {{the place of}} non-aeronautical activities. This is driven <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> seeking non-aeronautical revenues and real estate investors attempting to profit from major airports as high value locations. The resulting higher densities lead to more travel {{to and from the}} location. Travellers induced by non-aeronautical activity are likely to behave different than those induced by aeronautical activity. Consequently, there are potentially not only more, but also more public transport prone travellers. This can improve the viability of operating high quality public transport services. However, as demand of the different traveller groups is likely distributed differently, it also needs to be studied whether the superimposed demand affects the peaking behaviour of travel demand in a beneficial, balancing, or negative, exacerbating, way. For the analysis, an iterative reduction procedure is proposed that begins with a network of highest quality services. Considering demand elasticity and minimum loads to viably operate a service, network elements are degraded and demand is recalculated iteratively until only viable services remain. This procedure is applied to a case study of Zurich, where large scale commercial activities and a public transport hub are located at the airport. It was found that the non-aeronautical development already contributes decisively to public transport use and without it, severe service reductions might be necessary. Furthermore, the compound demand distribution is more even than that of the individual traveller groups, resulting in a landside transport hub that can be operated more efficiently than facilities in conventional locations. Future growth of the airport location will increase this effect and further service expansions may become an attractive option. It is concluded that the high connectivity of airport locations is an opportunity to drive development patterns conducive to public transport use. In addition, airports can be efficient locations for transfer centres as there, if their {{locations are}} suitable, sustained high demand with less variation throughout a day allows for a better utilisation of services and facilities...|$|E
40|$|The air {{transportation}} {{system in the}} United States {{is in a state}} of constant change and adaptation. Greatly affected by rapid changes in the industry are the large commercial airports that handle the greater proportion of passenger traffic. To increase capacity, maintain adequate levels of safety and security, and provide increased convenience and comfort to passengers, these airports need to invest heavily in capital programs, whose prices continue to escalate rapidly. The funding of capital programs for airports in the United States is closely associated with their operating revenue structures. Therefore, this thesis develops a framework for understanding these operating revenue structures. The high concentration of the air traffic in the United States suggests that a large portion of investment in airport infrastructure will be destined to few large facilities. Hence the primary area of concern of this study is the largest commercial airports in the United States Part I examines the financial data of the airports at the aggregate level to create a consolidated financial profile of these facilities. The consolidated operating revenue is analyzed to identify the most important line items. Special consideration is given to the alternative cost recovery methodologies - residual, compensatory and hybrid - used <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> to set their aeronautical fees. The objective of this exercise is to identify the main drivers and factors that shape the revenue structure of large commercial airports. In addition, by synthesizing scattered operational and financial data, the research highlights the impact of airport operations and business practices on the airports' revenues. Part Il contains the case studies of three airports. Each case is evaluated within the basic framework used to analyze the system at an aggregate level in Part 1. However, the evaluation of the case studies also emphasizes the unique characteristics of each case.

40|$|The {{operating}} certificate {{required for}} airports that accommodate commercial-service air carriers stipulates that the airports {{be able to}} conduct safe operations, pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Under Federal Aviation Regulation Part 139, most airports must prepare and implement a wildlife hazard management plan (WHMP) {{as part of the}} certification process. Required components of the WHMP include the priorities for needed habitat modification and changes in land use as a result of those modifications. Because habitat modification is often a relatively permanent procedure to reduce wildlife use of airports, it is a preferred method <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> for hazard abatement. There are likely to be federal and state permits associated with habitat modifications, such as those needed for wildlife removal, discharges to surface water, or dredging and filling activities in wetlands. However, proposed activities to reduce or eliminate habitat at Part 139 -certified airports are also subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Virtually all activities involving federal funding or approval at these airports require some level of analysis for compliance with NEPA; most of these activities are either specifically categorically excluded from a formal environmental assessment, or need at most an environmental assessment to document the lack of significant environmental impacts. In contrast, modifications to most “natural” wildlife habitats, even those undertaken to increase aviation safety, are not categorically excluded from environmental assessment. It is reasonable to assume that habitat modifications would in most instances require preparation of an environmental impact statement, either because of the potential to result in significant effects on the environment or the highly controversial nature of the activity. The reasoned, procedural nature of NEPA and the often-lengthy EIS process may appear to conflict with the urgency associated with wildlife hazard reduction at airports. A case study in southeast Alaska is used to illustrate the influence of NEPA on wildlife hazard management, in particular habitat modification actions...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) {{in the world will}} have a {{significant}} impact on future airport development. LCCs such as Ryanair, Air Asia and EasyJet prefer only basic terminal facilities (TFs) at Low Cost Terminals (LCTs) to reduce associated costs (airport charges, capital investment, operational costs). Pressure by LCCs for reduced airport charges has led to the inclusion of only basic TFs so as to reduce capital investment and operational costs. This has raised an interest in the evaluation of TFs within LCT design. A reduction of airport charges, which is possible through LCTs, is indirectly linked to the reduction in air fares. The debate concerning the development of the ‘right’ TFs has led to considerable discussion <b>by</b> <b>airport</b> <b>operators.</b> Airports have to retain the airlines as business partners and customers. To this end, they need to develop facilities that offer best value in order to retain their custom. In addition, airports must be flexible enough to meet the changing needs of passengers. With particular emphasis on experiences at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), this research is an evaluation the provision of TFs for a LCT model, taking into account potentially conflicting expectations of airline and airport managements, and passengers. A research framework was developed as the result of a literature review of LCT design and development. The research itself used multiple questionnaires in pre- and postdevelopment surveys involving three different parties: airline management (Air Asia Berhad), airport operator (Malaysia Airports Holding Berhad) and passengers (LCT users). The headquarters of Air Asia Berhad and Malaysia Airports Berhad were visited and surveys were undertaken to ascertain the viewpoints of LCC passengers flying with Air Asia, a low-cost airline based at KLIA, Malaysia. The main focus of this research has been to propose a possible conceptual model for LCT design with an emphasis on simplifying the provision of TFs in such a way as to reduce capital investment and operational and airport charges, while at the same time being able to generate additional airport revenues. The evidence from the surveys reveals that, in LCT design, there are conflicting expectations between airlines, airport authorities and passengers on the adequacy of TFs whose design is influenced by consideration of cost and revenue structures. The proposed conceptual model indicates the preferences for core and secondary TFs within LCT design after the cost and revenue structures, and airline management, airport operator and passenger’s expectations, are considered.
