5|$|A {{widely used}} zinc alloy is <b>brass,</b> in which copper is alloyed with {{anywhere}} from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of <b>brass.</b> <b>Brass</b> is generally more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.|$|E
5|$|The {{manufacture}} of <b>brass</b> {{was known to}} the Romans by about 30BC. They made <b>brass</b> by heating powdered calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting calamine <b>brass</b> was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine <b>brass.</b>|$|E

In 1882 a monument was {{situated at the}} east end of the north aisle of the church, formed of a chest tomb on top of which was a slab of stone inlaid with several <b>brasses,</b> of which some were then missing, as revealed by matrices. Today only the slab with <b>brasses</b> survives, with some further <b>brasses</b> missing, and stands against the west wall of the church. The <b>brasses</b> show Sir John flanked by his two wives with two groups of his children below and two individual children between himself and each wife. Other <b>brasses</b> are heraldic escutcheons. The inscription on the ledger line of the slab is as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Brasses,</b> {{which were}} {{frequently}} used for doorknobs and push plates in decades past, also demonstrate bactericidal efficacies, {{but within a}} somewhat longer time frame than pure copper. All nine <b>brasses</b> tested were almost completely bactericidal (over 99.9% kill rate) at 20°C within 60–270 minutes. Many <b>brasses</b> were almost completely bactericidal at 4°C within 180–360 minutes.|$|R

5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is <b>brass,</b> in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of <b>brass.</b> <b>Brass</b> is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E

5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the <b>brass</b> guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. <b>Brass</b> {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, <b>brass</b> culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Belle Vue staged {{the first}} British open <b>brass</b> band championships. Attended by {{a crowd of}} more than 16,000, {{it was the first}} of what became an annual event until 1981.

50|$|There was {{a revival}} of {{interest}} in monumental <b>brasses</b> in the Victorian era.

5|$|In 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. Surveyor, {{found this}} newer stone had broken too and he {{replaced}} it with a <b>brass</b> disc marker set in cement. In 1962, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured an elevated cement pad around the 1931 <b>brass</b> marker; this pad included the state border lines and names in tile. The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 <b>brass</b> marker was replaced with a disc shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the version performed in 1724, which is in B minor, uses oboes d'amore in the first movement and <b>brass</b> playing colla parte with {{the voices in the}} last movement, a choir of cornett (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) (or trumpets (Tr)). According to the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, the audition version of 1723 had no reinforcement by <b>brass,</b> matching the scoring of the other audition piece. The originally composed version, which was not performed until 1728, was in C minor, had oboes in the opening movement and no <b>brass.</b> The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E

5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} {{of lead in}} drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in <b>brass</b> necessary. The new <b>brass</b> is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E
5|$|The Qing Emperor's {{undercover}} emissary Jack Knife {{arrives in}} the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary <b>Brass</b> Body {{arrives in the}} village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by <b>Brass</b> and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. <b>Brass</b> beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying <b>Brass</b> under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.|$|E
