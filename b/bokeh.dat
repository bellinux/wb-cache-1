25|$|Mathematically, {{applying}} a Gaussian blur to an image {{is the same}} as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. This is also known as a two-dimensional Weierstrass transform. By contrast, convolving by a circle (i.e., a circular box blur) would more accurately reproduce the <b>bokeh</b> effect. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, {{applying a}} Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, Susan Bower {{announced}} that Neighbours would introduce new opening titles for the 25th anniversary {{and they would}} feature a bit of [...] "bling". The titles were created by Visual Playground, who shot a series of scenes featuring the cast in settings familiar to viewers. The titles made their debut on 18 March 2010. A new set of opening titles made their debut on 15 April 2013, along with {{a new version of}} the theme tune. Visual Playground once again created and produced the titles. The titles depict the Ramsay Street residents gathering outside their houses for a street party. A writer for Visual Playground explained that they [...] "invented a <b>bokeh</b> graphic device that uses the play of light in a formation to locate the houses in the cul-de-sac. Six overlapping circles represent the six houses of Ramsay St and the off street cast members. All the circles together reinforce the sense of community that makes up Neighbours." [...] A new retro-inspired logo, theme tune and opening titles debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations. The new logo is a reimagined contemporary version of the original Neighbours logo from 1985. The titles show characters in a variety of familiar settings around Erinsborough and ends with a look at Ramsay Street from above.|$|E
500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if we can get a bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused vignetting, which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this big jump, but I wanted these subtle differences like the background <b>bokeh</b> to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] steadicams, and instead relied on jib arms, dollies, and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|E

2500|$|In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also {{known as}} Gaussian smoothing) {{is the result}} of {{blurring}} an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, [...] typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the <b>bokeh</b> effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales—see scale space representation and scale space implementation.|$|E

50|$|Some {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} have <b>bokeh</b> features which take several images with different apertures and focuses and then manually compose them afterward to one image.

5000|$|The English {{spelling}} <b>bokeh</b> was popularized in 1997 in Photo Techniques magazine, when Mike Johnston, {{the editor}} at the time, commissioned three papers on the topic for the March/April 1997 issue; he altered the spelling to suggest the correct pronunciation to English speakers, saying [...] "it is properly pronounced with bo as in bone and ke as in Kenneth, with equal stress on either syllable".The spellings <b>bokeh</b> and boke have both been in use since at least 1996, when Merklinger had suggested [...] "or <b>Bokeh</b> if you prefer."The term <b>bokeh</b> has appeared in photography books as early as 1998.It is sometimes pronounced [...] (boke-uh).|$|E

50|$|<b>Bokeh</b> is now {{a normal}} lens design {{parameter}} for very high quality lenses. However, <b>bokeh</b> is virtually irrelevant for {{the tens of millions}} of very small sensor digital point-and-shoot cameras sold every year. Their very short focal length and small aperture lenses have enormous depth-of-field - almost nothing is out of focus. Since wide aperture lenses are rare today, most contemporary photographers confuse <b>bokeh</b> with shallow depth-of-field, having never seen either. Many are even unaware of their existence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bokeh</b> {{is often}} most visible around small {{background}} highlights, such as specular reflections and light sources, {{which is why}} it is often associated with such areas. However, <b>bokeh</b> is not limited to highlights; blur occurs in all out-of-focus regions of the image.|$|E

Because of this, the lenses don't need to reach wide apertures to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required, {{at a time when}} all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good <b>bokeh</b> at f/4.5. Today {{it is much easier to}} make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great <b>bokeh.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In photography, <b>bokeh</b> (originally , [...] — also {{sometimes}} pronounced as [...] ,) is the aesthetic {{quality of the}} blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens. <b>Bokeh</b> {{has been defined as}} [...] "the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light". Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause some lens designs to blur the image {{in a way that is}} pleasing to the eye, while others produce blurring that is unpleasant or distracting—"good" [...] and [...] "bad" [...] <b>bokeh,</b> respectively.Bokeh occurs for parts of the scene that lie outside the depth of field. Photographers sometimes deliberately use a shallow focus technique to create images with prominent out-of-focus regions.|$|E
