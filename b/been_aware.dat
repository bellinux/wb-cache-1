5|$|Archaeologists have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> {{of ancient}} {{sites in the}} area {{since at least the}} 1940s; early work {{occurred}} at Aspero on the coast, a site identified as early as 1905, and later at Caral further inland. In the late 1990s, Peruvian archaeologists, led by Ruth Shady, provided the first extensive documentation of the civilization with work at Caral. A 2001 paper in Science, providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in Nature, describing fieldwork and radiocarbon dating across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.|$|E

5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that he would have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position {{with their heads}} just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with {{both sides of the}} brain.

5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E

A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may never have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E

5|$|Many of Chamberlain's family {{letters and}} his {{extensive}} personal papers were bequeathed {{by his family}} in 1974 to the Birmingham University Archives. During the war, the Chamberlain family had commissioned historian Keith Feiling to produce an official biography, and gave him access to Chamberlain's private diaries and papers. While Feiling had the right of access to official papers as the official biographer of a recently deceased person, {{he may not have}} <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of the provision, and the Cabinet Secretary denied his requests for access.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears not to have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> that they were being carried out.|$|E
5|$|These were {{years of}} tension in policy towards France, with Walsingham sceptical of the {{unpredictable}} Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford. Stafford, who was compromised by his gambling debts, {{was in the}} pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain. Walsingham may have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of Stafford's duplicity, as he fed the ambassador false information, presumably {{in the hope of}} fooling or confusing the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad {{was aware}} that heavy water {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the connection between}} heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. had <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson {{had chosen}} not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 {{and the introduction of}} his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} creation of an archbishopric at Lichfield relates to Offa's son, Ecgfrith of Mercia. After Hygeberht became archbishop, he consecrated Ecgfrith as king; the ceremony took place within a year of Hygeberht's elevation. It is possible that Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony, and that Offa needed an alternative archbishop for that purpose. The ceremony itself is noteworthy for two reasons: it is the first recorded consecration of any English king, and it is unusual in that it asserted Ecgfrith's royal status while his father was still alive. Offa would have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> that Charlemagne's sons, Pippin and Louis, had been consecrated as kings by Pope Adrian, and probably wished to emulate the impressive dignity of the Frankish court. Other precedents did exist: Æthelred of Mercia is said to have nominated his son Coenred as king during his lifetime, and Offa may have known of Byzantine examples of royal consecration.|$|E

5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University, meanwhile, {{argues that}} the play is a veiled warning against {{considering}} PETA as a nationalistic. Considering Pane's position at the Cultural Bureau, Woodrich suggests that Pane would have <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of the Japanese occupation government's ultimate goal for PETA: to help defend the Indonesian archipelago against the Allies if necessary, a message {{which had to be}} conveyed implicitly owing to Pane's own position and the Japanese occupation government's strict censorship. Woodrich points to Aminah's father, a former employee of the Dutch colonial government, and suggests that the character's protests about joining PETA, seemingly in order to promote the safety and comfort of home, are actually based on an understanding of the colonial mindset and the accompanying manipulation; in-text, these protests can only be conveyed in implicit terms owing to the father's fear of the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{later said}} {{he had tried to}} commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge {{critical}} intelligence to the North Koreans. He had <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of the plans for Operation Chromite, and feared he would reveal the information to the North Koreans under torture. Still he remained defiant during interrogations, refusing to divulge any information and acting unafraid, sometimes laughing off threats. He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea, as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture. He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so. He may have been moved to Manpo when the UN forces took P'yongyang, and returned when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back.|$|E
