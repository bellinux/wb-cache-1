We implemented a number of methodological approaches to assess the robustness of our findings, including instrumental variable, random effects, and fixed effects analysis. Mental health was assessed using the Mental Health Inventory- 5.

Hyperkalemic ventricular arrhythmias associated with amphotericin <b>B</b> infusion have <b>not</b> {{been well documented}} in humans. Ventricular fibrillation with progressive hyperkalemia (up to 8 to 8. 4 meq/liter) occurred twice in an anuric patient during rapid infusion of high-dose amphotericin B (1. 4 mg/kg over 45 min). The peak amphotericin B concentration in serum {{at the end of}} infusion was 6. 7 micrograms/ml. Prolonged infusion (3 h) and concurrent hemodialysis each prevented the development of hyperkalemia and ventricular arrhythmia. In two anuric patients receiving 4 -h infusions of amphotericin B during dialysis (0. 7 and 1. 0 mg/kg), peak amphotericin B concentrations in serum were lower, 1. 6 +/- 0. 1 and 2. 7 +/- 0. 7 micrograms/ml, respectively; serum potassium levels were maintained in the normal range; and venous access for outpatient therapy was convenient. Peak concentrations of amphotericin B in serum were also lower (1. 7 +/- 0. 7 micrograms/ml) in eight patients with normal renal function who received lower doses (0. 7 +/- 0. 2 mg/kg) over 45 min; there were only slight increases in the serum potassium level (from 3. 9 +/- 0. 9 to 4. 4 +/- 0. 6 meq/liter, P less than 0. 05).
