5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version {{of which is that}} actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E
25|$|Ramsch: If mittelhand (middle hand) and hinterhand (end hand) both pass, vorhand (forehand or starter hand) may not pass, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not wish}} to bid may declare ramsch in which players each play for {{themselves}} in {{trying to take the}} fewest number of tricks with grand as trumps. The skat is not used.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich Körner (36 victories) also {{recognised}} this as unique: [...] "Shooting {{in a curve}} (deflection shooting) is {{the most}} difficult thing a pilot can do. The enemy flies in a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E
60|$|COLFORD. <b>He</b> didn't. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> I'd {{stick to}} him, {{and see him}} through it, if I could.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has not {{breathed a}} word. He has not {{attempted}} to; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> I {{would not let}} him, because, you see, I do not love him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not {{accompany}} them himself, Castell, without their knowledge, sent {{two of his}} stoutest servants, bidding these keep near to them and see that they came home safe.|$|R
2500|$|... 105. But for {{a debt of}} grain, {{one will}} not become a serf; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not work it off in time, then he must repay it at once; but if he repays in full before the due date, he’s free.|$|E
2500|$|Laughlin lectured on Jungian {{psychology}} at {{universities and colleges}} throughout the United States since the 1970s, including Yale University and Stanford University In 1995, because of his background in football and psychology, he {{was brought in to}} counsel University of Nebraska football player Lawrence Phillips after Phillips' suspension from the team. He said of Phillips at the time, [...] "He should not be rewarded by being allowed to play unless there is real substantive change. I don't mean surface change. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> change, then he's not only going to not batter this girl, he's not going to batter the girl he marries at 30 and 35. If he just pretends to change, of course he {{should not be allowed to}} play, but Lawrence has already been sanctioned in ways other batterers on this campus are not".|$|E
2500|$|Guan Yu {{claimed he}} had 30,000 troops. He {{selected}} 5,000 elite soldiers, headed to the upstream shallows located some 10 li away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates {{on how to deal}} with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning had only 300 men under him and he told Lu Su, [...] "If you give me another 500 troops, I'll go to confront Guan Yu. I assure you that Guan Yu will not dare to cross the waters when he hears of my approach. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> I'll capture him." [...] Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning's command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu's position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead set up camps there. That place was thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (關羽瀨).|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> the subjects' rights invade, Then he was punish'd only, not betrayed; And {{punishing}} {{of kings}} {{is no such}} crime, But Englishmen have done it many a time.|$|R
60|$|Two {{years more}} passed, and Anselm came to beg {{permission}} to go to Rome to consult with the Pope on the miserable state of the Church. William said <b>he</b> might go, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> himself should take all the manors of Canterbury again, and the bishops warned him they {{should be on the}} king's side.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{recognized}} {{ruler of}} Former Liang, Zhang Jun's uncle Zhang Mao, was not mentioned as {{having had a}} princess; {{he might have had}} one, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> her name is lost to history.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure. I'm {{willing to}} take the risk. I don't expect Charnock will fool the job, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> you can get after me. I'll stand for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{sincerely}} hope not. After all, {{if a man}} has {{a conscience}} he ought not to do wrong. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{he must be a}} very poor sort of a fool to repent.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not wanting}} to fight," [...] said Peter. [...] "It's Felix. If he don't {{interfere}} with my prayers there's no need of fighting. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> there's {{no other way to}} settle it." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{met with}} a giant who {{told him he had}} to walk past stones that would mock him; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not turn, <b>he</b> could gain what <b>he</b> was after, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> would turn to stone as well. He went to the mountain, but the stones jeered at him so loudly he turned to throw a rock at them, and turned to stone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> come, {{how could}} I refuse to see him? I {{thought that he}} was here on Saturday, and I told Richard to admit him. I could not send him away from the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't, <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> I {{would stand}} up for him, {{he has always been}} so good to me," [...] said Nat, so earnestly that Dan forgot his spiders, and rose quickly to thank him, but Ned's next words arrested him.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, Bernard's {{money is}} his. He's just, and I don't imagine he'll leave us out. We're not rich, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> give Jim {{some of my}} share, I won't miss it very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{of course}} not; {{that is just}} what I mean. He can {{have no right to}} interfere. When he asked me to be his wife, he said nothing about that. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not come to me, what shall I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not talking}} about my hating him, or loving him. If he's honest to you, I'll neither say nor do {{anything}} to cross him. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> mane to marry you, it's time he did it; that's all. Did he say anything to father about it?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sincerely}} {{hoped that}} he would be closely pushed, and in fact so closely pushed {{that he would}} have no booty to bring. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> succeed in his nefarious plans, I was glad that I would know where to look for him.|$|R
60|$|My cousin {{opened his}} mouth and shut it again. How can one answer when ladies talk in this way? <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not answer, at any rate his preoccupation was gone. He was now {{acutely aware of the}} {{determined}} person at his side.|$|R
5000|$|... 99. If a {{slave set}} a house ablaze, his master shall {{compensate}} for him. The {{nose of the}} slave and his ears they shall cut off, and give {{him back to his}} master. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> not compensate, then he shall give up this one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. And {{lived with}} him till shortly before I left. It was stupid, I know; but I did! There, now I've told you. Don't round upon me! He talks of coming back to England, poor old chap. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> he won't be likely to find me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the ticket," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Spriggs. [...] "For one thing, I b'leeve he'll {{be ashamed}} {{to show his}} face here; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> he's come back from Australia. See? It'll make it nicer for 'im too. You don't suppose he wants to boast of where he's been?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} must stay here, {{especially}} since Sam is sick," [...] said Dora, {{while they were}} eating a breakfast of buckwheat cakes, honey, chops, and coffee. [...] "He may not get worse, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> one of {{you will have to}} take the horse and go for the doctor." ...|$|E
50|$|Johnson played cricket for Cambridge University in two matches, {{one each}} {{at home and}} away, against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1850, batting as a middle-order batsman. It is not {{recorded}} whether he batted right-handed or left-handed and the scorecards for both matches are incomplete, {{and so it is}} not recorded that <b>he</b> bowled, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> took no wickets. His top score of 28 came in the match at Lord's.|$|R
60|$|The Kro-lu stood {{watching}} us with stolid indifference. I presume {{that he expected}} to be killed; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> showed no outward sign of fear. His eyes, indicating his greatest interest, were fixed upon my pistol or the rifle which Ajor still carried. I cut his bonds with my knife. As I did so, an expression of surprise tinged and animated the haughty reserve of his countenance. He eyed me quizzically.|$|R
5000|$|Mòr Ros (Marion Ross) of Stornoway (afterwards Mrs. Clough of Liverpool) {{rejected}} his advances, in 1782. He celebrated her {{in several}} poems. As the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography puts it, [...] "legend {{has it that}} Ross died of love, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it was a lengthy process".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} a great deal more," [...] whispered Dickory; [...] "these men are dreadful. They {{do not know what}} keeps your father, {{although}} they have suspicions which I could not make out; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not come on board by ten o'clock they will sail without him, and without his cash-box." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt. But {{that gives}} me no authority. If he does mean to marry the girl he must go to her father;--or it is {{possible}} that he might come to me. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean it, what can I do?" [...] He promised, however, that he would think of it.|$|E
60|$|The fallacy {{is that of}} {{disregarding}} the Homeric poet's audience. He did not sing for Aristotle or for Aristarchus, or for modern minute and reflective inquirers, but for warriors and ladies. He certainly satisfied them; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not satisfy microscopic professors, he {{is described as a}} syndicate of many minstrels, living in many ages.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not see the}} woman's movements, mademoiselle saw them, and {{the sight}} set her eyes dilating with a new fear. She guessed the Dowager's treacherous purpose. And no sooner had she guessed it than, with a choking sob, she told herself that what madame could do that could she also.|$|R
6000|$|I am black, I am black, [...] And yet God made me, they say: [...] <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> so, smiling back [...] He {{must have}} cast his work away [...] Under {{the feet of}} his white creatures, [...] With a look of scorn, that the dusky {{features}} [...] Might be trodden again to clay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dame, our matters seem {{speeding}} fairly. It is full {{three months}} since I sent the shrewd and handsome Count Detzin on his devilish mission to my brother's daughter Constance. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> fail, {{we are not}} wholly safe, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> succeed, no power can bar our girl from being Duchess e'en though ill-fortune should decree she never should be Duke!" ...|$|R
