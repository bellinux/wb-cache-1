40|$|This {{document}} contains graphical data {{necessary for}} the preliminary design of ballistic missions to Mars. Contours of launch energy requirements, {{as well as many}} other launch and Mars arrival parameters, are presented in launch date/arrival date space for all launch opportunities from 1990 through 2005. In addition, an extensive text is included which explains mission design methods. from launch window development to Mars probe and orbiter arrival design, utilizing the graphical data in this volume as well as numerous equations relating various parameters. This is one of a planned series of mission design documents which will apply to all planets and some other bodies in the solar system.

25|$|The {{attempt was}} {{accomplished}} by reaching a speed of Mach 2.1, then pulling up to create a <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory</b> beyond the altitude its wings could continue to function. The engines flamed out in the thin atmosphere, and the aircraft rolled onto its back. This had already been experienced in previous flights, and so the pilot simply released the controls and the aircraft regained control naturally as it descended back into the thicker air of the lower atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|A dancer {{will appear}} {{to defy the}} laws of physics when ballon is {{exhibited}} effectively. For example, during a grand jeté, the dancer may appear to hover in the air. Physically, the dancer's center of mass follows a <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory,</b> as does any projectile, but observers have limited ability to reckon center of mass when a projectile changes its configuration in flight. By raising the arms and legs while ascending and lowering them while descending, the dancer alters the apparent path of the center of mass and, in so doing, seems to observers to be momentarily floating in the air.|$|E
25|$|Rust pits players {{against each}} other in a harsh, open world {{environment}} with the sole goal being to survive. Animals, such as wolves and bears, represent a threat to new players, but the primary danger comes from other players. The player vs player combat is accomplished with bows, melee weapons and craftable guns. Bullets and other projectiles travel via a <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory.</b> There are multiple different types of bullets for each gun. Damage is calculated using hit tracking, meaning shots to the head are more damaging than shots {{to other parts of the}} body. Weapon attachments, such as holosights, can be used to give players an advantage. In order to survive, the player must craft tools, build bases, and team with other players. Unlike many other sandbox games, Rust only features a multiplayer mode.|$|E

500|$|The navy plan {{originally}} {{called for}} {{the extension of the}} range of the [...] guns on the Flight I [...] guided missile destroyers ( [...] to [...] ) with Extended Range Guided Munitions (ERGMs) that would enable the ships to fire precision guided projectiles about [...] inland. The program was initiated in 1996 with a preliminary cost of US $78.6million; however, the cost of the program increased 400% during its research and development phase. The results of the program had been similarly disappointing: the original expected operational capability date was pushed from 2001 to 2011 before being cancelled by the navy in March 2008 for budget-related reasons and an apparent shift by the navy from the ERGM program to the <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Trajectory</b> Extended Range Munition (BTERM) program. These weapons are neither intended nor expected to satisfy the full range of the marine corps requirements.|$|E

Gliding continues until they achieve an altitude that is optimal for engaging turbofan engines and entering cruise flight. At this point, about [...] from the launch point, the boosters would be flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The cruise back to the airport requires about [...] of hydrogen fuel and takes over two hours to complete. An undercarriage is deployed and each booster lands autonomously. After separation, the boosters are not under threat of collision until they land due to small differences in their initial flight trajectories.|$|E
500|$|Since then, general {{relativity}} has been acknowledged as {{the theory that}} best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From {{the perspective of the}} object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory</b> of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as [...] "gravitational force".|$|E
