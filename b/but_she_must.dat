25|$|What {{the woman}} who labors wants {{is the right to}} live, not simply exist— the right to life as the rich woman has the right to life, and the sun and music and art.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1846 Stone {{informed}} her family of her intention to become a woman’s rights lecturer. Her brothers were at once supportive, her father encouraged her {{to do what she}} considered her duty, but her mother and only remaining sister begged her to reconsider. To her mother's fears that she would be reviled, Stone said she knew she would be disesteemed and even hated, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> [...] "pursue that course of conduct which, to me, appears best calculated to promote the highest good of the world.” ...|$|E
500|$|According to Black, Vala's {{motivation}} {{to hide her}} miraculous pregnancy by marrying the local villager Tomin (played by Tim Guinee) in late season 9 stems from [...] "genuinely car for the man. She does something wrong, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> in order to survive." [...] Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination. Throughout season 10, Vala has {{to come to terms}} with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by Morena Baccarin), well knowing from the beginning that Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought. Black believed Vala had to [...] "try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her", despite her own lack of maturity. When Vala meets her father Jacek (Fred Willard) in [...] "Family Ties", Vala shows [...] "a slightly more dramatic and vulnerable side" [...] that was new to the audience.|$|E
500|$|Despite Mary Shelley's {{attempts}} to assist Gatteschi financially, {{he tried to}} blackmail her one year later in 1845using indiscreet letters she had written. After not hearing from Gatteschi for months, she received threatening letters, which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage. He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this. The contents of Mary Shelley's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have felt some danger, for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends: [...] " [...] were written with an open heart – & contain details with regard to my past history, which it [...] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light." [...] Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help. After obtaining help from the British government, he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi's correspondence. Implying that Gatteschi was {{a danger to the}} state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the cabinet noir system in order to retrieve the letters. On 11 October, Le National and Le Constitutionnel reported in outrage that Gatteschi's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary. Mary wrote to Claire that [...] "It is an awful power this seizure", but she did not regret using it. After Knox retrieved her letters, he burned them. Shelley spent £250 of her own money to finance the operation. She was embarrassed by the entire incident.|$|E

500|$|Rufus {{was born}} into the Whiskers Mob on 1 February 2007 in a mix litter of eight pups. His litter-mates were Burdock, Rhogan Josh, Amira, Squig, Chiriqui, Etosha and Murray. His mother is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have been either Hawkeye, Petra, Flo, Finn or Ella. His father remains unknown as well. His mother and the other females mated during a group split but the {{splinter}} group rejoined a month before he was born. On 25 January 2007 dominant female, and Rufus' grandmother, Flower died from a snake bite. He and his litter-mates survived their first few weeks and started to foraged with the adults. The five males soon joined into the Lazuli Mob. Machu Pichu took male dominance but was ousted by Wollow. Machu Pichu joined Beebop and formed the PK mob along with Rhogan Josh. But Rufus' litter-mate didn't stay in the group and took to roving. Rhogan Josh {{is now in the}} Chuckle Bros group now. It is a group of roving male who are not attached to any breeding clan. Then Axel left the Lazuli with some males and joined Stop it. Only Wollow and Rufus remained in the Lazuli. Rufus took to roving with some of his new Lazuli pals. He lived in the Lazuli for two years and often roved. In February 2010 when Rufus returned from roving he got in a fight with dominant male Wollow. He managed to overthrow Wollow. Life changed for Rufus who took over as dominant male beside dominant female Young. Rufus evicted Wollow from the group in June 2010 but he allowed the former beaten dominant male to return to the group. Young became pregnant and Rufus is most likely the father. Rufus was sadly predated in September [...] He was the only one out of his litter to become a dominant meerkat.|$|E

She was a wonderful speaker and a good administrator, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have been a born ingrate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} finale [...] "I Do, Adieu" [...] (1987), Diane's ex-fiancé, Sumner Sloan, who dumped her in the series pilot, returns to Cheers and tells Diane that he sent one of her {{unfinished}} manuscripts to his colleague, who praised it {{and gave it to}} the publishers.

Later, Sam and Diane want to be married immediately at the bar. At the wedding, Diane receives a telephone call informing her that the publisher wants her work, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> finish it immediately. Although she wants to be married to Sam, he convinces Diane to finish the book and delay the wedding, so that she has no regrets about giving up her dream of being a great writer.

2500|$|The first mastersingers file {{into the}} church, {{including}} Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner {{and the town}} clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for {{the winner of the}} song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is squelched by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the [...] "Marker" [...] of the guild for worldly matters. [...] At the signal to begin (Fanget an!), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (So rief der Lenz in den Wald), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that {{there is no point in}} finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.|$|E
