50|$|Non-sinusoidal {{imbalance}} {{can almost}} never be completely cancelled (balanced) with a single-crankshaft multi-cylinder configuration without <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts.</b> Boxer engines with many cylinders show the least effect by cancelling {{all but the}} (4.) plane imbalance in the cancelling forces.|$|R
50|$|All 1.5 L (1,498 cc) petrol engines have a bore of 82 mm and {{a stroke}} of 70.9 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 10.5:1. All engines are turbocharged and intercooled with direct injection. All engines are equipped with an electric water pump, but no <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is {{determinate}} the forces in crankshaft mechanism acting on new design engine from company Zetor, assessment {{of the state of}} balance, design modifications balancing units, calculation of modal analysis, stress analysis and strain control. The content of the work is the creation of technical documentation for the newly modified <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts...</b>|$|R
50|$|For reduced {{vibration}} {{and lower}} booming noise, the R gets a lower <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> which is {{encased in a}} stiffened ladder frame housing for increased rigidity. Weight saving features include a serpentine belt with isolation pulley, a plastic head cover, plastic intake manifold and plastic oil filter housing.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} 2.0L version, for reduced {{vibration}} and lower booming noise, the R gets a lower <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> which is {{encased in a}} stiffened ladder frame housing for increased rigidity. Weight saving features include a serpentine belt with isolation pulley, a plastic head cover, plastic intake manifold and plastic oil filter housing.|$|E
50|$|All M112 engines have {{aluminum}} engine blocks with a 90° vee angle with silicon/aluminum lined cylinders. The aluminum SOHC {{cylinder heads}} have 3 valves per cylinder. All use SFI fuel injection with two spark plugs per cylinder. All have forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, iron-coated aluminum pistons and a magnesium intake manifold. To {{deal with the}} vibration problems of a 90 degree V6, a <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> was installed in the engine block between the cylinder banks. This essentially eliminated first and second order vibration problems, see engine balance. A dual-length Variable Length Intake Manifold is fitted to optimise engine flexibility.|$|E
50|$|All 2.0 L (1,969 cc) petrol engines have a bore of 82 mm and {{a stroke}} of 93.2 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 10.3:1. All engines are turbocharged and intercooled with direct injection. More powerful versions are equipped with a roots type supercharger {{in addition to being}} turbocharged and intercooled.All engines come with an electric water pump and <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Features of {{the diesel}} engines include a {{cast-iron}} block, aluminium alloy cylinder head with double overhead camshafts, 16-valve layout and a bushes timing chain. The M9T {{is directed to}} heavier vehicules like the Nissan Navara or the Renault Master. It features 85 mm bore, 101.3 mm stroke and 2299 cc, nothing known about <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts,</b> typical speeds are 3500 rpm for maximum power and 1250 rpm for maximum torque.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts,</b> the {{disadvantages}} include rotating plane imbalances on 1.rotating mass (crankshaft), 2.reciprocating mass (pistons and conrods), 3.torque generation and 4.compression, all of which generate rocking vibrations. [...] These imbalances can be countered to varying degrees with heavy counterweights on each crank throw, so most crossplane V8s have very heavy crankshafts. Early Chrysler Hemi V8 had heavy counterweights, but the middle two positions {{on both sides of}} the center main bearing (the third of 5 mains) did not have any counterweight, as these positions are located close to the center of engine and deemed ineffective to counter rocking motions.|$|R
5000|$|The Life {{emerged as}} the {{successor}} to the Honda NIII360. It was fitted {{with a series of}} newly designed two-cylinder 356 cc SOHC, liquid-cooled four-stroke engines equipped with a <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft.</b> For strictly urban use, a lower-revving engine with a lower compression (8.0:1, as opposed to 8.8:1 for the higher powered version) was installed in the [...] "Life Town". For this version, which was a no-cost option across the range, the engine output was dropped to a lowly [...] at 6,500 rpm - as opposed to 8,000 rpm for the high-compression unit. It also received a three-speed transmission, meaning that top speed was limited to 90 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The dual {{crankshafts}} {{are geared}} {{directly to the}} clutch, while the front crankshaft also drives a counter <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> mounted between the two crankshafts. The counterbalance shaft, unusual on a two-stroke, assists with damping engine vibrations. The engine is cooled by thermostatically controlled liquid cooling, an auxiliary electric fan mounted behind the radiator cuts in at quite high but acceptable working temperatures (e.g. when stationary in traffic).Lubrication is by direct injection into the inlet manifolds using Yamaha's 'Autolube' pump system. Normally controlled in other two-stroke engines by throttle position, the engine oil pump {{is controlled by the}} YPVS servo motor ensuring that the oil supply is not shut off at high engine revolutions.|$|E
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double overhead camshaft; valve clearances are adjusted using shims. The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four exhaust downpipes join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no counter <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an oil radiator assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|E
5000|$|The Z20LET is a {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the X20XEV for the Opel Astra G and features a 8.8:1 compression, [...] and [...] of torque. From 2005, the Z20LET engine was revised for the Astra H and Zafira B, to three different model designations, Z20LEL, Z20LER and Z20LEH. The differing designations denote the engine power output, , [...] and [...] Further revisions to the original design include under-piston oil cooling, a revised turbocharger unit and the deletion of the contra-rotating <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts</b> in the [...] Z20LEH engine (as used in the Astra VXR), to reduce mechanical losses. The Z20LEH also features high quality Mahle forged pistons, which are much stronger than the cast pistons fitted to the Z20LET, Z20LEL and Z20LER.|$|R
50|$|Most {{inline-four}} engines below 2.0 L in displacement {{rely on the}} damping {{effect of}} their engine mounts to reduce the vibrations to acceptable levels. Above 2.0 L, most modern inline-four engines now use balance shafts to eliminate the secondary vibrations. In a system invented by Dr. Frederick W. Lanchester in 1911, an inline-four engine uses two balance shafts, rotating in opposite directions at twice the crankshaft's speed, to offset the differences in piston speed. In the 1970s, Mitsubishi Motors patented these <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts</b> to be located at different heights to further counter the rotational vibration created by {{the left and right}} swinging motion of connecting rods. Porsche, who used this technology on Porsche 944, and other car makers bought the license to this patent.|$|R
50|$|The other {{prominent}} {{design for a}} V8 crankshaft is the flatplane crankshaft, with all crankpins in the same plane and the only offset being 180°. Early V8 engines, modern racing engines and some others have the flatplane crankshaft, {{which is similar to}} that used in a straight four or flat-four engine. They lack the V8 burble but have double as strong (and half as frequent) secondary vibration of the crossplane design, and do not require the large crankshaft counterweights. Inherent balance of the reciprocating mass is like a pair of straight fours, and modern designs often incorporate a balance shaft for smoothness. When built without <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts</b> that add to the overall rotating mass, flatplane designs have the least flywheel effect of any V8s, which allows them to be quicker to rev up and down.|$|R
5000|$|A semi-closed deck structure, an {{integrated}} ladder frame and four-bolt {{main bearing caps}} contribute to engine strength, durability, and lower NVH levels. Unlike the 4G63, the 4B11T does not use a <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft.</b> The semi-floating pistons of the 4G63 have been replaced with fully floating pistons for the 4B11T. Aluminium is also used for the timing chain case and cylinder head cover. The engine features an electronically controlled throttle, an isometric short port aluminium intake manifold, and the stainless steel exhaust manifold is positioned {{at the rear of}} the engine. The use of a direct-acting valvetrain eliminates the need of the roller rocker arm configuration previously used in the 4G63. The 4B11T features built-up [...] camshafts and its valve stem seals are integrated with the spring seats. The internal components of the 4B11T engine have been reinforced to withstand high levels of boost.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{intake and exhaust}} ports and intake and exhaust manifolds are shape optimized for better volumetric efficiency. Mitsubishi lowered the friction of the engine by including elastic grinding of the valve stems, adopting a high-efficiency shroud equipped plastic impeller in the water pump and using 0W-20 low-viscosity oil. Mitsubishi increased the combustion efficiency by optimizing {{the design of the}} {{cylinder head}} intake and exhaust ports, by incorporating the MIVEC system on both intake and exhaust valves and by using injectors that give an ultra micro droplet fuel spray. To lower the engine's weight, Mitsubishi used die-cast aluminium for the cylinder block, plastic for the cylinder head cover and intake manifold, and stainless steel for the exhaust manifold. The engine features a compact <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> module with an integrated oil pump. A silent chain is used to drive the camshafts. The compact balancer module, the silent chain, the stable combustion yielded by the intake and exhaust MIVEC system, and high rigidity designs for the cylinder head and cylinder block realize low vibration and noise.|$|E
50|$|The 2017 model, {{introduced}} to reporters at EICMA in late 2016, {{had a significantly}} redesigned engine the first since the last engine update on the 2009 model. This new engine has a higher RPM limit and no <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft</b> to quell vibration, also a mechanical variable valve timing used for ten years by Suzuki in MotoGP and drive by wire throttle.This model {{is the first to}} get the addition of traction control with a (IMU) inertial measuring unit measuring yaw, roll and pitch also all lighting is now LED. Another first for any GSX-R is the use of a fuel gauge on this model.Along with the new 2017 GSX-R1000 model, Suzuki has also released a up spec model GSX-R1000R; this R model comes with a Motion Track Brake System, Bi-directional quick shifter and launch control. Also on the R model, as reported by Sport Rider, are the same Showa Balance Free Front (BFF) fork and Balance Free Rear Cushion (BFRC Lite) shock that come standard on the 2016 Kawasaki ZX-10R. Claimed specifications are 199 horsepower at 13,200 rpm, 86 lb-ft torque at 10,000 rpm; 76.0 mm x 55.1 mm bore x stroke, and 13.2:1 compression ratio.|$|E
50|$|Ford started {{offering}} {{their new}} turbocharged 1.0-litre three-cylinder EcoBoost {{unit in the}} Focus from 2012, having never before built a regular production car engine with fewer than four cylinders. This new engine features several innovations, {{including the use of}} an unbalanced flywheel to shift the inherent three-cylinder imbalance to the horizontal plane where it is more easily managed by engine mounts, and so remove the need to use <b>balancer</b> <b>shafts.</b> In 2013, it was made available for the Fiesta. In 2015, Ford announced that this engine had been named International Engine of the Year ‘Best Engine Under 1.0‑litre’ for the fourth consecutive year. Ford claimed at the time that ten models in Europe could be equipped with the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine, and that one in five all-new Ford vehicles sold in Europe in 2014 were equipped with the 1.0-litre unit, including almost two in five for Fiesta.In 2016, Ford announced that they would offer a 1.0 litre turbocharged 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine with cylinder deactivation, claimed to be a world first for this feature in three-cylinder engines.In 2017, Ford announced that the next generation of Fiesta ST would use a turbocharged 1.5 litre 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine, replacing a four-cylinder engine in this model.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996 the DR650SE was introduced, {{replacing}} the previous models. The engine was radically redesigned, reducing its power but allowing for more smooth delivery. The bike's weight was also reduced by around 25 kg. In 2002, the DR's styling was updated with Suzuki's widely recognized yellow off-road racing colors and graphics. The 2010-2015 SE model has the factory option of lowering the seat height by 45 mm for shorter riders. This involves lowering {{the front and}} rear suspension. A shorter side stand is also needed. The SE seat is narrow and firm. The SE has no tachometer but with standard gearing will cruise comfortably at 110-115 km/h. It has digital electronic CDI ignition and a coated cylinder bore to reduce weight. The exhaust pipe is made of stainless steel painted black to stop rusting. For a single cylinder bike it is quite smooth due to the effective <b>balancer</b> <b>shaft.</b> At 120 km/h it still has power for overtaking. The 40 mm Mikuni Carb gives smooth power flow. It has electric start only. The 21 inch front tyre gives good directional control on gravel roads but is still fine for fast riding on sealed roads with the standard tyres. The 2013 SE model has a range of about 240 km from the 13L tank or a consumption of less than 5l/100km. The front fork is non adjustable while the rear mono shock is adjustable for preload through a tricky to access threaded collar and for compression damping. The bike qualifies for LAMs legislation for beginner motorcyclists in Australia and New Zealand where it is rated at 43HP(32 kW). The bike has an excellent reputation for reliability. The 2013-2014 model is available in either grey or white By 2015 the model has been in production for 20 years.The bike is the best selling over 500cc bike in New Zealand. The bike is often in the top 5 sellers of any capacity bikes in New Zealand.The DR650 is also a big seller in both Canada and Australia. It is not commonly sold in Europe due to the stringent Euro 3 emission regulations which make it virtually impossible for a non fuel injected machine to pass.The 2015 model is white and grey with a gold stripe on the tank,with the exhaust pipe finished bright [...]|$|E
