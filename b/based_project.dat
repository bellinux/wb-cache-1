He said that studies using camera traps indicated there could be 19 to 25 tigers in Sathyamangalam forests. A 2011 camera trap tiger density study conducted by World Wildlife Fund indicated that the sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers. In the same year, a DNA <b>based</b> <b>project</b> initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Center for Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The findings also indicated that the region is home {{to as many as}} 30 tigers.|$|E

Funded by the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) between 2000 and 2015, its aim was {{to reduce the cost}} and time required to determine three-dimensional protein structures and to develop techniques for solving challenging problems in structural biology, including membrane proteins. [...] Over a dozen research centers have been supported by the PSI for work in building and maintaining high-throughput structural genomics pipelines, developing computational protein structure prediction methods, organizing and disseminating information generated by the PSI, and applying high-throughput structure determination to study a broad range of important biological and biomedical problems.|$|E

For community projects to have desired impact there is need for knowledge management yet this is never present in community projects. This study purposed to determine the influence of community knowledge management towards implementation of community <b>based</b> <b>projects.</b> The study was carried out in Njoro Sub County targeting 375 project staff working for community <b>based</b> <b>projects.</b> The sample size for the study was 79 using simple random sampling technique. Descriptive research design was employed. Data was collected using structured questionnaire. Analysis entailed descriptive statistics such as frequency counts, percentages, means and standard deviation. Regression analysis was also used to analyze the relationship between community knowledge and implementation of community <b>based</b> <b>projects.</b> The findings of the study revealed that community knowledge {{plays a significant role}} towards implementation of community <b>based</b> <b>projects.</b> The study concluded that community knowledge management positively influences implementation of community projects. It was recommended that community projects should place knowledge management initiatives with clearly defined channels for knowledge sharing throughout the implementation process. The results of the study are hoped to add knowledge to the body of project management and further contribute to how community <b>based</b> <b>projects</b> are successfully implemented in Keny...|$|R
