5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia might <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought to <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E

5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These transient phenomena {{are thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> interaction with the solar wind.

The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval may <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.|$|E
