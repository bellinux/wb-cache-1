5|$|Antbirds are {{a family}} of Passerines found from Argentina north to Mexico. There are {{a great variety of}} antbirds, with antbirds, antwrens and antshrikes. Antshrikes are small, often handsomely marked birds. There is only one species of antbird {{recorded}} in the United States; an audio recording of a <b>barred</b> <b>antshrike</b> from Harlingen, Texas, in September, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the antbirds is entirely Neotropical, with {{the vast majority of}} the species being found in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the <b>barred</b> <b>antshrike,</b> have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and Middle American {{distribution of}} the family; others, such as the ash-throated antwren, have a tiny distribution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the high}} {{biodiversity}} {{that characterizes the}} tropics, we know little about the behaviour of most tropical birds. Antbirds (Thamnophilidae) are a biodiverse family of more than 200 species found throughout Central and South America, yet their ecology and behaviour are poorly known. In this study, we provide the first {{detailed description of the}} vocalizations and vocal behaviour of <b>Barred</b> <b>Antshrikes</b> (Thamnophilus doliatus), a widespread Neotropical suboscine passerine. We studied 38 territorial pairs in a population in Costa Rica from 2008 to 2010, using field recordings and observations to quantify their vocalizations and vocal behaviour. Males and females produced similar songs consisting of rapidly repeated chuckling notes. Several aspects of their songs distinguish the sexes: male songs were longer in duration, containe...|$|R
40|$|In {{multiple}} animal taxa, {{including many}} birds and primates, members of mated pairs produce coordinated acoustic displays known as duets. By observing the behaviour of territorial animals as {{they respond to}} playback-simulated duets of rivals, we can gain insight into the behavioural significance of vocal duets. Playback experiments, however, have been conducted across a very narrow range of duetting animals. Furthermore, many {{studies have been conducted}} with single-speaker playback, whereas stereo-speaker playback offers more spatially realistic simulation of duets. Moreover, by evaluating the reactions of animals to separate loudspeakers broadcasting male and female duet contributions, we can study the interactions of both males and females with same-sex vs. opposite-sex rivals. We used a paired experimental design to broadcast duet stimuli through a single-speaker and a stereo-speaker apparatus to 30 pairs of duetting <b>barred</b> <b>antshrikes</b> Thamnophilus doliatus in Costa Rica. Our goals were (1) to evaluate whether territorial antbirds respond more aggressively to male vs. female duet components and (2) to assess aggressive responses of antbirds towards single-speaker vs. stereo-speaker playback. Neither males nor females differentiated between the loudspeaker simulating the male vs. female duet contribution during stereo-speaker playback trials. <b>Barred</b> <b>antshrikes</b> displayed significantly stronger responses to stereo-speaker playback compared with single-speaker playback. Males displayed stronger playback responses than females with closer, quicker and more vocal responses. These results provide evidence for a joint resource defence function of antbird duets given that pairs responded together with equivalent intensity to male and female simulated intruders. This is the first study to show that although duetting is an aggressive territorial signal, birds do not necessarily respond to sex-specific components of duets. Our results support the idea that spatially realistic stereo presentation of duet stimuli is critical for experimental duet research. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|R
40|$|Riparian {{corridors}} and fencerows are hypothesized {{to increase the}} persistence of forest animals in fragmented landscapes by facilitating movement among suitable habitat patches. This function may be critically important for forest birds, which have declined dramatically in fragmented habitats. Unfortunately, direct evidence of corridor use {{has been difficult to}} collect at landscape scales and this limits support for corridors in conservation planning. Using telemetry and handheld GPS units, we examined the movement of forest birds by translocating territorial individuals of <b>barred</b> <b>antshrikes</b> (Thamnophilus doliatus; a forest specialist) and rufous-naped wrens (Campylorhynchus rufinucha; a forest generalist) 0. 7 – 1. 9 km from their territories in the highly fragmented tropical dry forest of Costa Rica. In each translocation, the directly intervening habitat comprised 1 of 3 treatments: forested riparian corridor, linear living fencerow, or open pasture. Antshrikes returned faster and with greater success in riparian corridors relative to pasture treatments. This species also traveled more directly in riparian corridor treatments, detoured to use forested routes in the other 2 treatments, and did not use fencerows even when they led directly to their home territories. By contrast, wrens were more likely to use fencerows when returning, and return time and success were equivalent among the 3 treatments. Both species crossed fewer gaps in tree cover during riparian corridor treatments than in fencerow or pasture treatments. We conclude that antshrikes, which may be representative of other forest specialists, use forested corridors for movement in this landscape and that fencerows are avoided as movement conduits...|$|R

40|$|Duetting {{behaviour}} is {{a unique}} form of animal communication that occurs in many diverse taxa in the animal kingdom. Hypotheses for the function of duets can be grouped into two broad categories to explain why individuals coordinate with their partner 2 ̆ 7 s songs to create duets: (1) duets are cooperative displays where pair members have a shared goal, such as joint resource defence, and (2) duets are conflicting displays where pair members have different goals, such as guarding against divorce or extrapair copulations. To distinguish between cooperative versus conflicting functions of vocal duets, we conducted a playback experiment to 40 breeding pairs of <b>barred</b> <b>antshrikes,</b> Thamnophilus doliatus. We broadcast five playback treatments to territorial pairs of birds: solos of males and females, duets created by males responding to female songs and by females responding to male songs, and a heterospecific control. We categorized subjects 2 ̆ 7 behaviour in terms of vocal and physical responses. Male vocal and physical responses were significantly higher towards conspecific stimuli than towards heterospecific stimuli. Males tended to show more vocal responsiveness towards duet stimuli, although this tendency was not significant. We observed a similar pattern for female vocal responses. However, for physical responses, females showed significantly more intense responses towards female solo stimuli than towards any other conspecific treatment, suggesting that female antshrikes perceive rival females as an especially intense threat. Our results provide some support for a joint resource defence function for duetting in this species, while the high intrasexual aggression observed between females may indicate a form of mate guarding. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R

50|$|The {{pheasant}} cuckoo {{is one of}} three New World members of the Cuculidae which is brood parasitic. The precise details of its breeding biology are little known except for a list of known host species including tyrant flycatchers in the genus Myiozetetes, yellow-olive flatbill, eye-ringed flatbill, pied water tyrant and <b>barred</b> <b>antshrike,</b> all of which are sub-oscine passerines. As with other parasitic cuckoos, parental care of eggs and young is provided by the host species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>barred</b> <b>antshrike</b> is {{typically}} 16.5 cm long, and weighs 25 g. This species exhibits marked sexual dimorphism. The male is barred {{all over with}} black and white, and has a white-based black crest that is raised in display. The female is rufous above with a chestnut crest. The sides {{of her head and}} neck are streaked with black, and the underparts are rich buff. In both sexes, the legs are grey, the bill is black and the iris is pale yellow.|$|E
50|$|The <b>barred</b> <b>antshrike</b> (Thamnophilus doliatus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} antbird family. It {{is found}} in the Neotropics from Tamaulipas, Mexico, through Central America, Trinidad and Tobago, and a large part of South America east of the Andes as far south as northern Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. There is one accepted record from southern Texas. It is found {{in a wide range of}} wooded habitats (even gardens and parks) in both humid and arid regions. Throughout a large part of its range, it is among the most common antbirds.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} vary {{primarily in}} the overall darkness {{and the amount of}} barring and hue of the underparts. For example, in the Tobagonian race T. d. tobagensis, males are whiter below, and females darker, than in the nominate subspecies. The most distinctive subspecies is T. d. capistratus of the Caatinga in north-eastern Brazil, where males have uniform black crown (no white barring to the base) and females have streaked throat and faintly barred belly. It is also the only subspecies where the iris is deep maroon-red. It has recently been suggested that it should be considered a separate species, the Caatinga <b>barred</b> <b>antshrike.</b>|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{biodiversity}} {{that characterizes the}} tropics relative to temperate latitudes, we know comparatively little about the ecology and behaviour of tropical animals. In many tropical birds, males and females coordinate their songs to form duets. My thesis quantitatively describes the vocal behaviour of Barred Antshrikes (Thamnophilus doliatus), Neotropical duetting songbirds. My thesis consists of two main components: a thorough description of vocal behaviour and a playback experiment testing two hypotheses for duet function. I found substantial sex differences in the fine structure of <b>Barred</b> <b>Antshrike</b> songs. Analysis of passive recordings revealed that song output is highest during the early morning and in the period prior to nesting. Playback results indicate that duets are important in territory defence and intrasexual aggression between females. Evaluating communication strategies of tropical species is important for understanding patterns of behavioural ecology and provides useful comparisons to patterns observed in north-temperate regions...|$|E
