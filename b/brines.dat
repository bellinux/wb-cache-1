5|$|The Muisca {{constructed}} ceramic pottery for cooking, {{the extraction}} of salt from <b>brines,</b> as decorative ritual pieces and for the consumption of their alcoholic beverage; chicha. Large ceramic jars were found around the sacred archaeoastronomical site of El Infiernito, used for massive rituals where the people celebrated their festivities drinking chicha. Also musical instruments such as ocarinas were made of ceramics. The ceramic pots and sculptures were painted with zoomorphic figures that were common in the Muisca territory; frogs, armadillos, snakes and lizards. Main ceramic production centres were located close to the abundance of clays, in Tocancipá, Gachancipá, Cogua, Guatavita, Guasca and Ráquira.|$|E
5|$|The caliche was {{the main}} source of iodine in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (which is no longer an economically viable source), but in the late 20th century <b>brines</b> emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to evaporate the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.|$|E
40|$|The {{technological}} process of smoked mackerel (Scomber scombrus) manufacture {{was described in}} detail {{with a focus on}} quality of muscle. The smoked mackerel <b>brined</b> in 6 %, 12 % and 15 % of <b>brine</b> was monitored by texture profile analysis (TPA) using a cylindrical probe P 75 and spherical probe P 1 S. Textural properties of muscle, such as hardness, cohesiveness, springiness and chewiness were evaluated. With increasing concentrations of <b>brine</b> muscle hardness and chewiness significantly decreases. In texture measuring, using a cylindrical probe P 75, in 6 % of <b>brine</b> approximately 10. 4 % higher hardness can be achieved, about 1 % higher chewiness and about approximately 5 % lower springiness expect, than when <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> When <b>brined</b> in 15 % of <b>brine</b> about 6. 7 % lower hardness, about approximately 11. 2 % lower chewiness and about 6. 5 % lower springiness expect, than when <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> When using a spherical probe P 1 S is at <b>brined</b> in 6 % of <b>brine</b> about approximately 6. 5 % higher hardness and about approximately 11 % lower chewiness that <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> When <b>brined</b> in 15 % of <b>brine</b> about approximately 13 % lower springiness and approximately 21. 7 % lower chewiness expect, than when <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> To a lesser extent springiness was influenced, cohesiveness with increasing concentrations of salt in <b>brine</b> was unchanged. Texture measurements were supplemented by microbiological analysis of the total count of microorganisms (TCM). This analysis confirmed that with increasing concentrations of salt <b>brine</b> the count of microorganisms decreases (on 103 using 6 % of <b>brine</b> and on 102 using 12 % and 15 % of <b>brine)</b> as a result of reduced water activity (aw) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{derivative}} of oil recovery versus injection <b>brine</b> salinity is also plotted in Fig.  15. The maximum slope of oil recovery curve {{happens in a}} specific value of injection <b>brine</b> salinity for various <b>brine</b> salinity threshold ranges.

This figure also shows that the narrow <b>brine</b> salinity threshold range is less sensitive to injection <b>brine</b> salinity compared to a wide <b>brine</b> salinity threshold range. Therefore, both the <b>brine</b> salinity range and the injection <b>brine</b> salinity have important effects on LSW flooding performance.|$|R

40|$|<b>Brine</b> {{discharge}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} sources of wastewater from industrial processes. Because of the environmental impacts arising from improper treatment of <b>brine</b> discharge and more rigorous regulations of pollution control, industries have started to focus on waste minimization and improving the process of wastewater treatment. Several approaches have been proposed to provide a strategy for <b>brine</b> handling by recovering both <b>brine</b> and water or to remove pollutant components so it complies with environmental regulations when discharged. One of the most promising alternatives to <b>brine</b> disposal is reusing the <b>brine,</b> which results in reduction of pollution, minimizing waste volume and salt recovery. The <b>brine</b> may also contain valuable components that could be recovered for profitable use. Also, water recovery from <b>brine</b> effluent is generally performed to save water. In the case of rejected <b>brine</b> from desalination plants, water recovery from higher <b>brine</b> concentrations has huge potential for salt production.

50|$|<b>Brine</b> pools {{are large}} areas of <b>brine</b> on the seabed. These pools are bodies of water that have a {{salinity}} that is {{three to five times}} greater than that of the surrounding ocean. For deep sea <b>brine</b> pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The <b>brine</b> often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic extremophiles that live in this specialized biome. <b>Brine</b> pools are also known to exist on the Antarctic continental shelf where the source of <b>brine</b> is salt excluded during formation of sea ice. Deep sea and Antarctic <b>brine</b> pools can be toxic to marine animals. <b>Brine</b> pools are sometimes called seafloor lakes because the dense <b>brine</b> creates a halocline which does not easily mix with overlying seawater. The high salinity raises the density of the <b>brine,</b> which creates a distinct surface and shoreline for the pool.|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, salt <b>brines</b> were {{discovered}} along the Kanawha River {{and the first}} salt well was drilled in 1806.

25|$|One model {{holds that}} very saline <b>brines</b> formed in a {{restricted}} ocean basin within a hundred kilometers {{of the site}} of the Red Dog deposits. The brine fluid infiltrated the subsurface and was tectonically pumped through the rock mass, becoming enriched in metals as it stripped those metals from the rocks it passed through.

This water would be warm enough (warmer than about -25°C) but cold enough so that it doesn't immediately evaporate in the thin Martian atmosphere.

25|$|The {{timing of}} gas {{generation}} presents the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and primary gas migration from, the source rocks could have terminated {{as early as}} the Jurassic, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, {{it is also possible that}} a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin's oil and gas fields. It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation <b>brines</b> as a direct result of the Tertiary uplift (cf. Doré and Jensen, 1996).|$|E
25|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} accidentally in ancient China, as it {{resulted from the}} drilling for <b>brines.</b> The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt.

The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000km³ of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2–3% could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.|$|E
