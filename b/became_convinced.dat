5|$|Under the {{influence}} of C. S. Peirce and William James, Putnam also <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that there is no}} fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that their view of the Bible and its teachings were quite {{different}} than what he had been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E
5|$|By July 1808, Breckinridge {{had decided}} to return to Princeton in October to finish his studies. His roommate, James G. Birney, and the {{university}} president, Samuel Stanhope Smith, were both ardent abolitionists, and through their influence, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that slavery must be ended, but only by voluntary emancipation, not by government interference. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1810.|$|E

5|$|In February 1777 while encamped at Morristown, New Jersey, Washington <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that only}} {{smallpox}} inoculation by variolation {{would prevent the}} destruction of his Army. He ordered the inoculation of all troops and, by some reports, death by smallpox in the ranks dropped from 17% of all deaths to 1% of all deaths.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John {{and his staff}} <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that the enemy was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. But, instead of fleeing, Moreau and his troops {{were waiting for the}} Austrians. The two armies met in the decisive Battle of Hohenlinden two days later.|$|E
5|$|Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that the}} Kansas site {{could not be}} the correct one. To him, the local {{topography}} {{did not appear to}} match that described by Pike; and when he attempted to retrace Pike's route, he concluded that the actual village site must be some distance northwest of the Kansas monument.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after being married, Anne Dallas Dudley became {{involved}} in the temperance movement as a supporter of alcohol prohibition. Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that women's place in society could only be improved if women were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet consisted of six largely experimental submarines of three classes. The Navy had five larger, more modern submarines (what would have been the U-7 class) under construction in Germany at the outbreak of war, but when the Navy <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that delivery of the U-7 boats would be impossible, they were sold to Germany in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Bohr <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that light}} behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, {{experiments}} confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, {{such as being}} a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> of the region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the {{communication with the}} mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{returned}} to Germany {{as a member of}} the International Force supervising the Saarland plebiscite. Afterwards, he joined the German Intelligence Section at the War Office. In 1937 he became Assistant Military attaché in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong got to know many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that war with Germany was imminent and inevitable.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that these were not the culprits.

40|$|We could <b>become</b> <b>convinced</b> that a {{particular}} theory of very-high-energy physics is correct if (1) it has a tightly constrained structure and is linked strongly enough with observed particle interactions, or (2) it predicts new physics beyond the standard model which is discovered. The author makes the case that experiments of this decade and the next allow the possibility that we might <b>become</b> <b>convinced</b> that grand unification, a candidate theory of the second type, is correct...|$|R

5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that it would be}} impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{submarines}} were complete when World War I {{began in}} August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that it would}} be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June, General Jean Lannes beat Feldmarschallleutnant Peter Ott in the Battle of Montebello. This caused Bonaparte {{to become}} overconfident. He <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that Melas would not attack, and further, that the Austrian {{was about to}} retreat. As other French forces closed from the west and south, the Austrian {{commander}} had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near Nice and Genoa to Alessandria on the main Turin-Mantua road.|$|E

5|$|Riley renewed his {{relationship}} with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable. Bottsworth, however, <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> Riley was seeing another woman, and they terminated their relationship in January 1885. Riley's sister, Mary, had become {{a close friend of}} Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship ended.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8A's {{abilities}} in air-to-air combat were {{tested by the}} Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range. The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past. Marine Corps officers <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left {{the table and}} sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was {{finished}} Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
