5000|$|The similar white-crowned wheatear, Oenanthe leucopyga, also breeds in the African part of {{the black}} wheatear's range, but the <b>black</b> <b>wheatear</b> has a black {{inverted}} [...] "T" [...] on its white tail, whereas white-crowned has only a black centre to its tail. The <b>black</b> <b>wheatear</b> never has a white crown, but young white-crowned wheatears also lack this feature.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe leucura) is a wheatear, a small {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member}} of the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher of the Muscicapidae.|$|E
50|$|Slemish {{is within}} an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and, therefore, helps {{to protect and}} manage the fragile animal and plant {{communities}} that inhabit its slopes. An ideal location for bird watchers, large <b>black</b> ravens, buzzards, <b>wheatears</b> and meadow pipits can be seen regularly.|$|R
25|$|Deciduous {{trees are}} dominant, with the beech, linden, European ash, and {{sycamore}} maple being most widespread. The Little Carpathians PLA {{is the only}} place in Slovakia where some plants grow, for example, Ruscus hypoglossum and Rhamnus saxatilis. Insects include 700 species of butterflies and 20 species of ants. Notable species of birds are represented by the rock thrush, northern <b>wheatear,</b> <b>black</b> stork, European honey buzzard, short-toed eagle, Eurasian eagle-owl, long-eared owl, and European nightjar. The Landscape Area is home to the largest population of the saker falcon in Slovakia.|$|R
50|$|This is {{also true}} {{for a number of}} rare birds, {{including}} the hoopoe, kingfisher, <b>wheatear,</b> <b>black</b> woodpecker, whinchat and stonechat. Whilst the strictly protected peregrine falcon has been resident in the rock country of the Wasgau for several decades, hazel grouse and capercaillie appear to have died out in the Palatine Forest region. Typical autumn and winter species include the brambling and chaffinch, which overwinter here and occupy the woods in large flocks. They used to be hunted with blowpipes at night during the so-called Böhämmer Hunt (Böhämmer-Jagd), until this sport was ended by the 1936 Conservation Act.|$|R
50|$|This {{mountain}} range {{is a quiet}} lonely and isolated area with a sizeable amount of wildlife, foremost of which are the wildcat, boar, little bustard, Eurasian stone-curlew, peregrine falcon, European nightjar, <b>black</b> <b>wheatear,</b> common wood pigeon, Dartford warbler, red-legged partridge and Bonelli's eagle.|$|E
50|$|Moller used a {{play-back}} {{technique to}} investigate the effects of singing by the <b>black</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe leucura) on the behaviour of both conspecifics and heterospecifics. It was found that singing increased in both groups {{in response to the}} wheateater and Moller suggested the conspicuous dawn (and dusk) chorus of bird song may be augmented by social facilitation due to the singing of conspecifics as well as heterospecifics.|$|E
50|$|Mogadouro is {{also the}} seat for the Parque Natural do Douro Internacional (International Douro Natural Park), a {{protected}} wilderness that includes primarily {{the slopes of the}} Douro valley, but also lands designated as bird sanctuaries for species of eagle (specifically the Bonelli and golden eagles), the griffon and Egyptian vultures, and the rare black stork, in addition to the red-billed chough, the alpine swift and the <b>black</b> <b>wheatear.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dakhla Peninsula and Cintra Bay {{are some}} of the most {{important}} wintering grounds for birds especially for waders. The greater flamingo is one of the most iconic birds in the region and there are numerous others known to migrate or inhabit. Some of these are; pelican, great cormorant, gulls (slender-billed, Audouin's, black-backed), larks (sparrow, bar-tailed), terns (little, Caspian, royal, Sandwich), <b>black</b> <b>wheatear,</b> western reef heron, marsh harrier, sparrowhawk, lesser kestrel, laughing dove, great spotted cuckoo, little swift, hoopoe, rock martin, cricket longtail, oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, pharaoh eagle owl, and red-knobbed coot.|$|E
50|$|The genus Oenanthe was {{introduced}} by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with Oenanthe leucura, the <b>black</b> <b>wheatear,</b> as the type species. The genus formerly included fewer species but molecular phylogenetic studies of birds in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the type species C. melanura, phylogenetically nested within the genus Oenanthe. This implied that Cercomela and Oenanthe were synonyms. The genus Oenanthe (Vieillot, 1816) has taxonomic priority over Cercomela (Bonaparte, 1856) making Cercomela a junior synonym.|$|E
40|$|The North African {{population}} of the <b>Black</b> <b>Wheatear</b> has been treated as Oenanthe leucura syenitica for over 100 years. The type of syenitica was collected by Heuglin in June 1852 near the southern Egypt/northern Sudan border, well out-side {{the range of the}} sedentary <b>Black</b> <b>Wheatear.</b> Morphometric inference and genetic analyses of partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene COI demonstrate that the type specimen of syenitica is not conspecific with O. leucura, but instead is closely related to O. lugens of the Middle East and North Africa, being most similar in plumage to O. lugens warriae of the basalt deserts of north-east Jordan and southern Syria. While syenitica was not separable in the analysed part of its mitochondrial DNA from O. l. lugens and O. l. warriae, it differs in morphometrics and plumage features from the latter. The type specimen is a first-summer bird with abraded plumage as expected for June, and may thus have been collected in its breeding range. Its morphological distinctiveness implies that syenitica might be taxonomically dis-tinct from warriae. However, as it is known only from the type and its few associated data, we propose to treat it as a subspecies inquirenda of O. lugens. As a consequence of this, {{and the fact that we}} found no genetic or morphological differences between North African populations of O. leucura and riggenbachi Hartert, 1909, the name originally applied to the population in Western Sahara, the North African population takes the oldest available name to become O. leucur...|$|E
40|$|A bird’s quality, {{measured}} {{through various}} {{factors associated with}} fitness, generally increases with age. Such a change in quality is often accompanied by a change in appearance that functions as a signal of status to conspecifics. An age-related change in appearance occurs in the White-crowned <b>Black</b> <b>Wheatear</b> (Oenanthe leucopyga), a small sedentary passerine bird (Muscipadidae) that inhabits arid habitats. In this species, young birds are black-crowned whilst older birds are white-crowned. This report studied a wild population near St. Katherine, Sinai, {{to test the hypothesis}} that white-crowned birds are of a higher quality than black crowned birds. The primary measures of quality discussed in this thesis were breeding success, body-size, levels of territorial aggression, mate-choice, survival rate and territory size. Whilst no significant difference was found in many of these measures, white-crowned birds were found to be significantly more territorially aggressive and were more successful breeders. Evidence of an agerelated assortative mating system was also found in town environments. This report therefore provides evidence that a difference in quality exists between birds of different crown morphs. Should future investigations show crown-colours being used to reduce intraspecific aggressive encounters, this would suggest a signalling function for the crown. Furthermore, general information about the Wheatear’s biology is presented in order to increase our understanding of this species and of birds living in arid environments...|$|E
