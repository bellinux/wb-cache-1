25|$|In 1980, Philips {{introduced}} its model SL, {{which was a}} screw-in or <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> lamp with integral magnetic ballast. The lamp used a folded T4 tube, stable tri-color phosphors, and a mercury amalgam. This was the first successful screw-in replacement for an incandescent lamp. In 1985, Osram started selling its model EL lamp, {{which was the first}} CFL to include an electronic ballast.|$|E
25|$|Fibers are {{terminated}} in connectors {{that hold}} the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push and click, turn and latch (<b>bayonet</b> <b>mount),</b> or screw-in (threaded). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a key that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.|$|E

2500|$|G36V (V—Variante [...] "variant"): Previously {{known as}} the G36E (E—Export), it is the export version of the {{standard}} G36. The G36V has all {{of the characteristics of}} the standard rifle {{with the exception of the}} sight setup and <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount.</b> It is fitted with a x1.5 or x3 sight and lacks the integrated reflector sight; the <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> is a standard NATO type. This version was first produced for Spain and Latvia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the standard or [...] "plain finish" [...] model, a deluxe or [...] "fancy finish" [...] model was offered with pistol grip stock and checkering on the forearm and wrist of the stock. The plain finish rifles were offered in 1907 at a list price of $28. That equates to approximately $730 2016 dollars. In 1935, Winchester offered a special [...] "Police Rifle" [...] variant, featuring a non-adjustable rear sight, sling swivels, larger magazine release, and a special barrel measuring 5/8" [...] at the muzzle, and rear sight dovetail moved [...] 2 3/8" [...] inches rearward. A barrel sleeve with Krag <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> and front sight was also an option with the [...] "Police Rifle".|$|E
2500|$|Following this, {{there were}} two more {{attempts}} to make high-end protographic equipment, namely the Zenit-7 (1968) and Zenit-D (1969). Both {{were based on the}} completely new cloth-curtain shutter construction. The Zenit-D had automatic exposure mode. Its shutter was sped up to achieve X-sync at 1/125. Each of these had its own <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> ("mount 7" [...] and [...] "mount D" [...] respectively) which helped to utilize the camera's most advanced features. There were plans to develop a full line of optics for these cameras but the new shutter was too complicated and unreliable. Production was cancelled shortly after, and the only lens made for new mounts were the standard types. Ironically, the Start, Zenit-7 and Zenit-D utilized the same normal lens — a Helios-44 2/58. The Zenit-D is one of the rarest Zenit cameras — only 63 cameras were produced.|$|E

50|$|The Model 605A CAR-15 Carbine was a {{shortened}} {{version for}} situations where longer weapons could be unwieldy, such as aboard vehicles or helicopters. The only significant {{change from the}} M16 rifle was that the barrel was shortened to 15 in in length, so that it ended just forward of the front sight base. Because of the shorter barrel, no <b>bayonet</b> <b>mounting</b> lugs were provided. One prototype used a shorter handguard and a 16 in long barrel.|$|R
50|$|The barrel is {{equipped}} with a slotted flash suppressor that enables the use of rifle grenades and supports a standard G3-type <b>bayonet</b> that <b>mounts</b> above the barrel.|$|R

Charging across open ground, they were hit by American artillery, mortars, and machine gun fire until they retreated into a mangrove swamp. [...] Artillery continued to bombard the swamps, discouraging further attack from that approach.|$|R

50|$|The lens {{was part}} of a group of four {{convertible}} lenses: 400mm f/8, 600mm f/8, 800mm f/8, and the 1200mm. The lenses were in two parts: a focusing and aperture control section which mounted directly to the camera using the Canon FL breech-lock <b>bayonet</b> <b>mounting</b> ring; and the head end, which determined the focal length of the lens. The control section was common to each of the four head-end sections. The 1200mm head end was a preset aperture type, so the lens had to be stopped down manually for exposure.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bayonet</b> <b>mounts</b> {{generally}} {{have a number}} of tabs (often three) {{around the base of the}} lens, which fit into appropriately sized recesses in the lens mounting plate on the front of the camera. The tabs are often [...] "keyed" [...] in some way to ensure that the lens is only inserted in one orientation, often by making one tab a different size. Once inserted the lens is fastened by turning it a small amount. It is then locked in place by a spring-loaded pin, which can be operated to remove the lens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} wz. 91/98/23 utilised {{the original}} Russian spike bayonet. In 1925 the design was modified {{with the addition}} of a <b>bayonet</b> <b>mounting</b> bar to allow the use of Polish and German knife bayonets used with Mauser rifles: the Seitengewehr 84/98, Bagnet karabinowy wz. 22, wz. 24 and wz. 25. It was immediately introduced as the Karabinek wz. 91/98/25. A year later the design was further modified {{with the addition of}} a two-piece ejector/interrupter, similar to mechanisms used in Mauser rifles. The final version was accepted by the Army as Karabinek wz. 91/98/26 ...|$|R
