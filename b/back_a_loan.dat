5|$|On February 16, {{the company}} {{announced}} it had filed its registration for the IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Burger King began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BKC on May 18, 2006. The stock sale generated $425million in revenue, the largest IPO of a US-based restaurant chain on record. The proceeds from the sale were used by the company help pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> taken out taken by the company in February used to pay dividends to the investment firms. According to one analyst at Renaissance Capital, Wall Street investors were not alarmed by the large payout due to the increased financial stability of the company resulting from changes made by the investor groups during the interim between the purchase in 2002 and the stock offering. Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.|$|E
25|$|The Salic Law {{outlines}} {{a unique}} way of securing the payment of money owed. It is called the Chrenecruda (or crenecruda, chren ceude, crinnecruda). In cases where the debtor could not pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> in full {{they were forced to}} clear out everything from their home. If the debt still could not be paid off the owner could collect dust from all four corners of the house and cross the threshold. The debtor then turned and face the house with their next of kin gathered behind them. The debtor threw the dust over their shoulder. The person (or persons) that the dust fell upon was then responsible for the payment of the debt. The process continued through the family until the debt was paid. Chrenecruda helped secure loans within the Frankish society. It intertwined the loosely gathered tribes and helped to establish government authority. The process made a single person part of a whole group.|$|E

Gainesville, Fla. hospitals (Alachua General Hospital, UF Health Shands Hospital and North Florida Regional Medical Center) all agreed that a non-profit community blood center was the answer and made an appeal to all local civic organizations. The Gainesville Civitan Club was the only organization that agreed {{to take on this}} task.

50|$|Higher {{interest}} rates {{reduce the amount}} of money because fewer people seek loans, and loans are usually made with new money. When banks make loans, they usually first create new money, then lend it. A central bank usually creates money lent to a national government. Therefore, when a person pays <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan,</b> the bank destroys the money and the quantity of money falls. In the early 1980s, when the federal funds rate exceeded 15 percent, the quantity of Federal Reserve dollars fell 8.1 percent, from US$8.6 trillion down to $7.9 trillion.|$|E

This prompted the tax body, the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), to request a travel ban on him and the freezing of his assets. Around the same time it was alleged that Michael Ezra was ordered by the Commercial Court in Uganda to pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of Ush 430 Million (approx. $195,000), plus interest, to National Bank of Commerce (Uganda).|$|E

However, the facilities lacked a boiler to cook the caramels and Hershey soon moved to an old factory building on Church Street that had once housed the Edison Electric Plant. The early months were a struggle, but a British candy importer placed a large order and the cashier at the Lancaster County National Bank <b>backed</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan,</b> enabling Hershey to purchase supplies. As the business began to grow, Hershey expanded into other parts of the factory building. By 1894 the Lancaster Caramel Company employed approximately 1300 workers.|$|R

50|$|A Credit Derivatives Product Company, or CDPC, is a {{business}} focused on trading in credit default swaps contracts. That is, a CDPC typically sells insurance against someone failing to pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> ('defaulting'). A CDPC is usually highly leveraged, meaning that if even a portion of its held credit default portfolio were to be 'triggered' at once, the CDPC {{would not have the}} capital to fully pay out the resulting insurance claims. The CDPC business model is dependent on a triple-A rating from a credit rating agency and must trade within closely defined limitations to be allowed to maintain their credit rating.|$|E

50|$|An unnamed {{director}} is casting the lead actress {{for his first}} feature film. He discusses the process with his off-screen wife, becoming increasingly angry as he speaks.

5000|$|Islamic {{government}} {{will follow the}} unflinching courage and rectitude of Imam ‘Ali.

50|$|The Greeks, however, used purely written contracts, {{which clearly}} had some {{influence}} on Roman law, as writing was used. However, {{it is widely}} held by authors such as Zimmermann and Nicholas that the oral contract remained crucial and the documents merely supplemented the contract as evidence. In C.4.32.1 (circa 160AD) {{there is a question}} which was sent to the emperor involving a situation where a document witnesses a promise to pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> but does not mention the requirement of interest, which {{was a part of the}} oral promise. The response is that the interest is still enforceable. This fits with D.50.17.92 which says a stipulation which is recorded wrongly is still valid. Also, D.2.14.7.12 is an example of a written stipulation, and it speaks in the past tense, that T had asked and M had promised, which again suggests that the written documents performed an evidential function. More often than not by the time of the late Empire under Emperor Leo (which influenced his rescript), the Oral stipulation was never in fact made; the documents recorded a non event.|$|E
50|$|A Consumer Reporting Agency is an {{organization}} providing information on individuals' borrowing and bill-paying habits. Credit information such as a person’s previous loan performance is a powerful tool to predict his future behavior. Such credit information institutions reduce the effect of asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders, and alleviate problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. For example, adequate credit information could facilitate lenders in screening and monitoring borrowers as well as avoiding giving loans to high risk individuals. This helps lenders assess credit worthiness, the ability to pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan,</b> and can affect the interest rate and other terms of a loan. Interest rates {{are not the same}} for everyone, but instead can be based on risk-based pricing, a form of price discrimination based on the different expected risks of different borrowers, as set out in their credit rating. Consumers with poor credit repayment histories or court adjudicated debt obligations like tax liens or bankruptcies will pay a higher annual interest rate than consumers who don't have these factors. Additionally, decision-makers in areas unrelated to consumer credit, including employment screening and underwriting of property and casualty insurance, increasingly depend on credit records, as studies have shown that such records have predictive value. At the same time, consumers also benefit from a good credit information system because it reduces the effect of credit monopoly from banks and provides incentives for borrowers to repay their loans on time.|$|E

50|$|In April 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that the shortlist had been reduced to two, with the contract expected to be awarded several months later. Still uncertain was ownership of the trains, with Auckland Transport preferring to take ownership rather than being owned by KiwiRail. The Rail & Maritime Transport Union favoured this course, as it would ensure that they cannot be sold by the government at a later stage. Auckland Council transport committee chairman Mike Lee noted that it would be inappropriate that Auckland would be expected to pay <b>back</b> <b>a</b> government <b>loan</b> for the trains (unlike recent Wellington train purchases), yet could end up not owning the trains.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} a castle on this {{location}} dates from 1190, owned by Jacobus de Mithdac.

The castle would remain with this family until 1625. During this time the castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times. In 1673 Stadtholder William III conquered the city of Bonn, making the occupying French troops retreat, who destroyed the castle. Godard van Reede and his spouse Ursula van Raesfelt then had the castle rebuilt, based on the example of Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn. It was designed by Jacobus Roman (1640-1716) and Steven Vennecool (1657-1719).|$|R
