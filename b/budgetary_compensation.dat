40|$|The paper {{presents}} a fiscal estimate of Bulgaria’s perspective European Union (EU) membership. The projected EU funds have two distinct effects: first, {{there is the}} overall effect on the balance of payments of the country; and second, there is the pure effect on the national budget. The paper concludes {{that the country is}} likely to benefit from large net inflows of resources of an average of 3. 7 % of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 - 2009. In contrast, Bulgaria’s fiscal position is expected to deteriorate by 1. 6 % of GDP on average in 2007 - 2009, if no expenditure restructuring of the fiscal framework is carried out. The expected deterioration of the public finances related to EU accession would be due to co-financing requirements, national contributions to the EU budget, and possible full pre-financing of the EU direct payments to Bulgarian farmers {{in the first year of}} accession. However, the above expenditures will be partly offset by the <b>budgetary</b> <b>compensation</b> allocated out of the EU budget, savings from agricultural subsidies and shifting of certain public expenditures to Cohesion Fund-supported projects...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors trace the {{development}} of equity within the Australian higher education context over {{the latter part of}} the last century. In particular they focus on the ways different perspectives (liberalist-individualist and social democratic) have shaped what has been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of students accessing higher education in Australia. The adoption of a specific perspective has influenced the formation of policies concerning equity and consequently the way universities have responded to the pressures to accept more and different students. These responses are captured under two main headings – 'restructuring the entry into higher education' and 'changing the curriculum within higher education'. Several examples of current programs and procedures based upon these are explained. The paper concludes with the identification of three 'dilemmas'which have emerged as a result of the development and implementation of equity processes and procedures in higher education in Australia. These are: (a) While there has been an increase in the number and range of students accessing higher education, this has been accompanied by a financial cost to the more disadvantaged students, a cost which has the potential to exacerbate equity principles. (b) For one of the first times in the history of higher education, a focus is being placed on its teaching and learning functions, as opposed to its research functions. The problem is that those universities that have been obliged to broaden their base radically have also been obliged to review their teaching and learning practices without any <b>budgetary</b> <b>compensation.</b> (c) A third consequence of these changes relates to the life of a traditional academic. Universities that have been at the forefront of 'changing their curriculum'to cope with more diverse student groups (open and distance learning) have seen the loss of 'lecturer autonomy' as they work more as members of teams and less as individuals...|$|E
40|$|Before {{governments can}} "take" private {{property}}, property owners can often alter the public use value. This article models this capability and studies its implicationsf or takings compensation. Tying compensation to private land values generally does not prompt efficient land use practices. Tying compensation to land's public use value prompts efficient landowner behavior, {{but at a}} high budgetary cost to the government. When there are deadweight costs of government funds, efficient regimes deliver land use incentives at minimum <b>budgetary</b> cost. Negligence <b>compensation</b> does so by affording landowners positive compensation only if they act efficiently to protect their property's public use value. ...|$|R
40|$|The East Anglian Regional Health Authority is {{concerned}} to base its budgetary decisions on accurate {{information about the}} costs of cross-boundary flows in the Region. A patient counts as a cross boundary flow when a resident in one district completes a spell as an in-patient in a hospital in another district. Patients can flow across regional boundaries as well as district boundaries within the same region. The first question at issue is whether such patients present distinctively different treatment problems from those presented by resident patients. Such treatment problems might register in terms of greater length of stay and/or greater severity of condition requiring more intensive treatment during the stay. Severity could have several aspects to it. At admission it could involve the expectation of greater difficulty in diagnosis or in treatment. During treatment, it could present {{in terms of the}} need for more medical and nursing time for some patients or for more complex or more frequent treatment. Severity would lead to greater caution about discharge and to greater length of stay. The second issue is whether such differences (if they exist) lead to higher cost. The third issue is whether such differences in cost justify <b>budgetary</b> <b>compensation.</b> To justify compensation in terms of budgetary targets the costs would have to be consistent and likely to continue {{over a long period of}} time. There could also be compensation in arrears which would be related to measured differences from plan. At present districts are compensated for cross boundary flows on the bases if overage costs per case by specialty. The East Anglian RHA has asked the Centre for Health Economics at York University to carry out an independent study of the whole issue. This request followed the Report of the Regional Working Party on Resource Allocation published in September 1983. We set out the two relevant paragraphs in Appendix 1 as they reflect the state of information and the questions in the minds of policy-makers when we began our enquiry. The terms of reference set to us by the RHA originally cover all types of hospital care. IN subsequent discussion it was agreed that the study should cover in-patients only and exclude out-patients, day cases and the costs of laboratory tests. The information required to make estimates on these points is not available routinely in sufficient detail for individual cases. The aim is: “To show whether there is a significant variation among Districts in the severity of illness of patients crossing boundaries for treatment and, if so, whether this results in a significant difference in attributable costs. ”EARHA, HAA, district boundaries...|$|E
