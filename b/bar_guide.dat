5000|$|The {{chainsaw}} [...] "blades" [...] are technically {{known as}} [...] "guide bars". For chainsaw carving these bars have very small noses (typically around 25 mm diameter). This enables {{the artist to}} create detail in the carving that would be impossible with a standard <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> The chains that are used on these <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> are normally modified by reducing {{the length of the}} teeth in order that they are able to cut efficiently {{at the tip of the}} bar. The reason for this modification is that all chains manufactured currently (circa 2007) are made to be used on standard <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> only. These [...] "carving bars" [...] are manufactured by [...] "Cannon", [...] "GB", and by a companies in Japan supplying [...] "Stihl" [...] and others. The other very important advantage with these <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> is that they do not [...] "kickback" [...] when using the tip. they are therefore very safe to use in comparison with standard <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R

50|$|The bar {{rides on}} the ground, {{supported}} on a skid at the inner end, {{and it can}} be tilted to adjust the height of the cut. A spring-loaded board at the outer end of the <b>bar</b> <b>guides</b> the cut hay away from the uncut hay. The so-formed channel, between cut and uncut material, allows the mower skid to ride in the channel and cut only uncut grass cleanly on the next swath. These were the first successful horse-drawn mowers on farms and the general principles still guide the design of modern mowers.|$|R

The optimization aim is to make reality locus of gathering claw end-point be as in-accordance as possible with ideal locus, and so on. Formulae are derived for displacement of gathering claw end-point and position angle of the gathering claw. An optimization design model is established for the crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism. The crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism is optimized of crab claw type loading machine with 2100 mm wide, and the optimization result is satisfactory. Compared to the optimized crank straight line <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism in literature [2], the locus error function of gathering claw end-point has been largely improved with a reduction of 25. 8 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a long scan stage for metrological atomic force microscope. On designing the system, we mainly consider a simple structure with low vibration and high accuracy. In stead of the traditional two level stages, we used a surface plate as the reference of the main stage. Therefore, it has low profile and simple structure. Surface plate {{was made of the}} ceramic glass with very low thermal expansion. The stage is positioned on the surface plate of 800 mm x 800 mm. It is guided horizontally by a cross structure with two precision bars perpendicularly linked and vertically by the surface plate. The sliding pads of PTFE are used at X- and Y-axes, and also used for vertically supporting the stage. The X-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> with a moving plate is glued on the surface plate. The Y-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> is attached to the X-axis moving plate and moved to the Y-direction. Finally the Y-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> <b>guides</b> the XY-stage plate, so the XY-stage plate can be moved to two directions. This global stage also has the two-axis flexure structure machined by the precision wire-cutting machine. By combining global stage and micro-stage, the fast and long movement and the fine positioning can be provided. A two-axis tilt stage for adjusting the pitch motions of the stage and a L-shaped mirror for laser interferometer is positioned on the tilt stage...|$|R
