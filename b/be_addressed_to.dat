5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury. King Louis I even prohibited all prelates and noblemen who owned lands in Transylvania from bringing legal proceedings of lesser importance concerning these estates to the royal court. Nevertheless, legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of {{other parts of the}} kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes. Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings. Legislation prescribed that appeals against decisions of the voivodes were to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> the judge royal only from 1444.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the President {{in the conduct of}} foreign {{relations}} included the power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public policy of the United States with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> the political department and not to the courts.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E

25|$|In {{the story}} of Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6), Daniel has {{continued}} to serve at the royal court under Darius, and has been raised to high office. His jealous rivals plot his downfall, tricking Darius into issuing a decree that no prayers should <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> any god or man but to Darius himself, on pain of death. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and Darius, although deeply distressed, must condemn him to be thrown into the lions' den because the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and Daniel tells him that his God sent an angel to save him. Darius commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children.|$|E

500|$|The Brothers Poem follows {{shortly after}} {{fragment}} 5 in the edition of Sappho preserved by P. Sapph. Obbink, with probably only one column of text between them. [...] Silvio Bär {{argues that the}} poem was deliberately positioned here because it {{was seen as a}} sort of continuation of that fragment by the editor of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry. [...] He suggests that the poem acts to correct the views put forward in fragment 5: in that poem, Sappho prays to the Nereids, not just for the safe return of her brother but that [...] "whatever his heart desires be fulfilled"; in the Brothers Poem she recognises that such a broad request is out of the competence of the Nereids, and should more properly <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> the goddess Hera.|$|E

Others countered the book's more extreme conclusions one by one in public fora such as letters to the editor. One female reader of The New York Times wrote to decry The Woman's Bible for its radical statements that the Trinity was composed of [...] "a Heavenly Mother, Father, and Son", and that prayers should <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> an [...] "ideal Heavenly Mother". Mary Seymour Howell, a member of the Revising Committee, wrote to The New York Times in defense of the book, saying that its title could be better understood as [...] "The Woman's Commentary on the Women of the Bible". Stanton countered attacks by women readers, writing [...] "the only difference between us is, we say that these degrading ideas of woman emanated from the brain of man, while the church says that they came from God." ...|$|E
