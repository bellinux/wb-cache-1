25|$|Effie sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> to think. She wished Lill {{had found}} out how many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Claus—and had, in fact, {{obtained}} more accurate information about many things.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> chuckled, and was silent.|$|E
60|$|Duncombe glanced quickly {{towards his}} companion. She lay <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{in a dead}} faint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't bully me!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Fairlie, falling <b>back</b> helplessly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and closing}} his eyes. [...] "Please don't bully me. I'm not strong enough." ...|$|R
60|$|She dropped <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morris <b>chair,</b> {{her eyes}} against the cushion, her hair disordered, both her hands {{gripping}} the left arm of <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> her sobs throat-catching and long--throb-throb-throb <b>in</b> <b>the</b> death-still air.|$|R
50|$|According to The Fallen Drakes' Facebook & Twitter, {{the band}} are {{presently}} writing and recording their debut album with Ger McDonnell <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> producers <b>chair</b> alongside new addition; Philip Magee (The Script).|$|R
60|$|Almayer {{laid down}} his spoon suddenly, and pushing his plate away, threw himself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|Torwood saw {{my father}} lying <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> trembling, and he dreaded a fit every moment.|$|E
60|$|He had his arm {{round her}} as she sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> again with a forced smile.|$|E
6000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{front room}} {{she could only}} lie <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morris <b>chair</b> sobbing, {{and listen to what}} {{occurred}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen. [...] "I'll stay {{to the end of the}} week," [...] the fireman was saying. [...] "I've paid in advance." ...|$|R
60|$|She leant <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her <b>chair,</b> <b>the</b> Doctor {{holding her}} hand, and {{standing}} by her side.|$|R
6000|$|Winton {{looked at}} her. How like--when {{she said that}} [...] "Please!" [...] How like--her figure sunk <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old <b>chair,</b> and <b>the</b> face lifted <b>in</b> shadow! A sort of exultation came to him. He had got her back--had got her back! ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the double}} line snapped. I fell {{back in the}} boat and Dan fell <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{threw herself}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> she had taken, and laughed {{as if this}} were the best joke in the world.|$|E
60|$|Captain Mitchell {{would lie}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> casting around looks of satisfaction, and tender {{over the table}} a case full of thick cigars.|$|E
60|$|The Marquis {{was leaning}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his <b>chair,</b> <b>the</b> {{tips of his}} long, elegant fingers pressed gently together.|$|R
60|$|Christie {{suddenly}} {{felt as if}} ten years had been added to her age, as she eyed the new-comer, who leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great <b>chair</b> talking to David, who stood on the rug, evidently finding it pleasanter {{to look at the}} vivacious face before him than at the fire.|$|R
6000|$|She leaned <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and let {{her hands}} rest quietly in her lap. [...] "Would you have {{preferred}} me to remain outside, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yacht, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured you? Or {{do you think that}} they, too, were got up to carry on a farce?" ...|$|R
60|$|The letter {{dropped from}} Sir Patrick's hand. He sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> stunned for the moment, under the shock {{that had fallen}} on him.|$|E
60|$|At {{this sudden}} {{announcement}} his partner became exceedingly interested. Leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{he stared at}} the decorated ceiling, and uttered his favourite wind-in-the-wires whistle.|$|E
60|$|His {{wrinkled}} {{face went}} ashy pale as {{the facts of}} the situation were borne in upon him, and he sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> with both hands uplifted as if in supplication.|$|E
50|$|Bart then {{finds himself}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> therapist's <b>chair,</b> and learns {{that what he}} {{experienced}} was just a neural implant. Bart and Lisa visit Marge and find out that she and Homer have finally gotten back together, and {{she gave him a}} new robot body and personality; Milhouse remains a zombie and Santa's Little Helper is seen talking.|$|R
40|$|Congratulation, Lawton!!” “…Sure {{is good to}} {{have one}} of our kind <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Governor’s <b>chair,</b> old buddy!” “Now we can agree on spending…!” “…and taxing!” “Hoo, boy… the good times are here again!” An {{editorial}} cartoon by Ed Gamble, the cartoon references Governor-Elect Lawton Chiles being welcomed to Tallahassee by the Democratic legislators. Box: 3 Folder: 4 [URL]...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but a {{glass of}} water, if you please," [...] he said, and Bessie rang and sent for some apollinaris, which Jeff drank a great goblet of when it came. Then he lay <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep <b>chair</b> he had taken, with the air of being ready for any little amusing thing she had to say.|$|R
60|$|He {{struck out}} and slapped the {{helpless}} boy heavily upon the cheek. Then, as Dick sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> {{he turned and}} left the cabin, closing and locking the door after him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My friend, I cannot speak,' said Sir Ratcliffe, {{throwing}} himself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{and covering}} {{his face with}} his right hand; 'I know not what to say; I know not what to feel.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, boys, {{have your}} own way; you {{are old enough to}} know what you are doing." [...] And now Mr. Rover sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> for even this brief {{conversation}} had almost exhausted him.|$|E
60|$|He put it {{down and}} sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his <b>chair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> foreign vagrant had been wont to sit on mornings {{when he came to}} preach philosophy.|$|R
60|$|So speaking, {{he tossed}} the cigar into a cuspidor. And Kwaque, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> queerest <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> which he had ever sat, was unaware {{that the end of}} his finger had been burned and roasted half an inch deep, and merely {{wondered}} when the medicine doctor would cease talking and begin looking at the swelling that hurt his side under his arm.|$|R
60|$|She {{read the}} letter, which was open in her hands, and he listened thoughtfully, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-backed oak <b>chair,</b> and {{watching}} <b>the</b> blue smoke from his cigarette curl upward to the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John lay <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{and put the}} {{newspaper}} over his face again. Patsy and her father stared at one another with grave intentness. Then the Major drew out his handkerchief and mopped his brow.|$|E
60|$|Emily {{crossed the}} room. The energy of her {{character}} was roused at last. She seized the foolish woman by the shoulders, forced her <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and looked her {{straight in the}} face without uttering a word.|$|E
6000|$|Anna leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{and laughed}} softly. Even {{this man had}} {{accepted}} her for [...] "Alcide" [...] without a moment's question. Then all the embarrassments of the matter flashed in upon her. She was suddenly grave.|$|E
60|$|He ceased, {{and there}} was silence. M. de Rivarol sat <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his <b>chair,</b> <b>the</b> {{feathered}} end of a quill between his teeth. Presently {{he cleared his throat}} and asked a question.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Heigho!' sighed Nicholas, as {{he threw}} himself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prompter's <b>chair,</b> after {{telegraphing}} <b>the</b> needful directions to Smike, who had been playing a meagre tailor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interlude, with one skirt to his coat, and a little pocket-handkerchief with a large hole in it, and a woollen nightcap, and a red nose, and other distinctive marks peculiar to tailors on the stage. 'Heigho! I wish all this were over.' ...|$|R
60|$|And here sat Grandfather all by himself. He {{knew that}} it was bedtime; yet he could not help longing to hear your merry voices, or to hold a {{comfortable}} chat with some old friend; because then his pillow would be visited by pleasant dreams. But, as neither children nor friends were at hand, Grandfather leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great <b>chair</b> and closed his eyes, for the sake of meditating more profoundly.|$|R
