Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>she</b> starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1991 Broadway {{production}} of Tru starring Robert Morse as Truman Capote {{was actually a}} request of {{the lawyer for the}} Capote Estate.

[...] Friends of Capote were amazed at her accuracy portraying a man she had only met but not known, and there was much question about how many of the lines are Capote's and how many Allen's; she maintained that at least 70% of the dialogue is Capote's own.|$|E
50|$|For some reason, Mikage's {{evolution}} stopped {{five years}} prior {{the start of}} the series.

However, the real reason for Mikage's stuck was her fear of evolving into a human being, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>once</b> <b>she</b> overcomes her fears she continues to gradually evolve into human.|$|R

While in Paris in 1919, the grand duchess received a letter from her husband's parents telling her that one-year-old Roman had died of an intestinal disorder in July.
