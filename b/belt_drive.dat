As {{written by}} Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> {{was first used}} for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles.

5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E

25|$|In 1896, {{managing}} director of the Lunéville plant, Adrien, Baron de Turckheim, bought the rights to a design by Amédée Bollée. This used a front-mounted horizontal twin engine with sliding clutches and <b>belt</b> <b>drive.</b> It had a folding top, three acetylene headlights, and, very unusual for the period, plate glass windshield. While the company started out using engines from Bollée, de Dietrich eventually produced the entire vehicle themselves.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of gear change mechanisms, known as derailleurs and hub gears. Both systems have {{advantages}} and disadvantages, and which is preferable depends on the particular circumstances. There are a few other relatively uncommon types of gear change mechanism which are briefly mentioned {{near the end of}} this section. Derailleur mechanisms can only be used with chain drive transmissions, so bicycles with <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> or shaft drive transmissions must either be single speed or use hub gears.|$|E
25|$|Around 1873 {{the firm}} {{supplied}} two blowing engines {{to the huge}} Krupp steelworks at Essen, Germany. It was in this decade that the company began to install flat <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> systems for the transfer of power from its stationary steam engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. This technique was common in the US but rare in Britain until this time: the advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, {{and it was a}} more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, the American bolt-on Whizzer gas-engined bicycle kit was introduced, {{utilizing}} a 138cc side-valve four-stroke engine, the first whizzer {{was of the}} friction drive variety, but was soon replaced with <b>belt</b> <b>drive.</b> Despite some initial engine reliability issues, the Whizzer enjoyed modest popularity during World War II due to fuel and automobile shortages, and was used by war plant workers and others with priority for transportation. After the war, the Whizzer became popular with youth who desired faster speeds from their heavy cruiser-framed Schwinn bicycles. In 1949, the company introduced a complete production bike, the Pacemaker. Sales of the Whizzer conversion kits continued until 1962. In the United Kingdom, the motorized bicycle saw a resurgence of popularity and such bolt-on motors as the Cyclaid and the Cyclemaster motor wheel saw brief periods of immense popularity. The Cyclemaster, which was a hub motor that could be fitted to an ordinary bike, started at 25cc (painted black), but later the size went up to 32cc (painted grey).|$|E
