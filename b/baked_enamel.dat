50|$|The Esso Standard Oil Service Station is {{a former}} {{automobile}} service station at 1600 West 3rd Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a single story rectangular building, built out of concrete blocks and finished with a <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> on steel exterior. It has three service bays on the left side, with original overhead glass-paned doors, and an office and sales space on the right side. The right side has a short canopy protruding from it, also built of concrete with a <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> finish. Built in 1957, it is a rare mid-century service station in the city.|$|E
50|$|The {{inside of}} a {{dishwasher}} in the North American market is either stainless steel or plastic. Stainless steel tubs resist hard water, provide better sound damping, and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly. They also come at a premium price. Older models used <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> on steel and are prone to chipping and erosion; chips in the <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> finish must be cleaned of all dirt and corrosion then patched with a special compound or even a good quality two-part epoxy. All European-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard, even on low end models. The {{same is true for}} a built-in water softener.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{frequent}} {{collaborator of}} Grandhomme's was Jules Brateau, a silversmith and metal-worker. [...] Grandhomme used his flat as his studio, with his dining {{room as the}} main area of work, and using a furnace in his kitchen to <b>bake</b> the <b>enamel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{coated metal}} roofing tiles {{to be made}} in New Zealand were {{produced}} by Martile Roofing Ltd in Howick in 1956 and were pressed from an aluminium manganese alloy. They were then coated with High <b>Bake</b> <b>Enamel.</b> By 1957, L.J. Fisher had bought the rights to use the Martile profile from A.L.W. Martinsen and Son Ltd and was producing his own tile. Part of the condition of the rights purchase was that Fisher’s four-pan tile with its bitumastic emulsion coating was to be made from galvanised steel, thereby ensuring a different product.He formed LJ Fisher & Co. Ltd. (LJF) in 1957. In 1969, LJF merged with Alex Harvey & Sons and the New Zealand activities of Australian Consolidated Industries, forming Alex Harvey Industries (AHI), with AHI Roofing Pty Ltd being its subsidiary.|$|R

50|$|Early on, Bartlett made {{a number}} of {{three-dimensional}} works that she subjected to extreme conditions such as freezing and smashing. She also realized that she wanted something to draw on that was erasable but gridded like the graph paper that she and many other Conceptual artists were using at the time. She came up with what is now one of her signature materials: foot-square steel plates with a plain white <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> surface on which was silkscreened a quarter-inch grid. She had these fabricated in large quantities, and later worked with other sizes as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{pesticide}} products, DEGBE {{acts as an}} inert ingredient as a deactivator for formulation {{before the}} crop emerges from the soil and as a stabilizer. DEGBE is also a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of {{diethylene glycol monobutyl ether}} acetate, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether, and piperonyl acetate, and as a solvent in high <b>baked</b> <b>enamels.</b> Other applications of DEGBE are as a dispersant for vinyl chloride resins in organosols, a diluent for hydraulic brake fluids, and a mutual solvent for soap, oil, and water in household cleaners. The textile industry uses DEGBE as a wetting-out solution. DEGBE is also a solvent for nitrocellulose, oils, dyes, gums, soaps, and polymers. DEGBE is also used as coupling solvent in liquid cleaners, cutting fluids, and textile auxiliaries. In the printing industry, DEGBE applications include: solvent in lacquers, paints, and printing inks; high boiling point solvent to improve gloss and flow properties; and used as a solubilizer in mineral oil products.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} prototype, {{the body for}} the {{production}} Kaiser Darrin was made of fiberglass. More resilient than aluminum, fiberglass did not rot or corrode, was lightweight and more pliable than steel to mold into shape. The molds were far less expensive than the tooling needed to bend and shape steel. This could theoretically make a fiberglass-bodied car economical for a small private manufacturer such as Kaiser to produce. The body was molded in two sections, minus deck lid, doors and hood. Underneath, the frame rails of the Henry J were modified {{to allow for a}} lower ride height, the steering ratio altered and the spring and damping rates changed to match the lighter body. The car was offered initially in four colors—Champagne Lacquer (white), Red Sail Lacquer, Yellow Satin Lacquer, and Pine Tint Lacquer (green)—with lacquer paints specified because fiberglass could not withstand the temperatures needed to <b>bake</b> <b>enamel</b> onto it. Tritt's company, Glasspar, was commissioned to produce bodies for the production model. However, Glasspar produced only a handful of these. The remaining 435 were produced in-house by Kaiser. Glasspar did continue to produce the deck lids (truck, top compartment, and engine hood) and doors.|$|R
50|$|Bernard {{and wife}} Flo’ left their home, White House, 4 The Redoubt, Castlecrag, Sydney, in 1962 {{and moved to}} 21 Travers Place, North Adelaide. He was {{attracted}} by the Adelaide Festival and easy access to facilities for firing his vitreous enamel paintings on steel plates. Bernard cultivated executives of the Adelaide-based Simpson home-appliance company, who let him <b>bake</b> his <b>enamels</b> with their fridges and stoves (he paid them off in pictures). This gave him the vital entry that no-one else had. By the 1970s such white-goods were no longer made from enamelled metal, and this and his advancing age restricted his activities.|$|R
50|$|The PSO-1 was {{specifically}} designed for the SVD as a telescopic sight for military designated marksman activities. The current version of the sight is the PSO-1M2. This telescopic sight {{is different from the}} original PSO-1 only in that it lacks the now obsolete infrared detector. The metal body of the PSO-1 is made from a magnesium alloy. The PSO-1 features a battery-powered red illuminated reticle with light provided by a simple diode bulb. It features professionally ground, fully multi-coated optical elements, a <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> finish for scratch protection, and an attached, quick-deployable, extendable sunshade.|$|E
50|$|The best {{shelving}} {{for books}} is <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side {{so they can}} support each other. If a book {{is removed from the}} shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality. Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum. Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleus of}} the Stoner 63 system is the {{receiver}} which is a rectangular sheet metal pressing. The gas cylinder, support structures, brackets, lugs and other devices are welded in place. The front portion carries the piston and barrel and is perforated to reduce weight and improve air circulation around the barrel and gas cylinder. The rear segment holds the piston extension and bolt group. The ejection port {{is on the right}} side when the receiver is inverted and the weapon is configured as a rifle or carbine and on the left side when in the various machine gun roles. The various components are phosphate finished and then coated with a black <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> finish called Endurion. Early examples of the Stoner 63 were delivered with all wood furniture, however these were soon replaced with black polycarbonate parts {{with the exception of the}} handguard, which remained wood, but was painted black.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} {{housing is}} a steel-reinforced aluminium extrusion {{finished with a}} <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> coating. It holds the steel bearings for the barrel lugs and the guide rods. The non-reciprocating plastic charging handle works in a slot {{on the left side}} of the receiver and is connected with the bolt carrier's left guide rod. The charging handle has a forward assist feature—alternatively called a [...] "silent charging device"—used for pushing the bolt shut without recharging the rifle. A bolt hold-open device locks the bolt carrier assembly back after the last round has been fired. The newer AUG A3s possess a bolt release button, prior to this development all AUGs and the USR required the charging handle being retracted to release the bolt group after a new magazine has been inserted. Older versions of the AUG can be upgraded to use the newer A3 stock and in turn the button release; however, it requires they also upgrade other key parts as well including the hammer pack.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Allen Boyer (September 30, 1909 in Toledo, Ohio [...] - [...] November 11, 1989 in Dunedin, Florida) was {{a chemist}} {{employed}} by Henry Ford, {{he was extremely}} proficient at inventing ways to convert soybeans into paints and plastic parts used on Ford automobiles.Robert Allen Boyer, your average “B” chemistry student was given an extraordinary opportunity that changed his future {{and the future of}} automobile production in the U.S. (Plastic) Boyer, born on 30 September 1909 in Toledo, Ohio was given this chance when Ford hired his father to run the nation's oldest hotel, the Wayside Inn, in South Sudbury, Massachusetts. Ford frequented the inn and that is where Boyer was discovered. Ford claimed that Boyer had a “keen active mind”. He asked Boyer to enroll in the new Henry Ford Trade School and participate in its unique work-study program instead of following his plans to enter Andover prep school and then Dartmouth College (Shurtleff). Boyer excelled in the Ford Trade School and took to exploring concepts such as how to manufacture synthetic wool from soybeans. These were the types of problems that stumped the experts (Plastic). Boyer graduated the Ford Trade School at the age of 21 with a promising chemistry career in front of him. He started this career {{as the head of the}} soybean lab at the Edison Institute (Shurtleff). Here Boyer’s career took off. He started working to use soybeans in ways they had never been used before. Boyer has done things from extracting lubricating and paint oils from the soybean to creating a synthetic wool made from soybeans and pressing insulating varnish for starters and generators (Plastic). One of Boyer’s first projects began in 1932 and included building “a small solvent extractor to separate the bean into soy oil and protein-rich meal” (Shurtleff). The soybean oil became the most crucial commercial soy products on Ford cars. In 1934 the five to eight coats of lacquer that cars previously had been finished with was replaced with a synthetic <b>baked</b> <b>enamel</b> paint which contained about 35% soy oil. This new synthetic paint with soy oil saved considerable time and money. In 1937, Boyer developed a curved plastic sheet which he hoped would replace steel in the auto bodies of ford cars. He was so confident in his product that he took an axe to it in the middle of a crowd of reporters and critics. He also jumped up and down on the curved sheet. When there was no bending in the sheet and no shattering due to the axe and the weight of him jumping on the sheet, people were astounded (shurtleff). This soy protein plastic sheet consist of 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder pressed into cloth. “The new rust-free, dent-proof plastic was reportedly 50% lighter and 50% cheaper to produce than steel” (Shurtleff). This new plastic body cut the total weight of the car from 3,000 lb. to 2,000 (Dearborn). The sheets look like polished steel and can be bent but just snap back into place, therefor when caught in fender benders, the fender would bounce back like “rubber balls” (Shurtleff). Needless to say, this product was a breakthrough in the world of automobile production. Boyer also used the soy isolates to produce the world's first plant protein fiber in 1938. (Shurtleff.) This fiber resembled a soft wool, it was tan in color, had a medium luster and a soft warm feel. “it has 80% the strength of wool, took the same dyes, had good elongation, and did not wet as easily as wool.”(Shurtleff). Boyer figured this fiber could be used for upholstery in cars, filling in felt hats, or for clothing. Boyer changed the way the soybean was used and created innovative products we use daily.|$|E
