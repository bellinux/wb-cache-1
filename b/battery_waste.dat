Monitoring of collection rate of the separate battery stream is important for decision making, in particular for implementing interventions to improve the separate {{collection and}} evaluating their results. Limitations of the currently applied method for the estimation of battery collection rate are discussed and a new method, which improves the estimation, is suggested. The method utilizes a more accurate way of estimating the total <b>battery</b> <b>waste</b> generation. This estimation is based on batteries historical consumption estimated with material flow analysis method and distributions of batteries lifespan obtained from empirical data. Empirical data from two decades of battery consumption and disposal in Sweden were analyzed and lifespan distributions have been found for eight different types of batteries by dating over 5000 disposed batteries. The lifespans stretched from 1 to 28 years, with a median lifespan of 3 – 8 years. It is shown how the use of lifespan distributions in the suggested method could considerably improve the estimation of the collection rate. Consequently, the intervention potentials can be identified more accurately and the decision making for investments in the collection system can be improved.

As battery {{producers and}} vendors, legislators {{and the consumer}} population {{become more aware of}} the consequences of inappropriate disposal {{of a wide variety of}} battery types to landfill sites instead of responsible chemical neutralization and re-use, the topic of battery recycling has begun to appear as a priority on the environmental agenda. In the UK alone estimates of annual consumption are close to 300 million units and the domestic waste stream load is about 30, 000 tonnes. The end-of-life treatment that batteries receive in different European community member states, America and Asia differs very significantly and the percentage of household cells recycled ranges from almost zero to a modest high of about 50 % of annual sales. With current estimates of global per capita and per annum battery consumption of 330 g, even this best-case figure leaves a massive residue of untreated <b>battery</b> <b>waste</b> to enter municipal landfill sites.
