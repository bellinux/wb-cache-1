5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the <b>building</b> <b>had</b> lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that <b>building</b> <b>had</b> to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} earlier {{renovation}} attempts, authorities were considering the complete demolition of the 130-year-old Christchurch Cathedral. The <b>building</b> <b>had</b> become structurally compromised {{due to the}} collapse of its western wall, and the strong vibration had shattered its stained glass rose window. Similar damage was inflicted to the Christchurch Arts Centre, although it had been in a precarious state prior to the event. A three-month reconstruction project was scheduled to take place starting in October 2011, with associated costs estimated at NZ$30 million (US$24 million). The tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station, which sustained damage from the February 2011 earthquake, collapsed after plans to dismantle the <b>building</b> <b>had</b> been initiated. Lyttelton Port, a major harbour in the region, suffered additional damage from the tremors and opted to initiate full engineering assessments. The multi-story HSBC Tower shook considerably during the quake, though damage was limited to cracks and broken roof tiles. Artifacts from the Canterbury Museum collection were thrown into disorder by the aftershocks, several days after reordering work had been completed since the February 2011 earthquake. In all, experts believed the earthquake would increase reconstruction costs in Christchurch by approximately NZ$6 billion (US$4.83 billion).|$|E
