5|$|The route was paved between Owings and Edgewater by 1946. MD 2 from Owings to Edgewater {{starting}} receiving {{its first}} major upgrades in the 1950s, including several relocations of the highway. The bypassed portions of MD 2 became segments of MD 778, {{with the letter}} suffix on the highway designation corresponding to the order the sections were bypassed. The highway from Edgewater south to Harwood (then known as Butlers) was widened and resurfaced with <b>bituminous</b> stabilized gravel in 1950 and 1951. MD 2 from Harwood south to Lothian was widened and resurfaced with <b>bituminous</b> stabilized gravel in 1952 and 1953. Old Solomons Island Road between Harwood Road and Polling House Road in Harwood remained {{part of the state}} highway system until 1987.|$|E
5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from <b>bituminous</b> coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|Minerals in the {{watershed}} are mostly <b>bituminous</b> coal, fireclay, sandstone and slate. The daily loads of aluminum and manganese are both many {{times higher than}} the creek's total maximum daily load. The conductance of the creek ranges from 93.7 to 549 micro-siemens per centimeter. The creek {{is one of the most}} downstream tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River contributing acid mine drainage to it.|$|E
5|$|Pocono {{sandstone}} {{can also}} be found in the watershed, and <b>bituminous</b> coal formations known as the Clarion Formation, the Lower Kittanning Formation and the Eagleton Coal field also exist in the creek's watershed. The valley of Tangascootack Creek is the only place in Bald Eagle Township where there are significant deposits of minerals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to NIT, Norfolk {{is home to}} Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, with an annual throughput of approximately 48,000,000 tons. <b>Bituminous</b> coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The coal is loaded onto trains {{and sent to the}} port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of <b>bituminous</b> concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.|$|E
5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the <b>Bituminous</b> Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 1958, the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County {{signed a}} road {{transfer}} agreement to turn maintenance of MD 537B {{outside the town}} of Chesapeake City to county maintenance. However, the portion of MD 537B from US 213 to the north town limit was returned to state maintenance through an August 22, 1961, road transfer agreement. MD 285 and MD 537B were resurfaced with <b>bituminous</b> concrete in 1971 and 1976, respectively. The intersection of MD 537B and MD 284 was transformed from a tangent intersection to the present orthogonal intersection in 1982. The following year, the portion of MD 537B between MD 213 and the intersection of Biddle and Lock streets was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD 285.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segments}} of {{road in the}} location of what would become FM 1528 existed by the year of 1936. On September 26, 1939, a portion of road traveling from SH 24 to the community of Klondike was designated as Spur Highway 39 (Spur 39). and on September 28, 1949, through {{the order of the}} Texas Transportation Board, FM 1528 was designated, and Spur 39 was redesignated as part of the highway. In 1961, the highway had a <b>bituminous</b> surface, a combination of gravel and asphalt. By 1987, the highway had been minorly rerouted and straightened, and the entire length had been paved. Between 1986 and 1991, the highway's route was minorly rerouted between Klondike and Cooper, due to the construction of Cooper Lake.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} <b>bituminous</b> coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a <b>bituminous</b> surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E
5|$|By 1956, {{the surface}} of RM 2134 had been {{upgraded}} to stone, and the northern portion had been additionally straightened. On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a <b>bituminous</b> surface, made of asphalt and crushed rock. The other road segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, {{and it had been}} straightened generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved for the construction of the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, 15 {{years of}} {{explosive}} development began {{under the leadership}} of Collis P. Huntington, whose new Peninsula Extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway from Richmond opened up transportation along the Peninsula and provided a new pathway for the railroad to bring West Virginia <b>bituminous</b> coal to port for coastal shipping and worldwide export. With the new railroad came a terminal and coal piers where the colliers were loaded. Within a few years, Huntington and his associates also built a large shipyard. In 1896, the new incorporated town of Newport News, which had briefly replaced Denbigh as the county seat of Warwick County, had a population of 9,000. In 1958, by mutual consent by referendum, Newport News was consolidated with the former Warwick County (itself a separate city from 1952 to 1958), rejoining the two localities to approximately their pre-1896 geographic size. The more widely known name of Newport News was selected as they formed what was then Virginia's third largest independent city in population.|$|E
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using <b>bituminous</b> coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, <b>bituminous</b> and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E
5|$|The first upgrade of MD234 was a {{relocation}} at Allens Fresh Run, {{which included}} replacing a dangerous one-way {{bridge over the}} stream, that was completed in 1933. MD237 was reconstructed with a <b>bituminous</b> stabilized gravel surface between Clements and Leonardtown in 1950 and 1951, a project that included new bridges over Clements Creek at a spot known as Head-of-the-Bay and over Nelson Run near Leonardtown. Reconstruction of MD234 from Allens Fresh to Chaptico and MD237 from there to Clements occurred between 1959 and 1961. MD234 and MD237 were significantly straightened out, leaving behind many sections of old alignment: Glasva School Road in Allens Fresh; Allens Fresh Road between Allens Fresh and Newport; Stines Store Road in Newport; Plater Road and Olde Mill Road in Wicomico; Stone Corner Lane, which is unsigned MD868G, and Reed Road in Budds Creek; and Horse Shoe Road between Chaptico and Clements. The project also involved new bridges over Gilbert Swamp Run, Chaptico Creek, and Budds Creek. When the project was completed in 1961, MD234 assumed the course of MD237 between Chaptico and Leonardtown and MD238 was extended over the segment of MD234 between Chaptico and Helen.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of MD291 was reconstructed between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s. The highway was reconstructed from the Morgan Creek bridge to west of Morgnec in 1964; this project featured a curve-smoothing realignment {{on the east}} side of the bridge. MD291 was reconstructed from US213 to Morgan Creek in 1965 and 1966; the bypassed highway at the US213 end, now Hadaway Drive, became another segment of MD859. MD291 was extended west from US213 to MD20 as new construction in 1968 and 1969; this extension had been planned as an extension of MD447 as early as 1958. Work shifted to the original stretch of MD291 in the late 1960s, when the highway was resurfaced with <b>bituminous</b> concrete from US301 to the east side of Millington in 1967. The highway was reconstructed from MD290 to US301 in 1971. The reconstruction of the highway concluded with a curve being smoothed east of Millington in 1974 and the highway being resurfaced from Millington to the state line in 1975. MD291's bridge across US301 and its roundabouts with the two segments of MD701 to provide access to US301 were constructed in 1998 and 1999. The roundabout at MD291's western terminus was built in 2014.|$|E
5|$|US 213 {{was moved}} to the new Chesapeake City Bridge, and MD 537 was {{assigned}} to the bypassed portions of highway approaching and within Chesapeake City. On May 8, 1958, the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County signed a road transfer agreement to turn maintenance of the approach roads outside the town of Chesapeake City to county maintenance. These roads included all of MD 537A, most of MD 537D, and much of MD 537B. The portion of MD 537B from US 213 to the north town limit was returned to state maintenance through an August 22, 1961, road transfer agreement. All three segments of MD 537 were resurfaced with <b>bituminous</b> concrete in 1976. The intersection of MD 537B and MD 284 was transformed from a tangent intersection to the present orthogonal intersection in 1982. The following year, the portion of MD 537B between MD 213 and MD 285's then western terminus at the intersection of Biddle and Lock streets was renumbered as an extension of MD 285. The remainder of MD 537B not maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was transferred to Chesapeake City in 2015.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to <b>bituminous</b> coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to the state}} highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border, passing through Leonardtown, Hughesville, and Waldorf. MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 (now US 301) between Waldorf and TB. In 1928, the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs. By 1933, MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border. Also, the route was extended south along an unpaved road into Point Lookout State Park. In 1939, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border {{was designated}} as MD 637. DC 5 continued into Washington, D.C. along Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, and 11th Street SE to DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue SE). By this time, the section of route between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a <b>bituminous</b> road. By 1946, MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown. Also, DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along Pennsylvania Avenue to US 1 and US 240 at {{the east side of}} the White House. In 1949, the DC 5 designation was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|US113's {{southern}} terminus {{was moved}} to its present intersection after US13's bypass of Pocomoke City was completed in 1961; the segment of highway between US13 and MD675 (now US13 Business) became an extension of MD 250A. The original Pocomoke City bypass from US 13 to MD 756 was resurfaced with <b>bituminous</b> concrete in 1969, the same year work began to establish a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill. The second, northbound carriageway of the highway was constructed from east of Pilchard Creek to Blades Road between 1969 and 1971 and from Blades Road to {{the south end of}} the Snow Hill bypass in 1970 and 1971. US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from its US 13 intersection to east of Pilchard Creek, over which a new bridge was built for the northbound carriageway, starting in 1972. The now-bypassed 1936 Pocomoke City bypass was redesignated MD 359 after the completion of the new bypass in late 1974. The two-lane Snow Hill bypass was built as the southbound carriageway of an eventual divided highway from its south end to MD 12 in 1971 and 1972 and from MD 12 to north of Snow Hill between 1973 and 1975; the latter section included a three-span bridge across Purnell Branch. The bypassed portion of US 113 through Snow Hill became MD 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting.|$|E
5|$|Field {{survey for}} the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an {{official}} groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place. The {{first section of}} the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run Gap to Thornton Gap. The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, Congress approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct Skyline Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run Gap. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would have {{a hand in the}} construction of Skyline Drive. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along Skyline Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes {{on both sides of the}} roadway, built guardrails and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for <b>bituminous</b> surfacing of the road. The section of Skyline Drive between Thornton Gap and Swift Run Gap opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge Bureau of Public Roads and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build Skyline Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton Gap at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of Skyline Drive from Swift Run Gap to Jarman Gap was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman Gap and Rockfish Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of Skyline Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of Skyline Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, MD 5 was rerouted {{to follow}} Branch Avenue to the Washington, D.C. border, {{replacing}} MD 637; MD 637 was designated onto Naylor Road between MD 5 and the Washington, D.C. border by 1966. In addition, the route was widened into a divided highway along the US 301 concurrency between the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB and along Branch Avenue between {{south of the}} Henson Creek and the Washington, D.C. border. MD 5 was upgraded from a <b>bituminous</b> to a paved road between St. Mary's City and Great Mills in 1953. The same year, the portion of route along the US 301 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border was widened into a divided highway. MD 5 was relocated to a new alignment to the east between TB and north of Camp Springs in 1956, with a northward extension of MD 381 designated onto the former alignment. This section of MD 381, called Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue, was transferred to county maintenance in 1965. In 1959, MD 5 was paved between south of St. Inigoes and St. Mary's City. A year later, {{the remainder of the}} route south to Point Lookout was paved. In 1962, MD 5 was widened into a divided highway between south of Newmarket and the St. Mary's-Charles county border and between MD 223 in Clinton and Camp Springs. An interchange was built at the northern terminus of the US 301 concurrency in 1963. The route was upgraded to a divided highway in the Beantown area in 1964. In 1965, MD 5 was improved to a divided highway between MD 235 and south of Newmarket. The divided highway was extended south from Beantown to the MD 488 intersection in 1966. In 1967, the route was widened into a divided highway between the St. Mary's-Charles county border and MD 488 {{with the exception of the}} portion through Hughesville. MD 5 was upgraded to a divided highway between US 301 and MD 223 in 1969. An interchange was constructed at MD 414 in 1970.|$|E
