Dynamic models of the HEV powertrains such as engine, motor, and mode clutch are derived for the transient state during the mode change, and the HEV performance simulator is developed. Using the HEV performance <b>bench</b> <b>tester,</b> {{the characteristics of the}} mode clutch torque are measured and the motor torque required for the mode clutch synchronization is determined. Based on the dynamic models and the mode clutch torque, a motor torque control algorithm is presented for mode changes, and motor control without the ISG is investigated and compared with the existing ISG control...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{thermodynamic}} {{performance of}} R 170 /R 290 mixture is {{measured on a}} heat pump <b>bench</b> <b>tester</b> {{in an attempt to}} substitute R 22. The <b>bench</b> <b>tester</b> is equipped with a commercial hermetic rotary compressor providing a nominal capacity of 3. 5 Â kW. All tests are conducted under the summer cooling and winter heating conditions of 7 / 45 Â Â°C and - 7 / 41 Â Â°C in the evaporator and condenser, respectively. During the tests, the composition in R 170 /R 290 mixture is varied from 0 % to 10 % with an interval of 2 %. Test results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) and capacity of R 290 are up to 15. 4 % higher and 7. 5 % lower, respectively than those of R 22 for two conditions. For R 170 /R 290 mixture, the COP decreases and the capacity increases with an increase in the composition of R 170. The mixture of R 170 /R 290 mixture at 4 %/ 96 % composition shows the similar capacity and COP as those of R 22. For the mixture, the compressor discharge temperature is 17 - 28 Â Â°C lower than that of R 22. For R 170 /R 290 mixture, there is no problem with mineral oil since the mixture is composed of hydrocarbons. The amount of charge is reduced up to 58 % as compared to R 22. Overall, R 170 /R 290 mixture is a good long term [`]drop-in' candidate from the view point of energy efficiency and greenhouse warming to replace R 22 in residential air-conditioners and heat pumps.

R 433 A has no ozone depletion potential and very low greenhouse warming potential of less than 5. R 433 A also offers a similar vapor pressure to HCFC 22 for possible [`]drop-in' replacement. Test {{results showed that the}} coefficient of performance of R 433 A is 4. 9 - 7. 6 % higher than that of HCFC 22 while the capacity of R 433 A is 1. 0 - 5. 5 % lower than that of HCFC 22 for both conditions. The compressor discharge temperature of R 433 A is 22. 6 - 27. 9 Â Â°C lower than that of HCFC 22 while the amount of charge for R 433 A is 57. 0 - 57. 7 % lower than that of HCFC 22 due to its low density. Overall, R 433 A is a good long term environmentally friendly alternative to replace HCFC 22 in residential air-conditioners and heat pumps due to its excellent thermodynamic and environmental properties with minor adjustments.

40|$|The wear of {{the piston}} ring-cylinder wall contact area in fired engines {{has not been}} satisfactorily {{simulated}} in <b>bench</b> <b>testers</b> so far. This paper reports {{the development of a}} successful test device in which the same progression of surface change occurs as in fired engines. These changes were observed by microscopy, by hardness indentations and by the use of the stylus roughness tracer. The test device uses ring and cylinder segments and it oscillates at 350 cycles min- 1 over a stroke of 19 mm. It is apparently not necessary to duplicate the temperature, atmosphere, fluid film thickness and other obvious conditions in an engine to achieve simulation. At least, the materials in the engine were not affected by the conditions in the engine that were not duplicated in the laboratory tester. The purpose in developing the tester was to study the role of the honed roughness pattern found on most cylinder walls. Several engine manufacturers attempt to achieve "fplateau honing". No manufacturer polishes new cylinder walls. The reason for the honed roughness is to allow a high wear rate, without catastrophic scuffing, in locations of high stress between poorly conforming parts...|$|R

40|$|Summary Segregation is {{a complex}} {{mechanism}} that leads to separation of various particulate fractions in bulk solids. The nucleation and acceleration of segregation can potentially happen at various stages in the process or handling of a given bulk particulate. Any bulk solid composed of particulates under 50 μm size range and exhibiting variations in particle characteristics can be susceptible to air induced segregation. The pharmaceutical sector uses many types of dry powders exhibiting these characteristics in various manufacturing processes and products. The presented work was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility of an exemplar pharmaceutical blend to segregate {{under the influence of}} counter current air-flow using a <b>bench</b> size <b>tester.</b> The results of the segregation tests have then been used to predict the variation in the fine particles (often active content) of the bulk particulate. The techniques for minimising segregation are largely dependent on establishing the most dominant mode governing the segregation mechanism (in particular process and handling conditions). The air induced segregation tester {{has been shown to be}} a useful and reliable tool for predicting the propensity of fine powder blends to be susceptible to counter air current segregation, while the QPM segregation tester has been proven to indicate the propensity for surface segregatio...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{undertaken}} using a lubricated iron alloy powder to analyse rolling segregation using a novel <b>bench</b> size segregation <b>tester.</b> Bulk particulates charcaterised by small particle sizes, narrow size distributions, free-flowing natures, high particle densities and high inter-particle forces of attraction; necessitate {{the use of}} a very careful experimental procedure to obtain repeatable results. A 16 cup spinning riffler has been used to obtain representative samples and dry sieving has been used to obtain particle size distributions. The effect of height of discharge on surface effect segregation within the heap has also been analysed for an iron alloy powder. Close tolerances in powder quality are necessary for efficient production, and control of these tolerances can only be achieved by detailed analysis of materials and processes. The quantification and identification of segregation effects has been a challenge, especially in the field of powder metallurgy. This study attempts to quantify segregation and is considered as a first step towards the prediction of segregation behaviour for general powders...|$|R
40|$|Global {{planarization}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} demands of the semiconductor industry. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is the planarization method of choice use to achieve the required stringent tolerances essential for successful fabrication of next generation Integrated Circuits (IC). The predominant reason for CMP defects is the shear and normal stresses during polishing to which the material is subjected. Understanding the process of CMP and factor that contribute to overall stress addition during polishing requires an approach that encompasses all the four major categories of variables, namely: a) machine parameters, b) material properties, c) polishing pad characteristics, and d) polishing slurry performance. In this research, we studied the utilized in-situ technique involving acoustic emission (AE) signal monitoring and coefficient of friction (COF) monitoring using a CETRTM <b>Bench</b> Top CMP <b>Tester</b> to evaluate the impact of variation in machine parameters on the CMP process. The mechanical and tribological properties of different candidate materials have been evaluated bring potential challenges in their integration to the fore. The study also involves destructive and non destructive testing of polishing pads performed for characterization and optimization of polishing pad architecture. Finally, the investigation concludes proposing novel nanoparticle CMP slurry which has a predominant chemical component in its polishing mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) {{has emerged}} as the central {{technology}} for polishing wafers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry to make integrated multi-level devices. As the name suggests, both chemical and mechanical processes work simultaneously to achieve local and global planarization. In spite of extensive work done to understand the various components and parameters affecting the performance of this process, many aspects of CMP remain poorly understood. Among these aspects of CMP is the role of abrasives in the processes of conditioning and polishing. These abrasives are present in the chemical slurry between the wafer and the pad for polishing and play an important role during the conditioning to regenerate the clogged polishing pads. This thesis has focused on the study of abrasives, both in conditioning and polishing. The first part of the thesis concentrates on the effect of abrasive size for conditioning purposes. Diamond is being widely used as an abrasive for conditioning the polishing pad. Five different sizes of diamonds ranging from 0. 25 µm to 100 µm were selected to condition the commercially available IC 1000 polishing pad. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis were carried out on the pad to study the effect of the abrasive size on the pad morphology. In-situ 2 ̆ 7 coefficient of friction 2 ̆ 7 was also monitored on the CETR <b>bench</b> top <b>Tester.</b> The final impact was seen in the form of surface defects on the polished copper wafers. As pad morphologies resulting from different conditioning affect contact areas, {{the second part of the}} thesis focuses on developing a simple method to quantify the area of contact between the wafer and pad using optical microscopy. Optical images that were obtained were analyzed for the change in contact area with the change in operating conditions. Finally, the third part of the thesis details the synthesis and characterization of nano-zirconia for potential slurry applications. Nano-zirconia was synthesized using the plasma route and then characterized using different analytical techniques like TEM and XRD. These nanoparticles were then used to make abrasive slurry for oxide CMP and the polished wafers were analyzed for surface defects...|$|R
