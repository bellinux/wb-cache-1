40|$|The present {{investigation}} aimed {{to study the}} impact of self-concept and environment of the classroom in disruptive behaviors, {{as well as the}} influence of these <b>behaviors</b> <b>on</b> <b>grades</b> in two state schools in the north of Portugal, through 3 questionnaires (PHCSCS- 2, APSA and EDEP) to 425 students of the compulsory Portuguese schooling. It was found that with the increase of self-concept and improve the environment of the classroom are less frequent disruptive behaviors, increasing thus the academic achievement of students (Portuguese language and mathematics), which stresses the importance of these constructs in the success school. Educational implications are discussed at these levels of education...|$|R
5000|$|Parents {{of middle-class}} {{children}} {{make use of}} their social capital {{when it comes to}} their children's education as they seek out other parents and teachers for advice. Some parents even develop regular communication with their child's teachers, asking for regular reports <b>on</b> <b>behavior</b> and <b>grades.</b> When problems do occur, middle-class parents are quick to [...] "enlist the help of professionals when they feel their children need such services."

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the short-term and {{long-term effects of}} maternal employment on adolescent children’s outcomes, namely, <b>on</b> <b>behavior</b> and <b>grades</b> at school and on total years of education. Because a mother’s decision to work depends heavily on her husband’s socioeconomic characteristics in Japan, IV methods were employed {{to deal with this}} self-selection problem. The results show that maternal full-time employment itself does not hinder adolescents’ human capital development. Rather, maternal full-time work prevents sons from smoking at school, although the path of this phenomenon should be carefully examined with more detailed data. Effects of maternal employment are not observed for sons’ or daughters’ educational attainment after controlling for family and school characteristics...|$|R
