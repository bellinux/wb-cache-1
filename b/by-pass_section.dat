50|$|It resumes {{the route}} of the Great North Road. At the point where it runs {{parallel}} to runway of the former RAF Dishforth at Norton-le-Clay, it joins {{the route of}} the Roman road Dere Street. The road becomes the parish boundary between Marton-le-Moor and Dishforth. At Dishforth, the road leaves Dere Street and forms part of junction 49 of the A1(M). The A1 junction was planned in the 1970s to be the northern terminus of the A6183, a motorway-standard road that bypassed Leeds to the west from Kirkhamgate, north-west of Wakefield. The scheme was eventually condensed into the A1-M1 motorway link road and the improvement of the A1 to Dishforth. The A168 becomes the main route from the A1 to Teesside, joining the short section of the A168(M), and a trunk road. The former route went through Dishforth, to the south. The South of Topcliffe and Asenby By-pass, including Dishforth <b>by-pass</b> <b>section</b> was built in 1970, connecting with the A1 at the Dishforth Roundabout. At Asenby, the A167 leaves to the left, which is the former route of the A168, and the A168 bypasses Asenby and Topcliffe, crossing the River Swale, and consequently entering the district of Hambleton. The Topcliffe and Asenby By-pass was built in the late 1960s. There is a left turn for Topcliffe, the A167, also for RAF Topcliffe (which is still operational), and access to the east for Dalton and the former RAF Dalton. RAF Dishforth, Dalton, and Topcliffe were all used by No. 6 Group RCAF during the Second World War. It rejoins the former route. The South of Thirsk By-pass to north of Topcliffe and Asenby <b>By-pass</b> <b>section</b> opened in the late 1960s. In the parish of Topcliffe, there is a left turn for Sowerby, the B1448, the former route of the A168. The road becomes part of the Thirsk bypass, and at Sowerby crosses the East Coast Main Line, then Cod Beck. At Pudding Pie Hill it meets the A170 at a grade-separated junction, where the road continues as the A19 to Teesside. The improvements from the A1 to Thirsk in the late 1960s originally included classifying that section as the A19, not the A168. The Thirsk by-pass opened as the A19 in September 1972.|$|E

However, the complex relationship between these physical factors (mainly available habitat, water temperature, discharge, sediment transport) and the biological response is not yet clearly understood in either natural or regulated streams. In order to investigate this relationship, {{it is essential to}} understand how the influences of these physical factors differ in time and space. In the present study, we analyzed the spatio- emporal patterns of fluctuation in 31 brown trout populations spread across France, in both natural and regulated (i. e. <b>by-passed</b> <b>sections</b> downstream of hydroelectric water intakes) sites. This data is a result of annual fish monitoring surveys carried out continuously over a minimum of 5 years. Using statistical methods, we estimated the degree of synchrony among brown trout cohort densities (young-of-the-year, juveniles and adults) and evaluated the spatial scale at which synchrony is best identified. We also investigated whether synchrony patterns differ between natural and regulated sites. Results are then discussed according to fluctuations in local physical factors. This study demonstrates the utility of multi-site approaches for a better understanding of freshwater population dynamics.

The Old Rhine is a 50 -km long by-passed single bed paved channel, which is located downstream of the Kembs dam. In 2010, a restoration program was initiated to diversify aquatic and riparian habitats: minimum flow increase and artificial sediment feeding into the channel. A first experimental sedimentary recharge was conducted during the program "INTERREG IV A 2009 - 2012 " in the Rhine <b>by-passed</b> <b>section</b> between Kembs dam and Breisach. In February 2015, ‚ÄòElectricit√© de France‚Äô (EDF, the French hydroelectric power plant manager) implemented a similar artificial sediment recharge in the Old Rhine.

A confounding effect with the sediment feeding is the minimum flow increase and an important flood. An analysis {{of the dynamics of}} these biological communities is underway to identify the links between physical changes and ecological functioning. The minimum flow increase induced the development of new habitats on banks. Floods induced bedload transport which makes benthic habitats less stable for invertebrates and plants. The new gravel bars tends to favor the settlement of pioneer plant species and in border, it is characterized by a lower abundance of invasive species compared with the spatio-temporal reference stations.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{distribution}} of Cladocera species in the different sampling sites: the main channel/old river bed, parapotamal type side arms and plesiopotamal side arms, is described. The structure of cladoceran assemblages in the <b>by-passed</b> Danube <b>section</b> and in the adjacent floodplain water bodies has changed since the Gabƒç√≠kovo hydropower plant was put into operation. Great changes have been observed in the previous parapotamal side arm situated between river km 1840 and 1820, artificially fed with water from the head-race canal. The dominance of tychoplanktonic (benthic and phytophilous) species has increased, while the typical euplanktonic species have disappeared. Three characteristic groups of cladoceran assemblages were recorded when {{a different type of}} habitat was taken into consideration. Euplanktonic cladocerans prevailed on all sampling sites before damming. In periods after damming, littoral species, and later also a euplanktonic forms, dominated on the main channel sampling sites. In parapotamal and plesiopotamal side arms with rich littoral macrovegetation during periods after damming, phytophilous cladoceran species were the ones with the highest occurrence. The samplings from the first time period were rather homogenous. The samplings from the second and third period were more similar when considering the sample site than regarding the time period. In total, 64 cladoceran species were recorded in the course of 13 years (from 1991 to 2004). The increase in number of Cladocera species from 1991 to 2004 was significant. Chydorus sphaericus was found to be the most widely distributed species in the study area.

40|$|Floodplain {{ecosystems}} {{consist of}} a mosaic of shifting interactive habitats (forests, river channels and alluvial aquifers). Flood pulse, hydrological connectivity and geomorphological dynamics are key factors for high species diversity and productivity, complexity in successional trajectories and importance of ecotones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Most rivers in Europe have been drastically altered by dams and reservoirs, canalisation, reduction of the welland area, eutrophication and various other land-use developments. After a very long period of destruction of ftoodplain integrity, the need for protecting and restoring alluvial ecosystems slowly emerged {{over the last three}} decades. Restoration needs to define reference conditions, present conditions and restoration objective states, according to the principle of naturalness. This principle includes hydrological functionality (taking into account the flood pulse), the spatio-temporal diversity of habitat types and species, such as alluvial forest succession and connection of lateral arms to the active channel. We take examples in the upper Rhine valley to support the naturalness concept and to propose sorne principles on this basis for a restoration programme. The preservation of the hydrological functioning (i. e. flooding) ensures an efficient purifying capacity of the soil root system, with regard to phosphate and nitrate. As a consequence, groundwater nitrate and phosphate concentrations are very low under alluvial forests. Moreover the ftooding regime maintains a certain heterogeneity of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The hydrological network, i. e. the former lateral arms, is supplied by different types of water (ground and/or surface water) and water quality differs according to their degree of conneclion to the active channel. The connected arms, is eutrophie whereas the disconnected arms evolve towards an oligotrophic state. The aquatic macrophytes communities reftect the change in water quality. The spatio- temporal variability of habitats is higher in the ftooded sectors than in the unftooded ones. As a consequence the ftooded sectors include more aquatic macrophytes communities (3 to 5 according to the hydrological year vs 2) and each community has greater species richness. A similar relationship exists for terrestrial habitats and forest communities. Hard wood forests tend to dominate the unftooded sectors whereas the flooded areas present a very rich spatio-tempoal mosa√Øc of forests units including all steps of the alluvial succession. The comparison of forest architecture between ftooded and unftooded sites shows that disconnection results in an increase of the ligneous density, a decrease of the tree height, the absence of treefall and a decrease of lianas (for example ivy). The Rhinau island, a still flooded sector in the Rhine floodplain {{can be used as a}} basis for the naturalness concept, due to the preservation of a certain functionnality, even if flooding duration is lower than before the Rhine canalisation (2 days versus 15 days). The two other sites, with differing durations of isolation (30 and 130 years), show different levels of change in floristic composition and structure of forests, and aquatic macrophyte communities. Accordingly, the restoration programme needs to engage more direct interventions. A key factor to emphasize should be the restoration of natural hydrological functioning. On the basis of the concept of naturalness, we therefore propose a four- step restoration programme : 1) restoration of free flow of water in the former lateral arms by connecting them to the river, 2) restoration of natural floods based on Rhine discharges, 3) development of a specific programme for the <b>by-passed</b> <b>sections,</b> 4) finally, development of the inter-connection of the restored areas along the riverLes zones alluviales, travers√©es par des flux d'eau et d'√©nergie fournis par un cours d'eau, sont organis√©es en ensembles fonctionnels interactifs associant des syst√®mes terrestres forestiers et/ou prairiaux et des syst√®mes aquatiques.

Temperatures up to 200 C indicate the passage of hot fluid through Cenozoic sandstones, which <b>by-passed</b> the pre-Cenozoic <b>section</b> in this and other wells.

Oil inclusions in the Cretaceous of well 204 / 19 - 1 have a chemistry that suggests derivation from a Kimmeridgian-aged source rock. They occur in cements that show no evidence for the hot fluid event and it is concluded that the cements pre-date the event. Oil inclusions in Cenozoic sandstones have a heavy, degraded character and were trapped at high temperature, suggesting that degradation was related to the hot fluid event. Present-day oils in the West of Shetland region are mixtures, which could reflect components from the two charges distinguished by the integrated thermal and geochemical histories.
