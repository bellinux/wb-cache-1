5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> train, after the Empire Builder, {{to receive the}} new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' car is {{believed}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in the United States, according to its exhibit information at the Smithsonian Institution. It was built two years before Henry Ford's Quadricycle, and preceded only by Charles Duryea's Motorized Wagon {{less than a year}} earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American midwest.|$|E
