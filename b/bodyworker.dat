He is also known for his poetry, as founder of the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA), and as creator of Tantsu and Tantsuyoga. Watsu is a form of aquatic bodywork in which a practitioner or therapist gently cradles, moves, stretches, and massages a receiver in chest-deep warm water for deep relaxation and aquatic therapy.|$|E

5000|$|Dr Saario's work {{reflect his}} {{evolution}} as a composer - he readily acknowledges {{the influence of}} his tutors and collaborators on his work. Jonty Harrison, David Prior, Iain Armstrong and Robert Penman have left a telling influence on his sonic production. One characteristic feature of Dr Saarios work is his willingness to counterbalance within his work {{a wide range of}} aesthetic and academic approaches. The literary output of William S. Burroughs has been evident since his earliest compositions. The philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari and the filmwork of David Lynch and the Dogma 95 collaboration in particular underpin his composition as well as his academic approach. https://web.archive.org/web/20081114180429/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile Since 2001 majority of his output has been collaborative, and in many instances interdisciplinary (e.g. 'The Hollywoods' and 'Aboriginal Terraformations' with visual artist Amanda Newall, and the zygote concept with composer and musicologist Martin Iddon). His personal interests in martial arts http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/faculty/profiles/Antti-Saario/LICA/ can be clearly evidenced in the his recent work - Making Space: When The Curtain Falls (2007) [...]http://www.nuffieldtheatre.com/archive/details.asp?eventIdentifier=2007529_80331058.

40|$|This study {{examined}} differences among adult female {{childhood sexual abuse}} (CSA) client survivors 2 ̆ 7 comfort with touch from therapists and non-therapists by type of CSA experienced. Courtois 2 ̆ 7 (1988) model stating that denial, dissociation, ego strength, mental health, stage of treatment, therapeutic relationship, and other stressful life experiences predicted adult female CSA client survivors 2 ̆ 7 comfort with touch from a well-known individual, an acquaintance, an unknown person, a psychotherapist, a <b>bodyworker,</b> a team psychotherapist, a team <b>bodyworker,</b> or a body-oriented psychotherapist was tested. Responses from 95 adult females, ages 18 to 68, were analyzed. All participants completed the Attitudes Toward Touch Questionnaire-R that included the Demographic Questionnaire, Description of Abuse, Stage of Healing Checklist, Working Alliance Inventory, Attitudes Toward Touch Questionnaire, Stressful Life Experiences Long-Form, five subscales from the Trauma Symptom Inventory™, and eight subscales from the Personality Assessment Inventory™. A repeated measures MANOVA found {{no significant differences in}} touch comfort by type of CSA when the toucher was a non-therapist. However, there were significant differences in touch comfort by toucher. Client survivors reported more touch comfort from a well-known individual, than from an acquaintance, or an unknown person. Client survivors reported significantly more touch comfort from an acquaintance than an unknown person. No interaction effect was found between toucher and type of CSA. Results from a second repeated measure MANOVA found significant differences in touch comfort by type of CSA when the toucher was a therapist. Client survivors of non-incestuous CSA compared to client survivors of incestuous CSA reported greater touch comfort. No differences were found between survivors of non-incestuous CSA and those who experienced both types of CSA. No interaction between type of CSA and toucher was found. Backward stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated 10 acceptable models for the prediction of touch comfort when survivors of all types of CSA were analyzed at once, two models were acceptable for non-incestuous CSA only, two models for incestuous CSA, and no models were acceptable when survivors who experienced both non-incestuous and incestuous CSA were entered. All variables were retained as significant predictors of touch comfort from the various touchers. ...|$|E

40|$|Our micro-ethnographic study {{demonstrates}} how bodywork skills in Feldenkrais and Shiatsu are infused with systemic sensitivities. A micro-genetic study both of process vignettes and bodyworkers’ subjective theories reveals their intrinsically systemic self-awareness for process management – {{which is why}} we deem dynamic systems concepts a suitable meta-language. From an abstract angle, <b>bodyworkers</b> stimulate self-organization and dynamic homeostatic balance in the client’s somato-personal system. Operating in such a framework requires a progressive reconfiguring of the client’s attractor landscape, his or her systemic dispositions. Specifically, we argue that <b>bodyworkers</b> context-intelligently soft-assemble (frequently non-linear) synergies within their apperception of functional architectures of somato-systemic order. The client’s system is stimulated with a mix of perturbing and stabilizing interventions, while oscillating between eigenfunctions of joints, muscles, etc., and their integration in functional ensembles. In concrete embodied interaction this is implemented with continuous tactile coupling in a safe dyadic sphere and in an irreducibly real-time dynamics, even when sketchily planned. By sensorially charting systemic states in the making practitioners continuously stay apace of emergence, respond to minute changes, and customize reactions in a zone of proximal development (dynamic immediacy). Immediate responsiveness, in turn, benefits the client’s somatic learning. Finally, we inventorize the <b>bodyworker’s</b> tool-box at the operative level. Here a host of micro-enactive skills provides the necessary wherewithal for situated intervention, ranging from educated senses which know how to – often subtly – elicit information, via hands-on techniques from the action repertoire (grips, stretches, etc.), to habitus (proper posture, muscle activation, gaze patterns, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz O371 was a coach {{built in}} Brazil by Mercedes-Benz from the 1980s to the late-1990s. It was the {{replacement}} for the Mercedes-Benz O303 chassis in South America and was widely used in South America. It was also used widely in other countries like Mexico, or Costa Rica. The O371, was a entirely Mercedes-Benz built product; but also the chassis was sent to <b>bodyworkers,</b> like Marcopolo or Busscar.|$|R
50|$|Sessions are {{normally}} done in person, and involve a client tracking {{his or her}} own experience. Practitioners are often mental health practitioners such as social workers, psychologists, or psychotherapists, but may also be nurses, physicians, <b>bodyworkers,</b> physical therapists, clergy, or members of other professions. Certified practitioners complete a three year training course (216 hours of instruction) and must complete 18 hours of case consultations and 12 hours of personal sessions. Somatic Experiencing is used for shock trauma in the short term and for developmental trauma as an adjunct to psychotherapy that may span years.|$|R

Members of a group support, monitor and constructively challenge each other’s practice. They may do this in a variety of ways, providing sufficient challenge to enable them to [...] "stand by" [...] each practitioner in their group. The process by which this is accomplished is monitored in turn by each of the link groups.|$|R

5000|$|Myofascial trigger points, {{also known}} as trigger points, are {{described}} as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial [...] "knots" [...] as an identifiable source of pain is more common among <b>bodyworkers,</b> physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which {{may be used to}} help address certain musculoskeletal pain.|$|R
