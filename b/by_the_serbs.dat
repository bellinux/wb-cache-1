5|$|In {{a meeting}} of the Croatian and US Governments and {{military}} officials held on 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed an attack on Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to draw off part of the forces besieging Bihać and to prevent its capture <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> The U.S. officials gave no response to the proposal and Operation Winter '94 was ordered the same day. Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack advanced positions held by the HV and the HVO nearer to supply routes vital to the RSK.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, {{probably}} in 1213, he took Dyrrhachium from Venice, followed in 1214 by Corfu. Very {{little is known}} about the details of these successes, as the generally hostile stance of the pro-Nicaean Byzantine historians towards Michael means that his achievements were often ignored. According to local Corfiot tradition, the castle of Angelokastro was built by Michael. Michael continued to push northward into Albania and Macedonia, taking Kruja and ending the independence of the principality of Arbanon and its ruler, Dimitri Progoni, but his attempt to seize Zeta was stopped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> at Skadar.|$|E
5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> {{led by the}} renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes {{and the threat of}} a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, and with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{moderation}} and clemency {{shown by}} Kantakouzenos in this settlement, {{it did not}} gain universal acceptance. Supporters of the Palaiologoi still distrusted him, while his own partisans {{would have preferred to}} depose the Palaiologoi outright and install the Kantakouzenoi as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, and had to be placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous appanage covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a march against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated exclave surrounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a de facto independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.|$|E

One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakić, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the Municipality.|$|R

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun {{was briefly}} {{evacuated}} {{due to a}} Serbian counterattack in September. On 28 September, Körös, along with the monitor , a patrol boat and a minesweeper, broke through the minefields on the Sava near Belgrade and pushed upstream to join the fighting near Šabac. In November, French artillery support arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage. The stalemate continued until December 1914 when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade {{in the face of}} an Austro-Hungarian assault, although Körös did not support this action. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> with Russian and French assistance. Körös continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when the base of the Danube Flotilla was withdrawn north to Petrovaradin for the winter.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Agreement also {{resulted}} {{in a series of}} meetings between Croatian and US government and military officials held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. On 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and to prevent its capture <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> As the US officials gave no response to the proposal, the Croatian General Staff ordered Operation Winter '94 the same day, to be carried out by the HV and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO)the main military force of the Bosnian Croats. Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack shifted the line of contact of the HV and the HVO closer to the RSK's supply routes.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav monitor Sava was a Temes-class river monitor {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy as SMS Bodrog. She fired the first shots of World War I {{on the night of}} 28 July 1914, when she and two other {{monitors}} shelled Serbian defences near Belgrade. She was part of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the mouth of the Danube. In the closing stages of the war, she was the last monitor to withdraw towards Budapest, but was captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> when she grounded on a sandbank downstream from Belgrade. After the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Sava. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission.|$|E

5000|$|According to <b>the</b> ICTY, <b>Serb</b> forces {{deported}} {{at least}} 80-100,000 Croats in Croatia in 1991-92 {{and at least}} 700,000 Albanians in Kosovo in 1999. Further {{hundreds of thousands of}} Muslims were forced out of their homes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. <b>By</b> one estimate, <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> forces drove at least 700,000 Bosnian Muslims from the area of Bosnia under their control.|$|R
5|$|At this point, Kantakouzenos' {{position}} was greatly {{strengthened by the}} intervention of his old friend, Umur Bey, who in late 1342 or early 1343 sailed up the Evros river with a fleet of 300 ships and 29,000 (according to Kantakouzenos) or 15,000 (according to Turkish sources) men-in-arms and relieved Demotika both from the siege by the regency's forces and from the depredations of the Bulgarians. After pillaging Thrace for a few months, Umur was forced to retreat to Asia {{at the onset of}} winter, to which the Turks were unaccustomed. This turn of events displeased Dušan, for Kantakouzenos now had an independent power base and was less reliant on the Serbian ruler's goodwill. The final rift between Kantakouzenos and Dušan occurred in April 1343, when Kantakouzenos persuaded the town of Berroia, besieged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> to surrender to him instead of Dušan. This was followed by the surrender of several other forts in the area to Kantakouzenos, including Servia and Platamon. These moves strengthened Kantakouzenos' position and independence from Dušan, thereby thwarting the latter's plans for expansion. Realizing that he had little to gain by continuing to support Kantakouzenos, Dušan opened negotiations with the regency and concluded a formal alliance with them in the summer of 1343.|$|E
5|$|Following a US {{military}} strategy endorsed by President Bill Clinton in February 1993, the Washington Agreement {{was signed in}} March 1994. This ended the Croat–Bosniak War, abolished Herzeg-Bosnia, established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and forged the ARBiH–HVO alliance against the VRS. In addition, {{a series of meetings}} between US and Croatian officials were held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovinain effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia. In a meeting held on 29 November 1994, Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina to draw off part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent its capture <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> U.S. officials made no response to the proposal. Operation Winter'94 was ordered the same day; it was to be carried out by the HV and the HVOthe main military forces of the Bosnian Croats.|$|E
5|$|In 1344, the regency {{concluded}} a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required {{the surrender of}} Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and {{the bulk of his}} army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000men.|$|E
50|$|In Montenegro, protests {{were held}} in Podgorica on 19 February.

25|$|During {{and after}} the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were {{expelled}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> army from <b>the</b> Sanjak of Niš and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.|$|R
50|$|Arkan soon {{set up a}} {{training}} camp for his Serb Volunteer Guard in Erdut, which became headquarters {{until the end of}} the war, when Croatian forces recaptured most of <b>the</b> land occupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> rebels.|$|R
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians entered Valjevo on 15 November, {{prompting}} wild public celebrations in Vienna. Franz Joseph praised Potiorek for {{seizing the}} town; {{cities across the}} empire made Potiorek an honorary citizen and Sarajevo even named a street after him. Valjevo's capture led the Austro-Hungarians {{to believe that they}} {{were on the verge of}} defeating Serbia and that the Serbian Army was no longer a coherent fighting force, but the scorched earth tactics employed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> during their withdrawal complicated the Austro-Hungarian advance. Although the Austro-Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted, its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance. Putnik's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro-Hungarians. Moreover, the geography of northwestern Serbia favoured defensive operations since the approaches to the Kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from the direction of Austria-Hungary and the river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain. In October, the Serbs had fortified the Jeljak and Maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an Austro-Hungarian attack. This gave them an advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to Kragujevac. The Serbs also established a series of field fortifications blocking the approach to Niš. The extensive series of fortifications and the difficulty of the terrain which they faced left the Austro-Hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in the gruelling Serbian countryside with almost no lines of communication.|$|E
25|$|The same territories were {{claimed by}} those nations {{living in that}} region that had already risen their {{national}} development to independent statehood: Shkodër vilayet was claimed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> and Montenegrins, Kosovo vilayet <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> Montenegrins and Bulgarians, Monastir vilayet <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> Greeks and Bulgarians and Janina Vilayet by the Greeks. A {{few weeks after the}} beginning of the First Balkan War, the biggest part of the territories intended for the Albanian Vilayet was in the hands of Balkan League member states, as a condominium. Final frontiers between the Balkan League members and the new Principality of Albania were decided by the treaties of London and Bucharest, and ignored the frontiers of the proposed Albanian Vilayet, leaving substantial Albanian populations living outside the newly established Albanian nation-state.|$|E
25|$|The {{second largest}} {{population}} of linguistic {{and ethnic groups}} are the Turks (including minority of Kurds) {{with a number of}} 200,000 to 300,000 who currently live in Austria. The Turks and the Kurds are the largest single immigrant group in Austria, closely followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Settlement {{was founded}} in 1728 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> frontiersmen. From its {{foundation}} until the present day, {{the population of the}} settlement was almost entirely composed of ethnic Serbs. In 1759, population of the settlement numbered 28 houses.|$|R
50|$|In the Croatian War of Independence, Zrin {{was held}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> forces and {{was part of}} the Republic of Serbian Krajina. In Operation Storm (1995), Zrin was taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Army. It is {{inhabited}} by 12 residents.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason why}} the Party lost support in Croatia was because it was accused of being {{dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> minority. <b>The</b> <b>Serb</b> influence was indeed disproportionate at times. In 1989, 30% {{of the members of}} the Croatian League of Communists were Serbs, while their overall percentage in the republic was less than 13%.|$|R
25|$|In 1326, Dečanski sent a {{delegate}} to the Mamluk Sultanate in Alexandria and sought a flag in yellow colour, {{to be used as}} a war flag. The Byzantines mention that there were several war flags hoisted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> at the Battle of Velbazhd (1330), and the yellow one was likely one of those.|$|E
25|$|After the Turkish {{victory at}} the battle of Nicopolis (1396) the Hungarian King Sigismund (1387–1437) was {{considering}} defending the territory settled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> and he is known to have visited Bečkerek on September 30, 1398. The town was granted to Stefan Lazarević {{at the end of the}} 1403. The despot became the vassal of the Hungarian King; but he got Bečkerek and the title of the Great Head of the Torontál County.|$|E
25|$|Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) {{women were}} raped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> {{as part of}} a methodical and {{concentrated}} campaign of ethnic cleansing. For instance, the girls and women selected by the later convicted war criminal Dragoljub Kunarac or by his men, were systematically taken to the soldiers' base, a house located in Osmana Đikić street no 16. There, the women and girls (some as young as 14) were repeatedly raped. Serb soldiers regularly took Muslim girls from various detention centres and kept them as sex slaves.|$|E
50|$|The {{letter was}} a result of {{extensive}} studies about respect for minority rights in Croatia, which were initiated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> Democratic Forum and other partner NGOs of the Forum, like UNHCR, University of Zagreb and other Serbian NGOs.|$|R
5000|$|Fighting {{continued}} in subsequent months, {{during which the}} JNA and Krajina Serbs managed to gradually expand territories under their control and even threaten the major urban centre of Zadar. The Maslenica bridge was blown up in November <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> forces.|$|R
5000|$|The unusual ending [...] "-ce" [...] (-це) {{as opposed}} to [...] "-ci" [...] (-ци) (e.g. Kavadarci) {{reflects}} the local dialect, which {{is a form of}} Torlakian, similar to what is spoken in Kumanovo, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> population of Preševo.|$|R
