5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other source of vitamin B.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, adelgids also feed on plant phloem. Adelgids are {{sometimes}} described as aphids, but are more properly classified as aphid-like insects, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> cauda or cornicles.|$|E

25|$|Softer-bodied prey of {{the same}} size such as small tadpoles could be {{ingested}} completely, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> rigid parts and the head, although capable of plugging the door for a time, will soften and yield and finally be drawn in.|$|E
25|$|Surface-mount {{components}} like MLCCs are cheaper, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{leads and}} a little bit smaller than their counterparts with leads, and they need no holes in the PCB, a second reduction of costs.

25|$|Only {{unsaturated}} fats can be trans or cis fat, {{since only}} a double bond can be locked to these orientations. Saturated fatty acids are never called trans fats <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> double bonds. Therefore, all their bonds are freely rotatable. Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a triple bond, are rare and of no nutritional significance.|$|E
25|$|The meld {{must be in}} {{absolute}} numerical sequence. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. The sequence must also {{be in the same}} suit. Honours, Flowers and Seasons cannot be used to make chows <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> numerical value. A player can steal a discard to form a chow from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs if no one else needs the tile to make Pongs, Kongs or win.|$|E
25|$|Some drugs used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets {{have been replaced by}} new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin.|$|E

25|$|To {{maintain}} {{compatibility with}} older operating systems and applications, the 640 KB barrier remained {{part of the}} PC design even after the 8086/8088 had been replaced with the Intel 286 processor, which could address up to 16 MB of memory in Protected mode. The 1 MB barrier also remained {{as long as the}} 286 was running in Real mode, since DOS required Real mode which uses the segment and offset registers in an overlapped manner such that addresses with more than 20 bits are not possible. It is still present in IBM PC compatibles today if they are running in Real mode such as used by DOS. Even the most modern Intel PCs still have the area between 640 and 1024 KB reserved. This however is invisible to programs (or even most of the operating system) on newer operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) that use virtual memory, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> awareness of physical memory addresses at all. Instead they operate within a virtual address space, which is defined independently of available RAM addresses.|$|E
25|$|A {{purpose trust}} in English {{law is a}} trust created for the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore nobody to enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts. If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being for a purpose, it involves beneficiaries in some respect. Purpose trusts can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the rule against perpetuities and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the lateral}} nasal wall is {{supplied}} with blood by the sphenopalatine artery (from behind and below) {{and by the}} anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery (from above and behind). The nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery, and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the greater palatine artery. These three (3) vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the Kiesselbach plexus (the Little area), which is a region in the anteroinferior-third of the nasal septum, (in front and below). Furthermore, the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation. The nasal veins are biologically significant, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> vessel-valves, and because of their direct, circulatory communication to the sinus caverns, which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose. Hence, because of such an abundant nasal blood supply, tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise post-operative healing.|$|E

25|$|While Doctor Light, Iron Man, Spencer and Hawkeye build {{a weapon}} to harness the Infinity Stones, Ultron Sigma attacks Avengers Tower. In the carnage, Thanos is {{released}} and attacks Ultron Sigma, cracking the Reality Stone and forcing him to retreat. As Chris’s team is pursued by the Symbiote, the heroes return to repel it. They use their Stones to destroy the Symbiote and the falling core, but are infected in the process. With hours left until they are turned, the heroes head for Xgard. While one group distracts Ultron Sigma, the rest infiltrate Sigma’s laboratory to finish their weapon, the Infinity Buster. When Thanos learns of Death and Jedah’s partnership, he becomes enraged and betrays the heroes, creating a mechanized gauntlet that absorbs Ryu’s Satsui no Hadō before departing. Dante returns to the Dark Kingdom and reclaims the Soul Stone from Jedah. He arrives in Xgard and pretends to surrender the Stone, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> souls, Ultron Sigma is overwhelmed by the Stone and transformed into Ultron Omega. The Soul Stone purges the Sigma Virus within Thor, returning him to normal. The others appear and install the Infinity Buster into X, who uses it to destroy Ultron Omega.|$|E
25|$|The Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple is a {{good example}} of a richly {{decorated}} Hoysala temple built in the trikuta (three towers) vimana (prayer hall) style with fine sculptures adorning the walls.

The Jagati is in perfect unity with the rest of the temple and the temple is built on a jagati (platform) that closely follows the plan of the temple. The size of the original temple can be considered small, to which a larger open mantapa (hall) was later added. The three shrines are located around a central closed mantapa with 9 bays. The ceiling of the closed mantapa is supported by four lathe turned pillars and is deeply domed in the centre. The ceiling of the closed mantapa is supported by four lathe turned pillars and is deeply domed in the centre. The central shrine is the most prominent and has a large tower. This shrine has a vestibule that connects the shrine to the mandapa. Consequently, the vestibule also has a tower that looks like an extension of the main tower and is called the sukanasi or nose. The other two shrines have smaller towers and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> vestibule to connect them to the central mantapa, they have no sukanasi.|$|E
