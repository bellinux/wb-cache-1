5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> specific eurozone markets.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that the DOTS (directly observed therapy, short course) strategy for tuberculosis (TB) control can contain the emergence and spread of drug resistance {{in the absence of}} second-line treatment. We compared drug-resistance levels between 1996 and 2001 in the south of Vietnam, an area with a well-functioning DOTS program. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from consecutively diagnosed patients with smear-positive TB at 40 randomly selected public TB clinics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 888 new patients in 2001, resistance to any drug <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 238 (26. 3 %), resistance to isoniazid <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 154 (16. 6 %), resistance to rifampin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 22 (2. 0 %), resistance to ethambutol <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 12 (1. 1 %), resistance to streptomycin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 173 (19. 4 %), and resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance [MDR]) <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 20 (1. 8 % [95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 %- 3. 3 %]). Among 136 previously treated patients in 2001, any resistance <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 89 (62. 9 %), and MDR <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 35 (23. 2 %). The prevalence of any drug resistance and of streptomycin resistance among new patients had decreased significantly (P <. 01) since 1996; there was no increase in the prevalence of MDR. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance decreased despite high initial levels of resistance to isoniazid and streptomycin and despite the absence of second-line treatment. Therefore, a DOTS program can contain drug-resistant TB in this settin...|$|R
