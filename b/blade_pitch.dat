40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of periodic <b>blade</b> <b>pitching</b> on rotor aerodynamics is numerically investigated at a Reynolds number typical of micro-air vehicles. <b>Blade</b> <b>pitching</b> motion is parameterized using three variables, {{giving rise to}} a large parameter space that is explored through 74 test cases. Results show that a relevant tuning of pitching variables can {{lead to an increase}} in rotational efficiency and thrust, which is found to be primarily related to theoccurrence of reversed von Karman street, leading edge vortex (LEV) formation and dynamic stall phenomenon. In addition, for cases where reversed von Karman street occurs, the flow is found to be quasi-two-dimensional, suggesting that quasi-two-dimensional approaches can provide relevant approximations of the global aerodynamics. Overall,the analysis demonstrates that <b>blade</b> <b>pitching</b> can be beneficial to the aerodynamic performance of micro-air vehicles and helps draw guidelines for further improvements of flapping-rotor concepts...|$|R

25|$|From 1974 to 1981, NASA's Glenn Research Center (then the Lewis Research Center) in Brook Park, Ohio led the U.S. Wind Energy Program {{for large}} horizontal-axis wind turbines, {{designing}} {{a series of}} 13 experimental large horizontal-axis wind turbines. In conjunction with the United States Department of Energy, NASA developed and tested megawatt-class wind turbines. The program's goal was to develop the technology, and then {{turn it over to}} private industry.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with four standard radial baffles at the wall under a turbulent regime of flow. The pumping capacity was calculated from the radial profile of the axial flow, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the discharge flow. The mean velocity was measured using laser Doppler anemometry in a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm, provided with a standard dished bottom. Three and six <b>blade</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers (the <b>pitch</b> angle varied within the interval a Îá 24 °; 45 °ń) of impeller/vessel diameter ratio D/T = 0. 36, as well as a three <b>blade</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller with folded blades of the same diameter, were tested. The calculated results were compared with the results of experiments mentioned in the literature, above all in cylindrical vessels with a flat bottom. Both arrangements of the agitated system were described by the impeller energetic efficiency, i. e, a criterion including in dimensionless form both the impeller energy consumption (impeller power input) and the impeller pumping effect (impeller pumping capacity). It follows from the results obtained with various geometrical configurations that the energetic efficiency of <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers is significantly lower for configurations suitable for mixing solid-liquid suspensions (low impeller off bottom clearances) than for blending miscible liquids in mixing (higher impeller off bottom clearances) ...|$|R

The presence of counter-rotating propeller improves total thrust and cancels out the torque.

25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and collective pitch to reduce <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> before driving the rotor.

Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the dangerous area is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|E
25|$|The pontoon hull {{was built}} of soft Siemens steel framing and 11 {{millimeters}} thick sheet iron. In November 1879, when the double bottom was 2/3 complete (but not formally laid down yet), Popov persuaded the imperial authorities to award interior finishes contact to the British, and hired Tideman {{to review the}} design again. Tideman built another 1:10 scale model, ran another series of tests and recommended changes to the powerplant and propeller arrangement that caused a significant extension of the contract. The Livadia had a double, perfectly flat bottom and only 7ft (2.1 m) of draft, excluding the propellers. Their blades projected 9 feet below the hull. Tideman found what he claimed was near-perfect propeller configuration: all three screws had the same diameter but varied in <b>blade</b> <b>pitch,</b> which in practice required running the engines at different revolutions per minute.|$|E

40|$|Performance and flowfield {{measurements}} {{were conducted on}} a small-scale cyclorotor for application to a micro air vehicle. Detailed parametric studies were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of the number of blades, rotational speed, and <b>blade</b> <b>pitching</b> amplitude. The results showed that power loading and rotor efficiency increased when using more blades; this observation was found over a wide range of <b>blade</b> <b>pitching</b> amplitudes. The results also showed that operating the cyclorotor at higher pitching amplitudes resulted in improved performance, independently of the number of blades. A momentum balance performed using the flowfield measurements helped to quantify the vertical and sideward forces produced by the cyclorotor; these results correlated well with the force measurements made using load balance. Increasing the number of blades increased the inclination of the resultant thrust vector with respect to the vertical because of the increasing contribution of the sideward force. The profile drag coefficient of the blade sections computed using a momentum deficit approach correlated well with typical values at these low chord Reynolds numbers. Particle image velocimetry measurements made inside the cage of the cyclorotor showed that there are rotational flows that, when combined with the influence of the upper wake on the lower half of the rotor, explain the relatively low efficiency of the cyclorotor.

50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch.</b> In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in <b>blade</b> <b>pitch.</b> Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|E
