40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> on traffic flow and propose an {{improved}} cellular automaton model, which considers both the performance difference between passenger cars and trucks and the behaviour change of passenger cars under the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks.</b> A questionnaire survey has been conducted {{to find out whether}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> exists and how the behaviour of passenger car drivers changes under the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks.</b> The survey results confirm that the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> exists and indicate that passenger car drivers will enlarge the space gap, decelerate, and change lanes in advance when they are affected. Simulation results show that traffic volume is still affected by percentages <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> in the congestion phase in the proposed model compared with traditional heterogeneous cellular automaton models. Traffic volume and speed decrease with the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> in the congestion phase. The impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> can increase traffic congestion as it increases. However, it has different influences on the speed variance of passenger cars in different occupancies. In the proposed model, the relative relationship of the space gap between car-following-truck and car-following-car is changeable at a certain value of occupancy, which is related to the impact <b>of</b> <b>trucks...</b>|$|R

50|$|Daimler {{unveiled}} a new brand <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> - BharatBenz - for the Indian market on 17 February 2011. The brand {{was intended to}} offer a range <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> in the 6-49 ton range, with vehicles for applications such as haulage, tippers and tractor trailers. In 2012 BharatBenz unveiled its first range <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> to the media, potential customers and partners in a six-day event in Hyderabad. The BharatBenz range <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> includes Light Duty Trucks (LDT) & Heavy Duty Trucks (HDT) in the 9, 12, 25, 31 and 49 tonne categories, featuring various usages and applications. The first 3 Heavy-duty trucks (2523 R, 2523 C, & 3123 R) were launched on 26 September 2012.

A stated choice experiment designed for identifying route choice behavior <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> drivers provides the data for model estimation.

Results reveal that size <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> is a significant segmentation variable of preferences for route attributes. Drivers <b>of</b> light <b>trucks</b> care more about congestion than drivers <b>of</b> heavy <b>trucks,</b> and are highly sensitive to road pricing and slightly sensitive to a road bonus.

40|$|Truck {{platooning}} {{refers to}} the automated operation <b>of</b> multiple <b>trucks.</b> High expectations rest on truck platooning as to alleviate negative impacts caused by road freight transport like congestion, accidents and pollution. Furthermore, driver shortages may be partially solved by the concept <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning. This study identified enablers and barriers <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning and assessed their effect on the potential implementation of the concept. The implementation and possible adoption <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning as a transport mode is a complex and uncertain process. The magnitude {{of the consequences of}} platooning are in general unknown and many different stakeholders should be involved in the implementation process. Based on this research it can be concluded that several barriers still have to be mitigated and that cooperation between different competing companies and industries is essential for the successful implementation <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning.

40|$|Submitted for {{presentation}} and publication at 2008 TRB Annual Meeting TRB 2008 Annual Meeting CD-ROM Paper revised from original submittal. Sun, Lv and Paul 2 In the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000), capacity is expressed as the unit passenger cars per hour per lane (pcphpl). The number of passenger cars a single vehicle {{is equivalent to}} is the passenger car equivalent (PCE). This paper studied PCEs within highway work zones that were based upon the speed and the percentage <b>of</b> <b>trucks.</b> The results indicated that PCEs designated for highway work zones have their own distinct characteristics. This study plotted 3 dimensional charts to display the change of PCEs {{with respect to the}} speed and percentage <b>of</b> <b>trucks.</b> Thus, a mountain chain of PCEs is formed on the speed-percentage (percentage <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> traffic) plane. The 3 dimensional charts help identify the PCE value as speed varies given the same percentage <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> traffic or as the percentage <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> traffic changes given the same speed. First, the multiple regression (the traditional method) wa...|$|R
