5|$|Since {{they began}} playing {{football}} in 1995, the Panthers {{have been to}} four NFC Championship Games; they lost two (1996 and 2005) and won two (2003 and 2015). The Panthers have won six division championships: the NFC West championship in 1996 and the NFC South championship in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They are {{the first and only}} team to win the NFC South back to <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> won the NFC South more times than any other team in the division. They have finished as runners-up in their division six times, finishing second-place in the NFC West in 1997 and 1999 and finishing second-place in the NFC South in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012.

25|$|Particularly {{problematic}} local trees {{include the}} sycamore, lime, sweet and horse chestnut, ash, and poplar, which regrow or coppice after cutting <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> large, flat leaves, which {{stick to the}} line and cause severe slippery rail. Other types of tree that cause problems are quick-growing, pioneering trees, or those producing {{a substantial amount of}} leaves. Poplars are particularly troubling because they tend to shed limbs.|$|E

25|$|The chicks hatch after 15–16 days; {{they are}} {{initially}} hairless, save for some grey {{down on the}} <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> dark skin. They start to grow feathers 5 days or so after hatching, starting with the remiges; the rectrices begin to emerge about 3 days later. The young are fed 1-2 times per hour on average, and the female spends {{about half of the}} day brooding and feeding her offspring, and the other half flying around and feeding. The young fledge after 22–24 days but still return to the nest to sleep and be brooded for some more days; they are independent some 2–3 weeks after fledging. Two broods may be raised subsequently, sometimes reusing the nest; due to the prolonged breeding season, three broods might be raised per year in theory, but this does not seem to happen. The species first breeds at 1–2 years of age.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

500|$|Carlton coach Brett Ratten {{suggested}} that he would [...] "have to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a look" [...] {{at the possibility of}} drafting White for the 2009 season. Ratten cited White's experience and leadership in helping to guide the younger ruckmen at Carlton as a potential draw-card. St Kilda was also suggested as a possible destination for White to continue his playing career, but the Sydney Swans later emerged as the most likely destination for White. Ultimately White signed to play in 2009 with the Redland Australian Football Club in the AFL Queensland State League. After one season with Redlands he retired from playing and joined Gold Coast Football Club as a coach ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Stephen Thompson. The {{producers}} wished to develop a Doctor Who episode set on [...] "the high seas." [...] The episode was also made to allow the Doctor and his companions to [...] "kick <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> some fun." [...] As the episode was pirate-themed, the producers wanted to fit in as many elements as possible from pirate fiction, including treasure, mutinies, a stowaway boy, walking the plank, storms, swords, and a pirate with a [...] "good heart" [...] who [...] "isn't really evil." [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot" [...] was originally planned to be ninth in the series, but was moved forward prior to filming as executive producer Steven Moffat felt {{the first half of}} the series was too dark.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Taylor, {{director}} of the animal rights group Animal Aid, called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: [...] "It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event." [...] The RSPCA's equine consultant David Muir stated: [...] "I was gutted that two horses died... What I will do now is go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a look at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, {{to see if the}} jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, but the one thing I can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there." [...] Muir did however add: [...] "There's no way I'm going to get the National banned." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E
500|$|Vick was {{activated}} to the 53-man roster in mid-September {{and played}} sparingly {{for the rest}} of the season as McNabb's backup. In week 13 against the Falcons, Vick both threw and ran for a touchdown, his first scores since December 2006. Vick was voted by teammates as the winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in December. The award honors players who [...] "exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage". [...] "It means a great deal to me," [...] Vick said at the time. [...] "I was voted unanimously by my teammates. They know what I've been through. I've been through a lot. It's been great to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> an opportunity to play and be with a great group of guys. I'm just ecstatic about that and I enjoy every day." [...] The Eagles finished the season with an 11–5 record, making the playoffs. In the team's NFC wildcard game against the Dallas Cowboys on January 9, 2010, Vick threw the longest touchdown pass of his career to rookie Jeremy Maclin for a 76-yard touchdown. The Eagles lost the game 34–14.|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} the filming of the final episode, Aniston said that with each episode it got [...] "harder just to read the lines." [...] She {{explained}} that the cast was [...] "all just nerves and raw emotions [...] No one knows how to feel. We {{may need to be}} sedated on the last night." [...] The producers promised a tearful ending, and the cast admitted their crying was not faked when they filmed their scenes. LeBlanc revealed it had been too much for him {{and the rest of the}} cast; he said Kudrow started crying first, and when he looked at Aniston and Cox they also appeared emotional. Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the [...] "consummate professional", was also upset, so LeBlanc [...] "just lost it." [...] Maggie Wheeler, who was Chandler's [...] "on and off" [...] girlfriend Janice, told People, [...] "the entire cast had to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> their makeup redone before starting," [...] and that Perry broke the tension by saying, [...] "Somebody is gonna get fired."

500|$|Chun {{described}} the first specimen he caught, a male, as looking {{similar to the}} genus Eledone, but with larger membranes, a differently shaped hectocotylus, and a differently shaped funnel organ (siphon). The specimen had [...] "a sac-shaped body and very large eyes", with arms that [...] "are folded <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> very large membranes which enclose the whole animal", and had a [...] "characteristic pale coloration". Reiterating Chun, Guy Robson summarized the differences between Eledone and V. togata as [...] "the possession of (a) a funnel organ composed of two separate pieces, (b) a [...] bend in the hectocotylized arm, and (c) the development of extensive lateral membranes on the arms". Robson, however, was not fully convinced that {{the shape of the}} hectocotylized arm was of value in identifying the species, positing that the curve could have been caused by a shrinkage of the membrane. In comparing the distinctive features of V. togata with other known octopus species, Robson found similarities between V. togata and species in the genera Moschites (now considered a synonym for Pareledone and Eledone, both in the subfamily Eledoninae), and Polypus (now considered a synonym for Enteroctopus, in the subfamily Octopodinae). He found V. togata closest to the southern species of Moschites, such as M. charcoti (now Pareledone charcoti) and M. brevis (now Eledone massyae), due to having similar funnel organs and suckers as those species.|$|E

Sidwell said of his return, [...] "I was happy to be asked back, it was the right time for me and the right time for the character.

2500|$|Moffat {{wanted to}} start the series with a two-parter that had gravity and a wider scope in plot. He also aimed to make them some of the darkest episodes. In contrast, the {{following}} episode, [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot", would allow the characters to [...] "kick <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> some fun". Gaiman's episode was based around the TARDIS, and allowing the Doctor and the TARDIS to speak to each other. Graham's two-parter was intended to lead into [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", the mid-series finale, but have a main plot about [...] "avatars that rebel". Graham took Moffat's pitch and added many of his own aspects, such as the monastery setting and the Flesh. Then, in addition to revealing who River Song is, [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] presented {{the situation of the}} Doctor, who was typically a pacifist, being provoked enough to assemble an army. Moffat described the ending as [...] "game-changing cliffhanger" [...] and split the series in two because such a climax could not be done {{at the end of a}} series, as it would be [...] "too long before it came back".|$|E
