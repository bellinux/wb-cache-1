Dairy products are easily accessible and available world-wide and analysis of this matrix supplies estimation of human food chain exposure and, at the same time, reflects the contamination level of the environmental compartment from which they derive. The Stockholm Conventions and the Global Monitoring Plan encourage the production of monitoring data to effectively evaluate {{the presence of the}} POPs in all regions, in order to identify changes in levels over time, as well as to provide information on their regional and global environmental transport. Often large sample amounts must be extracted to achieve sufficiently low detection limits of the priority POPs. Consequently, large amounts of lipids can be present in the extracts depending on the lipid content of the sample. The first step of analyzing lipid rich matrices is to extract the pollutants, preferably without extracting the lipids themselves. The presence of lipids, in the form of phospholipids, triglycerides and free fatty acids or cholesterol can disturb the chromatographic capabilities in the further clean up or fractionation steps, as well as suppresses the ionization at the chemical analysis. Dialysis with a semi permeable membrane (SPM) enables a non-destructive separation technique of the analytes from matrix, i. e. it efficiently extracts the smaller non-polar compounds, and retaining the larger compounds in animal or plant fat samples.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with experimental and theoretical studies related to alumina thin films. Alumina, Al 2 O 3, is a polymorphic material utilized {{in a variety of}} applications, e. g., in the form of thin films. However, controlling thin film growth of this material, in particular at low substrate temperatures, is not straightforward. The aim of this work is to increase the understanding of the <b>basic</b> mechanisms governing <b>alumina</b> growth and to investigate novel ways of synthesizing alumina coatings. The thesis can be divided into two main parts, where the first part deals with fundamental studies of mechanisms affecting alumina growth and the second part with more application-oriented studies of high power impulse magnetron sputter (HiPIMS) deposition of the material. In the first part, it was shown that the thermodynamically stable α phase, which normally is synthesized at substrate temperatures of around 1000 °C, can be grown using reactive sputtering at a substrate temperature of merely 500 °C by controlling the nucleation surface. This was done by predepositing a Cr 2 O 3 nucleation layer. Moreover, it was found that an additional requirement for the formation of the α phase is that the depositions are carried out at low enough total pressure and high enough oxygen partial pressure. Based on these observations, it was concluded that energetic bombardment, plausibly originating from energetic oxygen, is necessary for the formation of α-alumina (in addition to the effect of the chromia nucleation layer). Moreover, the effects of residual water on the growth of crystalline films were investigated by varying the partial pressure of water in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber. Films deposited onto chromia nucleation layers exhibited a columnar structure and consisted of crystalline α-alumina if deposited under UHV conditions. However, as water to a partial pressure of 1 * 10 - 5 Torr was introduced, the columnar α-alumina growth was disrupted. Instead, a microstructure consisting of small, equiaxed grains was formed, and the γ-alumina content was found to increase with increasing film thickness. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the atomistic processes occurring on the surface, density functional theory based computational studies of adsorption and diffusion of Al, O, AlO, and O 2 on different α-alumina (0001) surfaces were also performed. The results give possible reasons for the difficulties in growing the α phase at low temperatures through the identification of several metastable adsorption sites and also show how adsorbed hydrogen might inhibit further growth of α-alumina crystallites. In addition, it was shown that the Al surface diffusion activation energies are unexpectedly low, suggesting that limited surface diffusivity is not the main obstacle for low-temperature α-alumina growth. Instead, it is suggested to be more important to find ways of reducing the amount of impurities, especially hydrogen, in the process and to facilitate α-alumina nucleation when designing new processes for low-temperature deposition of α-alumina. In the second part of the thesis, reactive HiPIMS deposition of alumina was studied. In HiPIMS, a high-density plasma is created by applying very high power to the sputtering magnetron at a low duty cycle. It was found, both from experiments and modeling, that the use of HiPIMS drastically influences the characteristics of the reactive sputtering process, causing reduced target poisoning and thereby reduced or eliminated hysteresis effects and relatively high deposition rates of stoichiometric alumina films. This is not only of importance for alumina growth, but for reactive sputter deposition in general, where hysteresis effects and loss of deposition rate pose a substantial problem. Moreover, it was found that the energetic and ionized deposition flux in the HiPIMS discharge can be used to lower the deposition temperature of α-alumina. Coatings predominantly consisting of the α phase were grown at temperatures as low as 650 °C directly onto cemented carbide substrates without the use of nucleation layers. Such coatings were also deposited onto cutting inserts and were tested in a steel turning application. The coatings were found to increase the crater wear resistance compared to a benchmark TiAlN coating, and the process consequently shows great potential for further development towards industrial applications...|$|R

For all aluminas, both Langmiur and Freundlich models fitted the adsorption isotherms well and the calculation of thermodynamics showed that adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic; the kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order model and the weak acidic pH favored the fluoride adsorption.

30|$|Aliquots {{of volume}} 1  ml were {{withdrawn}} at intervals of 6  hrs {{from the start}} of the reaction. There was no by-product formation, so the sample purification could be done in a single step by removing sodium hydroxide and enzyme from these samples. The aliquots were water washed (0.5  ml) 3 times for the removal of NaOH (added for adjusting pH) and enzyme. The purified samples were used for titrimetric calculations. Samples were then passed through a <b>basic</b> <b>alumina</b> column having 1  cm diameter. The amount of adsorbent alumina was taken according to the acid value of the sample calculated in 2.3. 1. The eluted samples from the column were acid free and were used for TLC, HPLC and NMR analysis.|$|E
40|$|Different {{synthetic}} {{approaches to}} methylethers by reaction of alcohols with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) used as reagent and solvent are herein reported. Direct methylation {{has been achieved}} in good yields using <b>basic</b> <b>alumina</b> or hydrotalcite KW 2000 as catalyst both in batch and continuous-flow (C. -F.) conditions. A two-step synthetic approach, consisting of carboxymethylation of the parent alcohol followed by decarboxylation, has been also reported. Finally, the high-yielding methylation of the secondary hydroxyls groups of cyclic sugar isosorbide at reflux temperature (90 ∘C) by reaction with DMC is herein discussed. It is noteworthy that, despite methylation of secondary alcohols is quite complicated owing {{to the formation of}} elimination products, in this case study, dimethyl isosorbide was the sole product formed at low temperature and in quantitative yield...|$|E
40|$|A gas chromatographic method, with {{electron}} capture detection and mass spectrometric confirmation, is described for {{the determination of}} chlorothalonil and its metabolite 4 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 6 -trichloroisophtalonitrile (HTI) in water samples. Water is saturated with sodium chloride and acidified to pH < 2 with dilute sulfuric acid. After extraction with dichloromethane, HTI was methylated with diazomethane. The extract obtained was cleaned with <b>basic</b> <b>alumina.</b> Chlorothalonil and the methylated HTI-derivative were determined by gas chromatography with {{electron capture}} detection (GC-ECD) and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The limit of detection, depending {{on the nature of}} the water samples is for both compounds between 0. 01 - 0. 03 μg l- 1 water. The average recovery in ground water is 87 % for chlorothalonil and 82 % for HTI...|$|E
