The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus.|$|E

From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E

In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E

5|$|<b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E
