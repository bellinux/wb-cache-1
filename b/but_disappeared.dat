5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{next decade}} {{was one of}} mixed successes. Some of the minor or less {{successful}} series ended: Robert en Bertrand, a critical but never a commercial success, folded in 1993, 8 years after Vandersteen had stopped writing the stories. Jerom and Bessy both were restyled <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> {{a few years later}} in 1988 and 1993. Pats, later renamed Tits, already disappeared in 1986.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang {{music has been}} waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central Maluku have also come to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long ago but that has all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared,</b> replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.|$|E
5|$|Under Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were {{virtually}} {{excluded from the}} important public offices. Mucianus himself all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. Real power was unmistakably concentrated {{in the hands of}} the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of democracy.|$|E
5|$|Western Khmer, {{also called}} Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, is spoken {{by a very}} small, {{isolated}} population in the Cardamom mountain range extending from western Cambodia into eastern Central Thailand. Although little studied, this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of vocal register that has all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> in other dialects of modern Khmer.|$|E

5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common {{starlings}} were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American Acclimatization Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Bergen County. One that remains is South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.|$|E
5|$|Commemoration ceremonies honouring {{the victims}} of the camp have been {{organized}} by the Serb National Council (SNV), representatives of the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009. 24 June has since been designated as a Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp in Croatia. A monument commemorating those who perished was constructed in 1975 and stood for fifteen years before being removed in 1990 prior to the outbreak of ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence. A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.|$|E

5|$|The IIC was {{formally}} disbanded in November 1918. Most {{of its members}} became closely associated with communism and the Soviet Union. Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920. Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M. N. Roy, {{was among the first}} Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements. Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Jawaharlal Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927. He later fled Nazi Germany for the Soviet Union <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> in 1937 under Joseph Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} scleractinians {{were not}} reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest {{diversity in the}} Jurassic and all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> in the mass extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic septal insertion – two features that characterize Scleractinia – have strengthened the hypothesis for an independent origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question. The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera Astrangia, Madracis, Cladocora and Oculina, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.|$|E
5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the site}} of the church, {{including}} {{the upper part of the}} sea defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design a Millennium Cross to commemorate two thousand years of Christianity. This stands at the entrance to the car park and was commissioned by Canterbury City Council.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|Working horses all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Britain's streets by the 21st century; among few {{exceptions}} are heavy horses pulling brewers' wagons, or drays. However, when Young's Brewery ceased brewing in Wandsworth, London, in 2006, it ended more than 300years' use of dray horses by the brewery: its team of Shire horses was retired from delivery work {{and given a}} new career with the head horsekeeper, offering heavy horse team driving as a recreational event, although they continue to appear at opening ceremonies for new Young's pubs and other publicity events.|$|E

5|$|After {{being away}} {{for nearly four}} months, Michaels would make a {{surprise}} return to the WWF as a guest commentator on the July 13 episode of Raw Is War. Michaels would continue to make non-wrestling appearances on WWF programming and on November 23 he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF Commissioner, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, eventually joining Vince McMahon's group of wrestlers called The Corporation as a villain. Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on Raw, in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches. On the January 4, 1999 episode of Raw Is War, Michaels re-joined DX as a fan favorite, <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from WWF television {{for a few weeks}} to have back surgery {{and by the time he}} returned DX was on the way of dissolving within the next couple of months.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared,</b> while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E
