5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject Ecce Homo arises after the time of St. Louis and {{the building of the}} Sainte-Chapelle. The Catholic Encyclopedia reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the chi-rho emblem on early Christian sarcophagi, but the compilers considered that it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> probable that this was only meant for a laurel wreath.|$|E

The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate, and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion. Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with {{the condemned}} person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.|$|E

25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

500|$|One of the film's strongest detractors was Time Out magazine's Keith Uhlich, {{who called}} the film [...] "war porn of the highest order".

[...] While praising the film for its visuals and sound effects, as well as Berg's atmospheric direction, Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave Lone Survivor a mixed review. Smith concluded his review by describing it as [...] "a movie about an irrelevant skirmish that ended in near-total catastrophe, during a war we are not winning." [...] Film critic Steven Boone, writing for Roger Ebert's website, compared the film's violence to that of Mel Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ: [...] "What's in between amounts to The Passion of the Christ for U.S. servicemen: a bloody historic episode recounted mainly in images of hardy young men being ripped apart, at screeching volume. Though Berg's source material isn't the New Testament, he often handles Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell's account...with the thunderous reverence Mel Gibson brought to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection." ...|$|E

He was positive towards the Logan and Keith storylines, writing [...] "the other main storylines, featuring Logan and Keith, were nice ones for the respective characters," [...] calling the half-brother plotline [...] "interesting". On the advancing of the rapist plot, Goldman praised the increase in Veronica's personal involvement with the case, while continuing to criticize the portrayal of the feminists in the episode. [...] "At this point, neither we, nor Veronica, seem to be meant to have nearly any sympathy for them. And yet, shouldn't we all naturally be able to connect more to a group of girls who are passionately seeking to stop a serial rapist on campus?" [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a very positive review, lauding the Logan's half-brother storyline, calling it [...] "Top quality stuff. I loved the moment when Veronica realized Logan's brother was an imposter and in the next scene we saw the two guys surfing together. So much suspense!" [...] Television Without Pity gave [...] "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] a [...] "B+". The reviewer was very positive towards the plot involving Logan and his supposed half-brother, writing, [...] "since Logan actually knows how to find Charlie in person, perhaps this all doesn't have to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> tragic as it's coming off.

500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats did not seem to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due {{to the way in which}} they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1883, Courtney {{was hired}} for 10days to help train the Cornell University four-oared varsity crew for their 1 mile race against Wesleyan College, University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University at the Lake George Regatta. Princeton and Penn were favored since {{they both had}} beaten several of the top rowing clubs in America. He was hired again by Cornell in 1884, which drew {{criticism}} because of his past controversies during his professional career.

[...] Because of the help he gave during the 1883 season that allowed Cornell to defeat rivals at Lake George, Cornell overlooked his ethics and hired him on for his extensive rowing knowledge. Courtney coached the four-oared crews at Cornell {{over the next few years}} and consistently won. Notable victories included winning the Childs Cup over Pennsylvania in 1885 and 1887, and winning the Downing Cup in The People’s Regatta at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1888.|$|E

[...] When asked if they are pro gamers, Bajo and Hex explained that in truth they aren't, as [...] "a pro gamer is someone who plays games professionally at the highest competitive levels in tournaments... so we don't really fit that description, and pro gamers around the world would scoff if we ever said we were [...] "pro"." [...] They added that their job as game critics is not to be {{the best of the best}} at any one particular game, but to [...] "be ok at all types of games so we can review and compare them to help you decide if you want to play them." [...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E

His first team cricket with Lancashire in 2006–2009 was limited, {{and in that}} time he played 4first-class matches, 7listA matches, and three Twenty20 matches. In April 2007, Mullaney scored his maiden first-class century. Playing against Durham University, his innings of 165not out (165*) came at quicker than a run a ball and allowed Lancashire to win the match. His first hundred runs came off 92balls and the next 65 from 26 and included 10sixes. It beat his previous highest score of 44. In the 2007 cricket season, Mullaney played for Northern Cricket Club, in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, averaging 70 with the bat and taking over 30wickets. After he spent the winter of 2007/08 playing grade cricket for McKinnon in the Victorian Turf Cricket Association, Mullaney signed a professional contract with Atherton Cricket Club in the Bolton Association {{at the start of the}} 2008 season.

They've succeeded in making a movie for no audience at all." [...] And The New York Timess Jeannette Catsoulis complained that [...] "John Hodge's screenplay is frequently dreary and overly literal... The Seeker feels passé and lacks a charismatic lead." [...] One of the few somewhat-positive reviews came from the Chicago Tribune's Kelley L. Carter, who said that [...] "At its best, The Seeker is a pretty vivid fantasy book come-to-life" [...] and found the lead character of Will Stanton to have been [...] "played convincingly." [...] Another came from the Baltimore Suns Michael Sragow, who found that The Seeker had [...] "a lot going for it, including wonderful sets and locations...that create a heightened-reality English hamlet". Both gave the movie only 2½ stars out of 4. Several of the reviewers mentioned the Harry Potter movies. The New York Timess Catsoulis mentioned, [...] "Too bad Daniel Radcliffe is an only child." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Carter wrote, [...] "Harry Potter, meet your not-so-much cousin... {{had it not been for}} the Potter series, the bar for children’s fantasy film wouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> high, and The Seeker falls short of the high-riding, high-quality material delivered in the Harry Potter film series." [...] The New York Posts Smith went so far as to title his review [...] "Bad Harry Day" [...] and to joke that [...] "In today's England, a teenage boy is instructed by grown-up mentors in the use of magical powers while a dark lord who comes in many formats promises an epic battle. The movie is based on a 1973 book by Susan Cooper, who must be trembling in fear of being sued for ripping off J.K. Rowling's ideas and publishing them 20 years in advance." [...] The Boston Globes Burr described the parallels more clearly, saying that [...] "against him is a metrosexual meanie called The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), sort of a He Who Can Be Named.
