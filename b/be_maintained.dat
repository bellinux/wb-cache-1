5|$|As {{it appears}} that the {{decision}} of the court of appeals was rested, in addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not involving any federal question, and sufficient in itself to maintain the judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that subject, and cannot <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cancel the Ground Combat Vehicle – If the Army {{reconditioned}} {{its current}} Bradley instead of replacing them, the current {{capability of the}} IFV fleet could <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> through 2030. The Army could continue to investigate {{ways to improve the}} current Bradleys, but it would not field any new or improved vehicles. The $24 billion saved in funding could be used on other programs.|$|E
5|$|Debian 0.01, {{released}} on September 15, 1993, {{was the first}} of several internal releases. Version 0.90 was the first public release, providing support through mailing lists hosted at Pixar. The release included the Debian Linux Manifesto, outlining Murdock's view for the new operating system. In it he called {{for the creation of a}} distribution to <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU.|$|E

Since December 2014, the Class 455 fleet <b>is</b> now <b>maintained</b> at Stewarts Lane (having {{transferred}} from Selhurst).|$|R
5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing {{a significant percentage of}} the provincial highway network.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{would need}} a {{significant}} manpower expansion of 2,800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships. The Commission {{believed that it was}} unlikely that sufficient Dutch citizens would volunteer, and that as a result Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI. Strong segregation between white and Indonesian sailors was to <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency.|$|E

5|$|The Epsilon Eridani {{system also}} {{includes}} two belts of rocky asteroids: at about 3AU and 20AU from the star. The orbital structure could <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> by a hypothetical second planet, which if confirmed would be Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani hosts an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals {{left over from}} the system's formation.|$|E
5|$|There were, of course, {{numerous}} {{reasons for}} maintaining roads. A unified political system could <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> {{only as long}} as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.|$|E
5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

30|$|The {{bacterial}} culture Bacillus amyloliquefacience P- 001 {{was obtained from}} the Microbial Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Biotechnology, Ganakbari, Savar, Dhaka. It <b>was</b> <b>maintained</b> on nutrient agar medium. The organism <b>was</b> <b>maintained</b> at 4 °C in refrigerator for routine laboratory use. For the long term preservation, the log phage growth bacteria <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> in 15 % glycerol broth at - 20 °C.|$|R
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low reproductive success {{that they could not}} <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> without immigration.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} {{holding that}} this action could <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> {{either by the}} tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes. They are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are conferred upon them by statute.|$|E
5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
50|$|First North Western's diesel fleet <b>was</b> <b>maintained</b> at Newton Heath Depot, and the {{electric}} fleet at Longsight Depot. The Class 175s <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> at a purpose built depot in Chester.|$|R
500|$|The {{majority}} of NY22's [...] routing <b>is</b> <b>maintained</b> by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, several sections <b>are</b> <b>maintained</b> by other jurisdictions. The southernmost {{of these is}} in the Bronx, where the entirety of NY22 within the borough <b>is</b> <b>maintained</b> by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). In Westchester County, NY22 <b>is</b> mostly locally <b>maintained</b> within the city of Mount Vernon and is county-maintained within the city of White Plains. In Clinton County, the route <b>is</b> locally <b>maintained</b> within the city of Plattsburgh.|$|R

5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E
5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to operate on the maritime plain could <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> far from base. He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills {{with the hope of}} capturing Jerusalem. This would keep pressure on this army in the hope of denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E
