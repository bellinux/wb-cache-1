2500|$|In the {{landmark}} 1976 California case of Landeros v. Flood, the California Supreme Court remanded {{a case to}} the trial court for action in tort against a treating physician for failure to report suspected child abuse. [...] The theory at trial was that the plaintiff, a child of about 12 months of age, had been returned to a home where further physical abuse occurred, causing more damages. [...] This was because the physician had failed to report the abuse in violation of California law. [...] After this case, all states instituted mandatory reporting by physicians and other medical personnel of any suspected child abuse or neglect cases. In general, reporting in good faith shields the physician or health care worker from tort liability. Reporting to police or social services necessitates obtaining medical records by subpoena duces tecum. This case, and legislation that followed it were in response to several articles {{that appeared in the}} medical literature that defined <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome</b> and child abuse syndrome.|$|E

The theoretical part is defined by the family, its functions, types, and family pathology is described in the context of domestic violence and CAN syndrome. The central chapters of this section also deal with educational styles, parental attitudes, characteristics of domestic violence and child development in families with the occurrence of domestic violence. The practical part includes a qualitative analysis of documents, families affected by domestic violence, held at the Municipal Office Prachatice, department of Social and legal protection of children. The analysis examined whether these families can be considered the transgeneration transfer patterns of behaviour and styles of upbringing family to multiply family.

Further surveys and analyses of the syndrome followed, culminating in a landmark article published in 1962 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. [...] Since that date numerous additional studies of the condition have been undertaken, and their results and recommendations publicized in the medical journals. A typical article in the field recites case histories of child abuse, points out the distinguishing {{signs and symptoms of}} the <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and advises the practicing physician how to detect and treat the condition.

50|$|While helpful, the {{foregoing}} general {{history of the}} <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not conclusive on the precise question in the case at bar. The question is whether a reasonably prudent physician examining this plaintiff in 1971 would have been led to suspect she {{was a victim of}} the <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome</b> from the particular injuries and circumstances presented to him, would have confirmed that diagnosis by ordering X-rays of her entire skeleton, and would have promptly reported his findings to appropriate authorities to prevent a recurrence of the injuries.

It is further alleged that proper medical treatment of plaintiff's <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome</b> would have included reporting her injuries to local law enforcement authorities or juvenile probation department.

5000|$|Inasmuch as the [...] "common knowledge" [...] {{exception}} to the foregoing rule does not apply on the facts here alleged, the trial court could not properly conclude {{as a matter of}} law that defendants' standard of professional care did not include the diagnostic and treatment procedures outlined in the complaint. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to the opportunity to prove by way of expert testimony that in the circumstances of this case a reasonably prudent physician would have followed those procedures. Whether the physician would have followed the procedure of reporting plaintiff's injuries to the authorities, however, is not solely a question of good medical practice. The above-cited reporting statutes (Pen. Code, § 11160- 11161.5) were in force in 1971. They evidence a determination by the Legislature that in the event a physician does diagnose a <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome,</b> due care includes a duty to report that fact to the authorities. In other words, since the enactment of these statutes a physician who diagnoses a <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> <b>syndrome</b> will not be heard to say that other members of his profession would not have made such a report. The same is true of each of the persons and entities covered by this legislation. Accordingly, although expert testimony on the issue of a duty to report is admissible, it is not mandatory.|$|E
