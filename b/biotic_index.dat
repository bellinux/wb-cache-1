40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a study which assessed the knowledge gaps regarding the variation, consistency {{and effectiveness of}} <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> to detect a level of ecosystem health in two subtropical streams {{in the context of}} spatial and temporal patterns of variability in water quality and macroinvertebrate community compositions during varying antecedent rainfall totals (ART) and daily flows. Macroinvertebrates were sampled in riffle and pool-edge habitats on three occasions over a one-year period at seven sites in Terania and Goolmangar Creeks in north-eastern NSW, Australia. The <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS), SIGNAL 2 score and the environmental filters model were used as indicators of stream health. Physical and chemical parameters were measured and compared with macroinvertebrate data observed in the study and the biotic data were also compared with samples collected by NSW Environment Protection Authority (NSWEPA) in the study creeks. Habitat for macroinvertebrates was assessed with a visual-based habitat assessment (HABSCORE). The study found physical and chemical parameters and macroinvertebrate assemblages in riffles and edge habitats varied among seasons, sites and between creeks. The study also observed significant spatial and temporal variation in <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> and the values for <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> differed under temporal changes in environmental variables. It is considered that the temporal variability among <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> may be partly a result of the effects of anthropogenic activities, natural seasonal variability in ART and daily flows as well {{as a result of the}} non-seasonal drought prior to sampling in summer (2003). The values of <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> were higher on Terania Creek compared to the more agriculturally oriented Goolmangar Creek. For both creeks, the highest values for most <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> were observed at sites located in the upper reaches and the lowest values downstream at sites more impacted by human pressure. It was considered that all the <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> effectively indicated a gradient of human pressure among sites and between creeks. The <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> were found to be somewhat independent of each other and the responses of the indices to environmental factors (natural and human-generated) varied. The majority of <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> were sensitive to factors such as altitude, water quality and land-use activities. The study found SIGNAL to be the most sensitive of the indices to seasonal variations in water quality and AUSRIVAS and environmental filters models effectively indicated seasonal variation in taxa diversity. The <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> applied in the study complemented each other, with each providing insights regarding assessment of the health of the study creeks. It is recommended that, when using <b>biotic</b> <b>indices,</b> sampling is undertaken for more than one season because of possible significant temporal variations in biotic indices’ values at the same site. It is also considered equally important that stream managers do not limit the number of habitats sampled to one. The capability the <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> demonstrated in measuring the health of streams used in conjunction with additional indicators based on other ecosystem elements (e. g. fish, turtles, diatoms etc) may assist river planners in assessing the most appropriate cease-to-pump (CTP) for the proposed Water Sharing Plan for the study creeks and other tributaries of the Wilsons River...|$|R

In the present work, the question about the discriminating power of different <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> and the relationships with the structure and functioning of the macrobenthic community in a transitional environment is discussed. A time series of samples collected during the last 70 years in the lagoon of Venice, reflecting different environmental conditions (a sort of ‘pristine state’ in 1935, the distrophic crisis in 1988 and subsequent modifications in 1990, the invasion by an alien species and the developing of high impacting fishery in 1999) has been used.

40|$|Changes in macroinvertebrate {{community}} and <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> associated with streamflow regulation and wastewater inputs in Sierra Cebollera Natural Park (La Rioja, Northern Spain) The macroinvertebrate communities of two mountain streams in the Sierra Cebollera Natural Park (La Rioja, Northern Spain) were studied {{to ascertain the}} changes in these communities and their ecological status, considering the two main pressures {{that exist in the}} area, i. e., the Pajares Reservoir and various wastewater discharges. While the alterations in the macroinvertebrate communities were minimal downstream of the wastewater discharges, significant changes were detected in the composition of the community in the stream reaches located downstream of the Pajares Reservoir. This major disturbance downstream of the dam was especially intense in those reaches affected by a massive growth of the invasive algae Didymosphenia geminata, which might be related to dam operation. Despite a small decrease in the different <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> used, especially IBMWP and IMMi-T, downstream of the Pajares Reservoir, no large changes in the biological quality levels were detected (from high to good conditions). We conclude that the <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> did not completely reflect the changes produced by the disturbances present in the studied streams, especially the effects produced by the presence of a large dam. This study highlights the importance of considering measures other than the <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> to study the ecological status of headwater streams and rivers using macroinvertebrates, such as multivariate analysis, when the main disturbance is the alteration of the physical habitat rather than organic pollution...|$|R

However, at this shallow sites with low human pressure and high water residence times, such benthic community composition can be associated with physical stress due to salinity increase and to changes in environmental characteristics, triggered by conventional seasonal variations.

This {{study was conducted in}} a coastal area under mild organic enrichment from a sewage outfall where no other anthropogenic point source disturbance exists. Results are presented from an integrated assessment in order to test if <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> would give a response comparable to that of other descriptors. The study included the analysis of sediment descriptors, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in benthic species, benthic community species composition and abundance, and <b>biotic</b> <b>indices.</b> The various groups of descriptors were tested under the null hypothesis of no significant alterations with increasing distance from the outfall. The sediment grain-size, median and total organic matter did not cause rejection of the null hypothesis, in contrast to the sediment redox potential and the stable carbon isotopic composition. The benthic community species composition and abundance and their stable carbon isotopic composition also rejected the null hypothesis. In areas closer to the outfall, the redox potential showed negative values, the macrofauna showed the dominance of opportunistic species and the stable carbon isotope composition showed depletion, in accordance with a terrestrial origin of organic matter. These three independent groups of descriptors diagnosed a coherent alteration scenario associated with organic enrichment. However, the <b>biotic</b> <b>indices</b> failed to reject the null hypothesis. The analysis of the full species composition dataset gave a more reliable picture of the environmental disruption and specific descriptors such as stable isotopes allowed a direct measure of the spatial extent of the organic enrichment.
