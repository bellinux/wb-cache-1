Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms.

My company recently developed a guitar that can be programmed to sound like twenty-five different classic guitars - everything from a 1928 National 'Tricone' to a 1970 Martin. It is quite an amazing piece of technology. The guitar started as a research project <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> know if the technology was going to be viable and if the guitar design was going to be practical. I've been in this business for about twenty years now, and I still enjoy starting up projects whenever the opportunity presents itself. During the research phase, I headed up the project myself. Once we completed our preliminary research and made the decision to move into development, that's when I handed the project off - and that's where this story really begins...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} {{expected}} integrated mean-squared error (EIMSE) experimental design criterion and show how we {{used it to}} design experiments <b>to</b> meet the <b>needs</b> of researchers in die casting engineering. This criterion expresses in a direct way the researchers' goal to minimize the expected meta-model prediction errors, {{taking into account the}} effects of both random experimental errors and errors deriving from our uncertainty about the true model form. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make assumptions about the prior distribution of model coefficients to estimate the EIMSE, we performed a sensitivity analysis to verify that the relative prediction performance of the design generated was largely insensitive to our assumptions. Also, we discuss briefly the general advantages of EIMSE optimal designs, including lower expected bias errors compared with popular response surface designs and substantially lower variance errors than certain Box-Draper all-bias designs.

40|$|Criticism of the {{traditional}} budget has increased since the 1970 s {{and it has become}} increasingly common for companies to abandon the budget in part or in whole. Because companies that do not prepare budgets and instead makes rolling forecasts, the question arose whether it is possible to borrow money without a budget as a basis. Therefore, we were interested to find out if one of the major commercial banks’ credits differed according to the different decisions. To examine this we carried out a qualitative study of Svenska Handelsbanken AB <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get deeper responses from a bank's perspective in terms of the ability to lend money to companies without a budget. We were then able to conclude that the assessment of the budget and forecasts did not differ and that they can be considered the same thing from Svenska Handelsbanken AB`s point of view.
