25|$|The <b>Boston</b> <b>terrier</b> breed {{originated}} around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston, {{purchased from}} Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which {{was of a}} Bull and Terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is either {{directly related to the}} original Bull and Terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries, or Judge is the result of modern English Bulldogs being crossed into terriers created in the 1860s for show purposes, like the White English Terrier. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of almost all true modern Boston Terriers.|$|E
25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a <b>Boston</b> <b>Terrier.</b> A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Syringomyelia* is a {{condition}} where a fluid filled sac develops in the spinal cord. The most important cause in dogs is by a Chiari I malformation, which is when an underdeveloped occipital bone interferes with spinal fluid circulation and results in fluid accumulation in the cervical spinal cord. This is a congenital disease most commonly found in small breeds such as the Brussels Griffon and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Other breeds known to be affected include the Bichon Fris√©, <b>Boston</b> <b>terrier,</b> bull terrier, Chihuahua, French bulldog, Havanese, King Charles spaniel (the English toy spaniel), Maltese, miniature dachshunds, miniature and toy poodles, Papillon, Pomeranian, Pugs, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire bull terrier, and the Yorkshire terrier. Signs may include ataxia, weakness, and neck pain.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Abu Simbel the heroes {{are joined by}} Iggy, a <b>Boston</b> <b>Terrier</b> and the user of The Fool, a simple but powerful Stand of sand. They are immediately attacked by the blind Stand user N'Doul, who attacks with Geb, a Stand of water and {{the first of the}} nine Egyptian god Stands; he is able to slash through Kakyoin's corneas before he is defeated by Jotaro and Iggy. Afterwards, Kakyoin is taken to a hospital to recuperate. Oingo and Boingo, users of the face-altering Stand Khnum and the future-predicting comic book Thoth respectively, attempt to defeat the heroes, but Oingo (in disguise as Jotaro) is incapacitated without the heroes even knowing he was there. Anubis, a sword with a Stand, possesses a farmer named Chaka, a barber named Khan, and then Polnareff, nearly killing Jotaro before being thrown in a river to rust away. Mariah, the user of Bast, magnetizes Joseph and Avdol causing problems for them before they overcome her attacks and crush her between themselves. Meanwhile, Polnareff and Silver Chariot are reduced to children by Seth, the shadow Stand of the sadistic child-abuser Alessi. Polnareff outsmarts Alessi before he is attacked by a de-aged Jotaro; Polnareff and Jotaro return to their old selves before beating up Alessi. Later, the group encounters Daniel J. D'Arby, who offers information if they gamble with him, but when Polnareff and Joseph lose, D'Arby's Stand Osiris transforms their souls into poker chips. Only by betting everyone's souls and bluffing his way through D'Arby's rigged game can Jotaro defeat him. In Cairo the group meets Hol Horse again, who has partnered himself with Boingo, but the duo are defeated through their own incompetence. Later, Iggy battles Pet Shop, DIO's pet falcon and the user of the ice-slinging Stand Horus. Kakyoin returns soon afterwards, his eyesight mostly recovered.|$|E
