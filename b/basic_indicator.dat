25|$|Since the <b>basic</b> <b>indicator</b> {{system in}} either an analog or digital meter {{responds}} to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E

The dimension of Modern Social Security System is captured through three different indicators: 4. the main indicator, which is based on 20 <b>basic</b> <b>indicators</b> and covers the three year period from 2005 to 2007, 5. a first additional indicator, based on 17 <b>basic</b> <b>indicators</b> and covering only 2004, 6. a second additional indicator built on 24 <b>basic</b> <b>indicators</b> and covering only 2007. All indicators used are based on three different sources. Results point to a heterogeneous Europe, with an overall good performance of Continental countries, and less favourable scores for Mediterranean and Eastern Member States. The indicator's country ranking is quite stable over the period considered with a few changes from one year to another. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have been performed in order to test the robustness of the Composite Indicator. Those were based on 29400 different simulated scenarios for the main indicator, 25200 different scenarios for the 2004 indicator and 35000 simulated scenarios for the 2007 indicator, generated by considering different options with respect to standardization methods, weighting scheme, aggregation rules and the inclusion/exclusion of <b>basic</b> <b>indicators.</b> Results show that the composite indicator's scores and rankings are overall robust over the period, although some variability is present in each year. This is mainly due to the imputation of missing data. On average, countries record a higher ranking variability with respect to the Life Long Learning Composite indicator, but a lower one compared to the index on Active Labour Market Policies. This is due to the varying presence of missing data. However, the MSS index is quite robust compared to similar indicators developed in the literature. JRC.
