25|$|In Britain, but {{especially}} London, during the 1970s and the 1980s {{the teaching and}} playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 {{out of more than}} 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which children can be taught. To counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who have a passion for cricket, and were concerned at its decline.|$|E
500|$|Meyer is {{a former}} United States Senator and Vice President of the United States {{following}} an unsuccessful run for President. During the first season, as Vice President she was powerless and disregarded by most other important officials, leading to various humiliations and indignities. During the second season she begins to amass some power and influence. In the third season, she contemplates challenging the incumbent president for their unnamed party's nomination {{in light of his}} political weakness, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> mooted when he abruptly resigns, allowing her to become the president. [...] In the fourth season, she has assumed office but is facing strong primary and general-election challengers of her own. The general election results in a tie, setting the stage for the fifth season, as the United States House of Representatives prepares to choose the president.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Samuel Gompers, {{president}} of the American Federation of Labor, has said: [...] "The workers want more wages; more of the comforts of life; more leisure; more chance for self-improvement as men, as trade-unionists, as citizens. These were the wants of yesterday; they are the wants of today; {{they will be the}} wants of tomorrow, and of tomorrow's morrow. The struggle may assume new forms, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the immemorial one,--an effort of the producers to obtain an increasing measure of the wealth that flows from their production." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Majesty," [...] he said, [...] "I beg you for {{one moment}} to reflect. I appeal once more, less for your sake or mine, than for our country's, to your honour. Your throne you owe to me. I have been your {{faithful}} servant, and my sword is yet wet {{with the blood of}} your enemies. Our name is great throughout Europe. An alliance with us can only strengthen your hold upon the people. It ill becomes me to force these things upon you, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> great. Do you seek the hand of my sister in marriage?" ...|$|E

50|$|Sir Brian Hill, {{a member}} of the seventh {{generation}} of his family to work in the business, retired in 1992. In 1994 it announced a rights <b>issue</b> to finance <b>the</b> acquisition of land for housing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> not well subscribed.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{humans do}} not appear to display the same degree of sexual {{dimorphism}} as Australopithecus did. In modern populations, males are on average a mere 15% larger than females, while in Australopithecus, males could be up to 50% larger than females. New research suggests, however, that australopithecines exhibited a lesser degree of sexual dimorphism than these figures suggest, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not settled.|$|E
50|$|Mary Newport, married William Gratewood, {{nephew of}} Rowland Hill. However, the entry for the Newports in the Visitation of Shropshire {{features}} Mary twice, initially as a sister of Sir Richard, and only afterwards as a daughter. Moreover, {{there has been}} understandable confusion between Mary and Magdalen, her sister or niece. Placing her as a sister of Sir Richard seems more plausible chronologically, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. She is omitted from the family tree below.|$|E
50|$|The story {{develops}} from there, {{taking in}} his twin brother's widow, Lissa; Rudy Banning, a once respected professor and writer {{turned into an}} anti-semitic conspiracy theorist by a brain-altering microbe; and a scheming group of immortals who want to stay unique. They {{are able to do}} this because they have access to bacteriological research by Russian scientist Maxim Golokhov from the 1940s who was working for Beria and Stalin. Stalin possibly cameos in the story, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> left vague.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} for <b>the</b> first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> gathered in late 1989 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> not published until 'Autumn' 1991 (which in Australia means the months March to May).

50|$|Kelly {{returned}} home in August, {{to be named}} vicar-general by Bourget. Kelly also received a canonship of the Cathedral of Saint-Jacques in Montreal. In September, Signay seconded the appointment. Kelly's return was not universally well-received, however. A number of parishioners preferred his interim replacement, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> resolved by December.|$|R
5000|$|Stopping {{power is}} related to the {{physical}} properties of the bullet, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> complicated and not easily studied. Although higher caliber has traditionally been widely associated with higher stopping power, the physics involved are multifactorial, with caliber, muzzle velocity, bullet mass, bullet shape, and bullet material all contributing. Critics contend that the importance of [...] "one-shot stop" [...] statistics is overstated, pointing out that most gun encounters do not involve a [...] "shoot once and see how the target reacts" [...] situation.|$|E
5000|$|Rene Weis echoes a {{trend of}} recent and older {{suggestions}} that Edith Thompson was innocent of murder. The main {{basis for this}} argument {{is that there was}} no evidence that Edith was party to arranging the murder on the night in question, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> bound up with his perception of what it means to be [...] "principal to murder in the second degree" [...] (i.e. support, assist, instigate, command, agree, murder) and also his perception of Edith's true character, although he concedes she was an adulteress and no saint.|$|E
5000|$|An {{answer to}} the {{question}} of whether philosophical progress is possible, however, is not the end of the story: it may still leave open the question of whether it is desirable. Those who are optimists about the prospect for philosophical progress have a pretty clear answer: it is, they could argue, just part of what we mean by [...] "progress," [...] that you ought to pursue it if you can get it. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> somewhat trickier for pessimists. If philosophical progress is not possible, then there are two different lessons that could be, and have been, taken from that.|$|E
50|$|Peter Siddle {{was named}} the Man of the match for his match figures of 9/104. There was minor {{controversy}} when broadcast footage of the match appeared to show Siddle ball tampering, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> quickly cleared up without any formal complaint against him. Siddle was later cleared by the International Cricket Council (ICC).|$|R
50|$|During World War II, nations {{started to}} expand and claim many {{resources}} and water territories all over their surrounding coasts. There were four international treaties meticulously drafted in the late 1950s and onto <b>the</b> 1970s, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> not resolved between nations until 1982 when the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was introduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{context of}} this paper is the current range of {{investment}} regulation regimes in Asia, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> universal. Investment in Asia is governed by multiple layers of legal norms, many of which are external to the host State of the investment. These norms deal with both aspects of the issue: definition and dispute resolution...|$|R
50|$|When the {{computers}} are joined into a domain (Active Directory or NT domain for instance), each computer {{has a unique}} Domain SID which is recomputed each time a computer enters a domain. Thus there are typically no significant problems with duplicated SIDs when {{the computers}} {{are members of a}} domain, especially if local user accounts are not used. If local user accounts are used, there is a potential security issue similar to the one described above, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> limited to the files and resources protected by local users, as opposed to by domain users.|$|E
5000|$|If, as {{is often}} the case, the {{standard}} deviation of the estimated g should be needed by itself, this is readily obtained by a simple rearrangement of Eq(18). This standard deviation is usually quoted along with the [...] "point estimate" [...] of the mean value: for the simulation this would be 9.81 ± 0.41 m/s2. What is to be inferred from intervals quoted in this manner needs to be considered very carefully. Discussion of this important topic {{is beyond the scope of}} this article, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> addressed in some detail in the book by Natrella.|$|E
5000|$|The {{green-winged teal}} (Anas carolinensis or Anas crecca carolinensis) {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} duck that breeds in the northern areas of North America except on the Aleutian Islands. It was considered conspecific with the common teal (A. crecca) for some time <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> still being reviewed by the American Ornithologists' Union; based on this the IUCN and BirdLife International do not accept it as a separate species at present. However, nearly all other authorities consider it distinct based on behavioral, morphological, and molecular evidence. The scientific name is from Latin Anas, [...] "duck" [...] and carolinensis, [...] "of Carolina".|$|E

5000|$|At the Sumerian Royal Cemetery of Ur, a [...] "complete rubble dome {{built over}} a timber centring" [...] was {{found among the}} {{chambers}} of the tombs for Meskalamdug and Puabi, dating to around 2500 BC. Set in mud mortar, it was a [...] "true dome with pendentives rounding off the angles of the square chamber." [...] Other small domes can be inferred from the remaining ground plans, such as one {{in the courtyard of}} Ur-Nammu's ziggurat, and in later shrines and temples of the 14th century BC. Some monumental Mesopotamian buildings of the Kassite period are thought to have had brick domes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> unsettled due to insufficient evidence in what has survived of these structures.|$|E
50|$|He {{tries to}} leave, but manages to disable the car, and {{eventually}} hitches a ride into town. After making arrangements {{to get the}} car fixed, he makes {{more than a dozen}} phone calls attempting to locate his wife. Finally succeeding, he discovers she is in hospital after being wounded in an ‘incident’ at the train station in Poitiers. He goes to the hospital where she is, whereupon police lieutenant Levet (Jean-Pierre Gos) notifies him his wife was beaten, robbed, and raped by the dangerous convict, whose body has now been discovered. Antoine explains to the lieutenant what had happened between himself and Hélène, but leaves out his subsequent ‘adventure’, of course. The lieutenant may suspect Antoine, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not pushed any further.|$|E
