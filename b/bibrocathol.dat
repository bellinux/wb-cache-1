40|$|Background <b>Bibrocathol</b> is a {{well-established}} antiseptic drug {{for the treatment}} of acute eyelid diseases like blephar-itis. Despite its frequent use in clinical practice, no con-trolled clinical trial on the efficacy of <b>bibrocathol</b> 2 % eye ointment has been performed until now. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate efficacy, safety and tolerability of <b>bibrocathol</b> (Posiformin ® 2 %) eye ointment in patients diagnosed with blepharitis. Methods In this multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled parallel-group comparison, the change of signs and symptoms (sum score) of blepharitis in 197 patients (ITT (intention-to-treat-group); mean age 56 ± 18 years, 56 % female, active drug:vehicle 097 : 100) over 2 weeks treatment with <b>bibrocathol</b> 2 % eye ointment was evaluated. Results Patients receiving <b>bibrocathol</b> 2 % showed greater improvement in the sum score than the placebo patients (p< 0. 0001, Cohen’s effect size d 00. 73). Also, the results from further efficacy assessments improvement of single symp-toms and ocular discomfort measured by a VAS (visual analogue scale) supported treatment with <b>bibrocathol.</b> Patients and investigators provided favorable tolerability ratings preferring <b>bibrocathol</b> over placebo. No safety issues were observed with regard to intraocular pressure, visual acuity, or occurrence of adverse events. Conclusions Blepharitis therapy with the antiseptic bibro-cathol 2 % in this trial was highly efficacious and safe...|$|E
