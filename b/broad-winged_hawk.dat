Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.|$|E

25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawk</b> (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1941, the Brown County Game Preserve and Brown County State Park were unified as {{a single}} state park. Since that time, two {{portions}} of the park have been designated as nature preserves—giving them additional protection from development. [...] Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve was established in 1970 and consists of [...] in Ogle Hollow containing the rare yellowwood tree. [...] The second preserve is the [...] Ten O'Clock Line Nature Preserve. [...] This preserve was designated in 2010, and is Indiana's largest. [...] It also contains yellowwood trees, and {{is the home of}} some of Indiana's deep forest species, including the red bat, timber rattlesnake, and <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawk.</b> [...] The term [...] "Ten O'Clock Line" [...] refers to a treaty with the Miami Indians from the early 1800s.|$|E
500|$|The {{park has}} good bird viewing areas along the trails, near the two lakes, {{and at the}} Nature Center. The hooded warbler, pileated woodpecker, and ruffed grouse nest in the park. [...] Goldfinches and {{northern}} cardinals {{can be seen at}} feeders near the Nature Center. [...] The pileated woodpecker, Acadian flycatcher, eastern wood pewee, white-breasted nuthatch, wood thrush, and yellow-billed cuckoo can all be observed in the park's Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve. [...] Owls and woodpeckers are known to occupy sycamore trees. [...] The cerulean warbler, whippoorwill, and <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawk</b> all live in the Ten O'Clock Nature Preserve. [...] Wild turkeys can be seen (and heard) along the park's Trail 10, known as the Fire Tower Trail. [...] Other bird species in the park include the blue jay, the crow, the junco, the white-breasted nuthatch, and the robin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> are carnivores. The {{types of}} food they eat {{depends on the}} time of year. During the summer or nesting season the parents and {{ultimately}} their chicks will eat small mammals, such as chipmunks, shrews, and voles, frogs, lizards, and sometimes even other nesting birds. In the winter months <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> have been observed feeding on insects, frogs, snakes, crabs, and some small mammals. To catch their prey, <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> will watch from low branches hiding in the foliage until a target is spotted. From their roost they will do a short fast glide to capture the prey. They give special attention to preparing their food for consumption, skinning frogs and snakes and plucking prey birds' feathers. Most small mammals on the other hand will be eaten whole. They rarely drink water and are able to survive solely with the water present in their prey.|$|R
50|$|<b>Broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> have a {{wide range}} in North America and South America, from {{southern}} Canada to southern Brazil. Their breeding range is in the northern and eastern parts of North America and some, not all, migrate in the winter to Florida, southern Mexico and northern South America. There are five subspecies that are endemic to the Caribbean that do not migrate. Thus, <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> are partial migrants. Those subspecies that do migrate will fly in flocks of more than forty up {{to hundreds of thousands}} at heights anywhere from 550 m to approximately 1300 m. They soar using thermals to carry them through their journey of 3000 - 6000 km. Fall migration lasts for 70 days as birds migrate about 100 km per day from North America, through Central America to South America without crossing salt water. The enormous flocks of soaring <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> are termed kettles and are characteristic of many hawk migration spectacles in North America, such as at Hawk Cliff in Ontario, Hawk Ridge in Minnesota, Hawk Mountain in Pennsylvania, and the River of Raptors in Veracruz.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{birds of prey}} are <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawks</b> and American kestrels, {{followed}} by red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, and barred owls. Water birds include the loon, great blue heron, common merganser, spotted sandpiper, and herring gull.|$|R
500|$|As an International Bird Area, Quehanna's {{forests are}} {{recognized}} as a [...] "large, unfragmented tract with exceptional diversity of woodland species" [...] and are home to 102species of birds. Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, <b>broad-winged</b> <b>hawk,</b> common raven, hermit thrush, house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, whip-poor-will, and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as hooded merganser and wood duck, and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock. In addition to the commonly seen red-tailed hawk, other raptors include the northern goshawk and the golden and bald eagles.|$|E

Surveys of hawks were conducted using taped Great-horned Owl broadcasts at 350 points between April and July, 1995 and 1996. The relative abundance was estimated using the proportion of area occupied technique. Estimates of the proportion of area occupied by each species ranged from 4 % to 34 %. Red-tailed Hawks were estimated to occupy 34 % of the area surveyed. Estimates of the area occupied by Cooper's Hawks was 8 % and by Red-shouldered Hawks was 4 %. <b>Broad-winged</b> <b>Hawks</b> only occupied two points, therefore no estimate of the area occupied was determined.
