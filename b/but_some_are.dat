5|$|All juniper species grow berries, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} too bitter to eat. In addition to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea, Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica. But the berries of some species, such as Juniperus sabina, are toxic {{and consumption of}} them is inadvisable.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} scavengers, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> {{omnivorous}} or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It {{is capable of}} maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used {{for a variety of}} purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> toxic {{and should be}} treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|T. m. intermedius is an Asiatic race {{breeding}} from Central Russia to Tajikistan, {{western and}} north east Afghanistan, and eastern China.

This {{is a large}} subspecies, with a sooty-black male and a blackish-brown female.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{have been}} {{developed}} into {{a broad range of}} percussion instruments that are used in both Japanese folk and classical musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was advanced by Francis Taylor Piggott in 1909. Taiko are generally classified based on the construction process, or the specific context in which the drum is used, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> not classified, such as the toy den-den daiko.|$|E
5|$|The Banda Sea in {{the south}} of the Molucca {{archipelago}} includes a small group of islands. Three major tectonic plates beneath the sea, Eurasian, Pacific and Indo-Australian plates, have been converging since the Mesozoic epoch. Volcanoes in the Banda Sea are mainly islands, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> submarine volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|The tributaries of Catawissa Creek {{range from}} 4.6 to 25.6 feet (1.4 to 7.8 m) in width, {{with the vast}} {{majority}} being less than 13 feet (4 m) wide. Most of the tributaries' gradients are high, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> low or moderate and one is extremely high. The tributaries occupy seven United States Geological Survey quadrangles: Catawissa, Shumans, Nuremberg, Conyngham, Ashland, Shenandoah, and Delano. Most of the tributaries are within several hundred meters of a road for {{at least part of}} their lengths.|$|E

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the gilled mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on dead wood, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> parasites that can cause root and butt rot in over 600 species of woody plants. Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E
