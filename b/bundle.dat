40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{organization of}} the collagen fibril network of the guinea pig tympanic membrane was studied by a modified alkali/water maceration method and scanning electron microscopy. The collagen fibril network of the tympanic membrane is formed of the outer radial fibril <b>bundles</b> and inner circular fibril <b>bundles</b> and additional oblique and parabolic fibril <b>bundles.</b> In {{the lower half of}} the tympanic membrane, long radial <b>bundles</b> arising from the umbo and the lower two-fifths of the malleus handle spread radially to blend into the fibrocartilageous tympanic ring. In the upper half portion of the tympanic membrane, short radial <b>bundles</b> run antero- or posterosuperiorly almost paralled with each other connecting the upper three-fifths of the handle of the malleus and the tymanic ring. Oblique <b>bundles</b> running oblique against circular <b>bundles</b> were found only in the inferior portion of the tympanic membrane and the parabolic <b>bundles</b> running parabolically aganinst the circular <b>bundles</b> were observed in the antero- and posterosuperior, anterior and posterior portion of the tympanic membrane. The oblique and parabolic <b>bundles</b> merge with the circular <b>bundles</b> in places but with only a few connections with the radial <b>bundles</b> in the outer layer. At the periphery of the tympanic membrane, circular <b>bundles</b> increase in number to form a thick band of collagen fibrils, annular ligament. Beneath the annular ligament, the radial <b>bundles</b> blend with these special circular <b>bundles.</b> The radial and circular <b>bundles</b> are considered to be the main <b>bundles</b> of the tympanic membrane responsible for the mechanical property to the tympanic membrane. The oblique and parabolic <b>bundles</b> seem to strenghen the connection of the radial and circular fibrils forming a collagen network in the connective layer of the tympanic membrane...|$|R
40|$|Several key {{questions}} in <b>bundling</b> {{have not been}} empirically examined: Is mixed <b>bundling</b> more effective than pure <b>bundling</b> or pure components? Does correlation in consumer valuations make <b>bundling</b> more or less effective? Does <b>bundling</b> serve as a complement or substitute to network effects? To address these questions, we develop a consumer-choice model from micro-foundations to capture the essentials of our setting, the handheld video game market. We provide a framework to understand the dynamic, long-term impacts of <b>bundling</b> on demand. The primary well known explanation for the profitability of <b>bundling</b> relies on homogenization of consumer valuations. However, we find <b>bundling</b> can be effective through a previously unexamined mechanism of dynamic consumer segmentation that can operate even when homogenization might not be effective. In the absence of <b>bundling,</b> we find that sales of both hardware and software components decrease, and consumers who had previously purchased <b>bundles</b> might delay purchases, resulting in lower revenues. We also find that mixed <b>bundling</b> dominates pure <b>bundling</b> and pure components {{in terms of both}} hardware and software revenues. Investigating the link between <b>bundling</b> and indirect network effects, we find that they act as substitute strategies, with a lower relative effectiveness for <b>bundling</b> when network effects are stronger. ∗ Both authors contributed equally to this paper, and are listed in alphabetical order...|$|R

We show that, compared to the equilibrium without <b>bundling,</b> (i) prices, profits and social welfare are lower, whereas (ii) consumer surplus is higher in the equilibrium with mixed <b>bundling.</b> In addition, the population of consumers who purchase both products from the same firm is larger in the equilibrium with mixed <b>bundling.</b> Further, when the quality gap between brands narrows under no <b>bundling</b> and symmetric mixed <b>bundling,</b> prices and profits decrease but social welfare and consumer surplus increase. When quality differentiation is asymmetric across products, however, complicated effects occur on prices and profits due to strategic interdependence that mixed <b>bundling</b> creates. mixed <b>bundling,</b> vertical differentiation, quality advantage, competitive <b>bundling...</b>|$|R
