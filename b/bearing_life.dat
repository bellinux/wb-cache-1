40|$|This report aims {{to explain}} the full design and {{analysis}} of the front upright -the car component which links suspension wishbones and steering bar with wheels- of the TAU Racing’s 2012 car. The first step is to find the worst load case that might affect the upright. Due {{to the fact that the}} study only covers the front ones, the worst load case occurs when the car is cornering and braking at the same time (load transfer effect). Once the loads are studied, the next step is to design the upright and all the components involved in the assembly which will link the wishbones and the wheels. The first problem appears in this point because there is not enough space for all the components. A little change in the suspension geometry (increase of the scrub radius length), solves the problem. The next step is to carry out the <b>bearings</b> <b>life</b> calculations and the finite element analysis (stress and displacements). The results are correct but, after showing to the team leaders the design, another problem appears: the assembly is heavier than expected. The solution agreed is to reduce the bearings size which affects all the assembly. Therefore, another full design is suggested. The <b>bearings</b> <b>life</b> is calculated and the finite element analysis is carried out once again. This time the results are worse: the <b>bearings</b> <b>life</b> is short but, since the competition only lasts a weekend, it is accepted; and the upright has a factor of safety lesser than expected. Hence the last step is an optimization of the upright and, as a result, the factor of safety increases above the minimum required. The overall weight is reduced in almost 20...|$|R

50|$|<b>Bearing</b> <b>life</b> {{is often}} much better when the bearing is kept clean and well lubricated. However, many {{applications}} make good maintenance difficult. For example, bearings in the conveyor {{of a rock}} crusher are exposed continually to hard abrasive particles. Cleaning is of little use, because cleaning is expensive yet the bearing is contaminated again {{as soon as the}} conveyor resumes operation. Thus, a good maintenance program might lubricate the bearings frequently but not include any disassembly for cleaning. The frequent lubrication, by its nature, provides a limited kind of cleaning action, by displacing older (grit-filled) oil or grease with a fresh charge, which itself collects grit before being displaced by the next cycle.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing ball <b>bearings</b> service <b>life</b> is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and ball bearings dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of ball bearings also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of ball bearings thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of solid contaminant particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between ball bearings temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical conveyor idlers bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants. Applied experimental methodology included thermographic inspection, as well as usage of custom designed test rig for ball <b>bearings</b> service <b>life</b> testing. Finally, by obtained experimental data processing in advanced software, statistically significant mathematical correlation between mentioned bearings characteristics was determined and applied in commonly used internal radial clearance equation.

Successful reliability assessment, which is dependent on selecting features that accurately reflect performance degradation as the inputs of the assessment model, allows for the proactive maintenance of equipment. In this paper, a novel method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and Weibull proportional hazards model (WPHM) is proposed to assess the reliability of rolling bearings. A high relative feature set is constructed by selecting the effective features through extracting the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain features over the <b>bearing’s</b> <b>life</b> cycle data. The kernel principal components which can accurately reflect the performance degradation process are obtained by KPCA and then input as the covariates of WPHM to assess the reliability.
