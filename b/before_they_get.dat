25|$|In Eclipse, Bella {{agrees to}} marry Edward on the {{condition}} he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and agrees, on the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot {{is driven by the}} machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native-American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart. However, the truce is endangered when Bella realizes Jacob means more to her than she thought. Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is {{the most important person in}} her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her life trying to please other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing things the way Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire.|$|E
25|$|With Jonathan out {{of their}} lives, Erica and Dimitri reunite. He keeps quiet about his affair with Maria but soon finds out she is pregnant. They run a {{paternity}} test and the results say the baby is his. Unbeknownst to them, Skye Chandler, who {{is in love with}} Maria's husband Edmund, switched the test results. Erica also discovers she is pregnant with Dimitri's baby and the two plan to remarry. On the day that should be their third wedding, Erica collapses. She is rushed to the hospital where she finds out she had a miscarriage. The couple are determined to start a family together so they look into adoption. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> much further with their plans, Erica finds out about Dimitri's one-night stand with Maria and the child they supposedly conceived. She confronts Maria in a remote cabin where her rival goes into labor. Erica has {{to decide whether or not}} to help Maria. She does. After delivering the baby, Erica tries to take her to the hospital but her car goes off a bridge. Erica lives, however, the baby is presumed dead. Dimitri makes it clear that he still wants a future with Erica and that his affair with Maria was just a mistake. Erica makes it equally as clear that they are over, devastating Dimitri.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

500|$|According to Nolan, an {{important}} {{theme of the}} sequel is [...] "escalation", extending the ending of Batman Begins, noting [...] "things having to get worse <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> better". While indicating The Dark Knight would continue the themes of Batman Begins, including justice vs. revenge and Bruce Wayne's issues with his father, Nolan emphasized the sequel would also portray Wayne more as a detective, an aspect of his character not fully developed in Batman Begins. Nolan described the friendly rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent as the [...] "backbone" [...] of the film. He also chose to compress the overall storyline, allowing Dent to become Two-Face in The Dark Knight, thus giving the film an emotional arc the unsympathetic Joker could not offer. Nolan acknowledged the title {{was not only a}} reference to Batman, but also the fallen [...] "white knight" [...] Harvey Dent.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stand Up for Love" [...] {{received}} negative reviews by most music critics. James Blake {{writing for}} BBC Online, described [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] as a [...] "sugary ballad". Pitchfork Medias writer Jess Harvell criticized the song by writing, [...] "Opener 'Stand Up for Love' is subtitled the '2005 World Children's Day Anthem', which {{should tell you}} all {{you really need to}} know, i.e. Diane Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions". Fiona Mckinlay criticized the fact that the song was used as an opener for #1's and felt it wasn't [...] "really causing any kind of reaction <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> started properly with Independent Woman Pt.1". Houston Chronicles Michael D. Clark described the track as [...] "overwrought and overproduced; at best, it's a future prom theme". Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post felt it was [...] "great" [...] the song was used for World's Children day but described it as a [...] "total snoozefest". A writer for Billboard magazine commented that the song lacked the potential to become a chart-topper. He went on to describe it as a [...] "schmaltzy AC ballad aiming to display the individual talents" [...] of Destiny's Child's members, adding that it was [...] "ironic" [...] as the group's other songs on the disc focused mainly on production. He finished his review by saying that [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] was a [...] "disappointing nonstarter".|$|E

In parallel, vocalists in the background sing rhythmically the play, matching the beats of the orchestra playing, thus unifying the ensemble into a resonant oneness.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Christgau {{was less}} enthusiastic, writing in MSN Music that Maxwell [...] "really {{believes}} {{that the quality of}} the sex is measured by its curlicues—and by {{how long it takes to}} come true"; he named [...] "Badhabits" [...] and [...] "Helpsomebody" [...] as the album's highlights. The Observers Paul Mardles was more critical, accusing Maxwell of exhibiting a [...] "fondness for cliche". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post called the album [...] "cerebral but impersonal" [...] and felt that it [...] "never quite breaks free of its self-imposed restraints". Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt said Maxwell's [...] "sentiments rarely transcend the boudoir — and listeners lulled by the album's unvaryingly sleek, high-gloss beats may just drift off to dreamland <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> there". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis wrote that several songs [...] "never rise above the level of pleasant background music", which he nonetheless found [...] "gorgeously recorded, tastefully arranged and beautifully played".|$|E
2500|$|The Jin navy on {{the river}} was checked by a new {{invention}} of the Chinese, the tiger ship, which could spill fire from its front using flamethrowing technology imported from the Middle East by way of Arab mariners.

The tiger ships quickly pierced the Jin ships, and the Jin navy was close to being routed by their enemies. The Jurchens were trapped for forty days wherein almost half their force was routed; and, the Jin prince who commanded the Jurchen army even sent messengers to the Chinese commander and offered bribes to beg for mercy. Han ignored the request. Eventually the Jurchens escaped {{through a hole in}} Han's encirclement {{due to the lack of}} soldiers—the weakness was revealed by a Song traitor.

2500|$|Up to 25% of {{patients}} with TB of the lymph nodes (TB lymphadenitis) will get worse on treatment <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> better and this usually happens {{in the first few}} months of treatment. A few weeks after starting treatment, lymph nodes often start to enlarge, and previously solid lymph nodes may soften and develop into tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis. [...] This should not be interpreted as failure of therapy and is a common reason for patients (and their physicians) to panic unnecessarily. [...] With patience, two to three months into treatment the lymph nodes start to shrink again and re-aspiration or re-biopsy of the lymph nodes is unnecessary: if repeat microbiological studies are ordered, they will show the continued presence of viable bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which further adds to the confusion: physicians inexperienced in the treatment of TB will then often add second-line drugs in the belief that the treatment is not working. [...] In these situations, all that is required is re-assurance. [...] Steroids may be useful in resolving the swelling, especially if it is painful, but they are unnecessary. [...] Additional antibiotics are unnecessary and the treatment regimen does not need to be lengthened.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 September 2012, Netanyahu gave {{a speech}} to the UN General Assembly in which he set forward a [...] "red line" [...] of 250kg of 20% enriched Uranium, because this amount would be enough Uranium to fuel the first nuclear bomb if it were further enriched to weapons grade fuel levels. Netanyahu claimed that if Iran would {{stockpile}} such an amount of 20% enriched Uranium, that this would constitute 90% of the required progress toward building the first nuclear bomb, which according to Netanyahu would constitute an intolerable risk for Israel. Netanyahu used a cartoon graphic of a bomb to illustrate his point, indicating three stages of uranium enrichment, noting that Iran had already completed the first stage, and stating that [...] "By next spring, at most by next summer at current enrichment rates, [...] will have finished the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. From there, it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> enough enriched uranium for the first bomb." [...] Netanyahu delivered his speech the day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, a presentation that the American, Canadian, and Israeli delegations had deliberately not attended. Iran has since stayed below this threshold by converting and using up parts of its stockpile of 20% enriched Uranium.|$|E
