It utilizes a random coeffcients model and analyses a cross-sectional sample of bilateral trade data for 96 countries in 2005. We expect the elasticity of trade to vary particularly with bilateral distance and <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> due to measurement error about these factors. Indeed, the variability of coefficients is significant for these trade cost measures. The {{results indicate that the}} elasticity of trade with respect to tariffs in different countries varies relatively more than that with respect to distance. This is consistent with there being a host of sources of measurement error about <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> (due to strategic or non-strategic misreporting; the potential inappropriateness of the weighting of disaggregated tariffs; etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role that quality of {{infrastructure}} has on a country's trade performance, estimating a gravity model that incorporates <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> {{and a number of}} indicators for the quality of infrastructure. The paper looks at the impact of the quality of infrastructure (road, airport, port and telecommunication, and the time required for customs clearance) on total bilateral trade and on trade in the automotive, clothing and textile sectors. In order to obtain unbiased estimators, multilateral resistances for tariffs and remoteness are introduced in the gravity equation. Moreover, the robustness of the results is tested by estimating a fixed-effect model, where bilateral indexes of the quality of infrastructure are included. The results can be summarised in four main findings: (i) <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs,</b> generally neglected in gravity regression of bilateral flows, have a significant negative impact on trade; (ii) quality of infrastructure is an important determinant of trade performance; (iii) port efficiency appears to have the largest impact on trade among all indicators of infrastructure; (iv) timeliness and access to telecommunication are relatively more important for export competitiveness in the clothing and automotive sector respectively...|$|E

Our findings are as follow. Firstly, the omission of <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> rates seems {{not to be so}} serious in terms of omitted-variable biases because the coefficients for the usual gravity variables do not change before or after their inclusion. Secondly, while the widely-used dummy variable of regional trade agreement could not play an alternative role in place of tariff rates, the inclusion of time-invariant pair fixed effects in addition to the time-variant importer fixed effects and exporter fixed effects accounts for the omission of tariff rates. The inclusion of those fixed effects makes the coefficient for <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> rates insignificant.

Looking {{at the impact}} of the 'non-price' and 'price' factors on international trade, this paper finds that country's tariff, infrastructure quality and transport costs are the main three determinants for cross-country variations of trade flows. The major findings of the paper can be summarised as follows: (i) bilateral infrastructure quality is a principal determinant of trade performance, (ii) <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs,</b> which are largely ignored in the empirical gravity literature in context of Asia, has an impact on trade, (iii) the bilateral transport costs strongly influence the trade flows, and (iv) except transport equipment, trade in all other manufacturing sectors, considered in this study, are influenced by tariffs, transport costs and infrastructure quality. ...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade in}} apparel and {{textiles}} is regulated {{by a system}} of <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> and quotas known as the Multifiber Arrangement or MFA. Using a time series of detailed product-level data from the United States on the quotas and tariffs that comprise the MFA, we analyze how the MFA affects the sources and prices of US apparel imports, with a particular focus on the effects on East Asian exporters during the 1990 s. We show that while a large fraction of US apparel is imported under binding quotas, there are many quotas that remain unfilled. We also show that binding quotas substantially raise import prices, suggesting both quality upgrading and rent capture by exporters. In contrast, tariffs reduce import prices. Lastly, we argue that the substantial shift of US apparel imports away from Asia in favor of Mexico and the Caribbean during the 1990 s is only partly due to discriminatory trade policy: the other reason is an increasing demand for timely delivery that gives a competitive advantage to nearby exporters. ...|$|E

40|$|Trade between {{developing}} countries, or South-South trade, {{has been}} growing rapidly in recent years following significant reductions in tariffs. However, significant barriers remain, and there is currently reluctance among many developing countries to undertake further reductions. In addition African countries and in particular least developed African countries are still marginal players in this reframing of geography of trade. The erosion of preferential access to Northern markets remains their major concern and {{the status quo in}} multilateral liberalization could be seen as a desirable scenario. This emphasis on developed countries markets, principally Europe and the US, is likely to represent a missed opportunity for African countries. Unless those countries are granted broader preferences by the European Union and other developed countries, especially in agriculture, significant gains would be obtained from trade preferences provided by other developing countries.

Including input-output linkages implies that domestic production of intermediates can serve as inputs in foreign products and subsequently be exported “indirectly” to a final destination. Our input-output model {{can be taken to}} the sectoral World Input Output Database (WIOD) and can be used to evaluate trade policy shocks.

40|$|Trade between {{developing}} countries, or South-South trade, {{has been}} growing rapidly in recent years following reductions in tariff barriers. However, significant barriers remain, and there is currently reluctance {{in many developing countries}} to undertake further reductions, with a preference instead for focusing on opening up access to developed country markets, or maintaining the status quo given that multilateral liberalisation may result in the erosion of preferential access enjoyed by some developing countries. This emphasis on Northern markets represents a missed opportunity for developing countries. To assess this we compare the potential effects of the removal of barriers on South-South trade with the gains from developed country liberalisation and from regional free trade areas within Africa, Asia and Latin America. A general equilibrium model, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model, containing information on preferential <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs,</b> is used to estimate the impacts. The results indicate that the opening up of Northern markets would provide annual welfare gains to developing countries of $ 22 billion.

40|$|This paper employs an {{endogenous}} merger formation {{approach in}} a two-country oligopoly model of trade {{to examine the}} international linkages between the nature of mergers and tariff levels. Firms sell differentiated products and compete in a Bertrand fashion in product markets. We find two effects playing key roles in determining equilibrium market structure: the tariff saving effect and the protection gain effect. The balance between these two effects implies that, when foreign country practices free trade, unilateral tariff reduction by a domestic country yields international mergers irrespective of the substitutability levels. By contrast, when foreign tariffs are sufficiently high and products are close substitutes, national mergers obtain in the equilibrium. Therefore, the implications of unilateral trade liberalization on the equilibrium market structure depends on the trade regime in foreign country especially when products are close substitutes. Unlike this asymmetric result of unilateral trade liberalization, we find that when <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> are sufficiently low, international mergers arise. These results fit well {{with the fact that}} global trade liberalization has been accompanied by an increase in international merger activities. Finally, from a welfare perspective, we show that international mergers are preferable to national mergers and thus social and private merger incentives become aligned together as trade gets bilaterally liberalized. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since the 1950 s, {{global trade}} in {{textiles}} and clothing has seen {{the evolution of a}} global system of bilateral quotas governing North-South trade in textiles and wearing apparel. As of 2005, these have been removed {{under the terms of the}} 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. In theory, the ATC was to have led to a smooth and progressive liberalization in the sector. In reality and especially when looking at trade flows from China, it appears that political leaders throughout the ATC period instead backloaded the problem of adjustment, delaying much of it until the very end of the ATC. In this paper, we explore econometrically the evolution of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sectors (T&C). Working with a panel of bilateral trade data on textile and clothing trade, underlying <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and the coverage of quotas under the WTOs Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) we first develop an estimation framework for calculating the tax equivalents of ATC quota restrictions on bilateral trade. Within this framework, we track the price impact of the quotas through the ten year phase-out period. We also discuss a major concern of LDC exporters the impact of quota elimination on market access. Finally, as these quotas are a potentially significant omitted variable, the ATC episode provides us with an opportunity to examine the impact of bilateral quotas on the econometric estimation of trade elasticities...|$|E

The eleven-year-old trade boycott of Rhodesia, initiated by the British and sanctioned by the United Nations, provides an ob-servation of such a response. 1 The observation is of interest since Rhodesia, a relatively small country, depends on exports of agricultural and mineral re-sources for a substantial fraction of her economic activity. Furthermore, the response has involved rather stringent foreign exchange controls {{and the maintenance of}} an overvalued exchange rate. The importance of the exchange rate as an economic policy variable has been forcefully expounded by Schuh. Many African countries maintain overval-ued currencies (Haessel and Vickery).

Elasticity techniques have been increasingly used in recent years to analyze balance of payments, exchange rate, and welfare effects of international trade distortions (Floyd, Basevi, Walker, Johnson).

For a country that can influence its terms of trade, {{there are two ways}} of approaching this question. This paper shows that under certain assumptions, the extra burden from a marginal change in the homecountry tariff is shared equally between the home and foreign country at a tariff rate equal to twice the optimal tariff for the home country. Also, the cumulative welfare effect of a tariff in the home country, relative to free trade, turns out to be equalized across countries when the home tariff equals four times its optimal tariff.

We consider the effects of openness on poverty in two components: the effect of openness on average income growth, and the effect on distribution for a given growth rate. Evidence {{from a variety of}} sources (cross-country and panel growth regressions, industry and firm-level research, and case studies) supports the view that trade openness contributes greatly to growth. Moreover, trade openness does not have systematic effects on the poor beyond its effect on overall growth. Trade policy is only one of many determinants of growth and poverty reduction. Trade openness has important positive spillovers on other aspects of reform, however, so that the correlation of trade with other pro-reform policies speaks to the advantages of making openness a primary part of the reform package.

We first present a statistical summary {{of the status of}} global trade protection. Then, based on a monopolistic competition trade model and 1994 cross-country data on trade barriers, trade flows, and production, we estimate the import-reducing effect of trade barriers including both tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). We use the disaggregated cross-country, cross-industry data on manufactured goods and, unlike previous studies, our sample covers a broad range of countries-more than 70 in total-including countries from the most developed ones like those in the Group of Seven to the least developed one, Bangladesh. We specify an empirical model that captures the stylized facts well and helps generate sensible estimates. Our econometric framework is designed to control for the simultaneous determination of trade flows, trade barriers, and production.

40|$|South-Eastern European (SEE) {{countries}} have recently {{engaged in a}} regional integration process, through the establishment of free trade agreements between themselves and with the European Union (EU). This study evaluates {{the impact of this}} process on trade and firm performance. Three complementary approaches are used. The first consists in evaluating the degree of trade integration of SEE countries and determining their trade potential with their main partners, i. e. themselves and the EU. The second approach tries to evaluate the evolution of tariffs and nontariffs barriers, faced by SEE countries and estimate their effects on manufactured trade. The third part investigates the impact of trade liberalization on performance of firms in SEE. In particular, we are interested in what extent foreign trade and foreign direct investment contributed to improvements in firm performance. Several interesting results emerge from this study. Concerning our first approach, we find three results. First,Western Balkan {{countries have}} reached their trade potential for almost all sectors while Eastern Balkan countries have outreached them. One can therefore expect an increase of trade flows between the Western Balkans and the EU. Second, it seems that preferential trade agreements between SEE countries will have a limited impact on their mutual trade since their trade potentials are already reached. Third, all SEE countries' trade is below its potential {{with the rest of the}} world. Concerning our second approach, we find that exports are increasing in all sectors during the period 1996 - 2000, while <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> are decreasing. However, this liberalization process exhibits small effects on trade. On the other hand, we find that nontariff barriers are increasing during the period. Trade liberalization should not be treated as exogenous (Trefler, 1993). Domestic firms, competiting with Balkan exporters, may have increased their lobbying activity for greater protection. As a result, NTBs increase and hurt exports of Balkan countries. In that respect, we find large estimates of NTBs on exports of manufactured goods. Concerning our third approach, we do not find a general pattern of uniformly significant impact of extensive trade flows on individual firm's TFP growth. Specifically, only in Romania and Slovenia, higher propensity to export to advanced markets (EU- 15, rest of OECD countries) has a larger impact on TFP growth than exporting to less advanced markets such as new EU members and countries of former Yugoslavia. The role of imports follows a similar path as exporting. Importing from the advanced countries is important for firms in Romania. At the same time, for firms in Romania and Macedonia importing from countries of former Yugoslavia provides a dominating learning effect. For other countries in our sample no learning effects from exporting to and importing from individual geographic regions could be found. Thus, one cannot imply that liberalization of bilateral trade within the region of SEE or with the other regions will have uniformly significant impact on individual firm's performance, but in some of the countries analysed trade liberalization might be an important engine of firms' productivity growth. Our results also indicate some selection process in FDI decisions by parent foreign companies. Foreign parent companies seem to select smaller firms in SEE as well as least productive, less capital and skill intensive firms. However, we find contrasting results on the impact on foreign ownership on TFP growth. Three countries (Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia) experience faster TFP growth in foreign owned firms. In Romania, in contrast we find faster TFP growth in domestic owned firms, while in Bulgaria no significant differences have been found. However, one can expect that after restructuring these firms would improve their TFP at a much faster rate than purely domestic owned firms. trade potential, trade liberalization, gravity equation, preferential trade agreements, South-Eastern Europe...|$|E

40|$|Bangladesh {{has entered}} into several {{regional}} FTA agreements {{and is in}} the process of signing bilateral FTA agreements with a number of countries. The study uses several models such as WITS/SMART global partial equilibrium model, SAM multiplier model, CGE model and an employment satellite matrix to explore the employment effects in Bangladesh out of three different FTA scenarios. In the WITS/SMART model, three FTA scenarios are run which assume full elimination of <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> between Bangladesh and India (under Bangladesh-India bilateral FTA), full elimination of <b>bilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> between Bangladesh and Malaysia (under Bangladesh-Malaysia bilateral FTA) and full elimination of tariff on trade among the BIMSTEC member countries (under BIMSTEC). The analysis of the macro impacts of the FTA scenarios suggest that such bilateral and regional FTAs would be beneficial for Bangladesh in terms of impact on consumer prices, exports, real wages and employment. At the sectoral level, a number of export oriented sectors would gain from such FTAs. However, the sectoral level impacts also suggest that a large number of sectors would experience fall in production because of large inflow of imports, which will result in loss in employment in these sectors. Therefore, these FTAs have important sectoral implications in terms of production, exports, import and employment. It however appears that at the aggregate level employment would rise which would mean that the loss in employment in some sectors will be more than compensated by rise in employment in other sectors. Therefore, the net effect on employment is likely to be positive. ...|$|R

We find that FTAs under GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause contribute to reducing tariff rates by 2. 1 % points and 1. 5 % points, respectively. In the case of NTBs, their respective impacts are 6. 6 % points and 5. 7 % points. Membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) does not contribute greatly to reducing tariff rates but does {{play a significant role}} in reducing NTBs.
