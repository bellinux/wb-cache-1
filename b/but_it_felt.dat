My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown."

500|$|According to Souders, Jonathan Kent's {{death had}} been {{requested}} by executive producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar at the [...] "beginning of the season", {{and that the}} idea was specifically planned to be featured in the show's 100th episode.

[...] Schneider was happy with how the show wrote Jonathan Kent's death, arguing that his character exited the show [...] "like a hero". Furthermore, he drew comparisons to the death of John Wayne's character Wil Anderson in The Cowboys (1972), arguing that both were examples of [...] "empowering death." [...] Originally, a scene had been shot featuring Clark bringing his father's dead body to the Fortress of Solitude. However, the scene was ultimately cut because, according to Gough, [...] "It was something that sounded great on paper, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like a bit of a stutter step in the episode."

500|$|Box Car Racer, {{intended}} as a one-time experimental project, became a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit and Hazen Street guitarist David Kennedy on guitar.

[...] "At the end of 2001, it felt like Blink-182 had broken up. It wasn’t spoken about, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> over", said Hoppus later. Barker, meanwhile, joined rap rock group Transplants in 2002 and was featured on their first album, Transplants. In addition, Blink-182 co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day, alongside opening acts Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, and Kut U Up in 2002. It was an [...] "uncomfortable" [...] time in the band according to Hoppus, but they had [...] "hundreds of discussions about it" [...] and seemingly moved on. Barker felt {{the dynamics of the}} band changed with Hoppus and DeLonge's marriages: [...] "Blink-182 were no longer just three inseparable guys who were touring together."

Maybe I should have done it already in the past in GP2, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E

500|$|Mercedes {{featured}} {{in three of}} the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, [...] "She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world." [...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> a little lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You just believe so much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E

2500|$|By 1982, South African guitarist, singer-songwriter and {{producer}} Trevor Rabin {{had moved to}} Los Angeles and sent a tape with several demos to record labels {{with the intent of}} releasing a fourth solo album. During this time, Atlantic Records manager Phil Carson, a long time fan and associate of Yes, sought for new musicians to work with Squire and White, was introduced to Rabin by producer Mutt Lange, with whom Rabin used to work as a session musician. Carson invited Rabin to meet and play with Squire and White in London; Rabin recalled the first sessions [...] "didn't sound great <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> good ... {{there was a lot of}} potential", causing him to turn down an offer from RCA Records as he wished to work with a [...] "great rhythm section". The three began to develop songs for an album using most of Rabin's demos. His songs, including [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", [...] "Hold On", and [...] "Changes", were more commercial and pop-oriented and less complex in structure. With such a direction, Squire recruited original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye who left in 1971, feeling Kaye's simpler style of playing was more suitable to their new music. Horn followed suit as a potential lead singer, but after unsuccessful rehearsals, opted to become their producer.|$|E
