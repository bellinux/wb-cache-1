I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E

500|$|Casablanca {{was part}} of the film {{colorization}} controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television network WTBS. In 1984, MGM/UA hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, [...] " [...] {{is one of a handful}} of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to.</b> All I'm trying to do is protect my investment." ...|$|E

Interviewed in 2013, Raven said that she and Larsen had always agreed they would keep performing together {{as long as they were}} having a good time, and they ended because it was not fun anymore, also saying that while they had been inseparable as children, as 18-year-olds they had become quite different.

500|$|After {{appearing}} in the 1986 films Jumpin' Jack Flash and ¡Three Amigos!, Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL) and joined the cast and writing staff.

[...] In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know how it feels to be an ornament.

Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E

This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked like crazy these past twelve months.

500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion {{to such a degree that}} the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" [...] (1.78m), 180-pound (82kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered.

500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} Burt's face superimposed {{onto the}} cityscape, {{was created by}} special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a pull-back shot of the carnival that was filmed 110 {{feet in the air}} via crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds' head. The two shots were sewn together, and a blur effect was added to [...] " [...] it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds'. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set. The score for the episode, {{like the rest of the}} series, was composed by Mark Snow. Snow based much of the music in the episode on records made by Karl Zéro, on the request of Carter.

500|$|Explaining that {{he wrote}} it as per his whim, and not {{according}} {{to the need to}} have more philosophy or love or war, Tripathi was sure that The Oath of the Vayuputras would have a tragic ending. During an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Tripathi explained that he had purposefully used the modern terms for the different historical locations described in the book, including calling India by its name, rather than its ancient name, Jambudweep. He did not believe that India could be represented as a political concept in his book, since at the timeline followed in the Shiva trilogy, India was still a cultural concept. Since some of the characters have their mythological names, but do not follow the characteristic traits, Tripathi believed that such development was spontaneous and did not question his writing further. Giving an example, the author said: [...] "When I was writing the first book, I was struggling with the Naga, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> desperately change his character – that he should be jovial and happy. But he kept ending up as a tormented and troubled a guy who was suffering. And I just had to surrender" ...|$|E

500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

500|$|In 1989, 15-year-old Cruz {{made her}} acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano's song [...] "La Fuerza del Destino". Between 1990 and 1997, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco's talk show La Quinta Marcha, a {{programme}} that was hosted by teenagers, {{aimed at a}} teenage audience. She also played in the [...] "Elle et lui" [...] episode of an erotic French TV series called Série rose in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1992, Cruz made her feature film debut at 18 as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film, Jamón, jamón. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, {{a young woman who}} is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. People magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became [...] "a major sex symbol".

[...] But I have no regrets <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> start working and it changed my life." [...] Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes noted that Cruz [...] "became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent".

500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E
