5|$|Britain and France {{recognised}} the Nationalist {{government on}} 27 February 1939. Clement Attlee criticised {{the way it}} had <b>been</b> <b>agreed,</b> calling it 'a gross betrayal... {{two and a half years}} of hypocritical pretence of non-intervention'.|$|E
5|$|Details of Thatcher's funeral had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> {{with her}} in advance. She {{received}} a ceremonial funeral, including full military honours, with a church service at St Paul's Cathedral on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Although {{authorised}} in 1864, work on {{the bridge}} was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment, since the bridge's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north {{bank of the river}} had <b>been</b> <b>agreed.</b> While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Single undertaking: Every item of the {{negotiation}} {{is part of}} a whole and indivisible package and cannot <b>be</b> <b>agreed</b> separately. In other words, Nothing <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> until everything <b>is</b> <b>agreed.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kickback ace-asking {{convention}} {{deals with}} the problem by adjusting the asking bid according to which suit <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> as trump. The ask is always one step above four of the trump suit. So, if clubs <b>is</b> <b>agreed,</b> the ask <b>is</b> 4; if diamonds <b>is</b> <b>agreed,</b> 4 asks; if hearts, 4; and if spades, 4NT.|$|R
25|$|No new {{contract}} <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> with Celtic and eventually a £1 million transfer to Aston Villa <b>was</b> <b>agreed,</b> where Maloney would play under his old boss Martin O'Neill.|$|R
5|$|By then, {{violence}} {{had broken}} out between the two sides; {{less than three months}} after it had <b>been</b> <b>agreed,</b> John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts that had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> at {{the inception of}} the National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.|$|E
5|$|Early on 15 April, the {{northern}} column of the 14th Panzer Division closed on Doboj, and after overcoming resistance around that town, arrived in Sarajevo at 20:45. Before noon, Nedeljković received orders that a ceasefire had <b>been</b> <b>agreed,</b> {{and that all}} 4th Army troops were to remain in place and not fire on German personnel. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} {{regulations of}} the Council of the League <b>were</b> <b>agreed</b> in October 1951 {{as well as}} those of the committees. Those of the Secretary-General <b>were</b> <b>agreed</b> in May 1953.|$|R
50|$|As <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> {{upon by the}} {{participants}} in the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in 1960, a formal constitution <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>agreed</b> upon by the Congolese within three to four years of independence.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{evidence}} of a party as to what terms he understood to have <b>been</b> <b>agree</b> <b>is</b> some evidence tending to show that those terms, in an objective sense, <b>were</b> <b>agreed.</b> Of course the tribunal may reject such evidence and conclude that the party misunderstood the effect of {{what was being said}} and done. But when both parties <b>are</b> <b>agreed</b> about what they understood their mutual obligations (or lack of them) to be, it is a strong thing to exclude their evidence from consideration." ...|$|R
5|$|From summer 2005, {{the media}} had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation {{intensified}} as the season went on. In early June 2006, {{it was reported that}} a transfer to Olympique de Marseille had <b>been</b> <b>agreed.</b> The very same day Cissé broke his leg during France's final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Cissé's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{games have}} been {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} Scottish Gaelic language television channel BBC Alba since 2008, which is run jointly by former sponsor MG Alba and the BBC. Every final since the 2008 final has been broadcast live on the channel and the arrangement was extended for three more years in 2012 despite the end of MG Alba's sponsorship of the competition in 2011. With {{the expansion of the}} competition to include teams from Northern Ireland and Wales from 2016-17, additional contracts for live match coverage have <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> with Premier Sports and S4C.|$|E
5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. The fleet was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.|$|E
60|$|To this Haldor and Ulf {{said they}} <b>were</b> <b>agreed.</b> Hilda plucked Erling by the sleeve, and whispered in his ear, {{after which he}} said that he too <b>was</b> <b>agreed.</b> Glumm glanced at Ada, who, with a little blush and smile, nodded. A nod was as good as a word to Glumm, so he also said he <b>was</b> <b>agreed,</b> and as no one else made objection, the ships' prows were again turned towards the setting sun.|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> upon, and it <b>was</b> also <b>agreed</b> that Dave {{should give}} a whistle {{when he wanted}} an attack made.|$|R
50|$|S. 2590 {{introduced}} in the House on September 8, 2006. It <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> upon and passed by voice vote five days later and S.Con.Res. 114 <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> to and passed by both the House and the Senate on the same day.|$|R
5|$|After {{successful}} athletics {{events at}} the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had {{either of the two}} larger stadium proposals developed by Arup <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> for funding, then Manchester would have ended up with a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.|$|E

After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers, with Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania all annexing parts of its territory.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{avalanche}} at San Carlos Minas in January 1992, Hermética joined a charity music festival {{held at the}} Chateau Carreras stadium. Hermética played only a few songs at a concert with Riffthe headline band, which ended with minor riots. Hermética were the opening act for Black Sabbath at Obras Sanitarias; Black Sabbath's frontman Ronnie James Dio thanked the band for playing with them. The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to Daniel Grinbank, the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath. In October 1992, they were the supporting band for Motörhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, but once in the country the show's producers tried to pay less money than had <b>been</b> <b>agreed.</b> Unable to find an alternative location, the band refused to play and returned to Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the North/South Ministerial Council <b>is</b> to <b>agree</b> and {{implement}} policies common to or shared by both jurisdictions in at least 12 areas where Northern Ireland has competency. At least six of these must to be areas where policy <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> together but implemented separately through existing agencies in each jurisdiction. At least six further areas of co-operate must be areas <b>were</b> policy <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> together and implemented through all-island or cross-border agencies. For example, food safety is managed by the all-Ireland Food Safety Promotion Board whereas transport policies may <b>be</b> <b>agreed</b> together but <b>are</b> implemented separately in each jurisdiction.|$|R

5|$|He {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} League One club Crewe Alexandra in February 2008, having been unable to figure in Mixu Paatelainen's plans at Hibs, meaning he was frozen {{out of the first}} team. Donaldson {{finished}} 2007–08 with 21 appearances and 6 goals, his last goal of the season coming against Falkirk in December 2007. In the summer of 2008, he was told that he was available for transfer by Hibs. Crewe were believed to be lining up a bid for him in July 2008, who had money available after selling striker Nicky Maynard to Bristol City for £2.25million and held negotiations with Donaldson. The move stalled after a six-figure fee had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> but Donaldson later agreed personal terms.|$|E
5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident from a series of {{victories}} against the Arabs in the East that had led to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and even had the envoys beaten up. He followed this up with a show of military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E
5|$|In Saxony, a joint {{force of}} Austrians and Brunswickers {{under the command}} of General Kienmayer was far more successful, {{defeating}} a corps {{under the command of}} General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had <b>been</b> <b>agreed.</b> The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E
50|$|The {{contract}} for the prototype <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> on 12 May 1760, for a ship to be launched within twelve months, and her name was assigned as Mermaid on 28 October 1760.

5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, Petrović and {{the staff}} of 1st Army Group {{headquarters}} were captured by Ustaše at Petrinja, and the rear area staff of 4th Army headquarters were captured by Ustaše at Topusko. The personnel of both headquarters were soon {{handed over to the}} Germans by their captors. Nedeljković and his operations staff escaped to fight on for a few days, but the 27th Infantry Division Savska had ceased to exist. On 15 April, Nedeljković received orders that a ceasefire had <b>been</b> <b>agreed,</b> and that all 4th Army troops were to remain in place and not fire on German personnel. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
