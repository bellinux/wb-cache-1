5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> In pressurized water reactors, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling.

5|$|Increasing {{demand for}} <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> has led {{a number of}} {{producers}} to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned Eti Mine Works opened a new <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers {{have been unable to}} meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (borax) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.|$|E

In this study the in vitro human toxicity of a set of TiO 2 NPs modified with acetic, oleic and <b>boric</b> <b>acids</b> were studied in order to assess the hazard in view of a future scale-up of the synthesis. The surface reactivity of the powders under simulated solar illumination and in the dark has been evaluated by means of EPR spectroscopy. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS- 2 B) have been chosen as a model for lung epithelium. Cytotoxicity has been assessed by measuring the cells membrane integrity by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and the inflammatory response evaluated as nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production, and oxidative stress measured as intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, and induced lipoperoxidation.

40|$|Fluoride {{is widely}} added to {{drinking}} water systems to prevent tooth decay. Some toothpaste also contains fluoride {{for the same}} purpose. According to WHO as well as Indian standards the optimum fluoride levels of around 1 ppm is safe. Consumption of fluoridated water between levels of 0. 7 to 1. 2 ppm has beneficial effects on the tooth, in that it causes less dental caries. But level above 1. 5 ppm causes dental fluorosis and it has hazardous effects on nervous, muscular, gastric, urinary and hormonal systems. On the other hand hydrogen fluoride and fluorine are very often used in various industrial processes. Both these gases are also very toxic. So, {{there is a great}} demand for on-line sensors for these gases. Fluoride along with their other halogen family members is usually detected by the colour change of the solution on addition of specific reagents [1]. But for on-line quantitative detection of these ions an ion selective electrode (ISE) is a more convenient device. Fluoride ISE sensors measure pF in solution the same way that a pH sensor measures hydrogen ions. Various techniques have been tested using lanthanum fluoride crystal for fluoride sensors, such as capacitance-voltage measurement at electrolyte/ionic conductor/semiconductor structure [2], potentiometric [3] and field effect sensor [4]. Apart from lanthanum fluoride some organic and organometallic receptor based systems have also been used for the detection of fluoride.

40|$|Boron carbide {{is widely}} used as neutron {{absorbing}} control rod material in Western Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) and Russian RBMKs and VVERs and some Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR). During a hypothetical severe accident the B_ 4 C reacts with the surrounding stainless steel cladding forming eutectic melts at temperatures above 1200 C which is far below the melting temperatures of all components. The remaining uncovered absorber material {{as well as the}} B_ 4 C/metal mixtures may be exposed to the steam in the reactor core. The oxidation of boron carbide is highly exothermic and produces various gaseous reaction products like H_ 2, CO, CO_ 2 and CH_ 4 which may affect the fission product chemistry. Extensive test series were performed to study the oxidation behaviour of boron carbide at high temperatures. Four types of B_ 4 C specimens with quite different properties were investigated under various atmospheres in the temperature range between 800 and 1600 C. In contrast to most of the data published so far mainly at lower temperatures which are based on the evaluation of mass changes, gas production data were used to determine the oxidation kinetics of B_ 4 C in steam. The oxidation kinetics of boron carbide are determined by the formation of a liquid boron oxide barrier diffusion layer and its loss due to the reaction with surplus steam to form volatile <b>boric</b> <b>acids</b> and/or direct evaporation at temperatures above 1500 C. The overall reaction kinetics are paralinear. Under the conditions typical for severe accidents (high temperatures and steam flow rates) linear oxidation kinetics establishes soon after initiation of the oxidation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a chemical equilibrium model {{which can be}} used to characterize the carbonate system in natural waters from 0 to 50 °C and high ionic strengths (6 mol L- 1). The model considers the ionic interactions in solutions of the major sea salts (H—Na—K—Mg- -Ca-Sr-Cl-Br- 0 H-HC 03 -B(0 H) 4 -HS 04 -S 04 -C 03 -C 02 -B(0 H) 3 - -H 2 O). The estimated activity coefficients and infinite dilution constants have been used to determine the dissociation constants of all the adds (H 2 C 03, B(OH) 3, HgO, HF, HSO 4, H 3 P 04, H 2 S, NH| etc.) needed to examine the carbon dioxide system in natural waters. The model is largely based on measurements of dissociation constants in NaCl solutions with small amounts of Mg 2 +. The model predicts the activity coeffidents of HC 1 in seawater that agree with the measured values to 0. 002 from S = 5 to 45 and t = 0 to 50 °C. The model has also been used to examine the dissociation constants of acids in seawater to test its reliability. The calculated values of the dissociation constants for the ionization of carbonic and <b>boric</b> <b>acids</b> were found to be in good agreement (± 0. 02 to + 0. 03 in pJD with the experimental measurements in NaCl and seawater solutions from 5 to 45 °C and S = 10 to 45. The model predicts the dissociation constants of the minor acids with sufficient accuracy (± 0. 03 to ± 0. 06) to characterize the carbonate system in brines over a wide range of temperatures (0 to 50 °C) and ionic strength (0 to 6 mol L- 1). These constants can be used to characterize the carbonate systems in natural brines using measurements of two carbonate parameters (pH-TA, pH, 7 X 302 etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in {{thin films}} are usually evaluated either by measurement of elastic strains {{in the film}} or from the curvature or deflection of a film coated substrate material (the Stoney technique). Both methods are prone to serious measurement errors particularly for thinner films or smaller curvatures or deflections. The Stoney technique is popular because the analysis {{does not require the}} elastic modulus of the film. However, residual stress can be determined more accurately using the film modulus. A simple strain-energy analysis using this modulus has been developed to investigate residual stresses in <b>boric</b> acid-sulphuric <b>acid</b> (BSA) anodised films, based on bending measurements of thin coupons. The method is an improvement over Stoney's equation because the square root of the thickness of the film, rather than the thickness itself, is involved, therefore reducing one of the larger sources of error. The modulus of the film was determined from nanoindentation measurements. The strain-energy method allows analysis of residual stress development in the coupons as functions of film thickness and time. The results show that the residual stress in BSA anodised films formed on high strength Al-Cu alloy is highly tensile with stress levels up to 400 MPa. The effects of coupon geometry on stress development were also studied and were found to influence the final levels of residual stress developed.
