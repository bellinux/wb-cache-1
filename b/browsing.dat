5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally <b>browsing</b> as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed <b>browsing</b> on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low <b>browsing</b> or ground feeding.|$|E

40|$|Several {{protein sources}} were tested as deer repellents with captive deer. Black-tailed deer were offered Western redcedar {{seedlings}} treated with corn gluten meal, feather meal, poultry blood, hydrolyzed casein, or a control (latex sticker used for treatment proteins). After 37 days, feather meal and hydrolyzed casein provided equivalent protection against <b>browse</b> damage (only 23 % of seedlings significantly <b>browsed).</b> Poultry blood provided less <b>browse</b> protection (44 % <b>browsed),</b> while <b>browse</b> damage to seedlings treated with corn gluten meal (73 % <b>browsed)</b> {{was not statistically}} different than the control (100 % <b>browsed).</b> Based on the efficacy of feather meal and its low material cost, this protein hydrolysate should be investigated for use in commercial deer repellent formulations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 <b>Browse</b> {{production}} and use by moose (Alces alces gigas) in interior Alaska {{was investigated in}} 4 and 2 -year-old quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) coppice stands following clear-felling without removal of the mature aspen stems. Moose winter <b>browse</b> utilization, as related to distance from cover, coarse woody debris (CWD), and <b>browse</b> species composition, was quantified. Aspen terminal leaders were sampled to relate current annual growth (CAG) dry biomass (g) to leader diameter (mm). Stem density, current annual <b>browse</b> production, and <b>browse</b> use were estimated. <b>Browse</b> use was determined as 1) proportion of aspen stems <b>browsed</b> (stand scale), 2) proportion of <b>browsed</b> leaders per stem (stem scale), and 3) diameter-at-point-of-browsing (leader scale). Aspen sucker density ranged from 23, 000 - 43, 000 stems/ha. Terminal leader diameter {{was found to be}} a good estimator of individual stem CAG biomass. CWD did not impede moose utilization of stems. <b>Browse</b> use declined from mature stand edge to center (100 m). Beyond 15 m from mature stand edge <b>browse</b> use was low compared to that within 15 m of the stand edge. Clear-felling without removal of stems is a viable silvicultural method to reinitiate seral aspen in lieu of prescribed fire or mechanical treatments on south-facing hillsides...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from <b>browsing</b> on soft, tropical plants to adapt to <b>browsing</b> of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the Upper-East region of Ghana. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the sources, harvesting and marketing of <b>browse</b> plants, and challenges associated with their harvesting and marketing. Four districts were randomly selected in the region. Three categories of semi-structured questionnaires were separately administered to respondents in sixteen Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) administrative zones (communities) and in four livestock and <b>browse</b> marketing centers in the study area. In all, a total of 200 respondents comprising of 80 small-holder livestock owners, 60 harvesters and 60 marketers of <b>browse</b> plants were interviewed. Six (6) <b>browse</b> species were identified as the common ones utilized by livestock farmers in the area. Gliricidia sepium was identified as the most common and preferred species. Community range lands are the major sources of these <b>browse</b> plants for harvesters and users. Both young and the elderly people of the opposite sex are involved in the harvesting and marketing of <b>browse</b> plants in the area. However, the female population forms the greater proportion (55 %) in the harvesting and marketing of <b>browse</b> plants. Indigenous tools such as cutlasses, knifes, axes and sickles are used in the harvesting of <b>browse</b> plants in the area. Harvested plants are preserved by sun-drying, hay and silage preparation.

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf <b>browsing</b> was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

The crude protein (CP) content of <b>browse</b> was considerably higher in RS (P 3 Ìc 0. 001). P. dulce had the lowest neutral detergent fiber (NDFom) and acid detergent fiber (ADFom) in the two seasons; L. acapulcencis had the highest values and Q. laeta values were intermediate, with an overall increase in fiber fractions in DS <b>browse</b> foliage (P 3 Ìc 0. 001). The lowest in situ degradability values were in L. acapulcencis and Q. laeta had intermediate values during both seasons. Season of harvest (RS or DS), and ruminal inoculum (cows, UG, and AG) affected (P 3 Ìc 0. 001) dry matter degradability (DMD), crude protein degradability (CPD) and fiber fractions of <b>browse.</b> Nutrient degradabilities in all species were higher (P 3 Ìc 0. 001) in DS than RS.
