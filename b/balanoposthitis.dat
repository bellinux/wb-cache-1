5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis).

If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of <b>balanoposthitis</b> or forced retraction of the foreskin.

5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans.

For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons.

50|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BoHV-1) is a virus of {{the family}} Herpesviridae and the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, known to cause several diseases worldwide in cattle, including rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, <b>balanoposthitis,</b> abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis. BoHV-1 is also a contributing factor in shipping fever, also known as bovine respiratory disease (BRD). It is spread horizontally through sexual contact, artificial insemination, and aerosol transmission and {{it may also be}} transmitted vertically across the placenta. BoHV-1 can cause both clinical and subclinical infections, depending on the virulence of the strain. Although these symptoms are mainly non-life-threatening it is an economically important disease as infection may cause a drop in production and affect trade restrictions. Like other herpesviruses, BoHV-1 causes a lifelong latent infection and sporadic shedding of the virus. The sciatic nerve and trigeminal nerve are the sites of latency. A reactivated latent carrier is normally the source of infection in a herd. The clinical signs displayed are dependent on the virulence of the strain. There is a vaccine available which reduces the severity and incidence of disease. Some countries in Europe have successfully eradicated the disease by applying a strict culling policy.|$|E

We investigated differences in the preputial bacterial flora between patients with <b>balanoposthitis</b> and physiological phimosis. Materials and MethodsFifty-six male children were included in the study. Fifteen patients presented to the emergency room or outpatient department with <b>balanoposthitis.</b> Forty-one patients with physiological phimosis received a circumcision. Preputial swab cultures were done. Differences in age, body weight, and preputial flora between these two groups of patients were compared. ResultsPatients with <b>balanoposthitis</b> in this study were significantly younger. Common uropathogens were predominant in patients with <b>balanoposthitis,</b> whereas in patients with physiological phimosis, the main isolates were enteric flora other than common uropathogens. Patients with a body weight higher than the 50 th percentile of the normal growth curve had a lower risk of <b>balanoposthitis</b> (odds ratio =  0. 212). ConclusionsThe preputial bacterial flora in patients with physiological phimosis may change from enteric flora to common uropathogens which are predominant in patients with <b>balanoposthitis.</b> Furthermore, patients at a younger age and with a lighter body weight also had increased susceptibility to <b>balanoposthitis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Balanoposthitis</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting 11 % of male genitourinary clinic attendees {{and it can be}} a recurrent or persistent condition. Various predisposing factors like diabetes mellitus, sexual intercourse and usage of oral antibiotics can cause chronic <b>balanoposthitis.</b> The Objective {{of the study was to}} isolation and speciation of candida and their antifungal susceptibility patterns from the cases of chronic <b>balanoposthitis.</b> Methods: The study group comprised of swabs collected from 62 male patients with chronic <b>balanoposthitis</b> attending sexually transmitted diseases (STD) outpatient department (OPD), King George Hospital (KGH), Visakhapatnam. Standard mycological tests for the candida isolation, speciation and antifungal susceptibility were done. Results: Out of 62 samples, (85 %) were culture positive for candida. The most common species isolated was C. parapsilosis (37. 7 %), followed by C. glabrata (28. 3 %), C. albicans (15. 09 %), C. dubliniensis (9. 4 %), C. krusei (7. 5 %) and C. tropicalis (1. 88 %). Most of the candida species showed sensitivity to amphotericin B, Nystatin, clotrimazole and ketoconazole. A relative resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was observed. Conclusions: Chronic <b>balanoposthitis</b> is the most common infection in men attending STD, OPD. In the present study, diabetes is main predisposing factor than sexual intercourse and candida non albicans predominated over C. albicans. Resistance of candida species to azoles is on rise.
