Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>this</b> value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E

Goldberg called it [...] "fantastic", and Kubicek said [...] "it's hard not to love his singing".

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} Enamorada de Ti gave {{a good idea}} of how Selena might have sounded in 2012. Erlewine commented that [...] "Amor Prohibido", as updated for the album, [...] "ha much of its overly stiff drum {{machines}} stripped away, replaced with warmer studio musicians". Far from making Selena sound contemporary, he thought that all the remixed songs [...] "are rooted in the '90s and sound that way", even if [...] "fresher" [...] than many other posthumous Selena releases. Guerra wrote that Enamorada de Ti included [...] "reworked gems", but he believed that it felt rushed and dated. Unlike the remixes, he found the originals [...] "still fresh almost two decades later". He disapproved of the acoustic and the slowing down of the music's arrangements. Guerra concluded that Selena's legacy [...] "deserves <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>this</b> half-hearted attempt", and that better duet partners and producers (he named René Pérez Joglar from Calle 13, RedOne, Ximena Sariñana, and Cachorro López) could have made Enamorada de Ti [...] "a fascinating tribute to Selena".|$|E

It also became the most successful Finnish film to date. His next release, the independent film Rememory (2017), failed to impress reviewers, but his role of Sam Bloom was praised. Freelance film critic Yasmin Kleinbart stated that [...] "Dinklage deserves <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>this</b> film" [...] and John DeFore in The Hollywood Reporter said that he [...] "delivers a soulful lead performance that will attract fans' attention".

His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E

[...] Peary also wrote that the [...] "film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed... It {{would be one of the}} best Bond films if the finale weren't disappointing.
