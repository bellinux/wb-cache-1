5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door transom and concrete stoop. The original front <b>balustrade</b> has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron <b>balustrade</b> is still original.|$|E

5|$|On {{the inside}} of the tower there are 96 steps leading to the gallery in 4 stages, the first 3 of the same grade and the last stage a bit steeper and narrower. The {{staircase}} is made of concrete with slate treads and cast iron and brass <b>balustrade.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{decorative}} iron <b>balustrades</b> with timber railing on the north-west verandah, {{with a mix}} {{of timber}} latticework and timber-slat blinds above, while the north-east verandah has the same <b>balustrading</b> with timber-slat blinds above. There is also a timber partition with a door towards the eastern end of the north-east verandah, and a small timber toilet room. The south-west verandah has <b>balustrading,</b> but only a small section of lattice and no timber blinds. The south-east verandah has no <b>balustrading</b> and is screened by timber latticework. The narrow verandah that runs along the north-east elevation of the kitchen wing past the bedrooms and bathroom to the kitchen, has timber <b>balustrading,</b> and a lattice partition and door towards the north-west end. Hedged plants grow to the height of the top <b>balustrading</b> rail in front of the north-west, north-east and south-west verandahs of Aldborough. They are supported by a double galvanised steel pipe frame that is attached {{to the side of the}} house.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{originally}} had thick stone <b>balustrades,</b> with very narrow pedestrian gangways beside them. The <b>balustrades</b> were replaced in 1732 with thinner slabs of sandstone, widening the roadway. In 1877 these were in turn replaced with granite from Flossenbürg, and the wooden ramp which had connected {{the bridge to}} the Upper Wöhrd since 1499 was replaced with an iron one at the same time. Finally, in 1950, the bridge was given concrete <b>balustrades.</b>|$|R
5|$|Surrounding {{the lantern}} is a {{concrete}} gallery, accessible {{through a door}} in the lantern wall, with a white painted <b>balustrade,</b> and a 1990 railing. The solar panels are mounted on the gallery.|$|E
5|$|A <b>balustrade,</b> {{punctuated by}} sculptures atop the giant pilasters, capped the composition, {{one of the}} most {{influential}} of Michelangelo's designs. The two massive ancient statues of Castor and Pollux that decorate the balustrades are not the same as those posed by Michelangelo, which now are in front of the Palazzo del Quirinale.|$|E
5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms {{is exactly the same}} size and shape. A grand {{stairway}} is located {{at the end of the}} mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a <b>balustrade</b> consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the front elevation comprises a central verandah, which is now enclosed with the <b>balustrades</b> intact and sheeted over, and a protruding bay on the western end. The eastern elevation also comprises an enclosed verandah with intact <b>balustrades</b> {{and the location of}} the separate surgery access is evident, although the stairs to this have been removed. Verandah detailing consists of simple and elegant timber brackets and <b>balustrades</b> typical of Dod's style.|$|R

5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a <b>balustrade</b> with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with <b>balustrade</b> extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the <b>balustrade</b> and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the <b>balustrade</b> which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|The Corridor {{is one of}} the world's {{earliest}} retail arcades, {{designed by}} architect Henry Goodridge and built in 1825, with a glass roof. The High Street end has a Doric colonnade. Each end has marble columns. A musicians gallery, with a wrought iron <b>balustrade</b> and gilt lions heads and garlands, is in the centre of the arcade. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine with Henry Goodridge as the architect.|$|E

50|$|The {{application}} to architecture was {{a feature of}} the early Renaissance: late fifteenth-century examples are found in the balconies of palaces at Venice and Verona. These quattrocento <b>balustrades</b> are likely to be following yet-unidentified Gothic precedents. They form <b>balustrades</b> of colonnettes as an alternative to miniature arcading.|$|R
50|$|On the {{flanking}} bays {{each level}} is expressed through projecting balconies which {{run along the}} north eastern elevation. The balconies have light weight metal <b>balustrades.</b> At {{the edge of the}} balconies, underneath the <b>balustrades,</b> are deep horizontal bands or valances which provide sunshading for the windows below.|$|R
5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean <b>balustrade</b> was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a <b>balustrade</b> on the right-hand side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to the ceiling of the passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style that accompanied the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant <b>balustrade</b> and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron <b>balustrade</b> decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
50|$|A central {{entrance}} {{porch with}} a coffered barrel-vaulted ceiling is accessed by {{a flight of}} stone steps and has Doric columns supporting a frieze, moulded cornice and <b>balustraded</b> parapet. The first and second floors have tall two-light casement windows with architraves, <b>balustrades</b> and pediments to the second floor.|$|R

Rudolph Schwarz {{received}} another contract to provide and furnish the materials for two bronze bas-reliefs to be placed on the middle columns of the <b>balustrades</b> for $500 apiece.|$|R
50|$|The verandah, which returns at each end, has at {{the lower}} level an arched arcade of {{rendered}} masonry with pilasters and cast iron <b>balustrading.</b> The upper level of the verandah has double timber posts, cast iron <b>balustrades</b> and timber louvred panels above. Between the levels is a moulded string course.|$|R
5|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Library {{became a}} popular {{destination}} for studying and hanging out {{for young people}} from well-known neighbouring schools such as Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls' School, St Joseph's Institution and Tao Nan School that had their early beginnings in this area. The landmark <b>Balustrade</b> or front porch and steps {{leading up to the}} Library became an intimate public space where one could sit and read, wait, chat or simply watch the world go by.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 it was {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the <b>balustrade,</b> the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today {{is an important part}} of London's road system and carries the A202 road across the Thames.|$|E
5|$|Palacio de Congresos de Badajoz, {{the congressional}} palace, {{is the work}} of the architects José Selgas and Lucia Cano. Palacio Municipal houses the City Hall. The remains of the {{original}} City Hall building are in ruins. The current building dates to 1852, and the clock was added in 1889. In 1937, the municipal architect, Rodolfo Martinez, renovated the building, with particular emphasis on stylistic uniformity, expanding its towers and changing its decorative elements. It features a <b>balustrade,</b> a central balcony and columns.|$|E

5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a <b>balustrade.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Lawn is {{so called}} {{because of the}} replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was {{presented}} by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn {{is part of the}} original <b>balustrade</b> of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The {{facade of}} the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the {{instructions}} of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a <b>balustrade</b> consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, {{most of which are}} of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.|$|E
50|$|An open structure, the {{car park}} {{consists}} primarily of {{a grid of}} rectangular concrete columns with flared tops supporting waffle slabs which form the floors. Precast concrete panels with an exposed aggregate finish form the <b>balustrades</b> on the Turbot Street and Wickham Terrace elevations. <b>Balustrading</b> elsewhere consists of painted square sectioned steel posts attached to the outside face of the building which support steel pipe handrails. Horizontal steel rods secured with steel springs have been added as supplementary <b>balustrading.</b> The original security screen on the Wickham Terrace elevation {{is a series of}} vertical steel rods fixed to the floor slabs with springs.|$|R
