40|$|In {{the domain}} of sports and motor rehabilitation, it is of major {{importance}} to regulate and control physiological processes and physical motion in most optimal ways. For that purpose, real-time auditory feedback of physiological and physical information based on sound signals, often termed `sonification’, has been proven particularly useful. However, the use of music in <b>biofeedback</b> <b>systems</b> has been much less explored. In the current article, we assert {{that the use of}} music, and musical principles, can have a major added value, with respect to mere sound signals, to the benefit of psychological and physical optimization of sports and motor rehabilitation tasks.

These functions relate the power of music to Motivate, and to Monitor and Modify physiological and physical processes. The model brings together concepts and theories related to human sensorimotor interaction with music, and specifies the underlying psychological and physiological principles.

We identified communication and processing as two main possible obstacles for high performance real-time <b>biofeedback</b> <b>systems.</b> We give {{special attention to}} the role of high performance computing with some details on possible usage of DataFlow computing paradigm. Motion tracking systems, in connection with the biomechanical biofeedback, help in accelerating motor learning. Requirements about various parameters important in real-time biofeedback applications are discussed. Inertial sensor tracking system accuracy is tested in comparison with a high performance optical tracking system. Special focus is given on feedback loop delays. Real-time sensor signal acquisitions and real-time processing challenges, in connection with biomechanical biofeedback, are presented. Despite the fact that local processing requires less energy consumption than remote processing, many other limitations, most often the insufficient local processing power, can lead to distributed system as the only possible option. A multiuser signal processing in football match is recognised as an example for high performance application that needs high-speed communication and high performance remote computing.

Unfortunately, we often miss or ignore {{important}} signals from our bodies, and sometimes this can negatively impact our health. Therefore, the use of intelligent systems that grasp such signals and convey them in an intuitive manner to our minds can result in great health benefits. In this Thesis, we introduce a family of multimedia technologies and techniques aimed at realizing such systems. We call them: Ubiquitous <b>Biofeedback</b> Multimedia <b>Systems.</b> Although the notion of clinical biofeedback has been around for years, we introduce the concept of Ubiquitous Biofeedback where the biofeedback operation is given geographical and temporal ubiquity attributes. A Ubiquitous Biofeedback reference model is introduced in the Thesis to provide an abstract structural representation of the various components at play in a typical non-clinical <b>biofeedback</b> environment. Two <b>systems</b> that implement the reference model’s components are presented. These systems implement the concept of Ubiquitous Biofeedback through the introduction of innovative stress management methods. An important component of these systems guides users through a relaxation routine. Therefore, a mathematical model is developed in the goal of personalizing the relaxation process. Its objective is to suggest relaxation techniques to a user during a stressful episode based on her or his preferences, history of what worked well and appropriateness for the context. The mental stress monitoring mechanism built into the Ubiquitous <b>Biofeedback</b> <b>systems</b> presented in this Thesis relies on the measurement of Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
