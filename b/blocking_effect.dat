5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the <b>blocking</b> <b>effect</b> of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

The effect of changing {{the depth of the}} first point of gamma-ray interaction in the block detectors was examined. The gamma-ray interaction depth was varied, and the event position in the crystal identification image was examined. If the events were positioned inconsistently with gamma-ray interaction depth, this might be a cause of the <b>block</b> <b>effect.</b> In the CTI HR+ detector and the CTI HI-REZ detector, the positioning of events in the crystal identification image was dependent both on the crystal depth of the first point of interaction and the crystal location. In the GE Advance block detector the positioning of events in the crystal identification image was consistent for varying gamma-ray interaction depth, and crystal position. In crystals where the positioning of events is not consistent with interaction depth, the <b>block</b> <b>effect</b> is larger.

500|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the effect size is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter. The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies. Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed. [...] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting signal to noise ratio in cortical microcircuits. [...] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine <b>blocking</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to help the reader in {{designing}} D-optimal blocked experiments. The <b>block</b> <b>effects</b> are assumed to be random. Therefore, in general, the optimal designs depend on the extent to which observations within one block are correlated. An algorithm is presented that produces D-optimal designs for these cases. However, in three specific situations, the optimal design does not depend on the degree of correlation. These situations include some cases where the block size is greater than or equal to the number of model parameters, the case of minimum support designs and orthogonally blocked first-order designs. In addition, a relationship is established between the design of experiments with random <b>block</b> <b>effects</b> and the design of experiments with fixed <b>block</b> <b>effects.</b> Finally, it is shown that orthogonal blocking is an optimal design strategy.

30|$|This {{study shows}} that sodium and {{potassium}} ions that exhibit strong <b>blocking</b> <b>effects</b> on the adsorption of cesium ions are washed out from OC and AC more easily than magnesium and calcium ions. A noteworthy outcome of the present work is that demineralization by water-washing enhances the cesium-adsorption ability of OC and AC for solution II (CsCl: 2.50  ×  10 − 5  mol/L), although such enhancements are not observed for solution I (CsCl: 2.50  ×  10 − 4  mol/L). This allows us to postulate that W-OC has considerably high adsorption ability when the cesium concentration is extremely low, as in actual contaminated soil, if the <b>blocking</b> <b>effects</b> of other metal ions are negligibly small.|$|R
30|$|From {{the data}} shown in both Table  2 and {{previous}} work [6], {{it is assumed}} that the group 1 and 2 metal ions eluted from OC or AC, especially potassium ions, significantly prevented cesium ions from being adsorbed onto charcoals. Positive improvements in adsorption ability are expected to be achieved by the washing even if the metals cannot be completely removed from OC to AC. This is because the <b>blocking</b> <b>effects</b> of magnesium and calcium were relatively small and the eluted amounts of sodium and potassium showing the strong <b>blocking</b> <b>effects</b> were decreased drastically by the washing. To confirm this, the adsorption behavior of cesium ions was investigated using W-OC and W-AC as adsorbents.|$|R

This dissertation investigates {{the distribution of}} Iron Range English (IRE) reflexives, using judgments collected in a Magnitude Estimation task (Bard et al 1996), and presents a phase-based analysis for their distribution. IRE reflexives (e. g., himself) can corefer with nominal expressions outside their minimal clause in subject or object position. Coreference with an expression outside the minimal clause is not acceptable in two environments: (i) {{if there is an}} intervening subject that does not match the reflexive for person (c. f., <b>Blocking</b> <b>Effects</b> in Mandarin) or (ii) if the reflexive is in an island. The distribution of IRE reflexives is unexpected because generally only monomorphemic reflexives behave this way (Pica 1987). Complex reflexives that behave this way, such as Malay diri-nya `himself/herself' (Cole & Hermon 2003) and Turkish kendi-sin `himself/herself' (Kornfilt 2001), are shown to have pronominal qualities. IRE reflexives do not have pronominal qualities since they exhibit <b>Blocking</b> <b>Effects</b> and island effects. Therefore, they are true long-distance reflexives. <b>Blocking</b> and island <b>effects</b> provide evidence that the reflexive undergoes raising to [Spec, CP], as is suggested for long-distance reflexives in other languages (e. g., Katada 1991). From the [Spec, CP] position, the reflexive is able to corefer with a nominal expression in a higher clause, in accordance with the Phase Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 2001). Two processes are needed to account for the distribution of IRE long-distance reflexives (c. f., Cole & Wang 1996) since the set of expressions that are potential antecedents and the set of expressions that trigger <b>Blocking</b> <b>Effects</b> are not the same: a reflexive can corefer with a subject or an object, but only subjects trigger <b>Blocking</b> <b>Effects.</b> I posit that reflexives have a [VAR] feature that must be valued by a c-commanding nominal expression within the same phase via Agree, extending Hicks' (2009) analysis of English anaphors. Agree accounts for coreference and offers an inherent c-command relationship between the antecedent and reflexive. I account for <b>Blocking</b> <b>Effects</b> by considerably modifying Hasegawa's (2005) analysis for English anaphors. I suggest that a [+multi] feature on T licenses the reflexive and requires that the reflexive and the subject Agree for person...|$|R
