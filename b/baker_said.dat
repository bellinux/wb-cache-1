5|$|The port was {{released}} on September 17, 2009. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 2, 2012. Speaking in January 2010, Namco Bandai announced {{that they had no}} plans to release the port overseas. Later that year, Yuri's English voice actor Troy <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> that he had been recording new English dialogue for the PS3 port. A report from a Namco Bandai employee sparked speculation that the reason behind the lack of a localization was due to a deal with Microsoft to keep the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive in western territories. Later, she retracted this statement, apologizing for creating false impressions. Series producer Hideo Baba later said that the main factor in this decision was the strain put on the team with the simultaneous release of the original, meaning a Japan-exclusive release was chosen to lessen the burden. This also coincided with poor marketing feedback for the series in western territories.|$|E

25|$|<b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> that Prunier and he, who {{had been}} {{travelling}} together in Europe, had {{decided to go to}} Japan before the 2002 FIFA World Cup to buy souvenirs and allow Prunier to rent a flat for the tournament. Baker and Prunier left Brussels National Airport in Belgium on 12 April, transited through London's Heathrow Airport and arrived at Tokyo's Narita airport at approximately 11:00 a.m. JST, on 13 April 2002.|$|E

[...] In June 2003, Baker was sentenced to 14 years in prison with forced labour and a ¥5,000,000 fine. <b>Baker's</b> lawyer <b>said</b> <b>Baker</b> had been punished more heavily because he had protested his innocence rather than confessing, which is the usual method by which {{prosecutors}} secure convictions.|$|R
25|$|The {{struggles of}} newly minted closer Blake Treinen {{in the ninth}} inning {{prompted}} manager Dusty Baker to announce on April 19 that closing duties would be shared between relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover. <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> concerns about Kelley's resiliency, due to a twice-repaired elbow, and Glover's lack of experience, as a rookie without a career save, kept the team from giving either one the sole job of closer. Glover earned his first career save on April 22, coming into the ninth inning with two outs and retiring the only batter he faced. However, he landed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement on April 26, and left-handed reliever Matt Grace was recalled.|$|E
25|$|Baker, the character's recast, {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} taking over a prominent character. She said she had studied scenes of Havins as Babe, {{and that she was}} focused on her portrayal as the character. Before landing the role, Baker was screen tested with actors who often interact with the character (Jacob Young, who portrays JR Chandler and Bobbie Eakes, portrayer of the character's mother, Krystal). A few days after her audition, she received a phone call informing her that she had won the part. <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> that she was treated with a warm welcome {{from the rest of the}} cast and Havins herself, and that this has made her feel at home while on set.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, the Nationals {{selected}} the contract of top overall prospect Víctor Robles. They cleared {{space for the}} 20-year-old outfielder on the 40-man roster by moving Fedde to the 60-day disabled list. Outfielders Rafael Bautista and Andrew Stevenson were also recalled. Manager Dusty Baker disclosed that outfielder Brian Goodwin had experienced a setback while rehabbing from a groin injury suffered the previous month, rendering his status doubtful {{for the rest of}} the season. Robles pinch-hit and flied out to deep right field in his major league debut as the Nationals took the first of four from the division rival Philadelphia Phillies, coming back to win 4−3. The Nationals made one more call-up on September 8, recalling infielder Adrián Sánchez in what <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> was the last of the team's scheduled call-ups with expanded September rosters. In that evening's game against the Phillies, the Nationals won behind big offensive games from their shortstop Turner and their center fielder Michael A. Taylor, who respectively were a triple and a double shy of hitting for the cycle. Taylor hit the first major league inside-the-park grand slam in nearly two years, and the first in team history, as the Nationals defeated the Phillies in the dramatic 11−10 game. The Nationals took three out of four from the Phillies in the series, with Baker deploying a rookie-heavy team for the series finale on September 10 and Strasburg extending his scoreless inning streak to 34 innings, the longest of any major league pitcher in the season, as he earned the win in the 3−2 contest. Robles collected his first major league hit and RBI, driving in Sánchez with a double but being called out at third after he slid past the bag in an attempt to stretch the hit into a triple. With the Marlins losing to the Atlanta Braves the same day, the Nationals became the first team in the 2017 Major League Baseball season to clinch a spot in the playoffs and a division title, winning the National League East crown for the fourth time since their 2012 season.|$|E
5000|$|Art Critic Kenneth <b>Baker</b> has <b>said</b> of Kremer's work: “Naomie Kremer’s improvisational works {{depend on}} elusive, {{harmonious}} relations among painterly details, the tempo of brushwork, and {{the dimensions of}} a canvas.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} a box office flop - [...] "Harem just didn't work out," [...] <b>Baker</b> later <b>said,</b> [...] "those things happen." [...] However it {{launched}} {{a successful career}} for Baker in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|In a November 29 press conference, Secretary of State James A. <b>Baker</b> III <b>said</b> he {{believed}} President Cristiani {{was in control}} of the army and defended the government's crackdown on opponents as [...] "absolutely appropriate." ...|$|R
500|$|Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan {{recorded}} Empire Burlesque. Arthur Baker, who had remixed {{hits for}} Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper, {{was asked to}} engineer and mix the album. <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> {{he felt he was}} hired to make Dylan's album sound [...] "a little bit more contemporary".|$|E
500|$|Julian Glover as (Lieutenant) Colonel Breen: Roy Ward Baker {{first met}} Glover when he {{directed}} {{him in an}} episode of The Avengers ("Two's a Crowd", 1965). <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> of Glover's performance, “He turned in a tremendous character, forceful, autocratic but never over the top.” Glover recalled of the role, “I think I was too young for it. [...] I think I played it all right. It was very straightforward. Bit of a stereotype. [...] The obligatory asshole!” ...|$|E
500|$|Cambridge's women's coach Rob <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Our cox did {{exceptionally}} well and nearly got us {{back into the}} race. Then we sunk." [...] Speaking of Oxford's cox Morgan Baynham-Williams, OUWBC president Badcott noted [...] "we're so lucky to have Morgan – she smashed it today." [...] Badcott went on to describe the conditions as [...] "probably the worst I have experienced on the Tideway". [...] OUBC's coach Sean Bowden said the conditions were [...] "the worst I have ever seen" [...] while Matthew Pinsent referred to them as [...] "absolutely biblical". [...] Hoffstot said he was [...] "humbled" [...] by the victory, his first in three attempts, while his opposite number Gerlak acknowledged that Cambridge had [...] "managed the conditions better." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the three-hour judgment, {{which was}} an almost word-for-word copy of the prosecution's argument, Kadoya said [...] "This is a heinous crime. [...] "This amount of drugs was a record. If they had entered our country, they would have harmed {{a large number of}} people." [...] In June 2003, Baker was sentenced to 14 years in prison with forced labour and a ¥5,000,000 fine. <b>Baker's</b> lawyer <b>said</b> <b>Baker</b> had been punished more heavily because he had protested his innocence rather than confessing, which is the usual method by which {{prosecutors}} secure convictions.|$|R
25|$|In June 2003, the {{presiding}} judge, Kenji Kadoya, {{who had never}} found a defendant innocent in a career spanning more than a decade, found <b>Baker</b> guilty. He <b>said</b> <b>Baker</b> must have known {{the contents of the}} case because he had carried the key and had told customs officials and prosecutors that the case belonged to him. The judge also noted a signed confession, which implied Baker knew he was carrying drugs in the bag.|$|R

500|$|Baker {{was finally}} {{sent to the}} front in April and {{assigned}} to the 103d Aero Squadron, formed from {{former members of the}} Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps in January 1918. [...] Baker helped to bring down an enemy plane {{for the first time in}} his career on May 21, but due to a complicated system of confirming kills, he was not given credit for it. In a letter home describing the battle, <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> it was the [...] "biggest thrill I ever had in my life", and compared it to the feeling after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
500|$|Northern {{and central}} Sudan had been {{nominally}} under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied {{the region in}} 1821. The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves {{to serve in the}} Egyptian army. The slaves, paid in lieu of taxes, were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan. When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862, he found that everyone in the town was involved in the slave trade, including the Governor-General. The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation. Bribery {{was the only way to}} get anything done. Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons. <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> of Khartoum [...] "a more miserable and unhealthy place can hardly be imagined". He described the Governor General Musa Pasha as combining [...] "the worst of Oriental failings with the brutality of a wild animal".|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
50|$|Upon {{being hired}} as General Manager for the City of Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, <b>Baker</b> Tharp <b>said</b> that she {{intended}} to focus on getting councils to achieve results in their neighborhoods.

500|$|Britten was, as he acknowledged, {{notorious for}} dumping {{friends and colleagues}} who either {{offended}} him or ceased to be of use – his [...] "corpses". The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking {{that the number of}} boys in Noye's Fludde must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, [...] "He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his 'corpses' and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben." [...] Dame Janet <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> in 1981, [...] "I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody." [...] Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships {{to the end of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|On October 19, 1951, Josephine Baker made {{charges of}} racism against the Stork Club. [...] Baker visited the club on October 16 as {{the guest of}} Roger Rico and his wife; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances. <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> she ordered a steak and was {{apparently}} still waiting for it an hour later. [...] The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell {{of being in the}} Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid. [...] Winchell was at the club; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table. Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem, and left for a late screening of the film [...] The next morning, Winchell's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news, and he received countless telephone calls. The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers. Mrs. Rico, who was part of the Baker party with her husband, said that Baker's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call, but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork anyhow. News accounts show conflicting statements from the Ricos.|$|E
500|$|Respawn {{chose to}} build Titanfall on the Source game engine {{early in their}} {{production}} cycle due to their developers' familiarity {{and its ability to}} maintain 60 frames per second on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In an interview, Respawn software engineer Richard <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> the company chose Source since Portal 2 performed well on the PlayStation 3 with it, and the console was [...] "the riskiest platform in seventh generation". The company built upon the engine during development in features such as lighting, rendering, visibility, networking, and tools pipelines. The game also uses Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform for multiplayer servers, physics, and artificial intelligence. Offloading this non-player activity frees the local console for visual rendering tasks and better graphics, and the developers for game development (instead of backend maintenance). This arrangement determines world events in the cloud instead of locally, so position and movement data is downloaded simultaneously by all player-clients. The studio's cloud server access is considered vital to the game's viability, and Respawn artist Joel Emslie said they would not have attempted this game without the cloud support. The team ran a small alpha test and followed up with a large beta test to stress test the new Xbox Live compute platform {{as one of the first}} games to use the network. The platform broke for seven hours at one point of the test. Lead programmer Jon Shiring figured that the ten problems they found during the test were ten problems they didn't need to find at launch. Respawn felt that Kinect support did not suit the game and chose not to support the peripheral. The development team reported considerable interest in support for esports competitive play, and while such features were not prioritized for the initial release, Respawn indicated that esports accommodations were under consideration for future iterations.|$|E
50|$|After {{the failure}} of her play, {{she went back to}} writing novels. The next one was Our Gifted Son in 1948. She then wrote Cassandra at the Wedding in 1962, whose subject was {{identical}} twin sisters who were especially close. <b>Baker's</b> husband <b>said</b> that this novel was based on the couple's own two daughters.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Baker</b> has <b>said</b> that {{to succeed}} in acting, he knows he must focus on it {{completely}} and realises he must make some sacrifices, such as quitting his tennis lessons. He also recommends getting an agent and says prospective actors must [...] "get used to being criticised" [...] and that being good at reading helps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Paris, France as Minogue was finishing her photoshoot in Paris. The video featured Minogue {{in a number of}} disguises. According to her long-term friend William <b>Baker,</b> he <b>said</b> that her team intended to re-create her previous video [...] "What Do I Have to Do" [...] to this video.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> that he {{attacked}} Ashley {{because he believed}} the boy was a [...] "nark." [...] He freely admitted to killing Ashley and received a minimum 18 year life sentence. Damien O'Connor, the Minister of Corrections, described the fatal injury as [...] "senseless" [...] and [...] "preventable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Rick <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} rally [...] "really {{needed to be}} done. There was so much demand in the community. They didn't win the World Series but they won the AL.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Williams filed a habeas corpus {{petition}} and requested a retrial. Butts County Superior Court judge Hal Craig denied his appeal. Attorney General Thurbert <b>Baker</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "although {{this does not}} end the appeal process, I am pleased with the results in the habeas case," [...] and that his office [...] "will continue {{to do everything possible}} to uphold the conviction." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{driving to}} Le Studio on icy {{mountain}} roads, {{the band was}} following Roy Thomas Baker in their own vehicle and {{was involved in a}} car accident that sent bassist Gary Strater to the hospital. Roy Thomas <b>Baker</b> has <b>said</b> making the album was fun, but [...] "a complete disaster" [...] from the very first day.|$|R
