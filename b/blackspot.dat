5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Pondicherry shark are uncertain. In a 1988 study based on morphological data, Compagno tentatively grouped {{it with the}} smalltail shark (C. porosus), <b>blackspot</b> shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), Borneo shark (C. borneensis), and hardnose shark (C. macloti).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the hardnose shark {{have not been}} fully resolved. In a 1988 study based on morphology, Leonard Compagno tentatively grouped the hardnose shark with the Borneo shark (C. borneensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), smalltail shark (C. porosus), <b>blackspot</b> shark (C. sealei), and spottail shark (C. sorrah). Results from molecular phylogenetic analyses have been inconsistent, with some supporting parts of Compagno's hypothesis: a 1992 study could not resolve the hardnose shark's position in detail, a 2011 study reported that {{it was close to}} the clade formed by the whitecheek and <b>blackspot</b> sharks, and a 2012 study concluded that it was the sister species of the Borneo shark.|$|E
40|$|Visually {{classifying}} {{species is}} the most common method used in fisheries to estimate catch compositions for commercial and survey data, but catch records can be confounded when two or more morphologically similar species are classified as a single species (i. e., cryptic species) —as is the case for <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish and Rougheye Rockfish. To partition catches between the two species, I used genetic species identification data in regression models relating the proportion of <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish relative to the overall Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish catch to measures of set depth, location, and bottom ruggedness. The best model included a negative relationship with longitude and positive relationship with bottom ruggedness. I also used large-scale spatial predictors to estimate historical landings of each species, finding that the inclusion of trap longline commercial data after 2006 caused an increase in the relative proportion of <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish caught (out of the total Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish landings). Finally, I examined observer accuracy in distinguishing <b>Blackspotted</b> and Rougheye Rockfish and found that while 86 % of fish were identified correctly, <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish {{were more likely to be}} misidentified, leading to a 55 % overestimate of the actual Rougheye Rockfish catch and a 14 % underestimate of the <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish catch. My results indicate that set-specific variables are most useful in estimating proportions of <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish and can be used to estimate how spatial shifts in fishing efforts will impact fishing mortality of <b>Blackspotted</b> Rockfish and Rougheye Rockfish...|$|R

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not place {{it close to}} any other member of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), <b>blackspot</b> shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and <b>blackspot.</b> In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the creek whaler {{have yet to be}} fully resolved. In comparative morphological studies published by Jack Garrick in 1982 and Leonard Compagno in 1988, it was tentatively placed in a grouping defined by the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the <b>blackspot</b> shark (C. sealei). Shane Lavery, in a 1992 study based on allozymes, reported that this species was close to the nervous shark (C. cautus) and the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, in a 2011 study based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes, found it to be the basal member of a clade also containing the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni).|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the smalltail shark are uncertain. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick in 1982 and Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively {{placed it in}} a group defined by the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the <b>blackspot</b> shark (C. sealei). This grouping was equivocally supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme-based phylogenetic analysis. Alternately, a 2011 phylogenetic study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes, found close relationships between the smalltail shark, the daggernose shark (Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus), the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). The Pacific smalltail shark (C. cerdale) was once mistakenly synonymized with C. porosus, until 2011 when José Castro resurrected it as a distinct taxon. An undescribed species closely similar to C. porosus is known from Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} data, Jack Garrick {{suggested in}} 1982 that the blacknose shark has a sister relationship {{to a group}} containing the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the <b>blackspot</b> shark (C. sealei), while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this shark belongs in a group with five other species, including the silky shark (C. falciformis) and the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark (C. limbatus) or the smalltail shark (C. porosus). The whitenose shark (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the teratogenic effects of incipient cyclopia.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{efforts to}} resolve the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the silky shark were inconclusive; based on morphology, Jack Garrick in 1982 suggested the <b>blackspot</b> shark (C.sealei) as its closest relative.

500|$|The {{specific}} epithet falciformis is Latin for [...] "sickle-shaped", {{which refers}} to {{the outline of the}} dorsal and pectoral fins. The silky shark's common name comes from the fine texture of its skin compared to other sharks, a product of its tiny, densely packed dermal denticles. It may also be referred to as <b>blackspot</b> shark (usually used for C.sealei), grey reef shark (usually used for C.amblyrhynchos), grey whaler shark, olive shark, reef shark, ridgeback shark, sickle shark, sickle silk shark, sickle-shaped shark, silk shark, and silky whaler.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{species of}} wrasses have been {{observed}} using rocks as anvils to crack bivalve (scallops, urchins and clams) shells. It [...] in an orange-dotted tuskfish (Choerodon anchorago) in 2009 by Giacomo Bernardi. The fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve, takes it into its mouth, swims several metres to a rock which it uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head. This behaviour has been recorded in a <b>blackspot</b> tuskfish (Choerodon schoenleinii) on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, yellowhead wrasse (Halichoeres garnoti) in Florida and a six-bar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke) in an aquarium setting.
