5|$|Generally, {{the first}} <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> be {{affected}} are the fingers, facial bones, ribs, and pelvis. Long bones, which are {{longer than they}} are wide, are also among the first affected. As the disease progresses, any bone may be affected.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

25|$|Ligaments attach <b>bone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bone</b> or <b>bone</b> <b>to</b> tendon, and {{are vital}} in {{stabilizing}} joints {{as well as}} supporting structures.

5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak {{described}} {{some small}} parrot bones {{that he had}} discovered among a collection of broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) subfossils in the Zoology Museum of Cambridge University. These remains had been collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, who had found them in a cave on Le Pouce mountain, on the Mascarene island of Mauritius. They {{were placed in the}} zoology museum by 1908. Apart from their size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> be distinct from those of the Mascarene parrot genera Lophopsittacus, Mascarinus (the Mascarene parrot), Necropsittacus (the Rodrigues parrot), and Psittacula (which had two or three other species inhabiting the Mascarene islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{apparently}} {{controlled the}} Kingdom of Lindsey, given {{the evidence of}} a story told by Bede regarding the moving of Oswald's <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> a monastery there; Bede says that the monks rejected the bones initially because Oswald had ruled over them as a foreign king. To the north, {{it may have been}} Oswald who conquered the Gododdin. Irish annals record the siege of Edinburgh, thought to have been the royal stronghold of the Gododdin, in 638, and this seems to mark the end of the kingdom; that this siege was undertaken by Oswald is suggested by the apparent control of the area by his brother Oswiu in the 650s.|$|E

5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro {{had felt}} unusually tired {{at the end}} of her second senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E

5|$|Many ancient civilizations {{observed}} astronomical bodies, {{often the}} Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons. The first calendars {{may have been}} created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built {{in various parts of}} the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices. As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their calendars or timekeeping methods. Methods of sexagesimal timekeeping, now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with calendars to produce a 360-day year.|$|E
5|$|Many temnospondyls {{are much}} larger than living amphibians, and superficially {{resemble}} crocodiles. Others are smaller and resemble salamanders. Most have broad, flat heads that are either blunt (brevirostrine) or elongated (longirostrine). The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above, and are usually covered in pits and ridges. The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels, which could transfer carbon dioxide to the <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> neutralize acidic build up in the blood (early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land, and these dermal bones {{may have been an}} early solution to the problem). Many temnospondyls also have canal-like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci. The sulci, which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets, are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water. As semiaquatic animals, most temnospondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot. Terrestrial temnospondyls have larger, thicker limbs, and some even have claws. One unusual terrestrial temnospondyl, Fayella, has relatively long limbs for its body, and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey.|$|E
5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E

5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> the floor of the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the workhouse {{can be traced to}} the Poor Law Act of 1388, which {{attempted}} to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. But mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates, who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market. Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> produce fertiliser, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike, perhaps the origin of the workhouse's nickname.|$|E
