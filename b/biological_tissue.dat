In 2010, in close {{cooperation with the}} Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on <b>biological</b> <b>tissue.</b> In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several mutations of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of Aβ oligomers. Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.|$|E

25|$|Polarized light {{microscopy}} {{is commonly used}} in <b>biological</b> <b>tissue,</b> as many biological materials are birefringent. Collagen, found in cartilage, tendon, bone, corneas, and several other areas in the body, is birefringent and commonly studied with polarized {{light microscopy}}.

25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} {{medical imaging technique}} that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., <b>biological</b> <b>tissue).</b> Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. Confocal microscopy, another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} {{is limited to}} imaging 1 to 2mm below the surface in <b>biological</b> <b>tissue,</b> because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering {{is too small to}} be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained ‘non-contact’ or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also {{important to note that the}} laser output from the instruments is low – eye-safe near-infra-red light is used – and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} {{is the need for}} extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. <b>Biological</b> <b>tissue</b> specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>tissue</b> {{is often}} {{embedded}} in a resin block then thinned to less than 100nm on an ultramicrotome. The resin block is fractured as it passes over a glass or diamond knife edge. This method is used to obtain thin, minimally deformed samples that allow for the observation of tissue ultrastructure. Inorganic samples, such as aluminium, may also be embedded in resins and ultrathin sectioned in this way, using either coated glass, sapphire or larger angle diamond knives. To prevent charge build-up at the sample surface when viewing in the TEM, tissue samples need to be coated with {{a thin layer of}} conducting material, such as carbon.|$|E

It is shown that statistic approach {{to the analysis of}} complex degree of mutual anisotropy distributions of <b>biological</b> <b>tissues</b> of various morphological and physiological states and optical thicknesses appears to be more sensitive and efficient in differentiation of physiological state in comparison with investigations of complex degree of mutual polarization of the corresponding laser images...|$|R
25|$|Starting from white-light {{interferometry}} for in vivo ocular eye measurements imaging of <b>biological</b> <b>tissue,</b> {{especially of}} the human eye, was investigated by multiple groups worldwide. A first two-dimensional in vivo depiction of a human eye fundus along a horizontal meridian based on white light interferometric depth scans {{was presented at the}} ICO-15 SAT conference in 1990. Further developed in 1990 by Naohiro Tanno, then a professor at Yamagata University, and in particular since 1991 by Huang et al., in Prof. James Fujimoto laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with micrometer resolution and cross-sectional imaging capabilities has become a prominent biomedical tissue-imaging technique; it is particularly suited to ophthalmic applications and other tissue imaging requiring micrometer resolution and millimeter penetration depth. First in vivo OCT images – displaying retinal structures – were published in 1993 and first endoscopic images in 1997.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} by which heat may be delivered. Some {{of the most}} common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of 'tunability' of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an 'optical window' in which <b>biological</b> <b>tissue</b> (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a 'window' exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed.|$|E

2500|$|A sonomicrometer device {{measures}} distance {{by performing}} a timing {{measurement of the}} sound transmitted by one crystal and received by one (or more) adjacent crystals. [...] The ability to resolve small differences in this transit-time (or [...] "time-of-flight") directly correlates {{with the ability to}} resolve small changes in the distances between crystals. [...] The first generation of sonomicrometer devices were analog devices that integrated the time-of-flight as a voltage ramp function. [...] Their resolution was a function of the slope of the ramp and the electrical noise of system components. [...] Those systems output the length measurements as an analog voltage. [...] The second generation of sonomicrometer devices were digital—they measure time-of-flight by incrementing high-speed digital counters. [...] Typically these are 12 to 16-bit counters operating from 32 to 128MHz. [...] A digital system will output length measurements in form of a digital number (the time-of-flight count value). [...] Because of their digital nature, the resolution can be exactly specified as a function of counter clock frequency. [...] For example, when making measurements in <b>biological</b> <b>tissue</b> at body temperature (velocity = 1,590m/s), a digital sonomicrometer operating with a clock speed of 128MHz will have a spatial resolution of 12 micrometres.|$|E
2500|$|All natural {{products}} begin as mixtures with other compounds {{from the natural}} source, often very complex mixtures, from which the product of interest must be isolated and purified. The isolation of a natural product refers, depending on context, either to the isolation of sufficient quantities of pure chemical matter for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation/degradation chemistry, biological testing, and other research needs (generally milligrams to grams, but historically, often more), or to the isolation of [...] "analytical quantities" [...] of the substance of interest, where {{the focus is on}} identification and quantitation of the substance (e.g. in <b>biological</b> <b>tissue</b> or fluid), and where the quantity isolated depends on the analytical method applied (but is generally always sub-microgram in scale). The ease with which the active agent can be isolated and purified depends on the structure, stability, and quantity of the natural product. The methods of isolation applied toward achieving these two distinct scales of product are likewise distinct, but generally involve extraction, precipitation, adsorptions, chromatography, and sometimes crystallizations. In both cases, the isolated substance is purified to chemical homogeneity, i.e. specific combined separation and analytical methods such as LC-MS methods are chosen to be [...] "orthogonal"—achieving their separations based on distinct modes of interaction between substance and isolating matrix—with the goal being repeated detection of only a single species present in the putative pure sample. Early isolation is almost inevitably followed by structure determination, especially if an important pharmacologic activity is associated with the purified natural product.|$|E
5000|$|Photoacoustic Doppler {{effect can}} be used to measure the blood flow {{velocity}} with the advantages of Photoacoustic imaging.
