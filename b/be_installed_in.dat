5|$|Cairano first {{documented}} work is from December 24, 1489 {{with his}} commission for {{the cycle of}} twelve statues of the Apostles to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the first dome {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia. The installation of Cairano's cycle is contemporaneous with Tamagnino's installation of the twelve angels in the lower section of the dome.|$|E
5|$|When {{this station}} was opened in 1989, {{it had no}} artwork. As part of Second Avenue Subway renovations, the artwork of Jean Shin was {{commissioned}} by MTA Arts & Design to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the new station areas.|$|E
25|$|In August 1946, the Conservatory of Flowers {{was painted}} and reglazed. A new {{electrical}} system, which allowed automatic {{control of the}} heating system {{for all of the}} conservatory, <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1948. New piping <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1949. A new water supply <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1956.|$|R
50|$|A new marquee replicating the {{original}} 1926 one <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> late August 2013. It replaced a marquee that had <b>been</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 2004. Three additional onshore turbines <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 2008 {{in order}} to develop expertise with tripods, large hub heights, erection, lifting equipment, logistics and serial manufacturing.|$|R
5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E
5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. Soldiers filled the streets and blocked {{entrance}} to the capitol. Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> their respective offices.|$|E
50|$|Mansion Park's first {{artificial}} surface <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1989. Omniturf {{provided a}} way to maximize {{the use of the}} facility throughout the year and at the same time, save taxpayer dollars through reduced maintenance costs. AstroTurf 12-2000 <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1999. The eight-lane polyurethane running track <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1989 and has been resurfaced several times.|$|R
50|$|Der Rufer is a {{sculpture}} by Gerhard Marcks. One statue <b>is</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the Tiergarten in Berlin, Germany. Others <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> Bremen, Germany, and Perth, Australia.|$|R
50|$|A {{pipe organ}} <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1932, reconstructed in 1945 and {{destroyed}} during the 1951 hurricane. A replacement <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1953 {{at a cost}} of over £3,000.|$|R
5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine would drive the center shaft. However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E
5|$|Sabo {{was born}} in Kufstein, Austria on 22 February 1948 to Elizabeth and Leslie Sabo Sr., who had been members of an upper-class Hungarian family. Leslie Jr. had one brother, George, who {{was born in}} 1944, as well as a second brother who had been killed in World War II bombings at the age of one. With the post-World War II {{occupation}} of Hungary by the Soviet Union, Sabo's family lost their fortune in the war and, upon realizing Communism would <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> Hungary long-term, they left the country permanently.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War the Chain Home radar system began to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the south of England, with three radar stations being operational by 1937. Although the German High Command suspected that the British may have been developing these systems, Zeppelin test flights had proved inconclusive. As a result, the expanding Chain Home radar system, and aircraft-based radar first fielded in 1940, became a vital piece of Britain's defensive capabilities during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
50|$|The first prototypes {{of these}} engines <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the March Superturbo R/March R (EK10FR type) in 1988, {{shortly after the}} engine <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the March Superturbo.|$|R
5000|$|Most, {{but not all}} of Haig's work <b>is</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> {{religious}} buildings. In February 1991, Haig's [...] "Minerva" [...] comprising six windows <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a {{surgery in}} Bath, Somerset.|$|R
50|$|In 1653, {{the first}} post boxes are {{believed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> and around Paris. By 1829, post boxes were in use throughout France. The first public post boxes <b>in</b> Poland <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> Warsaw in 1842.|$|R
5|$|After {{the devastating}} raid of 6 July, the Germans held a {{high-level}} {{meeting on the}} site's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site's development. On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a single drift. The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, reamed out to a smooth bore with a diameter of , which were to use {{a new type of}} long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of Rheinbote missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{a statue}} of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was {{declared}} an obstruction to traffic and removed. A proposal that it <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> front of the Bank of England fell through, and in 1952 it was erected in Postman's Park. In 1971 the Metropolitan Police requested that the statue be moved to the new Peel Centre police training complex, and the Corporation of London agreed. In place of Peel's statue, a large bronze sculpture of the Minotaur by Michael Ayrton was unveiled in 1973. Dominating the small park, in 1997 the Minotaur sculpture was {{moved to a new}} position on the raised walkway above London Wall.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 it was {{announced}} that 10 Hammerfest Strom HS1000 Norwegian turbines, capable of generating 1 MW each, could <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the Sound of Islay and that the BiFab yard at Arnish had won a £2 million contract to build some of the structures' components. The following March this project, which will become the largest tidal array in the world, was approved by the Scottish Government with 10 planned tidal turbines predicted to generate enough power for over 5,000 homes. The Sound of Islay offers both high currents and shelter from storms. A single 1 MW HS1000 was installed at EMEC off Eday, Orkney by the end of 2011.|$|E
50|$|A sculptural {{instrument}} entitled “Over Lyre” <b>is</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the bromeliad house. Sound artist Dan Senn {{created this}} piece which <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> memory of Shannon Priebe, a long-time conservatory supporter.|$|R
50|$|Smart Antennas have <b>been</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> several Florida cities, {{including}} Safety Harbor, Dunedin, Orlando and Clearwater. In 2012, Smart Antennas <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the New Orleans {{tourist attraction}} Mardi Gras World.|$|R

5|$|Intersection, in {{collaboration}} with British telecommunications company BT and British advertising agency Primesight, is also planning to install up to 850 Links in the United Kingdom, including in London, beginning in 2017. The LinkUK kiosks, as they will be called, {{are similar to the}} LinkNYC kiosks in New York City. These Links will replace some of London's iconic telephone booths due to these booths' age. The first hundred Links would <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the borough of Camden. The Links will have tablets, but they will lack web browsing capabilities due to the problems that LinkNYC faced in enabling the tablet browsers.|$|E
5|$|Nine B.2 {{aircraft}} {{were converted}} for strategic reconnaissance purposes to replace Valiants {{which had been}} withdrawn due to wing fatigue, with delivery beginning in July 1965. These aircraft received a variety of cameras, a bomb bay-mounted radar mapping system and wing top sniffers to detect particles released from nuclear testing. Designated Victor SR.2, a single aircraft could photograph {{the whole of the}} United Kingdom in a single two-hour sortie. Different camera configurations could <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the bomb bay, including up to four F49 survey cameras and up to eight F96 cameras could be fitted to take vertical or oblique daylight photography; nighttime photography required the fitting of F89 cameras.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2011, VR {{announced}} it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter. The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will cover half of the expenses. The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on-the-fly again at intermediate stations. Heaters will <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The operating speed of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E
50|$|Three {{lines of}} three heaters <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1968, {{the last three}} lines <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1969. Heaters <b>were</b> {{provided}} by Ajax Magnethermic and the slab handling equipment by United Engineering and foundry.|$|R
50|$|A bandstand <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> 1908. In 1912 a cupola {{rescued from}} Cuthbert Brodrick's Hull town hall <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the park. In around 1930 a Victorian style {{conservatory}} was built near the lake.|$|R
50|$|The Crest was {{designed}} in the early 1900s, and <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a stained glass window of the Oratory in the Monastery building. In 1959, a larger replica <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the new College Chapel.|$|R
5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2014, Microsoft {{released}} the Windows 8.1 Update, which included all past updates plus new features. It was unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore {{noted that the}} update would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, {{so it can be}} installed on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage.

5|$|Previously, viewing YouTube {{videos on}} a {{personal}} computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the browser. In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard. This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed. The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the MP4 (with H.264 video) or WebM (with VP8 video) formats could play the videos, and not all videos on the site were available.|$|E
