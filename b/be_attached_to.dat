It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E

5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> moulded plastic containers.|$|E
5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it.

5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics Advance {{uses the}} {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain {{changes such as}} a customizable map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advances graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames {{have been given to}} create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a Game Cube for this to work.|$|E

5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using {{the space in}} the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.|$|E
5|$|Max-Hellmuth Ostermann (11December 1917 – 9August 1942) was a Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II.

He is credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down claimed in over 300 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front with eight claims over the Western Front and one over Belgrade.
