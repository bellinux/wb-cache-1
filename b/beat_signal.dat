50|$|In FMS, {{the light}} is {{modulated}} {{at a much higher}} frequency but with a lower modulation index. As a result, a pair of sidebands separated from the carrier by the modulation frequency appears, giving rise to a so-called FM-triplet. The signal at the modulation frequency is a sum of the <b>beat</b> <b>signals</b> of the carrier with each of the two sidebands. Since these two sidebands are fully out of phase with each other, the two <b>beat</b> <b>signals</b> cancel in the absence of absorbers. However, an alteration of any of the sidebands, either by absorption or dispersion, or a phase shift of the carrier, will give rise to an unbalance between the two <b>beat</b> <b>signals,</b> and therefore a net-signal.|$|R
40|$|A square-waveform {{generator}} {{based on}} a fiber optical parametric oscillator (FOPO) is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The FOPO works fundamentally by extracting the longitudinal modes <b>beating</b> <b>signal</b> to drive the intracavity amplitude modulator. In order to broaden the longitudinal mode spacing, two sub-ring cavities with a short cavity length are used. The longitudinal modes are phase locked, which ensures the generated microwave signal with very low phase noise. By biasing the amplitude modulator, the even-order <b>beating</b> <b>signals</b> are suppressed, while the odd-order <b>beating</b> <b>signals</b> are enhanced. Thus, the FOPO is self-starting and can provide stable square-waveform output with the repetition rate of 1. 133 GHz at the signal and idler simultaneously. It is tunable over 10 nm, which is only limited by the gain bandwidth of the fiber optical parametric amplifier of the current configuration. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5000|$|Self-oscillation {{reduced the}} quality of its {{reception}} of an AM (voice) radio signal but made it useful as a CW (Morse code) receiver. The <b>beat</b> <b>signal</b> between the oscillation and the radio signal would produce an audio [...] "beeping" [...] sound. The oscillation of the regenerative receiver could also be a source of local interference.

From the accompanying schematic for a practical regenerative receiver, one can appreciate its simplicity in relation to a multi-stage TRF receiver, while able to achieve the same level of amplification through the use of positive feedback.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1915 the tikker was {{replaced}} by a better means of accomplishing the same thing; the [...] "heterodyne receiver" [...] invented by Reginald Fessenden in 1902. In this an electronic oscillator generated a radio signal at a frequency fo offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC. This was applied to the rectifying detector with the radio carrier. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating a heterodyne (<b>beat)</b> <b>signal</b> at the difference fC - fC between these frequencies, which was in the audio frequency range. The heterodyne provided the audible tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. After vacuum tube oscillators were invented in 1913 by Alexander Meissner the heterodyne receiver replaced the tikker. Today the heterodyne method is still used to receive CW signals, and the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) is a standard part of all communications receivers.|$|E
5000|$|After optical {{heterodyne}} {{became an}} established technique, consideration {{was given to}} the conceptual basis for operation at such low signal light levels that [...] "only a few, or even fractions of, photons enter the receiver in a characteristic time interval". It was concluded that even when photons of different energies are absorbed at a countable rate by a detector at different (random) times, the detector can still produce a difference frequency. Hence light seems to have wave-like properties not only as it propagates through space, but also when it interacts with matter. [...] Progress with photon counting was such that by 2008 it was proposed that, even with larger signal strengths available, it could be advantageous to employ local oscillator power low enough to allow detection of the <b>beat</b> <b>signal</b> by photon counting. This was understood to have a main advantage of imaging with available and rapidly developing large-format multi-pixel counting photodetectors.|$|E
