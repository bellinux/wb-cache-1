5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E

Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, it will rise above it as the Earth curvature sinks below the horizon. Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium it crosses, and the beam disperses.|$|E

This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> shoulda been much better.

While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I can’t believe I did that <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> provided us with some great stories. And it was the longest running story on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, and sets it up so that his wife will discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her – jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen. Carole Glinez said, [...] "Mills' character faced her rival Paige, played by future Desperate Housewives sexpot Nicollette Sheridan." ...|$|E

500|$|In the UK, BBC DJ John Peel called [...] "Ding Dong" [...] "repetitive and dull" [...] {{and accused}} Harrison of complacency, while the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Dark Horse as [...] "Just stuff and nonsense", adding: [...] "You keep looking for saving graces, for words of enthusiasm {{to pass on}} – 'Ding Dong', you begin to think, for all its inane lyrics, has some spirit, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is very slight." [...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped {{by the presence of}} [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable infectiousness of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ... Curiously, records of such banality have a habit of selling in their zillions and this is bound to be a biggie. Hit." ...|$|E
500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E
500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to {{get the fuck out of}} this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|While Carly Darlin of The Orange County Register {{found the}} record to be [...] "an {{energetic}} and fun restatement of the RHCP whiplash funk attitude", {{she believed that}} [...] "with {{the exception of the}} dreamy instrumental 'Pretty Little Ditty', it doesn't break any new ground." [...] She continued by saying that, if anything [...] "Mother's Milk is a slight step away from the party-funk grooves of the last two albums and a return to the band's punk-rock roots. They even reprise the cover of Jimi Hendrix's 'Fire', which they did as a B-side for their 'Fight Like A Brave' 12-inch two years ago." [...] Furthermore, Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post said [...] "the polite term for albums like 'Milk' is 'eclectic', <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> sounds as if the band is unraveling [...] Considering the circumstances, it's not especially surprising that the album seems to be looking for someone to give it directions." [...] However, Jenkins did believe Frusciante possessed [...] "solid metal chops and means to show them off." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau mocked the band's ability to promote empathy and found the guitar layering in Mother's Milk to have been done improperly: [...] "punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they're finally cashing in on their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution's the problem. They didn't have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they're perfectly nice fellas, really—mention 'compassion' in the very first verse." ...|$|E
