5|$|In November 2007 someone {{claiming}} to be an al-Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and his disciples either to accept Islam or {{to be prepared to}} die. Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that this letter had been sent from Haridwar, that Rambhadracharya's security arrangements had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out. Gita Devi, secretary of JRHU, said that Rambhadracharya had been threatened by al-Qaeda, as Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Nrityagopal had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive.

5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine intervening years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov {{was the only one}} left who was fully active as a composer, and much had changed in the intervening years between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than he had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of sociobiology to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social Darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past),</b> tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E

25|$|The {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} economic and political policies of the 1950s and 1960s was to increase the closed, corporate quality of China's villages and to narrow the social horizons of villagers. Land reform and the reorganization of villages as subunits of people's communes meant that villages became collective landholding units and had clear boundaries between their lands and those of adjacent villages. Central direction of labor on collective fields made the former practices of swapping labor between villages impossible. The household registration and rationing systems confined villagers to their home settlements and made it impossible for them to seek their fortune elsewhere. Cooperation with fellow villagers and good relations with village leaders became even more important than they had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The suppression of rural markets, which accompanied the drive for self-sufficiency in grain production and other economic activities, had severe social as well as economic consequences. Most peasants had neither reason nor opportunity for regular trips to town, and their opportunities for exchange and cooperation with residents of other villages were diminished. Villages became work units, with all that that implied.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Next Generation {{argued that}} King of Fighters '94 {{was a particularly}} worthwhile arcade game, since the three-character teams meant the player would effectively get three lives for each credit, providing a high value per quarter {{at a time when}} most arcade games were much more expensive than they had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Reviewing the Neo Geo home version, GamePro remarked that the character selection is massive, but very unbalanced, and that most of the new characters are [...] "goofy looking" [...] and underpowered compared to the other fighters. They nonetheless concluded that [...] "The King of Fighters is the very best non-Shodown game available for the Neo Geo, and it's one of the most playable fighting games ever", citing enjoyable gameplay additions such as the dodge move and juggle combos.|$|E
500|$|The pagan {{crowd was}} more {{sympathetic}} to the Christians' sufferings than they had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Lactantius, Eusebius and Constantine write of revulsion at {{the excesses of the}} persecutorsConstantine of executioners [...] "wearied out, and disgusted at the cruelties" [...] they had committed. The fortitude of the martyrs in the face of death had earned the faith respectability in the past, though it may have won few converts. The thought of martyrdom, however, sustained Christians under trial and in prison, hardening their faith. Packaged with the promise of eternal life, martyrdom proved attractive for the growing segment of the pagan population which was, to quote Dodds, [...] "in love with death". To use Tertullian's famous phrase, the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church.|$|E

500|$|Both parties knew that, {{with the}} end of Reconstruction and the disenfranchisement of black Southerners, the South would be solid for Hancock, netting 137 electoral votes of the 185 needed for victory. To this, the Democrats needed only add a few of the closely {{balanced}} Northern states; New York (35 electoral votes) and Indiana (15) were two of their main targets, but New Jersey and the Midwestern states were also battlegrounds. Early in the campaign, Republicans used their standard tactic of [...] "waving the bloody shirt", that is, reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury.

500|$|Taxon is the {{bi-monthly}} {{journal of}} the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. Taxon also contains matters related to botanical nomenclature, and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names and proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). Publication of such matters in Taxon satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news {{in the world of}} plant systematics. [...] Although the journal is [...] "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany", it has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{began to}} make the drills far more {{intricate}} and precise than they had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> by adding a countermarch, maneuvers from the Army Drill Manual, and established a 30-inch (76cm) step, or sixsteps for every fiveyards (4.57m), as the band standard. Adams also added the criss-cross maneuver. First performed November 27, 1947 at the annual Thanksgiving Day game with the University of Texas, the criss-cross maneuver and its later variations became the band's most anticipated maneuver. Other band directors said {{it was impossible to}} do because it required two people {{to be in the same}} place at the same time (indeed, to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed). To accomplish this, band members step between each other's feet. In later years, people who did not know that the maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that the drill was designed by a computer. Adams explained, [...] "It's all a matter of mathematics. One man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed." ...|$|E

The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore."

500|$|... "Flu Season" [...] also {{demonstrated}} a departure {{in the way}} Ann's romantic relationships were handled compared to past seasons. The character previously dated Andy Dwyer and Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who was written out of the show {{at the end of}} the second season. In both cases, Ann was primarily in control of the relationship due to Andy's immaturity and Mark's lack of experience in long-term romances. Schur said of Ann's relationship with Chris, [...] "This is the first time that Ann just completely loses herself and really falls for a guy super hard. And the relationship goes in a lot of funny, unexpected directions." [...] Intimidated by her inability to find a flaw in the extremely positive and physically perfect Chris, Ann acts more awkwardly and nerdy around him than her character has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> [...] "Flu Season" [...] {{also demonstrated}} deeper levels to Ron Swanson, who adamantly insists [...] "I'm not interested in caring about people", yet reveals he cares about both Andy and April, and tries to help the two reconcile. Schur said Ron takes on a sort of father figure role, [...] "and he ends up revealing in a tiny, tiny, tiny way that's still true to the character that he has genuine feelings of caring for the people who work around him in the Parks office".|$|E
500|$|... "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{features}} a makeshift TARDIS console, which was piloted by the Doctor and Idris. The console {{was designed by}} Susannah Leah, a schoolgirl from Todmorden, who won a competition on Blue Peter, a children's programme that challenged its viewers to imagine a TARDIS console based on household objects. Leah's design was selected by Moffat, Edward Thomas, the production designer for the previous series, and Tim Levell, a Blue Peter editor, along with final input among the three age-group winners from Smith. Michael Pickwoad, the production designer for Series 6, commented that Leah's design captured the nature of [...] "bits and pieces" [...] of what TARDIS consoles have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> {{as well as the}} nature of the makeshift console needed for this episode. The drawing was redesigned faithfully by the production team into the prop for the show, including the use of a coat hanger to start the makeshift TARDIS. Leah was brought by Blue Peter to see both the set under construction and on location during filming of the makeshift TARDIS scenes, meeting Smith and the other actors and production crew. Character Options will release a toy playset based on Leah's console later in 2011. The House planetoid in the pocket universe was filmed on location at a quarry outside Cardiff.|$|E
