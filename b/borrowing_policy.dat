[...] The country's total external debt rose from US$2.3 billion in 1970 to US$26.2 billion in 1985. Marcos' critics charged that policies have become debt-driven, along with corruption and plunder of public funds by Marcos and his cronies. This held the country under a debt-servicing crisis which is expected to be fixed by only 2025. Critics have pointed out an elusive state of the country's development as the period is marred by a sharp devaluing of the Philippine Peso from 3.9 to 20.53. The overall economy experienced a slower growth GDP per capita, lower wage conditions and higher unemployment especially towards the end of Marcos' term after the 1983-1984 recession. The recession was triggered largely by political instability following Ninoy's assassination, high global interest rates, [...] Severe global economic recession, and significant increase in global oil price, the latter three of which affected all indebted countries in Latin America, Europe, and the Philippines was not exempted. Critics claimed that poverty incidence grew from 41% in the 1960s at the time Marcos took the Presidency to 59% when he was removed from power.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a dynamic multisector {{equilibrium}} {{model can be}} formulated {{to be able to}} analyze the optimal <b>borrowing</b> <b>policy</b> of a developing country. It also describes how a non-linear programming model with the proposed features was constructed for Brazil, and discusses the optimal solution of a base case scenario for the economy in the next 20 years. The sensitivity analysis emphasizes the response of the model to different interest rates on foreign borrowing, alternative export expansion and imports requirements scenarios, and different hypothesis with respect to future petroleum prices and domestic petroleum production. The main conclusion is that the optimal long run <b>borrowing</b> <b>policy</b> for Brazil is quite sensitive to the expected future interest rates, and may be different from some myopic strategies which are currently being suggested to handle the developing countries' foreign debt problems. The other important conclusion is that in the less favorable scenarios - protectionist foreign environment or higher petroleum prices - it is not optimal to postpone the required domestic adjustments by increased foreign borrowing. The usefulness of the model is not restricted to this set of simulations, since it can be readily adapted to address related issues such as foreign trade, investment and indirect taxation policie...|$|E

Perhaps the most crucial feature of a {{settlement system}} is the frequency with which settlement occurs. On the one hand, a higher frequency of settlement limits the risk of default should a bank be rendered insolvent.

The strategies, interventions and innovations of education systems that perform well, in international assessments, are enthusiastically borrowed and copied in {{the anticipation of}} similar educational performance and outcomes. Purpose: This purpose of the article is to highlight some of the implications and consequences of <b>policy</b> <b>borrowing</b> by comparing the preparation and development programmes for school leaders in various education systems. The article explores {{the way in which}} the leadership programmes and models are being adopted and developed by different countries. Sources of evidence: The article draws upon findings from a contemporary, comparative study of leadership preparation and development across seven different education systems (Seven System Leadership Study). This large-scale, mixed-methods, comparative research study is collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the nature and impact of leadership development and preparation programmes in seven different education systems. Main argument: The findings from the study reinforce how leadership preparation and development programmes are increasingly becoming standardised as a result of education systems borrowing and adapting from each other. This article also argues that in the contemporary policy discourse, important cultural and contextual influences that significantly affect subsequent implementation and outcomes are increasingly being side-lined and ignored. Conclusions: This article highlights some of the limitations and unintended consequences of educational <b>policy</b> <b>borrowing.</b> It concludes that adopting some of the design features of effective interventions rather than simply <b>borrowing</b> <b>policies</b> or strategies, in part or in their entirety from very different contexts, may be a more productive way forward...|$|R

Primary goal of the paper was to test to how much extent was Serbian external economic stability jeopardized by the global economic meltdown and what might be consequences of the apparent external imbalance. Additionally, we tried to examine what are the effects of the crisis on banking sector in the context of potential future instability. Our analysis brought us to conclude that the external imbalances have just become more visible in the crisis period. The real reason for these imbalances was actually inadequate growth model led by the policy makers, based on consumption and unstable inflows of foreign capital. On the other hand, during the crisis period, banking sector have shown quite solid performances while its stagnation was just a consequence of the real sector slowdown. Our conclusion is that banking sector was professionally led, highly capitalized and shall not be a trigger for some future crisis.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} that combines both in-network, application-layer adaptation and network-layer traffic control of scalable video streams based on the H. 264 /SVC standard. In the IPTV/VoD scenario considered, an intercepting RTSP/RTP proxy performs admission control of the requested video, based on the signaled scalability information, and decides whether the content can be streamed without changes or in an adapted version. The proxy configures the network layer appropriately in order to separate the video stream from best-effort traffic on the same link. Rather than performing fixed bandwidth allocation, our proxy approach uses the Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB) queuing discipline to allow for borrowing bandwidth between traffic classes. In that setting, two different allocation policies are introduced. The Hard Reservation Policy (HRP) performs admission control and adaptation on the video streams and does not modify video bandwidth allocation after admission. In contrast, the Flexible <b>Borrowing</b> <b>Policy</b> (FBP) restricts the admission control to the base layer of the SVC stream. The packets carrying MGS enhancement layer data are marked with priorities by the proxy and are handled at the network layer by a priority-based queuing mechanism. Both a qualitative comparison and an experimental evaluation of the two policies are given. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{settlement}} {{system is a}} set of rules and procedures that govern when and how funds are transferred between banks in order to finalize their customers’ transactions. Perhaps the most crucial feature of such a system is the frequency with which settlement occurs. A lower frequency allows banks to retain fewer idle reserves, and therefore economizes on financial opportunity costs. However, the accumulation of outstanding interbank liabilities under infrequent settlement introduces a large risk should a bank default on its payments. Moreover, when a bank retains fewer reserves, it is more vulnerable to external shocks. Conversely, a higher frequency of settlement decreases both the size and probability of defaults, but is more costly. This paper introduces a partial equilibrium model of a banking sector in which this tradeoff between cost and risk arises endogenously. We then complete the economy with a trading sector that has a micro-founded role for credit as a media of exchange. The result is a dynamic general equilibrium model that incorporates a sophisticated banking environment. Within this general equilibrium framework, we are able to conduct welfare and policy analysis. In particular, we study the optimal intra-day <b>borrowing</b> <b>policy</b> that the operator of a {{settlement system}} should impose on member banks.
