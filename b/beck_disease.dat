40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of body function, activities and pain on the level of activity in adults with Kashin <b>Beck</b> <b>Disease</b> (KBD). Seventy-five KBD patients with a mean age of 54. 8 years (SD 11. 3) participated. Anthropometrics, range of joint motion (ROM) and muscle strength were measured as well as the time-up-and-go test and functional tests for the lower and upper extremities. Activity was assessed with the participation scale and the WHO DAS II. In the shoulder, elbow, hip and knee joints, a severe decrease in ROM and bilateral pain was noted. A decrease in muscle strength was observed in almost all muscles. The timed-up-and-go test scores decreased. No or mild restriction in activity was found in 35 %, and 33 % experienced a moderate restriction whereas 32 % had severe to extreme restriction. Activities in the lower extremities were mildly to moderately correlated to ROM and muscle strength, whereas in the upper extremities activities were correlated to range of joint motion. Activity was significantly associated with ROM after correction for muscle strength, gender and age. Participation was borderline significantly associated with ROM after correction for muscle strength, gender, age and the activity time-up-and-go. In KBD adults, a severe decrease in activity is primarily caused by decrease in ROM. These findings have strong influence on rehabilitation and surgical interventio...|$|E

MethodsPatients aged ≤ 18 years {{at the onset of the}} disease and education level at or above the fifth grade of elementary school were selected. Cognitive evaluation was performed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by <b>Beck</b> scales; <b>disease</b> activity was assessed by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI); and cumulative damage was assessed by Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC). The presence of autoantibodies and medication use were also assessed. A significance level of 5 % (p< 0. 05) was adopted. Results 41 patients with a mean age of 14. 5 ± 2. 84 years were included. Cognitive dysfunction was noted in 17 (41. 46 %) patients. There was a significant worsening in mathematical performance in patients with cognitive dysfunction (p= 0. 039). Anxiety symptoms were observed in 8 patients (19. 51 %) and were associated with visual perception (p= 0. 037) and symptoms of depression were observed in 1 patient (2. 43 %). ConclusionPatients with JSLE concomitantly with cognitive dysfunction showed worse academic performance in mathematics compared to patients without cognitive impairment...|$|R

40|$|MHC {{complex is}} the most polymorphic, most complex {{and one of the}} most {{important}} parts of human genome which participates in the immune response. MHC in humans is known as HLA complex (human leukocyte antigen), and consists of about 224 genes (Beck et al., 1999; Robinson et al., 2000). HLA genes are well known risk factors associated with number of autoimmune <b>diseases</b> (<b>Beck</b> et al., 1999). Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy belongs to the systemic autoimmune diseases. It is a disease with clinical manifestation of chronic muscle inflammation with a destruction of muscle cells, leading to a damage of the whole muscles. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) includes several diagnoses - polymyositis (PM), dermatomysitis (DM), cancer associated myositis (CDM), inclusion bodies myositis (IBM), and others. Human MHC complex consists of three parts. First two of them - the MHC class I and MHC class II genes, are already well studied and published results show their associated with numbers of (mostly immune system mediated) diseases. The third part of MHC is located between class I and II antigens and covers an area of about 150 genes. It is also called "non Class I/II" antigens (Beck et al., 1999; Carole et al., 1988; Lie, Thorsby, 2005). My work was focused on three MHC-located genes, which are known to be [...] ...|$|R

Oos objetivos secundários são analisar se a imagem corporal e o autoconceito são influenciados pela gravidade da DP e, verificar se existe correlação entre depressão, autoconceito e imagem corporal na DP. Método: Participaram do estudo 48 indivíduos, sendo 26 com DP e 22 Controles. instrumentos utilizados foram: Mini-Exame do Estado Mental, Teste A Minha Imagem Corporal, Escala Fatorial de Autoconceito, Inventário de Depressão de <b>Beck,</b> Unified Parkinson’s <b>Disease</b> Rating Scale parte motora e Hoehn e Yahr Modificada. Resultados: Na DP a percepção da imagem corporal e do autoconceito, demonstraram valores reduzidos significativamente (p< 0. 001 e p= 0. 012) respectivamente, e a sintomatologia depressiva apresentou-se significativamente maior (p= 0. 002). Conclusão: Indivíduos com DP apresentam alteração da imagem corporal e do autoconceito, apresentaram também menos confiança pessoal e menor receptividade social correlacionados com sintomas depressObjective: To identify {{characteristics of}} {{body image and}} self-concept in individuals over fifty years of age with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The secondary objectives are to analyze whether body image and self-concept {{are influenced by the}} severity of PD and to verify if there is correlation between depression, self-concept and body image in cases of PD. Method: Participating in the study were 48 individuals, being 26 with PD and 22 Controls. The instruments used were: The Mini Exam of Mental State, The My Body Image Test, The Factorial Self-concept Test, The Beck Depression Inventory, the motor section of The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale and The Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale.
