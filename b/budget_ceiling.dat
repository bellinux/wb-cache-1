In this regard, it addresses three issues: (1) why reforms took place, (2) the main actors and coalitions driving this process and the institutional mechanisms at work and (3) the main outcomes of reform processes. In order to analyse the development of LTC policies, the article applies theoretical concepts of historical institutionalism. Our interpretation is that institutional change in LTC policy has taken place through a protracted institutional dynamic in which continuity and discontinuity are inextricably linked and where tensions and contradictions have played a crucial role. With regard to outcomes, the article analyses coverage and citizens’ social rights, working conditions in the care sector and trajectories of de-/re-familization of care. The final impact is that the level of universalism has generally increased in Europe, but that in part it has adopted a new form of ‘restricted universalism’, characterized by universal entitlements to LTC benefits constrained by limitations in provision due to financial constraints and <b>budget</b> <b>ceilings...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a politico-economic {{analysis of the}} European Union’s (EU) R&D policy. It develops an open-economy R&D-growth model characterized by two parameters that capture respectively the degree of technology spillover {{and the effectiveness of}} lobbying. In a non-cooperative equilibrium, each country chooses the level of R&D subsidy independently and fails to internalize technology spillover. Consequently, R&D subsidy is underprovided. In an economic union, the central government internalizes technology spillover but is vulnerable to lobbying by politicians from each country, who attempt to free-ride on the central government budget. Consequently, R&D subsidy is overprovided; however, this overprovision becomes less severe as the degree of technology spillover increases. Therefore, technology spillover has a surprisingly positive effect on welfare in an economic union. As for the effect on relative welfare, there is a cutoff value for the degree of technology spillover such that if and only if spillover is above this threshold, then an economic union dominates independent countries in welfare. Furthermore, this threshold is an increasing function in the effectiveness of lobbying. This paper also considers the possibility that the EU faces a binding <b>budget</b> <b>ceiling.</b> In this case, lobbying on R&D subsidy exerts a distortionary effect on revenue allocation, and hence a welfare loss continues to exist...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{having the}} second largest {{population}} of people over age 60, India has yet to generate an effective national framework for confronting the exigencies of later life, especially those that are derived from a lifetime of poverty. This article demonstrates that this {{lack of interest in}} 'past' generations is driven by the unfortunate coincidence of externally endorsed concerns and concepts, and internal politics. Foundational assumptions on the economy and development and on old-age capacities and inter-generational relations, push for evidence collation which disincentivises more empirically relevant analyses, creating the fiction of dependency ratios and inhibiting the generation of evidence-based knowledge on later life. The consequence is that India prioitises current and future generations over ‘past’ generations. Policies on older people, who are treated as 'other' at international and national levels, are tied to competition for votes at national and state elections. Currently, policy is not designed around the concept of older people’s rights, nor of meeting need. The first outcome of external and internal drivers is that national and state governments are not interested in, nor know, how many older people qualify for a pension; instead they fix <b>budget</b> <b>ceilings</b> and, at a local level, allocate and manage pensions in a random fashion. The second outcome is that pension values are allowed to wither on the vine, waiting on the political context in which one or more parties places a pension uplift at the centre of their manifesto...|$|R

However, {{it should be noted that}} no limits were set on expenditures under the rural development envelope, which can be expanded in parallel with the reform process. Comment: The Summit agreement limited the expansion of expenditures under the first pillar of the CAP to 1 % per annum above the 2006 level for the period from 2006 to 2013. However it should be noted that these limits do not include expenditures under the second pillar (rural development), for which no ceilings have been established. The European Commission has already announced its intention of increasing expenditures under the second pillar from 10 % to 20 % of CAP expenditures over the coming period The removal of rural development expenditures from the total agricultural budget to which the new ceilings on expenditures on market-support measures apply, would appear to provide additional scope for an increase in market-support measures, since 10 % of current expenditures are devoted to rural development. In addition the budget saving made on export refunds in recent years as a result of changes in the €/US$ exchange rate provide additional scope for an increase in expenditures on market support measures over the 2006 - 2013 period.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2006, {{researchers}} and decision-makers launched a five-year project - Response to Accountable Priority Setting for Trust in Health Systems (REACT) - to improve planning and priority-setting through implementing the Accountability for Reasonableness framework in Mbarali District, Tanzania. The {{objective of this}} paper is to explore the acceptability of Accountability for Reasonableness from the perspectives of the Council Health Management Team, local government officials, health workforce and members of user boards and committees. Methods Individual interviews were carried out with different categories of actors and stakeholders in the district. The interview guide consisted of a series of questions, asking respondents to describe their perceptions regarding each condition of the Accountability for Reasonableness framework in terms of priority setting. Interviews were analysed using thematic framework analysis. Documentary data were used to support, verify and highlight the key issues that emerged. Results Almost all stakeholders viewed Accountability for Reasonableness as an important and feasible approach for improving priority-setting and health service delivery in their context. However, a few aspects of Accountability for Reasonableness were seen as too difficult to implement given the socio-political conditions and traditions in Tanzania. Respondents mentioned: <b>budget</b> <b>ceilings</b> and guidelines, low level of public awareness, unreliable and untimely funding, as well as the limited capacity of the district to generate local resources as the major contextual factors that hampered the full implementation of the framework in their context. Conclusion This study was one of the first assessments of the applicability of Accountability for Reasonableness in health care priority-setting in Tanzania. The analysis, overall, suggests that the Accountability for Reasonableness framework could be an important tool for improving priority-setting processes in the contexts of resource-poor settings.

By implementing scoring system it is hoped that the principles will be realized in the government goods/services procurement. The set of problems in this research is the minimum use of Scoring System (Scrutinizing List and Passing Grade) in the Goods/Services bid. This leads to the many findings of less-than-minimum-score projects in Temanggung Regency by the Auditing Team. The object being researched is the goods and services auction of <b>budget</b> <b>ceiling</b> below five billion rupiahs. The objectives of the research are: 1) to analyze the difference between elimination system and scoring system in a bid evaluation, 2) to determine the factor most dominantly affecting passing grade and scrutinizing list within the process of choosing the winner for the contracting work, using AHP method, 3) to validate the analysis result {{with the help of the}} stakeholders of the goods/services procurement in Temanggung Regency. The methods used are qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative method is used to relatively measure the factors affecting passing grade and the scrutinizing list from the primary data. On the other hand, the quantitative method is used to analyze the secondary data and the bid documents. The combination of the two methods is used to validate the research result. The result shows that the elimination and scoring systems are different in terms of time, cost evaluation, evaluation result, detail of qualifications, accuracy in choosing the service provider, result of contract work, participants selection, process of determining the winner of the contract work, number of case found by auditors, basic guidelines in conducting the project, opinions of the service providers, opinions of the budget user, opinions of the project leader, and opinions of the contract work committee about the two systems, and evaluation limitations. Factors obtaining the lowest average of likert scale (2) are detail of qualification, accuracy in choosing the service provider, number of case found by auditors, opinions of the service providers, opinions of the budget users, opinions of the project leader, and opinions of the contract work committee about the two systems, and evaluation limitations. One factor has the highest average of likert scale (4), that is evaluation cost. Secondly, the research result shows that the most dominant factor affecting passing grade is the financial one (55, 1 %). The data validation tells that the scoring system stresses the importance on the company‟s financial strength, experience, the number of minimum expert personnel employed and the number of minimum work tools owned by the goods/service providers. This research concludes that 1) the characteristic difference between elimination system and scoring system is that scoring system proves to give better impact towards the bidding process and the contract working, 2) the dominant factors affecting passing grade and scrutinizing list are finance (55, 1 %), technical (18, 4 %), administrative (6, 7 %), interest statement (6, 7 %), pact of integrity (6, 5 %), and qualification (6, 7 %). Data validation shows that there are still abuses on the contract work. The research suggestions are 1) the application of scoring system requires further validation on what is written on the document and what are found in real possession of the company attending the contract bid, 2) the company‟s experience in conducting contract work, not merely administrative matters, should also be considered as an important factor in determining the winner of the contract work, 3) the theses succeeding this one should focus on the application of bid evaluation method using Built Operator Transfer System (BOT).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rationale for}} a top-down approach to budget preparation and approval, and discusses some factors {{that have to be}} considered when reorienting the budget process along these lines. The paper argues that the sequence in which budgetary decisions are taken matters, and that a strong top-down approach strengthens fiscal discipline and improves policy prioritization and coordination. Top-down budgeting also alters the division of roles and responsibilities between the central budget authority and line ministries, and requires that the process of determining the total expenditure level, sectoral allocations and individual appropriations is clarified. Finally, the paper argues that strong top-down elements in the parliamentary budget voting process can be effective in addressing the risk of excessive and unsustainable amendments during budget approval.

The buildings cover {{a wide range of}} functions from the residential to the commercial to the utilitarian, some highly contests some almost ignored and one invisible. All artists and the writers are asked to respond with proposals and interventions for any of the buildings and asked to consider the position of these buildings today, part of a much loved landscape or irrelevant, robbed of their utopian ideals. Their uncompromising exteriors and utilitarian solutions leave them often exposed in a new architecture of facades. The publication encouraged a speculative approach to the solutions – <b>budgets</b> are without <b>ceiling,</b> building regulations hold no barriers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2006, {{researchers}} and decision-makers launched a five year project, Response to Accountable Priority Setting for Trust in Health Systems (REACT) to improve planning and priority setting through implementing the Accountability for Reasonableness framework in Mbarali District in Tanzania. The {{objective of this}} paper is to explore the acceptability of Accountability for Reasonableness from perspectives of the Council Health Management Team, local government officials, health workforce and members of user boards and committees. METHODS: Individual interviews were carried out with different categories of actors and stakeholders in the district. The interview guide consisted of a series of questions asking respondents to describe their perceptions regarding the applicability and feasibility of each condition of the Accountability for Reasonableness framework to priority setting. Interviews were analysed using thematic framework analysis. Documentary data was used to support, verify and highlight key issues that emerged. RESULTS: Almost all stakeholders viewed Accountability for Reasonableness as an important and feasible approach for improving priority setting and health service delivery in their context. However, a few aspects of the Accountability for Reasonableness framework were seen as difficult to implement given the socio-political conditions and traditions in Tanzania. Respondents mentioned <b>budget</b> <b>ceilings</b> and guidelines, low level of public awareness, unreliable and untimely funding as well as limited capacity of the district to generate local resources as the major contextual factors that hamper the full implementation of the framework in their context. CONCLUSION: This study was one of the first assessments of the applicability of Accountability for Reasonableness in health care priority setting in Tanzania. The analysis, overall, suggests that the Accountability for Reasonableness framework could be an important tool for improving priority-setting process in the contexts of resource poor settings. However, the full implementation of Accountability for Reasonableness framework would require a proper capacity-building plan to all relevant stakeholders, particularly members of the community since public accountability is the ultimate aim, and it is the public that will live with the consequences of priority setting decisions. This paper is part of a larger study of the European Union's funded REACT project which is testing the applicability of the Accountability for Reasonableness approach to priority setting in Mbarali District in Tanzania. Other data came from a study conducted by the first author as part of his PhD research project on Priority Setting in Health Care Institutions.
