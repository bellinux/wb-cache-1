Ultrasound measures of longissimus muscle depth (LMD) and intramuscular fat (IMF) of Angus × heifers were used to predict lifetime cow productivity. IMF and LMD were categorized into high, medium, and low groups (IMFG and LMDG, respectively). Cows in the high and medium LMDG had greater (P 0. 05) effects on pregnancy rates and <b>performance</b> of <b>beef</b> cows and calves. Lactating crossbred cows with calves and non-pregnant, non-lactating Boer-cross nannies were {{used to evaluate the}} effects of co-grazing on herbivory patterns and animal performance while grazing native tallgrass rangeland infested heavily by sericea lespedeza (SL). The proportion of individual SL plants that had been grazed {{at the end of the}} trial was greater (P < 0. 01) in co-grazed pastures than in single-species pastures. Grazing cows and goats in combination increased (P < 0. 01) grazing pressure on SL without negatively affecting <b>beef</b> cow <b>performance,</b> <b>beef</b> calf <b>performance,</b> or residual forage biomass. Angus × cows and heifers grazing native range were used to evaluate the effects of pre-partum corn steep liquor supplementation on postpartum beef cow and calf performance.

The animals were assigned into three groups (A, B, C) based on age at slaughter. Group A consisted of 68 animals with the age at slaughter 15 – 21 months, group B 296 animals, age 22 – 28 months and group C 116 animals, age 29 – 35 months. A greater age at slaughter was significantly associated with a greater carcass weight which grew from 250. 78 [*]kg in group A to 317. 69 [*]kg in group C. The net weight gain decreased with age from 424. 06 [*]g in group A to 346. 41 [*]g in group C, the conformation improved from 4. 46 in group A to 4. 17 in group C and the external fat deposition increased from 2. 5 in group A to 2. 78 in group C.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{movement}} toward developing production and marketing alliances in the beef cattle sector in the United States to improve communications and ultimately provide higher priced branded products consistent with consumer demand. Beef cattle producers do not employ a consistent methodology to measure the financial performance of alliance participation. Nor {{do they have the}} information to negotiate financially sustainable agreements. The concentrated packer and retail sector do not share cost and returns information beyond total business data required by public traded corporations. A methodology using cost accounting and economic analysis is described to measure return on producer’s assets for an alliance agreement. This information can be used to inform the margin sectors, feedyards, packers and retailers on what share of increased revenue from branded product sales to pass to the cow-calf segment to make participation competitive and the alliance financially sustainable. The cow-calf segment must absorb the added costs and cyclical financial loss to participate in alliances. Increased revenue is required to make branded products a more profitable marketing option than producing commodity beef.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the genetic-environment interactions for certain live and carcass traits in beef cattle by determining if sires rank the same in growth and carcass traits with respect to their bull and steer progeny. The differences between bulls and steers represent a different physiological environment in which genotypes develop. An analysis of sire and sex differences and their interaction provides an estimate of one type of genetic-environment interaction for <b>beef</b> <b>performance</b> traits. The data used in this study were collected during 1963, 1964, and 1965. One hundred fifty-two male calves from the University of Nebraska Angus beef breeding herd were used in this experiment. One or two bull calves from each sire were designated as herd sire prospects and were fed as bulls. At weaning time all other calves were allotted at random to two slaughter-sex groups. The calves to be fed as steers were castrated within a few days after weaning. The two slaughter dates used were approximately forty-two days apart and were designated as early and late slaughter groups. Two slaughter dates were used to evaluate the effect of the length of the feeding period on the traits studied. Final selection of herd sires was made from the group of herd sire prospects near the end of the feeding period.

40|$|Thirty {{years of}} {{research}} involving phosphorus (P) fertiliser rates (0, 15 and 30 kg/ha/yr) on pastures has been completed. <b>Beef</b> <b>performance</b> on pasture at relatively low and high stocking rates was determined by weighing beef animals (mean wt = 260 kg) {{at the beginning and}} end of each grazing season for 18 years. Soil samples were taken at various times and at various depths. Live weight gain (LWG) was greatest at the high stocking rate (HSR) compared to the low stocking rate (LSR). LWG maximised at 15 kg P/ha. Maximum beef production took place with a soil test of 6 mg P/l using the Morgan’s procedure. Most of the soil P and fertiliser P, as measured by both the Morgan’s and Total P procedures, were in the top 10 cm. However, a significant portion moved below that to the 10 - 20 cm layer, as determined by both Total and Morgan’s P in both P treatments. Soil P and fertiliser P as determined by the Morgan’s procedure moved into the 20 - 40 cm layer but no lower. Work done on the 30 kg/ha P treatment and on another site at Johnstown Castle showed that significant amounts of P moved off the plot with water in overland flow and the loss was related to the soil test (Morgan’s) for P. The amount of P lost per unit of Morgan’s was calculated to be 175 g with a Morgan’s soil test of 4 mg P/l and 281 g with a soil test of 17 mg P/l. A mass balance procedure was attempted for the 30 years’ work to determine how much P was exported in beef, lost in overland flow or retained in the soil. This showed that fertilising beyond 15 kg/ha gave no increase in beef production and that the extra P was found in the soil, or lost in overland flow. When 15 kg P/ha was applied annually for 30 years it was estimated that 20 % and 4 % of P applied was removed in beef or lost in overland flow, respectively. It was calculated that 76 % of the P applied stayed in the soil. End of Project Repor...|$|E

Crossbreeding is promoted and implemented throughout the country, regardless of the various agro-ecological zones, each endowed with different feed resources in the smallholder farming systems. This study analyses the impact at farm level of crossbreeding in the different mixed farming conditions in Central Java. Quantitative and qualitative information was collected through participatory approaches involving famers (n = 252) in four study areas representing three agro-ecological zones: Wet lowlands (subdivided in two areas based on the history of breeding local cattle and crossbreeding), Wet uplands and Dry uplands. Phenotypic characteristics, reproductive performances, and carcass characteristics of Ongole and crossbred cattle were assessed, together with farmers’ reasons for keeping Ongole or crossbred breeding stock, the functions of cattle on the farms and the Gross Margins (GM) of the cattle component on Ongole and crossbred farms. Across different agro-ecological zones, crossbreeding is not changing the farming systems: herd sizes, farm types, experience in cattle keeping and functions of cattle were about the same for Ongole and crossbred farms. The agro-ecological zones differed in the cropping pattern and feed resources; however, they did not differ in amounts of dry matter and crude protein fed to individual animals. Crossbreeding is changing the individual characteristics of cattle and consequently the market prices of animals. In general, mature female crossbred cattle were approximately 25 percent heavier than mature female local cattle. Male crossbred progeny was 16 percent heavier their local counterparts, whereas female crossbred progeny was 24 percent heavier than female local cattle. In terms of reproduction performances, both local and crossbred cows performed well with calf crops ranging between 73 and 86 percent per year. Most farmers preferred crossbred over Ongole cattle. Simmental cross is the most preferred. GM for crossbred and Ongole farms were comparable within the different study areas; selling prices of crossbreds are higher, but feed costs too. Crossbreeding will continue. It is promoted by government policies and farmers are motivated to keep crossbred cattle as body weights and market prices are higher than for Ongole cattle; however, farmers said that they do not prefer upgrading to very high levels of Simmental.

Experiment 1 evaluated the effectiveness of grazing stockpiled and swathed annual ryegrass as backgrounding systems on forage quality and <b>beef</b> stocker cattle <b>performance.</b> Results of experiment 1 suggest grazing stockpiled and swathed annual ryegrass may be viable backgrounding systems; however, forage maturity and winter weather conditions may reduce forage quality and accessibility to levels that can limit stocker cattle performance. Experiment 2 evaluated the effects of reproductive status (spayed vs. intact heifers supplemented with melengestrol acetate) and terminal implant strategy (moderate vs. aggressive) on <b>beef</b> feedlot heifer <b>performance</b> during backgrounding and finishing phases and on carcass characteristics. Results of experiment 2 suggest intact heifers supplemented with melengestrol acetate had greater performance during backgrounding; however, use of moderate or aggressive terminal implant strategies may allow similar performance during finishing and comparable carcass characteristics between spayed and intact beef feedlot heifers. Experiment 3 evaluated the effects of partially replacing dry-rolled corn in traditional corn-based finishing diets with either 35 % conventional dried distillers grains plus solubles or 35 % high protein dried distillers grains on <b>beef</b> steer feedlot <b>performance</b> and carcass characteristics. Results of experiment 3 suggest that although overall feed intake tended to be reduced, high protein dried distillers grains may successfully replace conventional dried distillers grains plus solubles or up to 35 % of dry-rolled corn in finishing beef cattle diets. Experiment 4 evaluated effects of supplemental manganese in high-sulfur feedlot diets containing dried distillers grains plus solubles on in vitro and in vivo ruminal fermentation and hydrogen sulfide gas production. In vitro results of experiment 4 suggest that 1, 000 ppm manganese in high-sulfur diets appeared to release less total hydrogen sulfide gas than 0 or 500 ppm manganese; whereas in vivo results suggest beef steers consuming 1, 000 ppm manganese may have a less acidic ruminal environment prior to feeding {{to result in a}} tendency for reduced average ruminal hydrogen sulfide concentration...|$|R

The aim of this bachelor thesis was to analyse <b>beef</b> <b>performance</b> of fattening beef breeds, specifically crossbreds of charolais and piemontese breed, where asconditions under which fattening happened were same. The evaluation of chosen performance traits was carried out on 44 crossbreds from Old Town farm located near city of Frýdek-Místek. Groups of bulls were created according to the breed and year of slaughter. The slaughter age, live weight, carcass weight, net gain, average daily gain, and SEUROP system classification into meatiness and fat cover classes. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel and StatsoftStatistica. T-test {{was used to assess}} significance of differences. The slaughter weight of charolais crossbreds was 636. 97 (slaughter age 728. 91 days), with piemontese crossbreds 639. 17 kg (slaughter age 736. 52 days). Minimal difference was found at carcass weight (357. 85 kg in charolais, 359. 08 kg in piemontese respectively). Average daily gains were also balanced 818. 61 g (charolais) and 814. 86 g (piemontese). Net gain difference was also low, net gain of charolais crossbreds was 490. 74 g per day respectively 488. 31 g per day within group of piemontese crossbreds. Differences between breeds were not statistically significant. The difference between slaughter year (2013 and 2014) was also assessed but it was not significant too. Carcass classification according to SEUROP system was in case of charolais crossbreds most often in class R (75 %), while piemontese crossbreds were mostly classified into class R (54. 55 %) and U (45. 45 %) in 2013.

The aim was to maximise pasture growth rate and animal liveweight gains in late-autumn in order to winter heavier bulls at higher pasture covers than the traditional Tuapaka grazing system. Wintering heavier bulls at the target pasture cover (1800 - 2000 kg DM/ha) the winter grazing management would focus on maintaining pasture cover around 2000 kg DM/ha throughout the winter in order to reach early-spring with an average pasture cover around 1700 - 1800 kg DM/ha. This way the grazing management in this period would again target sward conditions for high net pasture accumulation and liveweight gains. The trial was conducted at the Tuapaka bull unit, Massey University, from 1 April to 30 September 1997. It compared three contrasting managements, involving a total of 165 bulls stocked at 2. 6 bull/ha. Treatment I followed a predetermined grazing plan based on a predicted the average pasture growth rate, the animal requirements needed to achieve performance targets, and on pre- and post-grazing pasture mass targets (2700 - 2800 kg DM/ha and 1500 - 1600 kg DM/ha for late-autumn and early-spring, and 3000 - 3200 kg DM/ha and 1100 - 1200 kg DM/ha for winter). Treatment 2 was managed according to the same pre- and post-grazing targets, except in this case post-grazing covers were monitored daily, and the bulls shifted when the post-grazing targets were achieved. No supplement was considered for Treatments 1 and 2. Treatment 3 followed traditional Tuapaka management, based on 50 day rotation over the autumn and winter, and 30 day rotation in August and bulls set stocked in September. Hay was fed as required in winter at the rate of 120. 6 kg DM (pasture equivalent) per hectare. The initial pasture cover and bulls liveweight did not differ between treatments. Results showed a significant difference in average pasture cover (P < 0. 1) over the autumn, although no difference was found in pre and post-grazing cover, apparent daily dry matter intake, and net herbage accumulation. Over the winter, Treatments 1 and 2 pasture cover did not differ, and both were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than Treatment 3. Pre-grazing cover was significantly (P < 0. 01) different between all treatments, while there was no difference between Treatments 1 and 3 in post-grazing cover and apparent daily dry matter intake, and both were lower (P < 0. 001) than Treatment 2. Net pasture accumulation of Treatment 1 did not differ from Treatments 2 and 3, however there was a significant difference (P < 0. 05) between these two last ones. In early-spring, Treatments 1 and 2 pasture cover and post grazing cover did not differ and were higher (P < 0. 001) than Treatment 3. Pre-grazing pasture cover was different (P < 0. 01) between all treatments. Net pasture accumulation of Treatments 1 and 2 did not differ and both were higher (P < 0. 05) than Treatment 3, while the average apparent dry matter intake of Treatments 1 and 3 were similar and both were different (P < 0. 05) from Treatment 2. The overall liveweight gain (0 84 ± 0. 02, 0. 87 ± 0. 02, 0. 74 ± 0. 01 kg LW/head/day for Treatments 1, 2, 3 respectively) and liveweight (354. 7 ± 3. 54, 359. 8 ± 3. 65, 335. 6 ± 3. 27 kg LW) did not differ between Treatments 1 and 2 but both were significantly (P < 0. 001) different from Treatment 3. Total pasture production was significantly different (P < 0. 10) between Treatment 1 (6147 kg ± 369. 34 DM/ha), Treatment 2 (7062 kg ± 319. 86 DM/ha), and Treatment 3 (5277 ± 334. 08 kg DM/ha). The total pasture production of Treatments 1 and 2 were 16 and 30 % higher than Treatment 3. The extra pasture production per 100 kg DM/ha of increase in pasture cover was 1. 64 and 3. 38 kg DM/ha/day for Treatments 1 and 2 respectively. It was concluded that it is possible to improve both pasture production and bull <b>beef</b> <b>performance</b> when grazing management is based on pre and post-grazing pasture targets, and the practical implications of this were discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} program was developed at Utah State University (USU) {{to aid in}} obtaining a more complete individual performance record keeping system for beef cattle in Utah. Some {{computer program}}s for beef cattle records presently exist but a program was needed that was readily available to the USU animal science extension and resident staff. The program was written in FORTRAN for use on the Burrogh 6700 computer located at the Utah State University Computer Center. It was designed to read input data for individual animals, perform various calculations (i. e. days of age, adjusted weaning weight and weaning weight ratio), print out the input data and results of the calculations for each animal {{as well as the}} average adjusted weight for each sex group (heifer, bull, steer). The computer program will manipulate weights in either the English or metric system and will convert weights from the English to metric system if desired. A unique feature of the program is the ranking of animals from highest to lowest based on the weaning weight ratio with accompanying animal number. The records can be evaluated to identify potential animals to use as replacements and those to be culled. The input data are collected on the ranch by a cooperative arrangement between the ranch operator and the USU Extension Staff. The ranch operator collects the preliminary data such as: birth date, tag number, tattoo number, dam, age of dam, and sire, and records it on the <b>beef</b> cattle <b>performance</b> input record. The extension specialist weights, gives a conformation score and records the information for each calf on the input record. The <b>beef</b> cattle <b>performance</b> input record is arranged in the same order as the data card is key punched thus facilitating the punching of the data cards. The staff can change from using the desk calculator {{to the use of the}} computer to improve efficiency and flexibility output as well as having more time available to spend with the public teaching that maintaining accurate records can help improve their herds for production and for inventory control. This can help the beef cattle industry to improve quality and type of beef animal produced in Utah and should improve the potential efficiency and profit. The rancher can transfer his records, with minor modifications, to one of the existing national computer programming organizations if desired. This computer program with or without modification has application for current research and university teaching. The computer program was designated for use with beef cattle, but could be modified to use for any class of livestock. This program is not an end in itself but is a foundation from which to build an improved record keeping system in Utah which could improve the production and quality of the beef cattle industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{importance}} of a producer’s market orientation on their subjective performance within agricultural commodity markets. Using a structural equation model of beef producers, our findings suggest that market oriented firms are highly innovative and achieve superior performance. These findings are consistent with previous research on the market orientation-performance relationship in heterogeneous product markets. The cost focus of a firm was also found to have a significant influence on innovation, but no direct effect on performance. This suggests that beef producers should follow a balanced approach utilizing both an external market and an internal productivity focus to achieve superior returns as opposed to solely focusing on internal productivity as many producers currently do. market orientation, <b>beef</b> production, innovation, <b>performance,</b> Marketing, Productivity Analysis, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Q 10, Q 13, Q 16,...|$|R
