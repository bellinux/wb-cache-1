5000|$|The SpeedLoader bridges {{differ from}} the {{original}} 1977 bridges in that the procedure for changing strings has been made easier. The original string replacement procedure involved cutting the <b>ball-end</b> from a new guitar string, [...] "locking" [...] the freshly cut end into the bridge using an Allen wrench, winding and rough tuning the string by using the machine heads, locking the string at the nut (the second lock of the double-locking system), and finally tuning it utilizing the fine tuners. When old strings are replaced with new strings, the tension provided on the floating bridge becomes slightly different, meaning that adjusting the tuning of one string with its machine head will undoubtedly alter the tuning of the other strings. During the process of rough tuning a Floyd Rose equipped guitar, the locking nut is usually left unlocked throughout the entire string replacement procedure, which facilitates adjusting the tuning of all the strings using the machine heads.|$|E
5000|$|Joan Michaël Fleischman (1701 - 1768) {{was born}} in Nürnberg where he trained as a punchcutter. He found {{employment}} with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728.

Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design - related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and <b>ball-ends.</b> Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean’s and Louis Simonneau’s [...] "Romain du Roi," [...] commissioned by Louis XIV in 1692 for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of E F L T and Z, all characteristics prefiguring the [...] "classical" [...] moderns of Bodoni and Didot.

50|$|In 2003, {{the patent}} for the Original Floyd Rose tremolo expired. This {{coincided with the}} release of a newly {{designed}} pair of Tremolos from Ibanez, the Edge Pro and the Edge Pro II. Ibanez mistakenly figured that all the Floyd Rose patents were available for use; however, the patent on the Low Profile design was still in effect. This prompted the Edge Pro II's replacement with Edge III which fits into the parameters of the original patent and is therefore not subject to a license fee. The Edge Pro and Edge Pro II differ from the original Edge, as they are able to accept strings with the <b>ball-ends</b> still attached, and have no locking studs. Due to the lack of locking studs, the tremolo is in some ways inferior to the models it replaces; however, the lower profile design and ergonomic improvements mean this distinction is not clear cut. The Original and Lo-Pro Edge are still produced and are available through Ibanez Parts dealers. Positioned as top of the line locking tremolo systems, the Original and Lo-Pro Edge are among the most expensive pieces of guitar hardware in mass production, with a unit cost higher than the Floyd Rose Original and the Schaller Floyd Rose, and indeed more expensive than even a number of Ibanez guitars (including ones with lower-tier locking tremolos). The Original Edge is still being used by Ibanez for certain RG series reissues, and all 2010 Ibanez JEM and JS series guitars.|$|R

Very few attempts have been done so far to address issues in the <b>ball-end</b> milling of thin cantilever-shaped parts made of "difficult-to-machine" materials.
