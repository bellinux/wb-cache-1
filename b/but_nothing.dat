When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon.

5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> was to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E

So then, when he saith, 'he showed me a pure river of water of life,' {{it is as if}} he had said he showed me a river of water that was all living, all life, and had <b>nothing</b> in it <b>but</b> life. There was no death, or deadness, or flatness in it; or, as he saith a little after, 'and there shall be no more curse.' A pure river. There is {{not so much as a}} grudge, or a piece of an upbraiding speech found therein. There is in it <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> heart, <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> love, <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> grace, <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> life.

Also under consideration is {{the creation of a new}} statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous.

5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup.
