5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E

At the election the Labor Party increased its margin by 5 seats, leaving a comfortable majority in the new parliament, although its success was attributed to the unpopularity at the time of Sir Robert Menzies' federal Liberal government following the 1961 credit squeeze.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 8746 This thesis {{provides}} an empirical investigation of how <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier teams {{make sense of}} collaboration. Specifically, this thesis explores how <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier parties interpret collaboration and how their interpretations of collaboration evolve over time. In addition, it considers the actions that accompany <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier parties? interpretations of collaboration and how these actions link to interpretations. Taking a sensemaking making perspective, this thesis considers collaboration as an interpretative process. The forces which mediate the interpretations of collaboration in this <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier context are also explored. Consistent with the interpretivist approach underpinning this thesis, a process approach is adopted, using a qualitative multiple case study design. A comparative cross-case analysis of four <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> four supplier teams is undertaken to address the research questions in this study...|$|R

5|$|The Marwari or Malani {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all equine colours, {{although}} pinto patterns {{tend to be the}} most popular with <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> breeders. It is known for its hardiness, and is quite similar to the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence.|$|E

Much of the work involved liaising with foreign <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> delegations, and he accompanied the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on visits to the annual fair. In 1956 the government withdrew its funding and the BIF closed. Horne received several attractive job offers, and chose the post of chairman and managing director of the toy manufacturers Chad Valley, where he was a success. In September that year he and Murdoch appeared in a one-off television programme Show for the Telly.|$|E

We present a set of plausible conditions under which the equilibrium welfare of both the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier is higher when quality is verifiable than when it is unverifiable. The welfare gain for the privately informed supplier arises even when the buyer has all the bargaining power. Thus, the interests of the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier coincide with regard to whether delivered quality should be made verifiable. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a middleman on the search and trading behavior of the traders. It is shown that the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> seller types with middle valuations choose to search for each other, while the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> seller types with high or low valuations drop out of the search market and choose to trade directly with the middleman. The ask and bid prices of the middleman act as an outside option for the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> seller, and influence the outcome of the bargaining between the two. The model generalizes Gehrig (1993) by endogenizing the traders' search intensities, by allowing the traders to go to an intermediary even if thy have engaged in search, and by enabling the intermediary to provide the service of immediacy.
