5|$|Stephen {{forced his}} father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary {{to the east of}} the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son, because Stephen accused Béla of {{planning}} to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{comprehensively}} plundered {{the eastern}} territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, including Transylvania, during both their invasion in 1241 and their withdrawal the following year. The {{consolidation of the}} province was the main task of Lawrence of the Aba clan, who was appointed by Béla IV and held the office for 10 years from 1242. One of his successors, also appointed by Béla IV, banus Ernye of the Ákos clan, was dismissed in 1260 by the king's son, Stephen who had just taken over Transylvania with the title of duke. The duke's action showed emerging tensions <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son, rather than conflicts between the duke and the banus.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son remained tense.

Béla's army under the command of Princess Anna crossed the Danube in the summer of 1264. She occupied Sárospatak and captured Stephen's wife and children. A detachment of the royal army, under the command of Béla's Judge royal Lawrence forced Stephen to retreat as far as the fortress at Feketehalom (Codlea, Romania) in the easternmost corner of Transylvania. The king-junior's partisans relieved the castle and he started a counter-attack in the autumn. In the decisive Battle of Isaszeg, he routed his father's army in March 1265.|$|E

It led to a breach <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son, and between the brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692.

Then it shows her thinking about her father, played by Danny Aiello, {{and how much he}} loves her. She then sees her boyfriend, played by actor Alex McArthur, coming along. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio. Madonna then moves away from her friends, who warn her from her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend spend a romantic evening together on a barge where they reflect upon their lives after watching an elderly couple. Then Madonna finds out that she is pregnant and after much hesitation tells her father. They have a few hours of tension between them. Her father eventually accepts the pregnancy, and the final scene is a reconciliatory embrace <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> daughter.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconciliation}} of Stephen {{and his father}} was only temporary. Stephen confiscated the domains {{of his mother and}} sister, Annaincluding Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzérwhich were located in the lands under his rule. Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264. She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children. Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania. Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania). King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived {{at the head of a}} new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania). The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it. Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat. He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265. The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country. Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the intergenerational income elasticity for four differently related groups. The results are IGE’s of 0. 1368 <b>between</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> sons, 0. 1734 <b>between</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> daughters, 0. 2076 between mothers and sons and 0. 2217 between mothers and daughters. These results are compared to previous studies {{and found to}} be significantly lower. Possible explanations are the simple passing of time between studies, the financial recession of 2008, and short-run data availability in the dataset. This study includes many control variables to find explanations of the IGE. The level of schooling is of sole importance and explains up to 49 percent of the IGE for <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> around 33 percent of the IGE for mothers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} on intergenerational mobility in the United States in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. We devise an empirical strategy that allows to calculate intergenerational elasticities <b>between</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children of both sexes. The key insight of our approach is that the information about socio-economic status conveyed by first names can be used to create a pseudo-link not only <b>between</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> sons, but also <b>between</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> daughters. The latter is typically not possible with historical data. We find that the father-son elasticity in economic status grows throughout the sample period. Intergenerational elasticities for daughters follow a broadly similar trend, but with some differences in timing. We argue that most of the increase in the intergenerational elasticity estimate {{in the early part of}} the 20 th Century can be accounted for by the vast regional disparities in economic development, with increasing returns to human capital contributing to explain the residual. Other mechanisms such as changes in fertility, migration, and investment in public schooling, appear to have had only a minor role in explaining the trends...|$|R

5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud <b>between</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

40|$|Shared {{decision}} making between {{children and parents}} is required in orthodontics. This study compared agreement among mothers, <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> children regarding the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children. A sample of 71 child patients (41 girls and 30 boys) aged 12. 6 years with an orthodontic treatment need, together with both their parents completed components of the child OHRQoL measure. Agreement among children, mothers, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> {{was derived from the}} 31 analogous questions and assessed using comparison and correlation analyses. Comparison analyses identified significant differences between mother's and children's reports <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports. The magnitude of the difference between mother's and children's reports, <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports could best be described as moderate (standard difference > 0. 2). In addition, absolute differences in scores constituted between 12 and 18 per cent of domain and overall scores for both mother's <b>and</b> children's, <b>and</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports. Correlation analysis, at the individual family unit level, showed that agreement between mothers <b>and</b> children, <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children was fair [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) < 0. 04]. Neither mothers nor fathers know their child's oral health status very well, as there was significant disagreement between mothers', fathers', and children's perceptions. The disagreement between mothers <b>and</b> children, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children was similar. While at the group level, mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> tended to agree on perception of their children's oral health status, at an individual family unit level they did not. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
