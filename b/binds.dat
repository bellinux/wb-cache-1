5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also <b>binds</b> to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently <b>binds</b> to hemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it <b>binds.</b> The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope <b>binds</b> to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region <b>binds</b> to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFormation of chiral amyloid {{superstructures}} is a newly recognised phenomenon observed upon agitation-assisted fibrillation of bovine insulin. Here, by surveying several amyloidogenic precursors {{we examine}} whether formation of such entities {{is unique to}} bovine insulin. Our results indicate that only bovine, human, and porcine insulins are capable of chiral superstructural self-assembly. A tiny covalent perturbation consisting in reversal of ProB 28 -LysB 29 residues in a human insulin analog is sufficient to prevent this process. Our study suggests that insulin’s dimer-forming interface – specifically the B-chain’s C-terminal fragment – may acquire the new role of a molecular velcro upon lateral alignment of individual fibrils into superstructures.

5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which <b>binds</b> the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that <b>binds</b> F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E
