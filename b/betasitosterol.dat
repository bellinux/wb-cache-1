40|$|<b>Betasitosterol</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} phytoconstituents in cornsilk (style and stigma of Zea mays Linn.). This study is an attempt to {{standardize}} cornsilk as a bioavailable source of <b>Betasitosterol</b> and it reports the pharmacokinetic evaluation of slurry of cornsilk using HPTLC. The study was conducted on male albino rabbits of New Zealand strain. Blood samples were collected at different time intervals following a single oral administration of cornsilk slurry in water (1 g kg - 1 b. wt.). Absorption and elimination of <b>Betasitosterol</b> after ingestion of cornsilk was monitored using changes in the concentration of the marker band in the HPTLC profile. A marker of cornsilk at R F 0. 48, identified as <b>Betasitosterol,</b> is detected in rabbit plasma after 1 h of ingestion of the slurry. The marker reaches maximum concentration at 2. 5 h post dose and is not detectable in plasma after 24 h. By applying Wagner-Nelson method, it can be deduced that over a 24 h period 32 % of <b>Betasitosterol</b> is absorbed when administered in rabbits in the form of slurry of powdered cornsilk. The pharmacokinetic parameters generated, confirm significant bioavailability of <b>Betasitosterol</b> from cornsilk and the potential use of cornsilk as a natural source of <b>Betasitosterol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Faecal steroid excretion, {{including}} <b>betasitosterol</b> excretion, whole-body cholesterol synthesis, plasma lipids, and lipoprotein concentrations and habitual diet, {{were determined}} in 14 male distance runners and 14 sedentary men. The proportion of cholesterol-derived steroids excreted as bile acids, and {{the quantity of}} <b>betasitosterol</b> excreted in the faeces were significantly (P less than 0. 05) higher in the runners compared with the sedentary men. Faecal <b>betasitosterol</b> excretion {{and the proportion of}} cholesterol-derived steroids excreted as bile acids were correlated significantly in the distance runners and the sedentary men (r = 0. 774, n = 28, P less than 0. 001). These results suggest that greater dietary intake of plant sterols may contribute to the higher proportion of cholesterol-derived steroids excreted as bile acids in distance runners...|$|E
40|$|Protein-ligand docking {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} using AutoDock Vina on 61 compounds from two different plants, Justicia adhatoda and Ocimum sanctum with FtsZ protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Various experimentally tested FtsZ inhibitors from literature were also studied before screening plant based compounds. The average dock score of the inhibitors taken from the literature was 7. 2 kcal/mol. After docking 61 compounds from two different plants, a final set of compounds were selected by filtering compounds that showed dock scores greater than 7. 0 kcal/mol. Following this criteria, 10 compounds each from Justicia adhatoda and Ocimum sanctum were finalized. In the next step, consensus scoring was employed to study the importance of various scoring functions available in other docking software’s such as Molegro, GOLD, Patch dock and MEDock respectively. From the scoring generated based on rank-sum technique, Anisotine, <b>Betasitosterol</b> Beta-D glucoside, Lyoniside from Justicia adhatoda, Rosmarinic acid, Stigmasterol, Ursolic acid from Ocimum sanctum {{were found to be}} the best inhibitors of FtsZ protein...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the adjuvant effect of <b>betasitosterol</b> and its glucoside {{in the treatment}} of culture proven pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). DESIGN: A blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial in culture proven drug sensitive PTB. Patients were hospitalised for the duration of treatment and evaluated at monthly intervals with regard to sputum culture positivity, chest radiography, weight gain, Mantoux test response, routine haematology and liver functions. STATISTICAL EVALUATION: General linear models for repeated measures (SAS GLM package) compared the interaction effects, group effects and time effects of findings in 19 patients receiving sitosterols with those in 18 patients receiving a placebo (talcum powder). Absolute values and change from baseline values were evaluated, although only the latter are reported. RESULTS: Weight gain was significantly greater in the sitosterol group (mean weight gain 8. 9 kg) than the placebo group (mean gain 6. 1 kg) (P = 0. 0023 group effects; P = 0. 0001 for time effects). Speed of achieving culture negativity, radiological improvement and induration on Mantoux testing was similar in the two groups. Change in lymphocyte counts from baseline was significantly higher in the sitosterol group (P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0001 for group and time effects) as was the increase in eosinophil counts (P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0137 for group and time effects). CONCLUSION: The study has shown significantly improved weight gain and higher lymphocyte and eosinophil counts in PTB patients receiving sitosterols in addition to an efficacious antituberculosis regimen. Sitosterols and their possible mode of action should now be evaluated in larger numbers of tuberculosis patients and in diseases with a similar immunopathogenesis. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) {{is currently the}} most significant infectious pathogen and the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Unfortunately, {{due to lack of}} resources, delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to countries where they are most needed, such as South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland, is limited and inefficient. Moreover, the short supply and high cost of antiretroviral drugs have caused researchers to turn to plants as prospective therapies in the search for alternative anti-HIV or immunomodulatory compounds. In an African context, traditional medicines are of great importance, not so much as an alternative to treatment, but in many cases as the only source of treatment. There are various South African plants used medicinally which possess phytochemical constituents that target certain mediators of inflammation and the immune system. In African regions where patients do not have access or financial capability to obtain conventional antiretroviral treatment, traditional herbal medicines are used as primary treatment of HIV/AIDS, regardless {{of the fact that the}} safety, toxicity and efficacy of these products are not yet fully understood and that a risk for adverse effects exists. Hypoxis hemerocallidea Fisch&C. A. Mey. (Hypoxidaceae) as well as Sutherlandia frutescens L. R. Br. (Leguminosae) have various effects on the immune system and due to claims about their immune boosting properties, they are two of the most common African herbal compounds being used for HIV management in South Africa. In this study, the immune modulating properties of H. hemerocallidea and S. frutescens were investigated in order to determine whether anectodal claims made about these plants could be supported. Differentiated THP- 1 and U 937 macrophages were treated with aqueous extracts of H. hemerocallidea and S. frutescens as well as with solutions of compound standards reputedly isolated from these plants such as beta-sitosterol, found in H. hemerocallidea, canavanine, pinitol and gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) which are present in S. frutescens Cytotoxicity of the test compounds was determined using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -dephenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Antioxidant capacity was assessed using the Trolox equivalence antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and Oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assays. Determination of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) concentration in treated THP- 1 and U 937 cell culture supernatants was performed by ELISA. Concentrations of cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 70, TNF-á and IFN-ϒ) in treated THP- 1 and U 937 cell culture supernatants were determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin, a well-known immunomodulatory compound, was used as a positive control. Results of cytotoxicity assessments showed that H. hemerocallidea (0. 1 – 1. 9 mg/ml), S. frutescens (0. 1 – 1. 6 mg/ml), beta-sitosterol (0. 2 – 25 ìM), canavanine, pinitol and GABA (1. 5 – 200 ìM) were not cytotoxic to THP- 1 and U 937 macrophages and had cytotoxicity profiles comparable to that of the positive control, curcumin (0. 8 - 25 ìM). The TEAC and ORAC assays showed different results in the antioxidant capacities of the test compounds. The purported antioxidant activity of H. hemerocallidea was confirmed by the TEAC assay with antioxidant effects equivalent to 0. 2 mg/ml Trolox. Canavanine showed antioxidant activity equivalent to approximately 0. 17 mg/ml Trolox and comparable to that of curcumin in the ORAC assay, suggesting its involvement in the inhibition of peroxyl radical-induced oxidation. Flow cytometry results showed that curcumin (20 ìg/ml and 10 ìg/ml) and beta-sitosterol (25 ìg/ml and 12. 5 ìg/ml) reduced IL- 1 â and IL- 8 production and significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased the production of TNF-á. This suggests that <b>betasitosterol</b> could indeed possess anti-inflammatory properties, with effects comparable to the known anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin in terms of cytokine profiles. Beta-sitosterol (25 ìg/ml) and pinitol (50 ìg/ml) significantly (p< 0. 001) decreased extracellular PGE 2 levels in U 937 macrophages by 233. 4 pg/ml and 281. 7 pg/ml, respectively and were the only two compounds showing greater reductions in PGE 2 than curcumin. In conclusion, results of this study do not provide enough evidence to support all anecdotal claims about the ‘immune boosting’ properties of S. frutescens and H. hemerocallidea, but the compounds canavanine, beta-sitosterol and pinitol were found to have modulatory effects on certain aspects of the immune system.
