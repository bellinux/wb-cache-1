5|$|The {{chemistry}} of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution, {{in which it}} can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states. The +1 state has also been reported, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E

5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been built.|$|E
5|$|Megazol {{in a study}} {{seems more}} active against Chagas than {{benznidazole}} <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been studied in humans.

5|$|Russia, Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are {{all members}} of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an {{alternative}} military alliance. In 2009, Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin did not rule out joining NATO at some point, but stated that Russia was currently more interested in leading a coalition as a great power. Azerbaijan has committed to a policy of neutrality, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> ruled out eventually joining NATO or the CSTO.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has been {{introduced}} outside its native range, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E

5|$|At Strangways' house, Bond sees a {{photograph}} of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named Quarrel, whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, Felix Leiter, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of Banksia paludosa are {{endemic to}} New South Wales. The nominate subspecies paludosa is found from Glen Davis {{through to the}} Sydney region and then south to Ulladulla on the South Coast, with a separate population {{in the vicinity of}} Eden just north of the Victorian border. It occurs inland as far as Taralga on the Southern Tablelands. It was collected in 1966 from Hat Head on the Mid North Coast by Lawrie Johnson, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been found there since despite field work in the area. This record aside, the northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now Centennial Park and La Perouse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where it is now locally vanished. Subspecies astrolux is restricted to Nattai National Park in the Southern Highlands.|$|E

5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Devonport was the {{headquarters}} of Western Approaches Command until 1941, and Sunderland flying boats were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an important embarkation point for US troops for D-Day. The city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, {{in a series of}} 59 raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the principal targets, much of the city centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. This was largely due to Plymouth's status as a major port. Charles Church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been demolished. It has been designated as an official permanent monument to the bombing of Plymouth during World War II.|$|E
