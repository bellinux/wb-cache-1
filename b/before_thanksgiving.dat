50|$|Hale {{may be the}} {{individual}} most responsible for making Thanksgiving a national holiday in the United States; it had previously been celebrated only in New England. Each state scheduled its own holiday, some as early as October and others as late as January; it was largely unknown in the American South.

In support of the proposed national holiday, Hale wrote letters to five Presidents of the United States: Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln. Her initial letters failed to persuade, but the letter she wrote to Lincoln convinced him to support legislation establishing a national holiday of Thanksgiving in 1863. The new national holiday was considered a unifying day after {{the stress of the}} American Civil War. <b>Before</b> <b>Thanksgiving's</b> addition, the only national holidays celebrated in the United States were Washington's Birthday and Independence Day.|$|R
