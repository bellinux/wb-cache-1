5|$|Adobe {{walls were}} {{historically}} made by laying the <b>bricks</b> with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks {{at the same}} rate as the <b>bricks</b> when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe <b>bricks</b> to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} secret items are available: gold <b>bricks,</b> minikits, and power <b>bricks.</b> Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its {{corresponding}} extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten {{pieces of a}} Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting {{a certain number of}} gold <b>bricks</b> unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold <b>bricks</b> are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold <b>bricks</b> are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing <b>bricks</b> that line the wall. One all of the <b>bricks</b> change color, the player moves to the next level. Some <b>bricks</b> are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing <b>bricks</b> are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E

50|$|During {{the post-war}} housing boom, Fletton <b>brick</b> sales increased, {{reaching}} a peak in 1967. <b>Brick</b> sales {{then began to}} decline, and the company diversified. London <b>Brick</b> Landfill was formed, and it began the tipping of household and industrial refuse into the old clay pits in the Marston Vale area. London <b>Brick</b> Landfill was merged into Shanks Group in 1988. Between 1968 and 1971, The London <b>Brick</b> Company also bought its three remaining Fletton <b>brick</b> competitors, including the Marston Valley <b>Brick</b> Company, giving it a total monopoly in the Fletton <b>brick</b> market. In 1973, its <b>brick</b> sales totalled 2.88 billion, or 43 per cent of the total <b>brick</b> market.|$|R

5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million <b>bricks</b> a year. It was decided that 5million <b>bricks</b> per year was a realistic figure, with <b>bricks</b> to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bricks</b> {{were also}} {{exported}} by the Dutch for major buildings in their colonies {{in the east}} and around the world. The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, South Africa, was built in 1666, and its entrance was made of the small yellow <b>bricks</b> called ijselstene (IJssel stones). Christ Church in Malacca, Malaysia, the oldest Dutch church building outside the Netherlands, was made of Dutch <b>bricks</b> that had been brought as ballast in ships from the Netherlands, coated with Chinese plaster.|$|E

50|$|Acid <b>brick</b> or acid {{resistant}} <b>brick</b> is a specially made form of masonry <b>brick</b> that is chemically resistant and thermally durable. Acid <b>brick</b> is created from high silica shale and fired at higher temperatures than those used for conventional <b>brick.</b> Some manufacturers create the <b>brick</b> by baking it {{for over a}} week.

5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from <b>bricks,</b> with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker <b>bricks,</b> called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired <b>bricks</b> to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{accounts}} {{show the}} details of the payments for the construction of the tower between 1398 and 1399, including charges for 36,850 <b>bricks,</b> stone, sand, lime, a hoist and various equipment. At least 170 cartloads of stone are mentioned, and the <b>bricks</b> may have been brought to the site along the river by boat, while some of the timber was brought from Great Yarmouth. The total cost of the building from these records, including labour, came to around £36. The number of <b>bricks</b> used in the tower, however, was probably twice the listed number purchased, and the city may therefore already have stockpiled some <b>bricks</b> on the location before the build.|$|E
5|$|Dutch <b>brick</b> {{is a type}} of <b>brick</b> made in the Netherlands, {{or similar}} <b>brick,</b> and an {{architectural}} style of building with <b>brick</b> developed by the Dutch.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>brick</b> [...] (extra) ordinary <b>brick</b> [...] and its metaphysics. How can a <b>brick,</b> {{a material}} object, have a metaphysics? The singular 2 ̆ 7 <b>brick</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{is arguably the}} most ubiquitous of construction materials, modest in its earth and fire roots, fitted to the hand, a utilitarian artifact habitually assembled into a myriad of constructions. Yet embedded, presupposed, potentially, within each <b>brick</b> are: a technological society with labor organization; conceptions of fabricating structure, skin, and illusion; temporality; and the creation of place, transparency, and motion. Louis I. Kahn, when discussing architectural materials, specifically <b>brick</b> and arches, speaks in Platonic terms of material construction giving presence to the pre-existent forms of <b>brick</b> assemblies and arches. He says this is 2 ̆ 2 the order of <b>brick.</b> 2 ̆ 2 This paper, though it shares the poetic notion of <b>brick,</b> postulates an Aristotelian model. It is through the human practices of making and construction, the relational aspects of <b>brick</b> bonded to <b>brick,</b> and the purposeful intents of those assemblies that there arises a metaphysics of <b>brick.</b> To build in <b>brick</b> is not to create inert objects, but to build existential presences.
