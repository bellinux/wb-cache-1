40|$|The Reed-Solomon codes {{have been}} widely used in digital {{communication}} systems such as computer networks, satellites, VCRs, mobile communications and high- definition television (HDTV), in order to protect digital data against erasures, random and burst errors during transmission. Since the encoding and decoding algorithms for such codes are computationally intensive, special purpose hardware implementations are often required to meet the real time requirements. [...] One motivation for this thesis is to investigate and introduce reconfigurable Galois field arithmetic structures which exploit the symmetric properties of available architectures. Another is to design and implement an RS encoder/decoder ASIC which can support a wide family of RS codes. [...] An m-programmable Galois field multiplier which uses the standard basis representation of the elements is first introduced. It is then demonstrated that the exponentiator can be used to implement a fast inverter which outperforms the available inverters in GF(2 m). Using these basic structures, an ASIC design and synthesis of a reconfigurable Reed-Solomon encoder/decoder processor which implements a large family of RS codes is proposed. The design is parameterized in terms of the block length n, Galois field symbol size m, and error correction capability t for the various RS codes. The design has been captured using the VHDL hardware description language and mapped onto CMOS standard cells available in the 0. 8 -µm <b>BiCMOS</b> <b>design</b> kits for Cadence and Synopsys tools. The experimental chip contains 218, 206 logic gates and supports values of the Galois field symbol size m = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and error correction capability t = 1, 2, 3, [...] ., 16. Thus, the block length n is variable from 7 to 255. Error correction t and Galois field symbol size m are pin-selectable. [...] Since low design complexity and high throughput are desired in the VLSI chip, the algebraic decoding technique has been investigated instead of the time or transform domain. The encoder uses a self-reciprocal generator polynomial which structures the codewords in a systematic form. At the beginning of the decoding process, received words are initially stored in the first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer as they enter the syndrome module. The Berlekemp-Massey algorithm is used to determine both the error locator and error evaluator polynomials.

The dissertation consists of two parts: One, implementation of a RF front-end receiver for an ultra-wideband system and, two, implementation of a local oscillation (LO) signal for a GSM/WCDMA multiband application. For emerging ultra-wideband (UWB) applications, the key active components in the RF front-end receiver were designed and implemented in 0. 18 um SiGe <b>BiCMOS</b> process. The <b>design</b> of LNA, which is the critical circuit block for both systems, was analyzed in terms of noise, linearity and group delay variation over an extemely wide bandwidth. Measurements are demonstrated for an energy-thrifty UWB receiver based on an MB-OFDM system covering the full FCC-allowed UWB frequency range. For multiband applications such as a GSM/WCDMA dual-band application, the design of wideband VCO and various frequency generation blocks are investigated as alternatives for implementation of direct conversion architecture.

This thesis presents new solutions at the device waveform-, circuit-, and transmitter level which exploit the inherent high efficiency potential of switch-mode power amplifiers (SMPAs) for realization of energy efficient, wide-band, highly integrated transmitters for wireless communication applications. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, a continuum of novel high efficiency class-E power amplifier modes are derived, significantly extending the known SMPA design space. In contrast to conventional SMPA modes, the new continuum allows some variation for the switch impedances, providing important possibilities on wide-band SMPA designs. This is experimentally verified in a 1 W SiGe <b>BiCMOS</b> SMPA <b>design</b> having a drain efficiency of above 70 % over a 1. 3 - 2. 2 GHz bandwidth. In the second part a novel combiner synthesis technique is developed that enables realization of wide-band highly efficient outphasing transmitters. The technique is based on the calculation of the combiner network parameters from the boundary conditions required for highly efficient switch-mode operation of the transistors in each branch. The approach is validated in a CMOS-GaN outphasing transmitter design providing a peak output power of 44 dBm and a 7. 5 dB output power back-off efficiency exceeding 52 % over a 750 - 1050 MHz bandwidth. It is further shown that the same theoretical approach can also be used for design of Doherty PA combiner networks. A 28 W 3. 5 GHz Doherty PA is designed and manufactured for experimental verification providing a record-high power added efficiency of 51 % at an adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of - 50 dBc with carrier-aggregated 100 MHz LTE test signals. In the third part a new SMPA topology particularly suitable for amplification of RF pulse-width modulation (RF-PWM) signals is presented. In classical pulse width modulated SMPAs the varying pulse width leads to switching losses and hence efficiency degradation.

This thesis demonstrates that Ka-band (35 GHz) T/R modules can also be developed using the SiGe <b>BiCMOS</b> technology. The <b>designed</b> circuit blocks include a low noise amplifier, a 4 -bit phase shifter, a variable gain amplifier/attenuator, and SPDT switches. The Ka-band phase shifters are designed based on CMOS switch and miniature low-pass networks for a single-ended and differential applications, and result in 3 -degree rms phase error at 35 GHz. The SiGe LNA results in a peak gain of 24 dB and a noise figure of 2. 9 - 3. 1 dB with 11 mW power consumption. The CMOS variablestep attenuator has 12 -dB attenuation range (1 dB step) with very low loss and phase imbalance at 10 - 50 GHz. A variable gain LNA is also demonstrated at 30 - 40 GHz for the differential phased array receiver, and has 20 -dB gain and < 1 -degree rms phase imbalance between the 8 different gain states and 10 dB gain control. All of these circuits show state-of-the-art performance, and the phase shifter, distributed attenuator and VGA are also first-time demonstrations at Ka-band frequencies. These circuit blocks were used in a miniature SiGe/CMOS Ka-band T/R module with a dimension of 0. 93 x 1. 33 mm 2, and a measured performance of 19 dB receive gain, 4 - 5 dB NF, 9 dB transmit gain and + 5. 5 dBm output P 1 dB.
