2500|$|The term [...] "green coffee bean" [...] {{refers to}} unroasted mature or {{immature}} coffee beans. These have been processed by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage {{and have an}} intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature, they are green. When mature, they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330mg per dried coffee bean. Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans, such as caffeine, deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further, both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to {{the flavor of the}} coffee bean when it is roasted. Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its <b>biological</b> <b>action.</b> Since the mid 2000s, green coffee extract has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its chlorogenic acid content and for its lipolytic and weight-loss properties.|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} described peptide hormone, endothelin, is {{a potent}} vasoconstrictor, but {{it is unclear whether}} endothelin has other <b>biological</b> <b>actions.</b> These experiments extend the range of <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> of endothelin to stimulation of mitogenesis. Endothelin at low concentrations (0. 1 - 10 nM) induced mitogenesis by quiescent rat glomerular mesangial cells in culture. Mitogenesis induced by endothelin was accompanied by activation of phospholipase C with increased inositol phosphate turnover and increments of intracellular [Ca 2 +]. Endothelin also activated Na+/H+ exchange, causing cytosolic alkalinization, and enhanced transcription of the c-fos protooncogene, additional biochemical signals closely linked to proliferation. In addition to being a vasoconstrictor, endothelin thus also functions as a mitogen, presumably through activation of phospholipase C...|$|R

40|$|To {{correctly}} perceive <b>biological</b> <b>actions,</b> {{the movement}} pattern {{generated in the}} course of the action has to be linked to the configuration of the actor. Recently, we showed that in humans, motion and configuration cues are processed separately in occipito-temporal cortex, and that both cues are integrated in the extrastriate (EBA) and fusiform (FBA) body areas (Jastorff and Orban, 2009). Using the same factorial design as in our human study, we performed fMRI experiments in awake monkeys to compare biological motion processing in the two species. Point-light displays of monkeys engaged in various actions were presented in a 2 × 2 factorial design. One factor manipulated the configuration of the stimuli, the other, the kinematics. As in humans, the two factors were anatomically segregated in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) rostral to the MT/V 5 complex, with the effect of configuration significant along the lower bank and that of kinematics significant in the fundus and the upper bank of the STS. Moreover, voxels showing a significant interaction between the two factors were mainly confined to body-selective patches within the STS, mimicking our human findings. Importantly, this study reports for the first time differential activation for <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> presented as point-light displays in the monkey. Moreover, our results suggest that the processing mechanisms of <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> are remarkably similar in humans and macaque monkeys, and provide the basis for linking existing and future single-cell physiology in the monkey with human functional imaging. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} paper was to review human studies of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) concentrations and of O-DMA producers compared with nonproducers {{in the context of}} results from in vitro studies. O-DMA is an intestinal bacterial metabolite of daidzein, an isoflavone compound observed to have phytoestrogenic properties. Not all individuals harbor bacteria capable of metabolizing daidzein to O-DMA, and individuals can be classified as O-DMA producers and nonproducers. O-DMA is less structurally similar to 17 β-estradiol than its parent compound, daidzein; thus, it may exhibit different <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> than daidzein. Evidence from in vitro studies suggests that O-DMA has several cancer-related <b>biological</b> <b>actions.</b> However, results from human metabolic studies and observational studies of disease risk suggest that these actions may not be physiologically relevant in vivo due to the amount and form (primarily glucuronide) of circulating O-DMA. Apart from circulating O-DMA concentrations, the underlying bacteria may have a distinct physiological role. Urinary excretion of O-DMA in humans is a marker of harboring intestinal bacteria capable of C-ring cleavage. Bacterial C-ring cleavage reactions are relevant to other phytochemicals that may exert <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> in vivo that are stronger than the actions of O-DMA; thus, the role of the phenotype may extend beyond daidzein metabolism. There are a limited number of studies that have evaluated disease risk factors in relation to being an O-DMA producer, with mixed results. Further research evaluating disease risk in relation to the O-DMA–producer phenotype from the perspective of intestinal microbial composition is recommended...|$|R
