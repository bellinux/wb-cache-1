5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E

Moreover, like Beowulf, Bödvar Bjarki arrives in Denmark from Götaland (Geatland), and upon arriving in Denmark he kills a beast that has been ravaging the Danish court for two years.

25|$|At {{least two}} vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built {{apparently}} as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow {{in the corporate}} museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only. Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum. Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott and Jay S. Walker.|$|E
25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap is {{the premier}} autologous skin graft for {{the reconstruction of}} a nose, by replacing any of the aesthetic nasal subunits, especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color. The forehead flap is an axial skin flap based upon the supraorbital artery (an ophthalmic artery branch) and the supratrochlear artery (an ophthalmic artery terminus), which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus {{in order to enhance}} the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose. Restricted length is a practical application limit of the paramedian forehead flap, especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline. In such a patient, a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a different skin texture and does continue growing hair; such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline; yet that portion of the skin flap is random, and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis.|$|E

Other obituaries and appreciations describe how he was generous with his time and knowledge, and always ready to point students in the right direction. The Independent credits his capacious memory and a personal library of around 20,000 books {{as the foundation of}} his broad scholarship. According to The Times, when reviewing others' writing he was usually generous, though capable of a courteous demolition job when well-deserved.|$|E

[...] Dave Kehr, in his review for the Daily News, criticized the film's premise as a [...] "tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film". The Guardian criticized the film as [...] "a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random.

500|$|Variations {{of these}} analogies {{are used for}} {{rotating}} mechanical systems, such as in electric motors. [...] In the impedance analogy, instead of force, torque is made analogous to voltage. [...] It is perfectly possible that both versions of the analogy are needed in, say, a system that includes rotating and reciprocating parts, in which case a force-torque analogy is required within the mechanical domain and a force-torque-voltage analogy to the electrical domain. [...] Another variation is required for acoustical systems; here pressure and voltage are made analogous (impedance analogy). [...] In the impedance analogy, {{the ratio of the}} power conjugate variables is always a quantity analogous to electrical impedance. [...] For instance force/velocity is mechanical impedance. [...] The mobility analogy does not preserve this analogy between impedances across domains, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> another advantage over the impedance analogy. [...] In the mobility analogy the topology of networks is preserved, a mechanical network diagram has the same topology as its analogous electrical network diagram.|$|E
