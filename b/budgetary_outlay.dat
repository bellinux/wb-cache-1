The ECAM I and ECAM II household consumption surveys collected by the Governments Statistics Office together with the software DAD 4. 4 were used to generate the results. The incidence, depth and severity of poverty retreated significantly the period under study. The growth component contributed significantly more in explaining the fall in levels of poverty than the redistribution component in both rural and urban areas. The overall situation however clouds regional tendencies, which attribute varying importance to the two factors. The indication, however, clearly portrays the important role to be attributed to growth if long term poverty reduction is valued high in the policy menu as articulated in Cameroon’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.

Trade and Assistance Review 2009 - 10 was released on 16 June 2011. The review contains the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s latest quantitative estimates of Australian Government assistance to industry.   According to the review, In 2009 - 10, Australian Government <b>budgetary</b> <b>outlays,</b> tax {{concessions and}} import tariffs provided Australian industry with 17. 3 billion in assistance in gross terms. After allowing for the cost impost of import tariffs on industries using goods as inputs, the net assistance received by industry was estimated at 9. 3 billion. The Review notes that, since May 2010, the Australian Government has announced around 700 million of industry assistance expenditure proposals. Nearly half of the proposed expenditure (370 million) relates to carbon emission reduction and energy programs. The remainder (over 300 million) relates to more traditional forms of Government support. This support is targeted at primary, manufacturing and service industries, as well as research, development and innovation. The Review provides an updated picture of state and territory government assistance to industry. Expenditures by these governments on programs and services identified as supporting industry policy objectives are estimated at around 4. 1 billion. These expenditures include grants and subsidies, marketing and promotion, and agricultural research as well as employee and administration costs.  ...|$|R

40|$|Social sector {{expenditure}} in India captures {{a number}} of important aspects including health, nutrition, education, water supply, sanitation, housing and welfare, among others. Over a period of time, besides <b>budgetary</b> <b>outlay</b> on this sector, private sector has also played a considerable role. Thus, efficiency of expenditure in this sector by state government has to be reckoned both in terms of relative levels of various aspects across the states and in terms of comparable benchmarks for different aspects of the sector. This paper attempts an analysis of social sector efficiency focusing on two major aspects: health and education. Unlike other studies on the Indian context, this analysis focusing on major states in India uses both non-parametric and parametric approaches. Although both approaches provide benchmarks to judge relative efficiency across states, the former provides a yardstick more at an aggregative level without parametric restrictions, whereas the latter is used for major focus on health care aspects. Results of free disposal hull analysis are suggestive of a considerably more scope for improvement in efficiency of public expenditure in health relative to education. Our results of stochastic frontier analysis indicate considerable state level disparities which could be reduced through a mix of strategies involving reallocation of factors (namely, manpower and supply of consumables) within the sector, mobilizing additional resources possibly through enhanced budgetary emphasis, or encouraging more private sector participation. Based on our results, this may enhance efficiency by nearly 20 % in health care sector and increase availability and equity across low performing and poorer states like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh...|$|E
40|$|Instrumental {{analysis}} of private law damage remedies assumes rational economic actors {{in a market}} environment. A privately owned factory forced by the tort system to pay 1000 in pollution costs suffered by a downstream neighbor will continue to pollute if, and only if, the private benefits of its pollution-producing activity exceed 1000. At least within the law and economics paradigm, we can safely take for granted the rather strong assumptions upon which this analysis rests. No one doubts, for example, that a profit-maximizing firm will tend to ignore social costs that are not reflected in financial outflows, or {{that it will take}} account of costs that are reflected in financial outflows and, perhaps, change its behavior in response. What happens, however, when government is substituted for the private firm in this analysis? This substitution takes place routinely in discussions of constitutional remedies such as just compensation for takings, damages for constitutional torts, and the liability or property rule represented by the constitutional prohibition against federal 2 ̆ 2 commandeering 2 ̆ 2 of state governments. Each of these remedial systems seeks to deter government, to some socially optimal extent, from violating constitutional rights by forcing government agencies to internalize the costs of their constitutionally problematic conduct. But government does not internalize costs {{in the same way as}} a private firm. Government actors respond to political incentives, not financial ones [...] to votes, not dollars. We cannot assume that government will internalize social costs just because it is forced to make a <b>budgetary</b> <b>outlay.</b> While imposing financial outflows on government will ultimately create political costs (and benefits), the mechanism is complicated and depends on the model of government behavior used to translate between market costs and benefits and political costs and benefits. As this Article seeks to demonstrate by applying public choice models of government behavior, government cannot be expected to respond to forced financial outflows like a private firm. If the goal of making government pay compensation is to achieve optimal deterrence with respect to constitutionally problematic conduct, the results are likely to be disappointing and perhaps even perverse. Having reached this conclusion, this Article proceeds to explore potential justifications for constitutional compensation remedies other than optimal deterrence of government misconduct. Efficiency justifications based on the incentives and welfare of private actors seem misguided and, in fact, often suggest efficiency gains from withholding, rather than paying, compensation. Moving from efficiency to 2 ̆ 2 fairness, 2 ̆ 2 the conventional philosophical justifications for compensation, offered in terms of morality or justice, are at best contestable and incomplete. This Article concludes by exploring how we might reinvent constitutional remedies in light of the insight that government responds to political, not market, incentives...|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} set of {{indicators}} for monitoring and evaluation of agricultural policy, patterned after the support estimates of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The main indicators are: producer support (incorporating indirect market support, and direct input support through irrigation, credit, and land transfer); general services support; and public expenditures for agriculture. The study finds that these indicators are viable measures of public support and may be consistently updated over time. Past trends in policy indicators suggest that price policy played the biggest role in agricultural support. Low to negative support to agriculture up to the late 1980 s was due largely to indirect taxation of agriculture. From the 1990 s onward though the protection structure swung in favor of agriculture resulting in expanding producer support, further enhanced by increasing <b>budgetary</b> <b>outlays</b> for agriculture, mostly toward provision of private goods (such as fertilizer subsidies).

Instructional time use is a mediator variable that is challenging to measure, so it often escapes scrutiny.

Key points: 	Government assistance to industry is provided through an array of measures including tariffs, <b>budgetary</b> <b>outlays,</b> tax concessions, and restrictions on competition. 	 		This benefits the industry receiving it, but comes {{at a cost to}} other industries, taxpayers or consumers. A critical issue is whether the benefits accruing to industry outweigh the costs. 	 	 	Estimated tariff assistance to industry was 7. 8 billion in 2012 - 13 in gross terms, accruing overwhelmingly to manufacturing. Budget and tax related support was worth a further 7. 8 billion, thus total gross assistance was 15. 6 billion. 	After deducting the cost penalty of tariffs on imported inputs (7. 1 billion, two thirds incurred by services industries) net assistance to industry was 8. 5 billion. 	Budgetary assistance in 2012 - 13 was about 2. 2 billion less than in 2011 - 12. The largest reductions were from the winding down of transitional assistance afforded by the Energy Security Fund (1 billion), the Coal Sector Jobs Package (219 million) and the Steel Transformation Plan (164 million). 	Since November 2013, the current Government has announced, amongst other things, that it would: 	 		reduce funding to motor vehicle manufacturing between 2015 – 2017 by 500 million, not provide a debt guarantee or line of credit to Qantas, nor provide assistance requested by processing company SPC Ardmona, but would proceed with support to Cadbury for a tourist facility. 	 	 	Australia recently agreed to bilateral trade agreements with Korea and Japan. Trade agreements can distort comparative advantage between nations and consequently reduce efficient resource allocation. 	 		The rules of origin in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s nine bilateral agreements differ widely, are likely to impede competition and add to the compliance costs of firms engaging in trade. 	 	 	Government outlays on defence capability represent one of the largest discretionary items in the Commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s budget. 	 		Defence industry assistance includes cost premiums for local purchasing preferences and budgetary support for skilling, research and exporting (with expenditures up to 500 million directly and indirectly benefiting industry). 		Significant cost premiums can also be incurred by choosing to modify off-the-shelf equipment or pursuing bespoke designs. 	 	 	To be justified, cost premiums and defence industry assistance need to be commensurate with any additional security and operational benefits. Publishing these additional costs and benefits would assist understanding of apparently huge cost differentials. 	The efficiency and effectiveness of direct defence industry assistance programs could benefit from independent scrutiny.

40|$|Agriculture {{seems to}} be a {{difficult}} sector to manage for most governments. Developing countries face tough dilemmas in deciding on appropriate price policies to stimulate food production and maintain stable, preferably low, prices for poor consumers. Governments in developed countries face similar difficult decisions. They are called upon to give income guarantees to farmers whose incomes are unstable and relatively low when compared to those in the nonagricultural sector. These guarantees often lead to ever-increasing <b>budgetary</b> <b>outlays</b> and unwanted agricultural surpluses. High prices make new investments and the application of new technologies more attractive than world prices warrant, and a process is set in motion where technological innovation attains a momentum of its own, in turn requiring price policies that maintain their rates of return. Surpluses are disposed of with subsidies in domestic markets or in the international market. Price competition reduces the market share of other exporters, who may be efficient producers, unless they are willing to engage in subsidy competition. This lowers export earnings and farm incomes or depletes the public resources of developing countries that export competing products. Retaliatory measures have led to frictions and further distortions of world prices. Every so often the major agricultural exporters [...] the USA, the EC, Australia, or Canada [...] accuse one another of unfair intervention. Though they have agreed to discuss agricultural trade liberalization under GATT negotiations, if anything, the expenditure on farm support has continued to increase in both the EC and the USA. Some developing countries do benefit from the subsidized disposal of surplus cereals on the world market. This, however, might be only a short-term gain. Low prices are a disincentive to their own producers and lead, in the long run, to an unsustainable dependence on imports, as appears to be the case in many parts of Africa. Also, these benefits of cheap cereals may not offset the loss of markets, such as the sugar market, which is important to a large number of developing countries. Against that background and {{in the light of the}} fact that many countries have agreed to discuss agricultural trade liberalization under GATT, it is important to assess the consequences of agricultural trade liberalization. It should increase efficiency at the global level as countries adjust their production more in line with their comparative advantages. However, in the absence of compensating transfers, some countries may lose under liberalization. An assessment of efficiency gains at the global level and gains and losses of countries can provide some insight into the degree to which their own production and trade have become distorted and how large the adjustment costs may be. Several questions are relevant here: what if the developed market economies remove border protection? But also: what consequences can be expected from the removal of border protection by developing countries only? (This is an issue that can be usefully analyzed as it belongs to the regular package of adjustment policies recommended by the World Bank and the IMF.) What would be the impact of simultaneous liberalization by all market economies? Who would gain and who would lose? This book reports on a study that explored these questions using a system of empirically estimated national agricultural policy models linked together through trade and capital transfers. A general equilibrium approach is followed for both the national models and the international linkage. Thus, behavioral responses of consumers and producers, as well as the responses of government policies to changes in world market conditions, are accounted for. We call this system of models the Basic Linked System (BLS). It consists of 18 national models, two models of regions [...] namely, the EC and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) [...] and 14 somewhat similar models of groups of countries. Together these cover all the nations of the world. We believe that the BLS is particularly suited [...] at least, better than any other existing analytic tool [...] for the analysis of issues related to agricultural trade liberalization and self-sufficiency. The present study differs from other available studies on trade liberalization in combining all the following features: a general equilibrium approach is applied to both the national and international levels; most of the parameters are empirically estimated; a number of agricultural commodities are distinguished; nations are distinguished; and a rich variety of policy instruments for national governments is permitted, including tariffs, trade, quotas, taxes, transfers, and stock operations. The existence of these features can significantly alter policy conclusions derived from the analysis...|$|R
