40|$|It is {{well known}} that the welding process induces {{residual}} stresses near the <b>bead</b> <b>toe.</b> These stresses could influence the high cycle fatigue strength of welding joints therefore {{it is very important to}} know their distribution. Among the local criteria, the Notch-Stress Intensity Factors (N-SIFs) method considers the weld toe like a sharp V- notch and estimates the fatigue strength according to the asymptotic stress distribution near the <b>bead</b> <b>toe.</b> Such distribution is evaluated taking into account only the external applied loads [1]. It is obvious that the residual stresses change such distribution and the size of the plastic zone near the weld toe, modifying the range of validity of a linear- elastic hypothesis. The aim of this work is to analyse, by means of a numerical model of a T-joint, the residual stress distribution near the toe due to a welding process. The 2002 ®...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn iron {{base alloy}} {{containing}} 10 wt. % Cr and 10 wt. %Ni with a martensite start temperature around 180 °C {{has been developed}} by Ohta et al. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} Low γ→α’ Transformation Temperature (LTT) welding consumables enable weld beads to be in compression after cooling. Owing to this, fatigue strength can be substantially improved. Low carbon martensitic stainless steel consumables (EN ISO 17633 -A -T Z 16 5 1) are widely available on the market in Europe, which also exhibit γ→α’ low temperature transformation (around 225 °C), despite dilution with base material. Experimental work conducted on partially penetrated symmetric and asymmetric fillet welded test pieces have shown good results with respect to weld root crack initiation and a substantial improvement of fatigue resistance with respect to weld <b>bead</b> <b>toe</b> crack initiation (m = - 5, FAT > 160). These results are all the more interesting because the weld bead connecting radius obtained with a heterogeneous welding consumable is smaller than with a homogeneous consumable such as G 3 Si 1. This study shows that using a LTT –type consumable with designation G 16 5 1 is an interesting alternative to more conventional techniques such as TIG re-melting or high frequency mechanical impact to improve fatigue strength of welded structures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently boron microalloyed steels {{have become}} an {{alternative}} in weight saving in structural elements in automotive industry, especially for parts like pillars and columns and reinforcements. These materials are used as quenched and tempered, reaching strength values between 1000 and 1500 MPa. Welding is a relevant issue as a fabrication process in automotive industry, in particular for high strength steels. Furthermore, fatigue life of these welded joints plays {{a very important role}} for these applications. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) {{is one of the more}} widely used welding processes in automotive industry. Indeed, different aspects of plasma arc welding (PAW) make it an interesting option for these applications. The objective of this work was to evaluate the fatigue life of GMAW and PAW welded joints of boron microalloyed steels, in a quenched and tempered condition. Samples of 100 × 100 mm were butt welded by GMAW and PAW and microstructural and mechanically characterized. Fatigue curves were obtained for both processes in a four point bending configuration. It was observed that PAW welded samples had a higher fatigue life than those welded by GMAW. Weld <b>bead</b> <b>toes</b> of GMAW joints acted as geometric stress concentrators, being the main responsible for fatigue resistance reduction...|$|R

A theory {{to estimate the}} wetting length considering gradual cooling of liquid filler and loss {{in its ability to}} spread is currently unavailable. We present here a methodology to estimate wetting length based on the minimisation of energy for spreading of a liquid filler considering its gradual cooling and tested the computed results in gas metal arc brazing of galvanised sheets {{for a wide range of}} conditions.

40|$|Weld bead {{geometry}} cannot, by {{its very}} nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as <b>bead</b> shape and <b>toe</b> radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. In the Notch Stress Intensity Factor (N-SIF) approach the weld toe region is modelled as a sharp V-shaped corner and local stress distributions in planar problems can be expressed in closed form {{on the basis of}} the relevant Mode I and Mode II N-SIFs. Initially thought of as parameters suitable for quantifying only the crack initiation life, N-SIFs are shown able to predict also the total fatigue life, at least when a large part of the life is spent as in the propagation of small cracks in the highly stressed region close to the notch tip. A large amount of experimental data reported in the literature for steel and aluminium welded joints is used here to demonstrate the applicability of the N-SIF-based approach...|$|R
40|$|Weldments {{geometry}} with failures {{occurring at}} the weld toe {{or at the}} weld root cannot, by its nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as <b>bead</b> shape and <b>toe</b> or root radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. The worst case configuration {{can be achieved by}} modelling as a sharp, zero radius, notch both the toe and the weld root. The intensity of asymptotic stress distributions obeying Williams' solution is quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). For steel welded joints with failures originated from the weld roots, where the lack of penetration zone is treated as a crack-like notch, units for NSIFs are the same as conventional SIFs used in LEFM. The different dimensionality of NSIFs for different notch opening angles does not allow a direct comparison of failures occurring at the weld toe or at the weld root. In order to overcome the problem related to the variability of the V-notch opening angle, a simple scalar quantity, i. e. the value of the strain energy density (SED) averaged in the structural volume surrounding the notch tip, has been introduced. This energy is given in closed form {{on the basis of the}} relevant NSIFs for modes I, II and III. The radius Rc of the averaging zone is carefully identified with reference to conventional arc welding processes being equal to 0. 28 mm for welded joints made of steel. The local-energy based criterion is applied here to steel welded rollers produced by Rulmeca and subjected to prevailing mode I (with failures at the weld root). The aim of the paper is firstly to describe the employed methodology for the fatigue assessment and secondly to show the first synthesis of fatigue data by means of local SED for a specific geometry...|$|R
40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as penetration <b>bead</b> thickness and <b>toe</b> radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or metal cored wires for robotic GMAW. Even though metal cored wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using metal cored wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using metal cored electrode. Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding. Specimens were cut, grinded and etched. Measurement of weld dimensions was performed via Lumenera software. Analysis of the results was made with JMP 11 software by SAS. Results indicated that for metal cored wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis. Tests with higher welding speeds suggest that there are possibilities for productivity improvement. Pulsed welding revealed that only a trade-off between values of bead thickness and penetration can create a quality weld. Less total amount of high quality welds are observed in pulsed welding, in comparison with conventional welding...|$|R
40|$|Weld bead {{geometry}} cannot, by its nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as <b>bead</b> {{shape and}} <b>toe</b> radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. In {{the present paper}} the weld toe region is modelled as a sharp, zero radius, V-shaped notch {{and the intensity of}} asymptotic stress distributions obeying Williams' solution are quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). When the constancy of the angle included between weld flanks and main plates is assured and the angle is large enough to make mode II contribution non-singular, mode I NSIF can be directly used to summarise the fatigue strength of welded joints having very different geometry. By using a large amount of experimental data taken from the literature and related to a V-notch angle of 135 degrees, two NSIF-based bands are reported for steel and aluminium welded joints under a nominal load ratio about equal to zero. A third band is reported for steel welded joints with failures originated from the weld roots, where the lack of penetration zone is treated as a crack-like notch and units for NSIFs are the same as conventional SIF used in LEFM. Afterwards, in order to overcome the problem related to the variability of the V-notch opening angle, the synthesis is made by simply using a scalar quantity, i. e. the mean value of the strain energy averaged in the structural volume surrounding the notch tips. This energy is given in closed form {{on the basis of the}} relevant NSIFs for modes I and II and the radius R-c of the averaging zone is carefully identified with reference to conventional arc welding processes. Rc for welded joints made of steel and aluminium considered here is 0. 28 mm and 0. 12 mm, respectively Different values of Rc might characterise welded joints obtained from high-power processes, in particular from automated laser beam welding. The local-energy based criterion is applied to steel welded joints under prevailing mode I (with failures both at the weld root and toe) and to aluminium welded joints under mode I and mixed load modes (with mode II contribution prevailing on that ascribable to mode I). Surprising, the mean value of Delta W related to the two groups of welded materials was found practically coincident at 2 million cycles. More than 750 fatigue data have been considered in the analyses reported herein...|$|R
40|$|This licentiate thesis {{focuses on}} the fatigue {{cracking}} behaviour of laser and hybrid laser-MAG welded structures. Beside the welding process and the resulting weld, several topics related to fatigue of welded structures are treated such as; macro and micro surface geometry, weld defects and their influence on fatigue performance of welded structures, fatigue analysis by the nominal and effective notch stress method, fatigue life prediction using LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics), fatigue testing, metallurgical analysis, elastic and elastic-plastic finite element analysis. The main objective is to gain understanding {{of the impact of}} weld defects and weld shape details on the fatigue behaviour of laser and hybrid laser welded joints. The first paper is a literature survey which compiled useful information regarding fracture and fatigue analysis of various welded joints. In the second paper fatigue testing by bending of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints was carried out. The weld surface geometry was measured and studied {{in order to understand the}} crack initiation mechanisms. The crack initiation location and the crack propagation path were studied and compared to Finite Element stress analysis, taking into account the surface macro- and micro-geometry. Based on the nominal stress approach, SN-curves were designed for laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. The competing criteria of throat depth and stress raising by the weld toe radii and by the surface ripples are explained, showing that surface ripples can be critical. The third paper is the continuation of the second paper, but studying the fatigue crack propagation of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. Microscopic analysis was carried out to identify internal weld defects. Nominal and effective notch stress analysis was carried out to compare standardized values. LEFM analysis was conducted for this joint geometry for four point bending load in order to study the effect of LOF on fatigue life. In good agreement between simulation and metallurgy, cracking starts and propagates from the lower toe, but for certain geometries alternatively from the weld <b>bead</b> or upper <b>toe,</b> even in case of Lack of Fusion, as was well be explained. Improved understanding of the crack propagation for these geometrical conditions was obtained and in turn illustrated. Lack of fusion surprisingly was not critical and only slightly lowered the fatigue life. Two dimensional linear elastic finite element analyses is carried out in the fourth paper on laser welding of a beamer in order to study the impact of geometrical aspects of the joint design and of the weld root on the fatigue performance. Critical geometrical aspects were classified and then studied by FE-analysis with respect to their impact on the fatigue behaviour. Stress comparison of full 15 mm and partial 6 mm weld penetration of the beam was done by varying the toe and root geometry to identify the critical details. Generalization of the knowledge by new methods was an important aspect, particularly to apply the findings for other joints. Together the papers provide better understanding of fatigue behaviour for complex geometries and are therefore suitable guidelines for improved weld design.
