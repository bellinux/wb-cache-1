5000|$|Bruynzeel - Founded in 1897 by Kees Bruynzeel in Rotterdam, {{furniture}} and kitchen manufacturer Bruynzeel started making wooden shelving in 1953 and <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> in 1970 ...|$|R
50|$|Lockers {{are often}} {{manufactured}} {{by the same}} companies who produce filing cabinets, stationery cabinets (occasionally wrongly referred to as lockers, <b>steel</b> <b>shelving,</b> and other products made from sheet steel.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Beseler Company is a Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania {{industrial}} company addressing four primary markets: {{public and}} corporate <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> and furniture, iron shelving and storage, shrink wrap packaging and silver halide photography (film photography). [...] The company now has two divisions left, its photo division and shrink wrap packaging.|$|R
50|$|Van Severen {{was also}} {{frequently}} commissioned as a decorator and furniture designer for private residence projects, teamed with Rem Koolhaas. They {{worked together on}} the Villa dall'Ava in 1990, then again in Bordeaux in 1996 (Maison â€¡ Floirac, OMA). He has also created exhibition stands of <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> for use at shows and trade fairs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{library science}} and architecture, a stack or bookstack (often {{referred}} to as a library building's stacks) is a book storage area, as opposed to a reading area. More specifically, this term refers to a narrow-aisled, multilevel system of iron or <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> that evolved in the nineteenth century to meet increasing demands for storage space. [...] An [...] "open-stack" [...] library allows its patrons to enter the stacks to browse for themselves; [...] "closed stacks" [...] means library staff retrieve books for patrons on request.|$|R
50|$|Omni Superstore {{featured}} a bakery, Hero's Deli, Field Fresh Produce Section, Great Lakes Seafood, The Dairy Depot, The Greenery Floral Department, 1 hour photo department, large general merchandise department, Homestyle home goods department, The Cheese Shop, cosmetics counter, pharmacy department, and a wholesale/family pack foods area with large 20' orange industrial <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> {{that separated the}} general merchandise area from the grocery area. Early Omni Superstore's contained a video department while newer ones dropped this department. The Orland Park Omni had a separate Video store entrance next to the exit doors.|$|R
50|$|To {{replace the}} collection, Thomas Jefferson offered his private library at cost. Jefferson's 6,487 volumes formed {{the heart of}} the new Library of Congress collection. The second fire {{occurred}} in 1851 and destroyed all but 20,000 volumes in the Library of Congress collection. The damage to the Library of Congress collections prompted the Senate to preserve its records by designating space in the Capitol for the Senate Library. The Senate decided to procure and install <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> to replace wooden shelving to fireproof their collection from future damage.|$|R
50|$|The best {{shelving}} {{for books}} is baked enamel <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side {{so they can}} support each other. If a book {{is removed from the}} shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality. Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum. Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{activity of the}} House of Lords Record Office, however, in the immediate post-war years concerned {{the reconstruction of the}} repository. The Victoria Tower, although ample in dimensions, was found in 1948 to be defective both in its structure and its equipment. In the course of the following years the interior of the Tower was therefore almost entirely rebuilt by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works. The resulting repository was air conditioned and contained 5.5 mi of <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> on twelve floors. It was declared open by the Viscount Hailsham, Leader of the House of Lords, on 3 July 1963, with the intention, as he said, that [...] "this new building may have a long and distinguished career... in the service of Parliament, history, and culture". This lasted until the late 1990s, {{when it became clear that}} the air-conditioning in the repository was failing to comply with required standards, and other services needed updating.|$|R
50|$|Open <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> {{systems are}} cost effective, and easily {{adjusted}} to accommodate objects of various sizes. Deeper shelves are often utilized for larger objects, while smaller objects are typically stored on narrower shelves to avoid overcrowding, and potential damage when retrieving {{objects from the}} back of the shelf. Shelving units can accommodate the height of the ceiling if necessary, but it is safer for objects and those working with them to keep shelves within an easily accessible reach. If open shelving is used, it is suggested that the objects are placed in boxes, or otherwise covered to protect the objects from dust and other environmental factors. Metal shelving is prone to carry vibrations, so if objects are not individually housed in boxes or otherwise stabilized, it is recommended that the shelves be lined with a protective padding. It is also necessary for cabinets to be stabilized by being bolted to the floor or walls, and for shelves to have restraining bars, to avoid tipping, especially in earthquake prone areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} business grew quickly, but Comino {{never felt}} happy in printing and wanted further business challenges. In 1937, he established Dexion Ltd (from the Greek for 'right') to market products {{he had developed}} and patented to improve {{the efficiency of the}} printing process. These included: a gauge to check the squareness and register of a printer's forme; trolleys; chutes; a duplicate book; interlocking frames to hold print in place inside the chase; and a compositor's chart. As a printer, he was also concerned about the lack of versatility of the wooden shelving often for storing paper and other consumables. He began to work on <b>steel</b> <b>shelving</b> which could readily be assembled, dismantled and then reassembled. By 1939 he had developed an angled section made of steel with slots cut down one side and a long groove cut down the other. Birmingham-based Accles & Pollock manufactured an initial batch which was delivered in late August, a week before the declaration of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, and Comino sold most of this angled section to local stores of Lillywhites, John Lewis and Selfridges.|$|R
50|$|In 1889 he {{sold the}} company and moved to Philadelphia and started the Penn Metal Ceiling & Roofing Company. Penn Metal began {{manufacturing}} corrugated iron and steel roofing, galvanized conductor pipe, pressed metal ceilings, heavy duty <b>steel</b> lockers, cabinets, <b>shelving</b> and corrugated metal pipe.|$|R
5000|$|By May 1949, around 60 {{years after}} its establishment, Wormald Bros. became a public company, Wormald Brothers Industries Limited, with head offices in Sydney. As well as their core fire {{protection}} department, its other operating divisions included Metalbilt, manufacturing doors - including fire doors - and roller shutters; Steelbilt, manufacturers of storage equipment such as <b>steel</b> cabinets, <b>shelving</b> and cupboards and the license for the manufacture of products from the Kirsch Company - [...] "the world's largest manufacturer of Drapery hardware and Venetian Blinds" [...] A 1952 booklet titled [...] "The History of Wormald Brothers" [...] listed 18 Wormald, Steelbilt or Kirsch factories in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, Ballarat, Hobart, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch - as well as 10 other locations in Australia and New Zealand with 'Resident Representatives' or 'Resident Engineers'.|$|R
50|$|The {{warehouse}} premises at 70/72 Kilbirnie Street {{was used}} as a cash and carry warehouse by the Sher Brothers company, selling textiles, clothing and household goods. It was built as a stables in 1899, but in common with much of Glasgow's industrial premises at that time, had seen numerous uses over the years. It was a brick built construction of ground, first and attic floors, connected by internal stairs and a goods lift. The first floor was of concrete construction, and the attic floor of composite steel and timber, supported on cast iron columns. Internal partitioning consisted of timber frames with hardboard lining. An external steel stair opening off the attic and first floors acted as the fire escape route. Stock was arranged on <b>steel</b> frame <b>shelving</b> and stacked on the floor. The potential fire load was considered high following a fire prevention visit in December 1971 and again in March 1972. It had been occupied by the owners since 1970.|$|R
