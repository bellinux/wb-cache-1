50|$|<b>Bushpigs</b> {{are quite}} social animals and {{are found in}} {{sounders}} of up to 12 members. A typical group will consist of a dominant male and a dominant female, with other females and juveniles accounting for the rest. Litters of three to four young are born in summer after a gestation period of approximately four months. <b>Bushpigs</b> can be very aggressive, especially when they have young.|$|R

5000|$|Potamochoerus (meaning [...] "river pig") is a genus in the pig family (Suidae). The {{two species}} are {{restricted}} to sub-Saharan Africa, although the <b>bushpig,</b> possibly due to introduction by man, also occurs in Madagascar and nearby islands. Early in the 20th century, there {{were considered to be}} as many as five different species within the genus. These were gradually consolidated, until, in the 1970s, it was generally agreed that all were representatives of just a single species (P. porcus). The <b>bushpig</b> was again recognised as a separate species from about 1993.|$|E
40|$|As the world’s {{population}} {{increases the}} need for food and good protein sources grows, especially in development countries like Uganda. The pig production is growing rapidly in Uganda and {{is not only a}} source of food but also an important income for many people living in the rural areas. African Swine Fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease, which can cause up to 100 % mortality among domestic pigs. This disease is endemic in Uganda and causes major economical and personal losses for farmers whom it affects directly or indirectly. Outbreaks occur every now and then, and in most cases the source of the infection is unknown. To better understand the dynamics of the disease, and sources of new infections, the aims of this study were to study different possible reservoirs for ASF (domestic pigs, wild suids and Ornithodoros ticks), and also to estimate the prevalence in one district, Rakai, in Southern Uganda, where pig production is an important source of income for the rural community. Another aim was to investigate the spatial behavior of a small number of <b>bushpigs,</b> to understand the interaction between these wild suids and their domestic relatives. Do they ever get in contact and thereby have the possibility to transfer ASFV from one another? DNA from African swine fever virus (ASFV) was found by PCR in nine of 239 domestic pigs with no clinical signs and in three out of four sampled soft ticks (Ornithodoros porcinus). Antibodies against ASFV were found in two of four sampled <b>bushpigs,</b> the only warthog sampled in the study and in five of the 239 domestic pigs, using a commercially available ELISA. Three of the PCR positive pigs were borderline cases on the ELISA. GPS readings of the movement of the <b>bushpigs</b> indicated possible interface with the domestic pigs. Conclusions made from this study are that domestic pigs, <b>bushpigs,</b> warthogs and soft ticks can act as reservoirs for ASFV. Domestic pigs and <b>bushpigs</b> can interact. The prevalence of ASFV in Rakai was 3. 3 % while the seroprevalence was 2. 1 %. The most important finding was the subclinical, ASFV positive pigs...|$|R
50|$|African {{swine fever}} virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF). The virus causes a {{haemorrhagic}} fever with high mortality rates in pigs, but persistently infects its natural hosts, warthogs, <b>bushpigs,</b> and soft ticks of the Ornithodoros genus, with no disease signs.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} three {{difficulty}} levels: easy, medium and hard. In the easy and medium difficulties, little Tarzan gets tips from his friend Terk.

50|$|The red river hog {{lives in}} rainforests, wet dense savannas, and forested valleys, and near rivers, lakes and marshes. The species' {{distribution}} ranges from the Congo area and Gambia {{to the eastern}} Congo, southwards to the Kasai and the Congo River. The exact delineation of its range versus that of the <b>bushpig</b> is unclear; but in broad terms, the red river hog occupies western and central Africa, and the <b>bushpig</b> occupies eastern and southern Africa. Where the two meet, they are sometimes said to interbreed, although other authorities dispute this. Although numerous subspecies {{have been identified in}} the past, none are currently recognised.|$|E
50|$|Other animals present {{include the}} long-tailed pangolin, giant pangolin, tree pangolin, Angolan slender mongoose, aquatic genet, hippopotamus, the African golden cat, <b>bushpig,</b> bongo, yellow-backed duiker, sitatunga, okapi, bushbuck, water chevrotain and forest buffalo.|$|E
50|$|The {{virus is}} thought to be derived from a virus of soft tick (genus Ornithodoros) that infects wild swine, {{including}} giant forest hogs (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), and <b>bushpigs</b> (Potamochoerus porcus). In these wild hosts, infection is generally asymptomatic. This virus appears to have evolved around 1700 AD.|$|R

East African cheetahs are found at the plains of Chyulu Hills. Various snakes inhabit the hills, like black mamba, puff adder and rock python.|$|R
50|$|Game species {{range from}} African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus), roan antelopes (Hippotragus equinus), eastern black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis michaeli), Rothschild's giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi), oribis (Ourebia ourebi), cape buffalos, Lelwel hartebeests (Alcelaphus buselaphus lelwel), olive baboons, Bohor reedbucks (Redunca redunca), hyenas, servals (Leptailurus serval), topis (Damaliscus korrigum), honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), <b>bushpigs</b> (Potamochoerus larvatus) and vervet monkeys among others.|$|R
50|$|Common herbivores in {{the region}} include hippopotamus, <b>bushpig,</b> warthog, buffalo, common duiker, topi and waterbuck. Common {{carnivores}} in the reserve are the vulnerable African wild dog and the aardwolf. Although extremely rare, African elephants are also present in the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{which can}} be seen are kudu, zebra, giraffe, reedbuck, bushbuck, steenbok, tsessebe, impala, klipspringer, <b>bushpig</b> and warthog and the two species of jackal, {{while there are many}} smaller mammals which are not so easily seen, such as four species of mongoose.|$|E
50|$|Kolpochoerus is an extinct genus of the pig family Suidae {{related to}} the modern-day genera Hylochoerus and Potamochoerus. It is {{believed}} {{that most of them}} inhabited African forests, as opposed to the <b>bushpig</b> and red river hog that inhabit open brush and savannas. There are currently 8 recognized species.|$|E
50|$|The {{angonoka}} tortoise {{has been}} observed feeding on grasses found in open rocky areas of bamboo scrub. It is also known to eat shrubs, forbs, and herbs. While it has been seen eating dead bamboo leaves, {{it has never been}} observed eating living bamboo. As well as these plants, the tortoise has also been seen eating the dried feces of <b>bushpigs</b> and carnivores.|$|R
50|$|The mammals {{affected}} the environment. For example, the <b>bushpigs</b> which feed on roots, maggots, and insects helped to aerate the trees' root systems. The female giraffes feed on leaves and dispersed plants seeds while their faeces acted as fertiliser. The dung beetles {{also played a}} role by helping bring the manure underground where it is broken down by micro-organisms creating further plant life.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bushpigs,</b> Potamochoerus porcus, in a sugar-farming area of Natal, South Africa, {{were found}} to be omnivorous, but plant {{material}} dominated their diet year round. Sugar-cane stem was the main item identified in faeces collected on farmland during all seasons and in faeces from adjacent forest during winter and spring. Fruits were probably preferred to sugar cane by animals defecating in the forest during summer and autumn...|$|R
50|$|Animals in {{the park}} include zebra, wildebeest, reedbuck, blesbok, red hartebeest, oribi, leopard, serval, aardwolf, jackal and <b>bushpig.</b> The Natal ghost frog, plaintive rain frog and the gray's stream frog are endemic to Swaziland, South Africa and Lesotho. In Swaziland they have only been found in Afromontane mist belt forest.|$|E
50|$|Lagoons {{can have}} crocodiles. There are three trails in the reserve. One of which passes {{examples}} of mangrove swamps in South Africa, where {{several species of}} mangrove can be found. Another walk leads through the dune forest where <b>bushpig,</b> bushbuck and red, grey and blue duiker may occasionally be seen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wildlife}} {{park has}} a diverse ecosystem, which includes grasslands, a forest, and wetlands. [...] A number of mammals {{can be found}} in the reserve, including duiker, bushbuck, <b>bushpig,</b> civit, genet, mongoose and rock hyrax. [...] Herds of blesbok, blue wildebeest, impala and zebra have been introduced to the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral proteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the DNA strand displacement model. DNA templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by microtubular outwards viral transport.Pigs, warthogs, and <b>bushpigs</b> serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (arthropods and ticks). Transmission route: vector.|$|R
5000|$|The {{forests are}} home {{to a variety of}} {{wildlife}} including ungulates such yellow-backed duiker, blue duiker and their predators, as well as other species such as <b>bushpigs.</b> The only two endemic species are a mammal Rosevear's striped grass mouse, and a bird white-chested tinkerbird (Pogoniulus makawai). However the latter has not been actually spotted since 1964 and may in fact be a variant of the common and widespread yellow-rumped tinkerbird (Pogoniulus bilineatus).|$|R
2500|$|African {{swine fever}} virus (ASFV) is a large {{double-stranded}} DNA virus which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells {{and is the only}} member of the Asfarviridae family. The virus causes a lethal haemorraghic disease in domestic pigs. [...] Some strains can cause death of animals within as little as a week after infection. In other species, the virus causes no obvious disease. ASFV is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and exists in the wild through a cycle of infection between ticks and wild pigs, <b>bushpigs</b> and warthogs.|$|R
