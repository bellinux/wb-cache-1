50|$|The {{process of}} forming steam bubbles within liquid in micro {{cavities}} {{adjacent to the}} wall if the wall temperature at the heat transfer surface rises above the saturation temperature while {{the bulk of the}} liquid (heat exchanger) is subcooled. The bubbles grow until they reach some critical size, at which point they separate from the wall and are carried into the main fluid stream. There the bubbles collapse because the temperature of bulk fluid is not as high as at the heat transfer surface, where the bubbles were created. This collapsing is also responsible for the sound a water kettle produces during heat up but before the temperature at which <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> is reached.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} boiling of the direct contact of two immiscible liquids. An intense vapour formation at such a direct contact is possible below the <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> points of both components, meaning an effective decrease of the boiling temperature of the system. Although the phenomenon is known in science and widely employed in technology, the direct contact boiling process was thoroughly studied (both experimentally and theoretically) only for the case where one of liquids is becoming heated above its <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> point. On the contrary, we address the case where both liquids remain below their <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> points. In this paper we construct the theoretical description of the boiling process and discuss the actualisation of the case we consider for real systems. Comment: 17 page, 7 figures, accepted to Eur.

Steady-state analyses are included for pressure drops, flow distribution, orificing, burnout, fuel and burnout cannot occur at any attainable reactor power in the CETR as designed. <b>Bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> of the coolant does not occur {{at any point in}} the core during normal steadystate operation. <b>Bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> is permitted during transients because very few fuel channels are involved and the resulting effects on over-all reactor performance are small. Local boiling of the coolant may occur in the reactor during normal steady-state operation and has no appreciable effect on reactor operation except a slight increase in friction pressure drop. The heat-transfer characteristics of the core are actually improved. The hydraulic transient analyses show that no risk of core damage exists for the total loss of forced coolant flow from either maximum or minimum initial flow conditions. (auth...|$|E
50|$|If {{the heat}} flux of a boiling system {{is higher than}} the {{critical}} heat flux (CHF) of the system, the <b>bulk</b> fluid may <b>boil,</b> or in some cases, regions of the <b>bulk</b> fluid may <b>boil</b> where the fluid travels in small channels. Thus large bubbles form, sometimes blocking the passage of the fluid. This results in a departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) in which steam bubbles no longer break away from the solid surface of the channel, bubbles dominate the channel or surface, and the heat flux dramatically decreases. Vapor essentially insulates the bulk liquid from the hot surface.|$|R

We have developed a PIV processing methodology that extracts measurements of the particle-displacement histogram from a flow video or ensemble of flow-image pairs. Single-pixel measurement of mean velocity {{can be obtained from}} an ensemble of {Omicron} 10 {sup 3 } images. Measurements of higher-order moments of the velocity histogram require spatial averaging (i. e., lower spatial resolution), larger ensembles of images, or a combination of the two.

40|$|Many flow {{regimes in}} Nuclear Reactor Safety (NRS) Research are {{characterized}} by multiphase flows, {{where one of the}} phases is continuous and the other phase consists of gas or vapor of the liquid phase. The validation of the CFD multiphase flow models against detailed experimental data for simplified flow configurations is a basic requirement for the accurate prediction of more complex flows, like e. g. multiphase flow in fuel rod assemblies with spacer grids under the conditions from ONB to DNB including <b>bulk</b> and wall <b>boiling</b> in a pressurized polydisperse liquid-vapor flow. This paper is therefore aimed on validation of the underlying multiphase flow modeling concepts for gas-liquid monodisperse and polydisperse bubbly flows.

The model uses a lumped parameters approach for the cou-pled kinetics (point reactor) and thermal-hydraulics, with continuous reactivity feedback due to coolant and fuel temperature effects. The model predictions are qualified by comparing with results from detailed simulations of reactivity insertion transients reported in the literature. Satisfactory results have been obtained for various reactivity insertion rates, up to insertions as high as $ 1. 5.

40|$|Abstract – Investigations into boiling, the {{generation}} of vapor and the prediction of its behavior are important in the stability of boiling water reactors (BWR). The present models are limited to simplifications made to draw governing equations or lack of closure framework of the constitutive relations. The commercial codes fall into this category as well. Consequently, researchers cannot simply find the comprehensive updated relations before simplification {{in order to simplify}} them for their own works. This study offers a state of the art, phase-weighted, ensemble-averaged, two-phase flow, two-fluid model for the simulation of two-phase flow with heat and mass transfer. This approach is then used for modeling the <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> (thermal-hydraulic modeling) in BWR. The resultant approach is based on using the energy balance equation to find a relation for quality of vapor at any point. The equations are solved using SIMPLE algorithm in the finite volume method and the results compared with real BWR (PB 2 BWR/ 4 NPP) and the boiling data. Comparison shows that the present model is satisfactorily improved in accuracy...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrated}} an inverted U-shape heat driven pump {{consisting of a}} microchannel heat sink, two vertical branches and two miniature check valves. A new criterion, which is governed by the fluid physical properties, the geometry effect and the heat transfer rates at various oscillating stages, was developed. The theory can explain the operating range of the applied heating power. The dynamic measurements with a high speed data acquisition system shows that periodically a full cycle can be subdivided into a short liquid suction stage, a <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> and a fluid discharge stage, followed by a pressure decrease stage with both of the valves closed. The average mass flow rate is small and can be computed by the energy conservation equation. The cycle period is shortened with increasing the applied heating power. The wall temperatures of the microchannel heat sink are oscillating with small amplitudes but they are slightly higher than the saturated temperature of the working fluid by several degrees. Deionized water {{was selected as the}} working fluid. Finally a closed loop heat driven pump design incorporating the microchannel heat sink and the condenser fin heat sink is proposed.

40|$|In modern, high-speed, direct {{injection}} diesel engines for passenger vehicles, there is extensive impingement {{of the fuel}} sprays on to the piston bowl walls. Recent trends towards smaller engine sizes, equipped with high-pressure common-rail fuel injection systems, have tended to increase the spray/piston wall interaction. This paper describes tests carried out in a high-speed {{direct injection}} automotive diesel engine, during which {{the temperature of the}} piston was increased in a controlled manner between 189 and 227 degrees C while being continuously monitored. The aim of the work was to quantify the effects of piston temperature on pollutant exhaust emissions. The results show a significant reduction in unburned hydrocarbon emission, a significant increase in smoke emission, and no significant change in the emission of oxides of nitrogen. The increase in smoke emission cannot be ascribed to changes in the engine volumetric efficiency or air-fuel ratio. The paper demonstrates that fuel spray deposition on the piston surface was {{in the form of a}} thin film that did not experience <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling.</b> A number of suggestions are put forward to help explain the observed changes in exhaust emissions with increasing piston temperature...|$|E

40|$|Over 30 years ago, Griffith {{showed that}} {{unstable}} and periodic initial boiling occurred in stagnant liquids in heated pipes coupled to a cooler or condensing plenum volume. This was called ``geysering``, {{and is a}} similar phenomenon to the rapid nucleation and voiding observed in tubes filled with superheated liquid. It is also called ``bumping`` when non-uniformly heated water or a chemical suddenly boils in laboratory glassware. In engineering, the stability and predictability has importance to the onset of <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> in a natural and forced circulation loops. The latest available data show the observed stability and periodicity of the onset of boiling flow {{when there is a}} plenum, multiple heated channels, and a sustained subcooling in a circulating loop. We examine the available data, both old and new, and develop a new theory to illustrate the simple physics causing the observed periodicity of the flow. We examine the validity of the theory by comparison to all the geysering data, and develop a useful and simple correlation. We illustrate the equivalence of the onset of geysering to the onset of static instability in subcooled boiling. We also derive the stability boundary for geysering, utilizing turbulent transport analysis {{to determine the effects of}} pressure and other key parameters. This new result explains the greater stability region observed at higher pressures. The paper builds on the 30 years of quite independent thermal hydraulic work that is still fresh and useful today.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{iron oxide}} crud was studied at 25 ºC {{and over the}} range 240 to 270 ºC in a high pressure water loop. Crud deposition and removal was measured in two parallel, heated Zircaloy- 2 tubes using iron- 59 as a radioactive tracer. This {{proved to be a}} powerful technique capable of detecting crud deposits less than 3 run thick. Rapid deposition of crud was observed following injection into the loop of an iron oxide suspension or a ferric nitrate solution. Crud deposited preferentially on heated surfaces when they were present but not to the exclusion of deposition elsewhere; hot spots on heated surfaces attracted additional deposits. Subcooled boiling appeared to be a more important factor than <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> in the enhancement of crud deposition. The initial rapid deposition of the bulk of the crud throughout the loop was usually followed by a slower transfer of crud from other surfaces to any heated surface present. Unsteady operating conditions, e. g. a change in power, temperature or pH, frequently caused crud bursts, but once steady conditions were re-established the entrained crud was quickly redeposited. The bulk of deposited crud was not readily re-entrained, particularly from heated surfaces, so that crud bursts involved {{only a fraction of the}} total crud deposited. Ferric nitrate solutions injected into the loop formed haematite which deposited more slowly and formed more mobile deposits than magnetite which was injected directly into the loop as a slurry.

40|$|An {{analytic}} model for pressurization and cryogenic propellant conditions during all mission phases of any liquid rocket based vehicle {{has been developed}} and validated. The model assumes the propellant tanks to be divided into five nodes and also implements an empirical correlation for liquid stratification if desired. The five nodes include a tank wall node exposed to ullage gas, an ullage gas node, a saturated propellant vapor node at the liquid-vapor interface, a liquid node, and a tank wall node exposed to liquid. The conservation equations of mass and energy are then applied across all the node boundaries and, {{with the use of}} perfect gas assumptions, explicit solutions for ullage and liquid conditions are derived. All fluid properties are updated real time using NIST Refprop. 1 Further, mass transfer at the liquid-vapor interface is included in the form of evaporation, <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> of liquid propellant, and condensation given the appropriate conditions for each. Model validation has proven highly successful against previous {{analytic model}}s and various Saturn era test data and reasonably successful against more recent LH 2 tank self pressurization ground test data. Finally, this model has been applied to numerous design iterations for the Altair Lunar Lander, Ares V Core Stage, and Ares V Earth Departure Stage in order to characterize Helium and autogenous pressurant requirements, propellant lost to evaporation and thermodynamic venting to maintain propellant conditions, and non-uniform tank draining in configurations utilizing multiple LH 2 or LO 2 propellant tanks. In conclusion, this model provides an accurate and efficient means of analyzing multiple design configurations for any cryogenic propellant tank in launch, low-acceleration coast, or in-space maneuvering and supplies the user with pressurization requirements, unusable propellants from evaporation and liquid stratification, and general ullage gas, liquid, and tank wall conditions as functions of time...|$|E
40|$|The Reactor Recirculation System {{has been}} {{designed}} to perform the following functions: a. To provide forced circulation of reactor water through the core to overcome the power density limitation of the fuel. b. To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, pipe support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant. To control reactor power level, the system makes use of the boiling water reactor large negative power coefficient. A power level increase is achieved b...|$|E
40|$|Removal {{of decay}} heat from an {{operating}} reactor during a prolonged station blackout condition {{is a big}} concern for reactor designers, especially after the recent Fukushima accident. In {{the case of a}} prolonged station blackout condition, heat removal is possible only by passive means since no pumps or active systems are available. Keeping this in mind, the AHWR has been designed with many passive safety features. One of them is a passive means of removing decay heat with the help of Isolation Condensers (ICs) which are submerged in a big water pool called the Gravity Driven Water Pool (GDWP). The ICs have many tubes in which the steam, generated by the reactor core due to the decay heat, flows and condenses by rejecting the heat into the water pool. After condensation, the condensate falls back into the steam drum of the reactor. The GDWP tank holds a large amount of water, about 8000 m 3, which is located at a higher elevation than the steam drum of the reactor in order to promote natural circulation. Due to the recent Fukushima type accidents, it has been a concern to understand and evaluate the capability of the ICs to remove decay heat for a prolonged period without escalating fuel sheath temperature. In view of this, an analysis has been performed for decay heat removal characteristics over several days of an AHWR by ICs. The computer code RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 was used for this purpose. Results indicate that the ICs can remove the decay heat for more than 10 days without causing any <b>bulk</b> <b>boiling</b> in the GDWP. After that, decay heat can be removed for more than 40 days by boiling off the pool inventory. The pressure inside the containment does not exceed the design pressure even after 10 days by condensation of steam generated from the GDWP on the walls of containment and on the Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS) tubes. If venting is carried out after this period, the decay heat can be removed for more than 50 days without exceeding the design limits...|$|E
40|$|A {{model has}} been derived to predict the {{frictional}} pressure gradient along a heated channel. It focuses mainly on flow boiling at high-pressure conditions (10 MPa). Based on a force-momentum balance, the overall pressure gradient {{is divided into three}} components: friction, acceleration and gravity. This model analyzes the frictional pressure drop for all heat-transfer modes encountered inside a heated channel: single-phase heat transfer, subcooled boiling, saturated (<b>bulk)</b> <b>boiling,</b> forced convective evaporation and film boiling. The heating effect is introduced through a change in flow structure in two-phase flow (i. e., the phase distribution), particularly the significant differences in entrained liquid fraction between adiabatic and boiling two-phase flow (two separate correlations have been derived in this study). One of the major components in this model is the relation between shear stress and velocity gradient. Based primarily on the theory in single-phase flow, this relation is extended to two-phase flow boiling through the assumption of a homogeneous mixture having the characteristics of a single-phase flow. In the forced-convective evaporation region (mainly wispy-annular flow), a four-layer structure is introduced to analyze the liquid film and two-phase core. A number of assumptions and modifications to the expressions for single-phase flow are introduced to account for the presence of two phases. Empirical corrections, however, are used for the effects of surface roughness and viscosity difference between near-wall fluid and bulk fluid on two-phase frictional pressure drop. Experimental data for validating the present model were obtained in a vertical tubular test section, installed in a high-pressure steam-water facility at the Chalk River Laboratories of AECL Research. A strong effect of surface heating on frictional pressure drop was observed. With increasing heat flux, the frictional pressure drop decreases in single-phase flow, increases in nucleate boiling, and decreases in forced convective evaporation. The effect of heat flux in the film-boiling region (post-dryout conditions) appears to be small. However, the frictional pressure gradient is much smaller in the film-boiling region than in the pre-CHF region for the same flow conditions (i. e., pressure, mass flux and quality). For most flow conditions, a maximum in two-phase frictional pressure drop is encountered at a quality lower than the value corresponding to the occurrence of dryout. In addition to heating, other effects on frictional pressure drop (such as pressure, mass flux, etc.) have also been examined. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
