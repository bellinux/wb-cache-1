Accordingly, we sallied forth, and speedily arrived at the hotel which Attwood {{inhabited}} still. He had occupied, for a time, very fine apartments in this house: and it was only on arriving there that day that we found he had been gradually driven from his magnificent suite of rooms au premier, to a little chamber in the fifth story:--we mounted, and found him. It was a little shabby room, with a few articles of rickety furniture, and a bed in an alcove; the light from the one window was falling full upon the bed and the <b>body.</b> <b>Jack</b> was dressed in a fine lawn shirt; he had kept it, poor fellow, TO DIE IN; for in all his drawers and cupboards there was not a single article of clothing; he had pawned everything by which he could raise a penny--desk, books, dressing-case, and clothes; and not a single halfpenny was found in his possession.* ...|$|E

50|$|Upon {{recruitment}} each Green Lantern in {{the original}} Corps received a Power Ring, a Power Battery shaped like a lantern (with which the ring is recharged), and a uniform. The default uniform design for humanoids was a green section covering the torso and shoulders, black arms and leggings, green boots, white gloves, green domino mask, and a chest symbol of a stylized Green Lantern icon on a white circle. Lanterns were allowed to customize their uniforms {{as long as the}} color scheme and the symbol were present. When the nature of the being precludes a standard uniform, an equivalent arrangement is expected as a substitute. For instance, Mogo, a sentient planet, arranges his foliage to create a green circling band and lantern symbol on his <b>body.</b> <b>Jack</b> T. Chance, a humanoid, refused to wear a uniform, but conceded to wearing a badge on the lapel of his coat. Lanterns were also allowed the option of a secret identity as a security measure and it is implied that the Corps were instructed to honor that choice by taking care not to expose them. Training {{in the use of the}} ring was optional and appropriate facilities and personnel were available on Oa upon request. In addition, a senior Lantern can be assigned to coach a recruit while in the field in their sector.|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis titled Euthanasia in {{the film}} an {{analysis}} of selected pieces, is divided into theoretical and practical parts. I devoted to {{a description of a}} current state of euthanasia in the theoretical part. First I focused on definitions of euthanasia, assisted suicide etc. A chapter is also devoted to a history of euthanasia. I wanted to highlight the fact, that euthanasia is not only a problem of the modern society, but beginnings of a discussion about euthanasia we could find already in the ancient world. Through the concept of euthanasia in the Middle Ages and modern times I got up to the World War II, which is in my opinion an important milestone in the history of euthanasia, because at that time euthanasia was perceived as a tool for a disposal of persons who, in the context of its time, seemed to be undesirable. Among such people there were classified for example people so called racially unsuitable, weak and sick. Because there are legally different views of euthanasia, in chapters I mention the fact how euthanasia is perceived in the world. In terms of acceptance of euthanasia and assisted suicide I particularly emphasize the Netherlands and Switzerland. One chapter I also dedicate to euthanasia in the Czech Republic. It includes a description of the discussion and arguments for and against euthanasia. One more separate chapter I devoted to questions whether to legalize or not to legalize euthanasia. I found out that a discussion on this topic is very extensive and here could be applied the rule that each man has his own opinion. It turned out that even experts in one area, doctors of philosophers, are not unanimous in the issue of euthanasia and its pros and cons are from both sides argued with plenty of arguments that are worth thinking about. A separate chapter I devoted to a man, who I consider to be the main promoter of euthanasia and assisted suicide and if you pronounce his name, people would link him with that theme. This is Dr. Jack Kevorkian, nicknamed Dr. Death. Jack Kevorkian, who understood his acts as medical services for terminally ill people, helped with the voluntary termination of life to several hundred of people. Although he had written certain "rules" about the situations when he can people "help" to solve their suffering and pain, it turned out that those people in many cases had no anatomical evidence of disease in their <b>body.</b> <b>Jack</b> Kevorkian has had and even currently has many supporters and opponents. In case of Jack Kevorkian there are arguments for and against euthanasia as in the whole debate about it. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse how the topic of euthanasia has been reflected {{in the film}} production. At the beginning of the research I have asked this research question: Which are usual attitudes to euthanasia reflected in filmmaking? In order to find out the given objective and to answer the research question I chose a qualitative research based on the method of disinterested observation of six selected movie titles. Titles in their alphabetical order were following: Doktor smrt (You Don´t Know Jack, USA, 2010, 134 min), Hlas moře (Mar adentro, Španělsko/Francie/Itálie, 2004, 125 min), Hodinu nevíš, Česko, 2009, 94 min), Invaze barbarů (Invasion barbares, Kanada/Fancie, 2003, 99 min), Millon Dollar Baby, (USA, 2004, 132 min) a Skafandr a motýl (Le Scaphandre et le papillon, Francie/USA, 2007, 107 min) ...|$|E
