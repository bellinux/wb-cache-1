40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of margin {{requirements}} on asset prices, trading volume and investors' welfare in a general equilibrium asset pricing model where investors differ in their degree of risk aversion. In the stationary equilibrium of the model <b>binding</b> <b>margin</b> requirements decrease the riskless rate and increase its volatility, as well as stock trading volume. Contrary to previous partial equilibrium results, stock prices are not affected by margin requirements. Small changes in margin requirements produce large effects on the long-run distribution of wealth among investors. From a welfare perspective margin requirements might benefit the constrained less risk averse investors, while they always make more risk averse investors worse-off. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of option trading and margin rules on the {{behavior}} of informed traders and on the micro structure of stock and option markets. In the absence of <b>binding</b> <b>margin</b> requirements, the introduction of an options market causes informed traders to exhibit a relative trading bias towards the stock because of its greater information sensitivity. In turn, this widens the stock's bid-ask spread. But when informed traders are subject to margin requirements, their bias towards the stock is enhanced or mitigated depending on the leverage provided by the option relative to the stock, leading to wider or narrower stock bid-ask spreads. The introduction of option trading, with or without margin requirements, unambiguously improves the informational efficiency of stock prices. Margin rules improve market efficiency when stock and option margins are sufficiently large or small but not when they are of moderate size. ...|$|E

The overall evidence suggests that the recapitalization plan effectively relaxed LTCM's binding constraints and therefore reversed the profitability of front running.

Fang Cai * Abstract: This paper uses a unique dataset of audit trail transactions to examine the trading behavior of market makers in the Treasury bond futures market when Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) faced <b>binding</b> <b>margin</b> constraints in 1998. Although identities are concealed in the dataset, I find strong evidence that during the crisis market makers in the aggregate engaged in front running against customer orders from a particular clearing firm (coded “PI 7 ”) that closely match various features of LTCM’s trades through Bear Stearns. That is, market makers traded on their own accounts {{in the same direction as}} PI 7 customers did, but one or two minutes beforehand. Furthermore, a significant percentage of market makers made abnormal profits on most of the trading days during the crisis. Their aggregate abnormal profits, however, were more than offset by abnormal losses realized after the private sector recapitalization of LTCM. Moreover, I show that before the rescue, a market maker’s cumulative abnormal profit was positively correlated both to her tie as contra party with PI 7 and to the intensity of her front running, but these relationships turned negative after the rescue.

However, The Books of the Bible does not include the Apocrypha, nor does it have the same level of production and design quality found in Bibliotheca (e.g. Despite being available in multiple volumes, The Books of the Bible, like traditional Bibles, still features Bible paper, does not have a sewn <b>binding,</b> has narrow <b>margins,</b> and is typeset with a comparatively utilitarian typeface and page layout).|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{this paper}} is also related to the {{literature}} on behavior {{in the presence of}} credit market imperfection. In a wide variety of settings, credit market imperfections have been shown to fundamentally alter the properties of equilibrium, giving rise for example to non-monotonic, and/or distributionally sensitive comparative statics responses (Galor and Zeira 1993; Matsuyama 2008). In the context of migration, credit market imperfection is expected to play a critical role particularly when the upfront cost of migration is significant. Indeed, several studies (Du et al. 2005; McKenzie and Rapoport 2007) document an inverted-U shape relationship between household endowments and migration likelihood. That is, households with middle wealth are more willing to and able to migrate. Some recent empirical evidences from Indonesia (Bazzi 2013) and Mexico (Angelucci 2013) suggest that relaxing financial constraints encourage international migration, particularly in households in which financial constraints to migration are <b>binding</b> at the <b>margin.</b>|$|R
60|$|I inquired {{after the}} fate of Mr. Roscoe's library, which had {{consisted}} of scarce and foreign books, from many {{of which he had}} drawn the materials for his Italian histories. It had passed under the hammer of the auctioneer, and was dispersed about the country. The good people of the vicinity thronged liked wreckers to get some part of the noble vessel that had been driven on shore. Did such a scene admit of ludicrous associations, we might imagine something whimsical in this strange irruption in the regions of learning. Pigmies rummaging the armory of a giant, and contending for the possession of weapons which they could not wield. We might picture to ourselves some knot of speculators, debating with calculating brow over the quaint <b>binding</b> and illuminated <b>margin</b> of an obsolete author; of the air of intense, but baffled sagacity, with which some successful purchaser attempted to dive into the black-letter bargain he had secured.|$|R
6000|$|There came {{moments when}} I grew {{slightly}} alarmed, as, for instance, one Sunday {{in the early}} spring when I was dining at the Ezra Hutchins's house and surprised Mrs. Hutchins's glance on me, suspecting her of seeking to divine what manner of man I was. I became self-conscious; I dared not look at Maude, who sat across the table; thereafter I began to feel that the Hutchins connection regarded me as a suitor. I had grown intimate with George and his wife, who did not refrain from sly allusions; and George himself once remarked, with characteristic tact, that I was most conscientious in my attention to the traction affair; I have reason to believe they were even less delicate with Maude. This was the logical time to withdraw--but I dallied. The experience was becoming more engrossing,--if I may so describe it,--and spring was approaching. The stars in their courses were conspiring. I was by no means as yet a self-acknowledged wooer, and we discussed love in its lighter phases through the medium of literature. Heaven forgive me for calling it so! About that period, it will be remembered, a mushroom growth of volumes of a certain kind sprang into existence; little books with [...] "artistic" [...] <b>bindings</b> and wide <b>margins,</b> sweetened essays, some of them written in beautiful English by dilettante authors for drawing-room consumption; and collections of short stories, no doubt chiefly bought by philanderers like myself, who were thus enabled to skate on thin ice over deep water. It was a most delightful relationship that these helped to support, and I fondly believed I could reach shore again whenever I chose.|$|R
