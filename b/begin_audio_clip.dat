40|$|In this thesis, I {{designed}} {{a system for}} augmenting a space with linked audio. Using this system, individuals can associate <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> with a location in real-world space. When an individual using the system passes through this augmented space, {{he or she can}} hear the <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> that have been left by traveling through the associated locations. Furthermore, <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> in the environment can be linked together, so that an individual listening to one <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> can be directed to related <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> in the augmented space. In addition, a method of allowing the user to navigate through the augmented space is presented. by Joseph Michale Rozier. Thesis (S. B. and M. Eng.)

40|$|This paper {{considers}} computer-assisted {{learning of}} sound spectra in environmental recordings to facilitate manual bird species identification. Today, {{a variety of}} automated methods have been successfully applied for acoustic recognition of specific bird species. These methods are more effective for single targeted species detection. For in-field recordings, however, simultaneous vocalisations and unknown species usually make such methods less effective. In this study, we propose a non-negative matrix factorisation based method to facilitate manual bird species identification from environmental recordings. First, distinct sound spectra are extracted from each <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> by applying non-negative matrix factorisation and clustering techniques. Based on these distinct sound spectra, a greedy algorithm is then designed to sample <b>audio</b> <b>clips.</b> Each sampled <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> maximises {{the number of new}} spectra. People who follow this sampled sequence of <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> should be able to identify the most species given a fixed number of <b>audio</b> <b>clips.</b> The efficiency is validated with annotated bird species per minute provided by experienced ornithologists...|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, each sample used in {{the experiments}} is an <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> with duration of 2  s. The network models are trained to detect whether any vocal sound (singing voice) {{is present in the}} clip or not. Note that we consider {{that as long as the}} presence of vocal signal is distinguishable, it could only be in a portion of the <b>audio</b> <b>clip.</b> Furthermore, <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> containing vocal sounds from backing vocalists are also classified as vocal clips. In the experiments, the ground truth (vocal or non-vocal status) of the samples is annotated by human listeners.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for the similarity measure and ranking of <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> by graph modeling and matching. Instead of using frame-based or salient-based features to measure the acoustical similarity of <b>audio</b> <b>clips,</b> segment-based similarity is proposed. The novelty of our approach lies in two aspects: segment-based representation, and the similarity measure and ranking based on four kinds of similarity factors. In segment-based representation, segments not only capture the change property of <b>audio</b> <b>clip,</b> but also keep and present the change relation and temporal order of audio features. In the similarity measure and ranking, four kinds of similarity factors: acoustical, granularity, temporal order and interference are progressively and jointly measured by optimal matching and dynamic programming, which guarantee the comprehensive and sufficient similarity measure between two <b>audio</b> <b>clips.</b> The experimental result shows that the proposed approach is better than some existing methods in terms of retrieval and ranking capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{programmable}} field acoustic sensors provide immense {{data for}} bird species study. Manually searching for bird species present in these acoustic data is time-consuming. Although automated techniques {{have been used}} for species recognition in many studies, currently these techniques are prone to error due to the complexity of natural acoustics. In this paper we propose a smart sampling approach to help identify the maximum number of bird species while listening to the minimum amount of acoustic data. This approach samples <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> in a manner that can direct bird species surveys more efficiently. First, a classifier is built to remove <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> that are unlikely to contain birds; second, the remaining <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> are ranked by a proxy for the number of species. This technique enables a more efficient determination of species richness. The experimental results show that the use of a classifier enables to remove redundant acoustic data and make our approach resilient to various weather conditions. By ranking <b>audio</b> <b>clips</b> classified as “Birds”, our method outperforms the currently best published strategy for finding bird species after 30 one-minute <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> samples. Particularly after 60 samples, our method achieves 10 percentage points more species. Despite our focus on bird species, the proposed sampling approach is applicable to the search of other vocal species...|$|R
