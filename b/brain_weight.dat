40|$|Background:Failure in the {{regulation}} of homeostatic water balance in the brain is associated with severe cerebral edema and increased <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> and may also {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the aquaporin- 4 water channel-encoding gene (AQP 4), which were previously shown to be associated with (i) SIDS in Norwegian infants (rs 2075575), (ii) severe brain edema (rs 9951307), and (iii) increased brain water permeability (rs 3906956). We also determined whether the brain/body weight ratio is increased in SIDS infants compared with sex- and age-matched controls. Methods:Genotyping of the three AQP 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in 160 Caucasian SIDS infants and 181 healthy Swiss adults using a single-base extension method. <b>Brain</b> and body <b>weights</b> were measured during autopsy in 157 SIDS and 59 non-SIDS infants. Results:No differences were detected in the allelic frequencies of the three AQP 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms between SIDS and adult controls. The brain/body weight ratio was similarly distributed in SIDS and non-SIDS infants. Conclusion:Variations in the AQP 4 gene seem of limited significance as predisposing factors in Caucasian SIDS infants.

Consistently, western immunoblot analysis showed that myelin basic protein abundance in the cerebellum of TNF-α/IGF-I Tg mice was double that in TNF-α Tg mice. Compared to WT mice, the number of oligodendrocytes was decreased by ~ 36 % in TNF-α Tg mice, while it was increased in IGF-I Tg mice by ~ 40 %. Oligodendrocyte number in TNF-α/IGF-I Tg mice was almost as twice many as that in TNF-α Tg mice.

Here, Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in low exogenous estrogen environments. After breeding at adulthood, dams were gavaged on gestational days (GDs) 6 – 21 with vehicle (VEH), 2. 5 or 25. 0 mg/ kg/day BPA, or 5. 0 or 10. 0 mg/kg/day ethinyl estradiol (EE 2). Offspring were orally treated on postnatal days (PNDs) 1 – 21 with the same dose the dam received. Relative to the VEH group, dams of both EE 2 -treated groups weighed less throughout gestation and lactation. PND 1 absolute anogenital distance and anogenital index were unaltered by any treatment.

Arachidonic acid (AA) is a {{fatty acid}} that is impor-tant for visual and brain {{development}} and is commonly added as a functional food ingredient to commercial infant formulas worldwide. However, {{few studies have}} examined whether AA supplementation during neonatal life has an effect on neuronal abnormalities. In the present study, the effect of dietary AA supplementation in dams during gestation and lactation was investigated by examining N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) -induced cerebellar hypoplasia in young Lewis rats. Dams were fed a 2. 0 % AA diet or a basal diet (< 0. 01 % AA). At birth (postnatal day 0), male and female pups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg MNU or vehicle. <b>Brain</b> <b>weights</b> were measured and a morphological analysis of macroscopic and histological specimens was conducted after 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 days. Irrespective of whether the rats had been fed an AA diet, the <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> of the MNU-treated rats, particularly the weights of the cerebellum, were decreased compared with those of the MNU-untreated rats from the 14 th day following the MNU injection. Macroscopic reductions in the cerebellar length and/or width and histologically observed reductions in cerebellar vertex height and/or cortex width were also detected in the MNU-treated rats, irrespective of whether the rats had been fed with AA. Histopathologically, the MNU-treated rats (irrespective of AA supplementation) exhibited disorganization of the cerebellar cortex and disar-rangement of the cortical layers (loss and/or disturbance of the molecular, Purkinje and granular cell layers). There {{were no significant differences in}} any parameters among the MNU-treated rats, irrespective of whether the rats had been fed an AA diet.

SD was elicited at 20 -min intervals by applying 2 % KCl for 1 min to a site on the frontal cortex and its occurrence was monitored at 2 sites in the parietal region by recording the electrocorticogram and the slow potential change of SD. When compared to control rats fed a commercial diet with 23 % protein, early malnourished rats showed deficits in body and <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> (10 % to 60 % and 3 % to 15 %, respectively), as well as increases in velocity of SD propagation (10 % to 20 %).

The effects of 1 -week restrictions on SD were less evident in the pups malnourished during the second week of lactation and were more evident in pups receiving the RBD during the third week.
