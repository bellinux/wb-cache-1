50|$|Differential {{tempering}} (also called graded tempering, selective tempering {{or local}} tempering) is the inverse of differential hardening, to ultimately produce similar results. Differential tempering begins by taking steel {{that has been}} uniformly quenched and hardened, and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for tempering cutting instruments, softening the <b>back,</b> <b>shaft,</b> or spine, but simultaneously tempering the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} shaft voltage in different configurations of a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and an Induction Generator (IG) with a back-to-back inverter in wind turbine applications. Detailed high frequency {{model of the}} proposed systems have been developed based on existing capacitive couplings in IG & DFIG structures and common mode voltage sources. In this research work, several arrangements of DFIG based wind energy conversion systems are investigated on shaft voltage calculation and its mitigation techniques. Placements of an LC line filter in different locations {{and its effects on}} shaft voltage elimination are studied with mathematical analysis and simulations.

50|$|There is a {{proposal}} to build a 480 megawatt combined wind farm-hydroelectric facility at this location which could contribute towards the county's goal of becoming self-sufficient in energy supply.

When required, the reservoirs would feed power generating turbines by allowing the water to fall down a <b>shaft</b> <b>back</b> to the ocean.|$|R
5000|$|Frenulum breve, {{or short}} frenulum, is a {{condition}} in which the frenulum of the penis, which is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the foreskin and helps contract it over the glans, is too short and thus restricts the movement of the foreskin. The frenulum should normally be sufficiently long and supple to allow for the full retraction of the foreskin so that it lies smoothly <b>back</b> on the <b>shaft</b> of the erect penis.|$|R
60|$|Across, {{seated on}} a pouffe {{on the other side}} of the fire, was a cameo-like girl with neat black hair done tight and bright in the French mode. She had strangely-drawn eyebrows, and her colour was brilliant. She was hot, leaning <b>back</b> behind the <b>shaft</b> of old marble of the mantel-piece, to escape the fire. She wore a simple dress of apple-green satin, with full sleeves and ample skirt and a tiny bodice of green cloth. This was Josephine Ford, the girl Jim was engaged to.|$|R
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of the R16, {{and later}} Renault 5, design {{is that the}} two <b>back</b> wheel axle <b>shafts</b> are not in-line. The left wheelbase is 70 mm (2.76 in) longer than the right wheelbase, to accommodate the torsion bar suspension. This and the soft front seats gives the car a particularly smooth ride even over big bumps. The suspension has the longest travel on a car of this size; if the handbrake is applied and reverse gear engaged, the rear bumper will raise about one foot.|$|R
50|$|At the 115 fathom {{level the}} air was still deemed too {{poisonous}} for the rescuers, this being indicated by the immediate extinguishing of candles which had been lowered further into the shaft. The Mine Inspector tried to obtain a sample of air for testing, however he was almost immediately overcome by the air and was quickly hauled <b>back</b> up the <b>shaft.</b> The body of a miner was observed at the 130 fathom level, however the rescuers were unable to reach {{it because of the}} air and the search was again suspended.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to combining digital fabrication and craft, emphasizing the user experience. While many researchers strive to enable makers to design and produce 3 D objects, our research seeks to present a new fabrication approach to make unique, one-of-a-kind artifacts. To that end, we developed the FreeD, a hand-held digital milling device. The system is guided and monitored by a computer while preserving the maker’s freedom to sculpt and carve, and to manipulate the work in many crea-tive ways. Relying on a predesigned 3 D model, the com-puter gets into action only when the milling bit risks the object’s integrity, by slowing down the spindle’s speed or by drawing <b>back</b> the <b>shaft,</b> {{while the rest of}} the time it al-lows complete gestural freedom. We describe the key con-cepts of our work and its motivation, present the FreeD’s architecture and technology, and discuss two projects made with the tool...|$|R

5000|$|The {{unrelated}} Truro Company {{was formed}} by investors in 1849, which re-excavated the <b>shaft</b> <b>back</b> down to the 86 ft level.

According to a nineteenth-century account, the drill or pod auger passed through a spruce platform at 98 ft. After this platform, the drill hit layers of oak, what was described as [...] "metal in pieces", another spruce layer, and finally clay for 7 ft without striking anything else.

As he rushed past he saw the face of Ostrog's aeronaut confident and cool and in Ostrog's attitude a wincing resolution. Ostrog was looking steadfastly away from him--to the south. He realized with a gleam of wrath how bungling his flight must be. Below he saw the Croyden hills. He jerked upward and once more he gained on his enemy.|$|R

This action would not only disconnect the cage from the winding rope but also prevent the cage from falling <b>back</b> down the <b>shaft.</b> The device was patented in 1867 and is manufactured today.
