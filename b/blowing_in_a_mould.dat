60|$|We {{know that}} cut glass is expensive, {{and the reason}} is that cutting it is a slow process. Four wheels have to be used in succession, iron, sandstone, wood, and cork. Sand is thrown upon these wheels <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> way that the glass is finely and delicately cut. But this is imitated in pressed glass, which is <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> inside of which the design is cut. This is much cheaper than the cut glass.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the {{performed}} investigations was a multi-aspect analyzes of the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> which takes two-stage nature {{of the process and}} the occurrence of uncontrolled phenomena which influence the shape, size and quality of the products into consideration. Design/methodology/approach: The value for the Barus number for different dimensions of the nozzle gap and the distribution of the temperature field during blow moulding process have been determined; the product thickness profile has been defined; phenomena which occur during blowing stage have been registered. The investigations have been performed by means of the blow moulding machine of UFP- 05 type by IPTS – Metalchem Toruń using the designed and prepared blow mould with the sight-glass made of polycarbonate. Findings: The performed investigations enabled the insight study of uncontrolled phenomena which occur during each individual stage of the process and they showed the dependencies between these phenomena and the process parameters. Moreover, the detailed analyses enabled to determine the influence of these parameters on the physical features and dimensions of the finished goods. Research limitations/implications: The continuation of the investigations with use of extended blow mould design equipped in polycarbonate sight-glass which enabled the determination of the influence of the structure and mould cavity dimensions on the finished product wall thickness seems to be justified. It would be also useful to design the station for the precise non-touch measurements of Barus effect which enabled, except the measurements of the external diameter, the measurements of the finished product wall thickness. Originality/value: The complex analysis of the blow moulding process was possible thanks to innovative and original approach to the experimental tests which enables e. g. the optical registration of the phenomena which occur during blow moulding process...|$|R

It is found that the inner U-shape cooling apparatus can make molten steel flow with a lower impact depth which is favourable to inclusion in steel floating up...|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{technique}} of glassblowing {{had not yet been}} invented, its creation was a complicated process. The vase was made from two pieces: the widely flaring belly on a high foot, and the shoulder with a long neck and flaring mouth. These two pieces fit together exactly. The join is covered by a gilt copper strip decorated with vine patterns. Only one side of this strip survives, however. The two parts were made in turn. The belly, whose walls are very thin, was either cast <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> or pressed onto <b>a</b> <b>mould.</b> The bell-shaped foot was produced similarly, which was then hot joined to the belly piece using a solid stick. The other portion was made in the same way. The shoulder and a portion of the neck were either cast <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> or lowered onto a template while hot. The rest of the neck and the mouth were melted together with a hot stick, just as the foot and belly were. Because of the bulge, the join can easily be spotted.|$|R
