25|$|All 33 were {{included}} in the sale of V/Line Freight to Freight Victoria in March 1999. On 26 November 1999 G517 and G518 were destroyed in a head-on collision at Ararat between an eastbound grain train and a stationary <b>ballast</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} during the inquiry that the locomotive on a <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> {{had lost the}} rack in January 1895 a little lower down the line. Details are not recorded, but {{it is likely that}} the locomotive dropped back onto the rack and was not badly damaged.|$|E
25|$|Hercules was out {{of service}} after the Burmarsh Road level {{crossing}} incident in 2003, and Samson was withdrawn from service for an intermediate overhaul shortly afterwards. Once both locomotives were back in service, the railway {{was faced with a}} tender shortage. Samson was kept from mainline service while Hercules was coupled to the tender from Green Goddess while it was stored prior to overhaul. During the 2007 season, Samson saw service using the tender from Hurricane while it was being overhauled (a situation that had also happened in 1949 when Samson was used for <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> duties).|$|E
50|$|The yard re-marshals wagon {{traffic on}} the main line and from the branch. The {{majority}} of traffic is aggregate wagons, with steel strip carriers are also present. Infrastructure units and <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> also use the yard. Container traffic from Thamesport passes through non-stop.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive No. 1 {{arrived by}} ship on 13 January 1855 and hauled to a {{temporary}} shed {{on the site}} of the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. The Locomotive Engineer William Scott supervised assembly and the engine commenced running on 15 May 1855 with <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> for railway construction.|$|R
50|$|Class M10 {{locomotives}} {{were introduced}} in 2012 numbered 915, 916, 917. These were used mainly on freight and oil trains. They have also been used irregularly on passenger services. M10 locomotives were also used for <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> in the construction work of the rail lines to Talaimannar and Kankasanthurei.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 March 1930, a {{passenger}} train departed from [...] station, Cumberland against signals. It subsequently {{collided with a}} <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> at , Cumberland. Two {{people were killed and}} four were seriously injured.|$|E
2500|$|Within a {{short time}} of co-designing the {{coupling}} device, Joseph Taylor {{was killed in an}} accident near Oakenhead Bridge just outside Lossiemouth on 23 April 1857. He was driving a tank locomotive which collided with a <b>ballast</b> <b>train.</b> In the same year also near Lossiemouth, a passenger was killed when a badly secured barrier gave way on a truck.|$|E
2500|$|... 27 February 1892. A <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> from Limavady {{ran into}} the back of the 07.00 Londonderry to Belfast {{passenger}} train at Castlerock. There were no injuries. Major General Hutchinson found fault with personnel at Downhill and Castlerock for signalling irregularities. The passenger train had been running late due to poor steaming because the brick arch in its firebox had collapsed some days previously and General Hutchinson censured the driver for not reporting the collapse.|$|E
50|$|Between July and November 1989 {{the whole}} class was {{transferred}} to Delec Locomotive Depot in Sydney. As well as metropolitan trip workings they were used on coal trains to Tahmoor on the Main South line. In January 1994 they began to operate on the Illawarra line to Bombo on <b>ballast</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hymeks {{were used}} {{all over the}} Western Region on mixed traffic {{services}} from secondary passenger and parcels through express freight to <b>ballast</b> <b>trains.</b> They were common {{in all parts of}} the region from Paddington to Bristol/South Wales/Worcester/Hereford. They also worked to Birmingham and the West of England, but were rare west of Plymouth.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 was a powered snowplow, {{effectively}} a steeple-cab locomotive, {{which was}} probably built in the railroad's shops.. In service from the beginning, it had four GE 66 [...] motors when passenger cars had two. At first when not plowing it was used in freight service, from 1922 it was used for <b>ballast</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
60|$|They went on together, {{and though}} the sun was now {{fiercely}} hot and the distance long, George enjoyed the walk. Once they met a <b>ballast</b> <b>train,</b> with a steam plow mounted {{at one end of}} it, and a crowd of men riding on the open cars; but when it had passed there was nothing to break the deep silence of the woods. The dark firs shut in the narrow track except when here and there a winding lake or frothing river filled a sunny opening.|$|E
60|$|A week later, {{he got a}} jar as {{he stood}} with Charnock beside {{a part of the}} track they had laboriously underpinned. The <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> was coming down, filling the valley with its roar, and the beaten snow heaved among the ties as the big cars rolled by. The rails sank beneath the wheels and then sprang up until the load on the next axle pressed them down again; the snow flaked {{off the side of the}} road-bed, which was built up with broken rock. Festing thought the {{movement}} was too marked and waited for the locomotive, which was coupled to the back of the train.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} a few details about his family, and then Prescott left him and, after giving an order to have his team ready, {{proceeded}} to the station. It was getting dark, but the western sky was still a sheet of wonderful pale green, against which the tall elevators stood out black and sharp. The head-lamp of a freight locomotive flooded track and station with a dazzling electric glare, the rails that ran straight and level across the waste gleaming far back in the silvery radiance. This helped Prescott to overcome his repugnance to his task, as he remembered another summer night when he had attempted to hurry his team across the track before a <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> came up. Startled by the blaze of the head-lamp and the scream of the whistle, one of the horses plunged and kicked; a wheel of the wagon, sinking in the loose ballast, skidded against a tie; and Prescott stood between the rails, struggling to extricate the beasts, while the great locomotive rushed down on them. There was a vein of stubborn tenacity in him and {{it looked as if}} he and the horses would perish together when Jernyngham came running to the rescue. How they escaped neither of them could afterward remember, but a moment later they stood beside the track while the train went banging by, covering them with dust and fragments of gravel. Prescott admitted that he owed Jernyngham something for that.|$|E
50|$|Three vans, no's 347, 420 and 431 ZL, were {{exclusively}} {{allocated to}} the Cudgewa line, for stock specials. These vans had been fitted with extra vents and berths for cattle drover accommodation. A further two vans were allocated to standard gauge, and were used on either end of NN wagons on the <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> during construction of the new Albury line.|$|R
50|$|Between October 1877 and March 1878, platelaying was {{completed}} up to Summit. This enabled {{the use of}} work trains to haul up materials {{that were used to}} line Summit Tunnel. Track laying on the incline commenced in April 1878 and reached Cross Creek the following month. During this work, H 199 was stabled at Summit and used to haul work and <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> to the railhead.|$|R
50|$|Moolort {{station was}} opened on 7 July 1874.There {{is no longer}} a station {{platform}} at Moolort; however, there are still sidings provided to grain silos and to ballast piles. On 17 December 2004, the line from Moolort to Maldon junction was closed, due to the line being reserved for the Victorian Goldfields Railway to operate between Maldon and Castlemaine. <b>Ballast</b> <b>trains</b> operate from Maryborough to Moolort.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 August 2015, a <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> {{ran into}} the rear of another <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> at [...] Both trains were derailed.|$|E
50|$|As far as is known, {{the last}} locomotive-hauled train was a <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> run on 21 March 1891.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, U664 was {{converted}} to a 4-6-4 tank locomotive at the Midland Railway Workshops {{to allow it to}} maintain the faster schedules on Perth suburban services introduced when ADG class railcars were placed in service. Although deemed a success, no more followed due to its high operating costs. After being stored, it returned in 1966 to haul <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> on the Midland and South Western lines.|$|R

50|$|Although the Rosstown Railway {{has become}} infamous as an abject failure, the tracks were used {{from time to}} time. Construction and <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> were often {{on the line in}} the late 1880s and early 1890s, hauled by Victorian Railways {{locomotives}} that had been hired by Ross. The largest of these was a Y-class locomotive that was used on ballasting runs. Tenders had been let for the construction of rolling stock to be used by Ross, but nothing ever came of those.|$|R

50|$|The <b>ballast</b> <b>train</b> was {{returning}} to Dalbeattie, running down a gradient of 1 in 100 with little forward visibility. The collision was inevitable; both engine drivers died.|$|E
25|$|Although the London {{underground}} network had been electrified {{for many years}} (the then Metropolitan railway was electrified in 1905) {{a small number of}} steam locomotives were retained for engineering and <b>ballast</b> <b>trains.</b> By the 1950s the locomotives were past their prime and expensive to maintain, and the planned quadrupling of part of the Metropolitan Main Line would require reliable locomotives. London transport considered replacing the steam fleet with diesel shunters, and had also tested (unsuccessfully) a Great Northern Railway Class J52 locomotive in 1955.|$|R
25|$|During the Regional Fast Rail project, {{a number}} of {{shutdowns}} were carried out to normal passenger services, with the N class being used to haul <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> on the Geelong line in 2003/04, {{as well as being}} hired to Freight Australia in January 2004 to haul log and grain services. Since 2007 class members have also been hired to heritage operator Seymour Railway Heritage Centre for use on its trains, as the provision of TPWS equipment permits running at full line speed over the Regional Fast Rail network.|$|R
50|$|Girvan Old had {{a single}} platform. The goods station {{had a number of}} {{buildings}} including a turntable, water column, weighing machines, engine shed that closed in 1940 and a coal yard with a bridge over the River Girvan that led to the harbour and jetty. The track was still in situ in 1989 however it had been lifted by 2014. The old Girvan terminus went out of use in the 1980s due to the poor condition of the wooden bridge over the River Girvan although <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> were still making use of the site.|$|R

5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> and engineering trains.|$|R
50|$|Like the ZP vans before them, {{twenty of}} the ZL fleet were {{upgraded}} in 1971 by adding three tons of rail and a false floor. The vans were coded ZB, possibly indicating a planned use on <b>ballast</b> <b>trains</b> where constant stopping and starting could have created derailment risks. The vans were numbered 1 through 20, previously ZL van bodies 552, 348, 528, 427, 574, 452, 378, 308, 472, 317, 434, 405, 224, 393, 226, 463, 288, 481, 232 and 457 respectively. The vans {{were not considered}} particularly useful, with the first withdrawn in 1973 and none lasting beyond 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Withdrawals {{started in}} 1936 when four (7278, 7287, 7303 and 7308) {{were sold to}} Sir Robert McAlpine and Son, the latter concern also having five on loan from late 1936 to mid-1938. Three others were sold, with No. 297 going to the Mersey Railway in 1939 as their No. 3 to work <b>ballast</b> <b>trains.</b> By the end of 1940, thirty-one had been withdrawn, and the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives continued with no further retirements until 1950. In the LNER 1944 renumbering plan, the locomotives were renumbered 8370-8388. Withdrawal restarted in 1950 and all were gone {{by the end of}} 1955.|$|R
