500|$|Following {{the release}} of her sixth studio album, Bionic (2010), Aguilera filed for divorce from her husband Jordan Bratman, starred in her first feature film, Burlesque and {{recorded}} the accompanying soundtrack. She then became a coach on NBC's singing competition show The Voice and appeared as a featured artist on Maroon 5's single [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] (2011), which spent four weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following these events, Aguilera announced that had plans to begin production of her seventh album, stating that she wanted high quality and [...] "personal" [...] songs for the record. Regarding the creative direction, she revealed that the album would be a [...] "culmination of everything I've experienced up until this point... I've {{been through a lot}} since {{the release of}} my last album, being on ('The Voice'), having had a divorce... This is all sort of a free rebirth for me." [...] She further said [...] "I'm embracing many different things, but it's all feel-good, super-expressive [...] super-vulnerable." [...] Aguilera continued to say that the album would be about [...] "selfexpression and freedom" [...] because of the personal struggles she had overcome during the last couple of years. Speaking about her new material during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2012, Aguilera said that the recording process for Lotus was taking a while because [...] "I don't like to just get songs from producers. I like them to come from a personal place... I'm very excited. It's fun, exciting, introspective, it's going to be great". [...] "Blank Page" [...] was written by Aguilera, Sia Furler and Chris <b>Braide,</b> the latter of whom also produced the song.

In fluid mechanics, Miksis and Davis [6] studied a Navier-Stokes fluid flows over another one over rough and coated surfaces. Jäger and Mikelic [7] considered the boundary conditions on the contact interface between a porous medium and a free fluid. Kohn and Vogelius [8, 9] studied the effective models in a thin plate with rapidly varying thickness, he found that those models are different according to the different scaling. <b>Braides</b> et al.

40|$|Communicated by Andrea <b>Braides)</b> Abstract. In {{quasi-periodic}} homogenization of elliptic equations or nonlin-ear periodic homogenization of systems, {{the cell}} problem {{must be in}} general set on the whole space. Numerically computing the homogenization coefficient therefore implies a truncation error, {{due to the fact}} that the problem is ap-proximated on a bounded, large domain. We present here an approach that improves the rate of convergence of this approximation. 1. Introduction. Many problems in the engineering sciences and in the life sci-ences involve several scales. When these scales are well separated, homogenization theory (see for instance [3, 20, 21, 26, 30]) gives an appropriate answer to the prob-lem of defining an effective macroscopic equation. The coefficients of this equation may in general be computed using a cell problem. In the linear periodic case, se...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{rigorous}} statements and proofs for the asymptotic analysis of discrete energies defined on a two-dimensional triangular lattice allowing for fracture in {{presence of a}} microscopic impenetrability constraint. As the lattice parameter goes to 0, we prove that any limit deformation with finite energy is piecewise rigid and we prove a general lower bound with a suitable Griffith-fracture energy density which reflects the anisotropies of the underlying triangular lattice. For such a continuum energy we also provide a class of (piecewise rigid) deformations satisfying "opening-crack" conditions on which the lower bound is sharp. Relying on these results, some consequences have been already presented in the companion paper [A. <b>Braides</b> et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 96 (2016) 235 - 251] to validate models in Computational Mechanics in the small-deformation regime...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} motion of {{discrete}} interfaces driven by ferromagnetic interactions in a two-dimensional low-contrast periodic environment, by coupling the minimizing movements approach by Almgren, Taylor and Wang and a discrete-to-continuum analysis. As in a recent paper by <b>Braides</b> and Scilla dealing with high-contrast periodic media, we give an example showing that in general the effective motion does not depend only on the Gamma-limit, but also on geometrical features that are not detected in the static description. We show that there exists a critical value δ of the contrast parameter δ above which the discrete motion is constrained and coincides with the high-contrast case. If δ<δ {{we have a new}} pinning threshold and a new effective velocity both depending on δ. We also consider the case of non-uniform inclusions distributed into periodic uniform layers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a one-dimensional chain of atoms which {{interact with their}} nearest and next-to-nearest neighbours via a Lennard-Jones type potential. We are interested in a good approximation of the discrete energy of this system for {{a large number of}} atoms, i. e., in the continuum limit. We show that the canonical expansion by Gamma-convergence does not provide an accurate approximation of the discrete energy if the boundary conditions for the deformation are close to the threshold between elastic and fracture regimes. This suggests that a uniformly Gamma-equivalent approximation of the energy should be made, as introduced by <b>Braides</b> and Truskinovsky, to overcome the drawback of the lack of accuracy of the standard Gamma-expansion. In this spirit we provide a uniformly Gamma-equivalent approximation of the discrete energy at first order, which arises as the Gamma-limit of a suitably scaled functional...|$|R
