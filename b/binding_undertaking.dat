50|$|In {{addition}} to the conditions imposed by the MMC, BA agreed further concessions with the EC's Competition Directorate to prevent BA from abusing its dominant position at both of London's main airports.

5000|$|The dispute {{started in}} 1964 when, {{for the first}} time, the then Czechoslovakia {{exported}} its excessive production of Tokaj wine to Austria, the market {{that used to be}} solely supplied with this commodity by Hungary. The conflict of interests was settled in a bilateral agreement according to which Slovakia - {{at the expense of the}} Czech beer-related concession on Hungarian part - was only allowed to export its overproduction of Tokaj wine to Hungary (which consequently re-labeled and re-exported it).

40|$|Unilateral {{liberalisation}} {{of trade}} in goods and services has been considered an important policy objective. Most trade in services liberalisation {{in the developing world}} has taken place unilaterally; but it is not common among Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Among LDCs Bangladesh is a forerunner in pursuing unilateral liberalisation of mobile telephone services. There is a dearth of empirical studies on Bangladesh’s unilateral liberalisation of mobile phone services and its impact on users. Furthermore, no scholarly studies are known on the influence of unilateral liberalisation on <b>undertaking</b> <b>binding</b> liberalisation obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) framework of the World Trade Organisation. This study examined factors that motivated Bangladesh’s unilateral liberalisation of mobile phone service and its impact on users. It also investigated how unilateral liberalisation influenced Bangladesh to <b>undertake</b> <b>binding</b> liberalisation commitments under the GATS. The study applied a qualitative research design to address the research questions. Primary data were obtained from three different sources: informants from mobile phone firms, senior managers across the six mobile phone firms, trade experts, telecommunications analysts, policy makers, the telecommunications regulator, public officials and private sector representatives. Focus group discussions with different mobile phone users were conducted to determine the impact of unilateral liberalisation of mobile services. In the first 6 - 7 years after unilateral liberalisation of the sector, {{there was a lack of}} competition, mobile phone tariffs were high, quality of service was unsatisfactory, and the diversity of services was limited, which affected the growth of the sector. The competitive landscape of the sector changed dramatically after the state-owned firm and another large private operator commenced mobile phone service operations in 2005. Stiff competition took hold, which resulted in cheap and easy accessibility, a drastic reduction in mobile phone tariffs, and improved quality and variety of services. The main implications of the study are: (1) An unfettered market is detrimental to consumer benefits. A powerful independent regulatory body, which is held accountable for its actions, is needed for a free market to operate in the broader public interest; (2) Unilateral liberalisation is a ‘necessary condition’ and provided a foundation for the government of Bangladesh to <b>undertake</b> <b>binding</b> liberalisation commitments under WTO GATS...|$|R
40|$|Spermatozoa of {{the plains}} mouse (Pseudomys australis), {{like those of}} most Australian old endemic rodents, contain, in {{addition}} to an apical hook, two further processes that extend from the upper concave surface of the head, the ventral processes. This study shows that these processes contain thiol-rich cytoskeletal proteins, which presumably help to maintain their rigidity during sperm transport, together with the overlying cell membrane having abundant intramembranous proteins. To determine the possible functional significance of these processes, an in vitro study of spermatozoon-zona <b>binding</b> was <b>undertaken.</b> The findings suggest that initial sperm binding occurs by way of the cell membrane over the acrosome of the apical hook and that, subsequently, the lateral surfaces of the ventral processes also become tightly bound to the zona matrix. These ventral processes may therefore have evolved to increase sperm adhesion to the outer zona surface and/or to enhance stabilisation of the spermatozoon at the time of zona binding and initial penetration of the egg coat.

This is followed by an assessment of the role that foreign direct investments can play in improving the treatment of foreign services suppliers and modernize services, and an illustration of how to prioritize services sectors for higher value-added participation in global value chains. The paper concludes by offering a number of policy recommendations to support services liberalization with a view to diversity the economy, speed up the transition process and improve the overall standing of North and Central Asian countries in the world economy...|$|R
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) remains an important {{contributor to the}} neoplastic evolution of prostate cancer (CaP). CaP progression is linked to several somatic AR mutational changes that endow upon the AR dramatic gain-of-function properties. One {{of the most common}} somatic mutations identified is Thr 877 -to-Ala (T 877 A), located in the ligand-binding domain, that results in a receptor capable of promiscuous binding and activation by a variety of steroid hormones and ligands including estrogens, progestins, glucocorticoids, and several anti-androgens. In an attempt to further define somatic mutated AR gain-of-function properties, as a consequence of its promiscuous ligand <b>binding,</b> we <b>undertook</b> a proteomic/ network analysis approach to characterize the protein interactome of the mutant T 877 A-AR in LNCaP cells under eight different ligand-specific treatments (dihydrotestosterone, mibolerone, R 1881, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, dexamethasone, and cyproterone acetate). In extending the analysis of our multi-ligand complexes of the mutant T 877 A-AR we observed significant enrichment of specific complexes between normal and primary prostatic tumors, which were furthermore correlated with known clinical outcomes. Further analysis of certain mutant T 877 A-AR complexes showed specific population preferences distinguishing primary prostatic disease between white (non-Hispanic) vs. African-American males. Moreover, these cancer-related AR-protein complexes demonstrated predictive survival outcomes specific to CaP, and not for breast, lung, lymphoma or medulloblastoma cancers.

40|$|The species-specific binding of {{sea urchin}} sperm to the egg is {{mediated}} by an egg cell surface receptor. Although earlier studies {{have resulted in}} the cloning and sequencing of the receptor, structure/function studies require knowledge {{of the structure of the}} mature cell surface protein. In this study, we report the purification of this glycoprotein to homogeneity from a cell surface complex of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs using lectin and ion exchange chromatography. Based on the yield of receptor it can be calculated that each egg contains approximately 1. 25 x 10 (6) receptor molecules on its surface. The receptor, which has an apparent M(r) of 350 kD, is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein composed of approximately 70 % carbohydrate. Because earlier studies on the partially purified receptor and on a pure, extracellular fragment of the receptor indicated that the carbohydrate chains were important in sperm <b>binding,</b> we <b>undertook</b> compositional analysis of the carbohydrate in the intact receptor. These analyses and lectin binding studies revealed that the oligosaccharide chains of the receptor are sulfated and that both N- and O-linked chains are present. Functional analyses revealed that the purified receptor retained biological activity; it inhibited fertilization in a species-specific and dose-dependent manner, and polystyrene beads coated with it bound to acrosome-reacted sperm in a species-specific manner.

40|$|Human {{coronavirus}} OC 43 (HCoV-OC 43) is a causative {{agent of}} the common cold. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is a major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core and results {{in the formation of}} the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. We have solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC 43 N protein (N-NTD) (residues 58 to 195) to a resolution of 2. 0 Å. The HCoV-OC 43 N-NTD is a single domain protein composed of a five-stranded β-sheet core and a long extended loop, similar to that observed in the structures of N-NTDs from other coronaviruses. The positively charged loop of the HCoV-OC 43 N-NTD contains a structurally well-conserved positively charged residue, R 106. To assess the role of R 106 in RNA <b>binding,</b> we <b>undertook</b> a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments and docking simulations to characterize the interaction between R 106 and RNA. The results show that R 106 plays an important role in the interaction between the N protein and RNA. In addition, we showed that, in cells transfected with plasmids that encoded the mutant (R 106 A) N protein and infected with virus, the level of the matrix protein gene was decreased by 7 -fold compared to cells that were transfected with the wild-type N protein. This finding suggests that R 106, by enhancing binding of the N protein to viral RNA plays a critical role in the viral replication. The results also indicate that the strength of N protein/RNA interactions is critical for HCoV-OC 43 replication...|$|R

In this paper we highlight the extraordinarily versatile effects of the aurone structure on mushroom Ty activity. Depending on the position of the OH group on the B-ring, aurones can behave either as substrates or as hyperbolic activators. The synthesis of a hybrid aurone through combination of an aurone moiety with HOPNO (2 -hydroxypyridine N-oxide), a good metal chelate, led us to a new, efficient, mixed inhibitor for mushroom tyrosinase. Another important feature pointed out by our study is the presence of more than one site for aurone compounds on mushroom tyrosinase.

Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) and competitive binding studies were used to confirm this conjugation. A biotin initiator for copper-mediated LRP was used to provide acrylamide and methacrylate based polymers with the functional end group. This investigation revealed that 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid was not a suitable monomer in its acid form but was successfully used in its sodium salt form. A second monomer, 3 -sulfopropylmethacrylate as the potassium salt was also studied and both monomers produced polymers with polydispersities < 1. 3 and 1. 4, respectively. Evolution of molecular weight with respect to time indicated that the polymerization of the acrylamide polymer is controlled.

The highly selective competitive compound, (+) -niguldipine, was used to distinguish high-affinity (alpha 1 a) from low-affinity (alpha 1 b) sites, after initial studies demonstrated that this compound had greater selectivity than 5 -methylurapidil in distinguishing alpha 1 a and alpha 1 b sites in rat renal membranes. In contrast to the significant difference in the blood pressure of the spontaneously hypertensive rats (delta BP = 74 mm Hg), {{there was no difference in}} the renal alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor density.

Since {{it has been suggested that}} mannosyl residues on the egg zona pdllucida may be important for sperm-egg <b>binding,</b> studies were <b>undertaken</b> to examine the potential role of the sperm a-o-mannosidase during fertilization. Incubation of mouse spermatozoa in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitory sugars, a-methyl mannoside, a-methyl glucoside, D-mannose, or n-mannitol, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease In the number of spermatozoa bound per egg without a deleterious effect on sperm motility or on the sperm acrosome, and a dose-dependent inhibition of the sperm mannosidase activity. Galactose, however had no effect on sperm-egg binding or on sperm mannosidase activity.

Marine biotechnology is {{at an early stage}} of development, and therefore, more of the potential global market is open for development by Ireland than is the case for other sectors. A key area of growth, both in Ireland and Europe is the use of seaweeds for various applications including bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated waters. This thesis has demonstrated a method for identifying the most promising seaweeds for metal biosorption through the use of multiple analytical techniques. A comprehensive study of dead biomass of six locally derived seaweeds (Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus spiralis, Ulva lactuca, Ulva spp., Palmaria palmata and Polysiphonia lanosa) and three regionally significant metals (Cu (II), Cr (III) and Cr (VI)) was carried out. Fundamental investigations into metal <b>binding</b> were <b>undertaken</b> {{in order to determine the}} potential binding capacity of the seaweeds, the factors influencing binding and their potential mechanisms of binding. This work has adapted a number of analytical techniques previously used for seaweed analysis and modified them so that binding information supplementary to that found in the literature could be obtained. Studies indicated that seaweed is polyfunctional in nature with groups of varying affinities for metal ions. The quantity and distribution of these groups varied between species. Variations in experimental parameters were shown to influence the quantity of metal bound to the seaweeds, with optimum conditions dependent on the metal under investigation. Isotherm modelling revealed that Fucus vesiculosus and Polysiphonia lanosa were most effective in removing cations and anions respectively from solutions containing high residual metal concentrations while Palmaria palmata was superior for both cation and anion removal at low residual concentrations. Therefore, this implied that the most suitable seaweed biosorbent was ultimately dependent upon its final application. Changes in seaweed functional groups after metal binding were monitored using FTIR analysis with novel information on the timescale of Cu (II) binding presented. Ion-exchange and complexation mechanisms were shown to occur for cation binding while a surface reduction mechanism was also apparent during anion binding. The use of multiple chemical modification techniques confirmed binding mechanisms and identified a methodology for capacity enhancement of the seaweeds. Important changes in surface morphology and binding mechanism were established using surface analysis techniques such as SEM/EDX and XPS while a novel methodology for seaweed surface analysis using SFM was also demonstrated...|$|R

Conventional XPS and synchrotron radiation based photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES) were used to <b>undertake</b> <b>binding</b> energy calibrations, estimations of surface contamination, stoichiometric analysis and electronic band alignment measurements for the different ZnO surfaces. A wide range of cleaning procedures including ex-situ organic solvent cleaning, in-situ ultra-high vacuum (UHV) annealing, in-situ atomic hydrogen and atomic oxygen cleaning as well as in-situ high temperate molecular oxygen annealing treatments were systematically investigated and evaluated as to their effectiveness at preparing contamination free surfaces. The ex-situ wet chemical cleaning resulted in only a small reduction in the carbon contamination signal and a corresponding increase in the surface hydroxide signal. On all ZnO surfaces investigated, the contamination was reduced at different rates, depending on the surface termination. The in-situ surface cleaning studies showed that while in general {{it is possible to}} remove the carbon contamination by a variety of methods, the surface hydroxide species cannot be removed, due to the bond strength of O-H. It was found that the effective carbon removal temperature for the ZnO surfaces using atomic hydrogen cleaning was 600 °C, using molecular oxygen thermal cleaning it was 700 °C and for atomic oxygen, the cleaning temperature was 400 °C. As the result of removing carbon contamination on all ZnO surfaces, the natural surface downward banding was reversed into upward band bending...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{sampling}} is {{a useful}} method for contaminant analysis and monitoring, and of the techniques available the Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) technique is particularly applicable for use in transition metal studies. However, analysis of the metal-accumulating DGT 'binding phase' is typically expensive and time consuming, which limits the technique's application. In order to improve on the cost and speed of analysis, and to allow in-field analysis, a colorimetric binding phase was developed. By employing metallochromic reagents adsorbed onto ion-exchange resins a colour change was obtained {{as a result of}} the binding of metal ions, with the degree of change being proportional to the quantity of complexed metal. This reagent-adsorbed resin was immobilised on adhesive paper labels to provide a robust, cheap and effective colorimetric binding phase. Quantification of metal loading on these <b>binding</b> phases was <b>undertaken</b> through use of UV-Vis reflectance or Computer Imaging Densitometry (CID), the latter employing a flat-bed scanner for improved ease of analysis. Analytically robust metal quantification was found to be achievable using these methods, with the CID method equivalent in performance to the reflectance method. The use of a variety of metallochromic reagents was explored, with different reagents noted to provide colorimetric responses for different metal ions. A typical detection limit, provided by Methylthymol Blue adsorbed to Dowex 1 x 8 resin, was 10 ng Cu(II) per cm- 2 of disc area. Linear response was seen up to a stoichiometrically defined metal loading, typically providing a linear response from the detection limit to 2 µg of Cu(II) per cm- 2.

We swapped CDRs between four scFv that have different properties, including two scFv that can efficiently fold independently from disulfide bonds and two more disulfide-dependent scFv. To confirm disulfide-independence we generated cysteine to alanine mutants of the disulfide-independent scFv. All of the scFv were tested for soluble expression in the cytoplasm of E. coli in the presence and absence of the oxidative folding catalysts Erv 1 p and PDI. Eight of the hybrid scFv were solubly produced in the presence of CyDisCo, while seven were solubly produced in the absence of CyDisCo, though the yields were often much lower when CyDisCo was absent. Soluble expression was also observed for scFv natalizumab and trastuzumab containing no cysteines. We compared yields, thermal stability and secondary structure of solubly produced scFv and <b>undertook</b> <b>binding</b> studies by western blotting, dot blotting or surface plasmon resonance of those produced in good yields. Our results indicate that both the CDRs and the framework contribute to the disulfide-dependence of soluble production of scFv, with the CDRs having the largest effect. In addition, there was no correlation between thermal stability and disulfide-dependence of folding and only a weak correlation between the yield of protein and the thermal stability of the protein...|$|R
40|$|This works {{presents}} the results of studies concerning possibility of application of microwave heating in the curing process of molding sands containing oil binders. Molding sands prepared with three kinds of binders, that is oils C, DL and Retanol, have been subject to experiments. The sands have been dried with two methods: in a microwave chamber of 750 W power and, for comparison, with classical method at the temperature of 200 °C for 120 minutes. Tensile and bending strength of the samples have been determined after cooling down. It has been found that microwave drying in the low-power device used for experiments is effective only in case of molding sand prepared with addition of DL binder. The temperature of heated, even up to 32 minutes in a microwave chamber, blocks prepared from the remaining two masses, was insufficient to initiate <b>binding</b> process. The <b>undertaken</b> attempts of binder modification and introduction of additives intensifying microwave heating process allowed for achievement of satisfactory results. It has been found that power of the heating device is the main factor determining efficiency of microwave curing of molding sands containing oil binders. An additional experiment has been conducted on a laboratory workstation allowing for microwave heating of small mass samples with a high output power of magnetron concentrated in a small substrate volume. It has been observed that microwave drying process of molding sands was of dynamic character over a short period of time, not exceeding 120 seconds, thus assuring efficient curing of the sands containing the used oil binders. Therefore, application of devices of properly high microwave output power allows for efficient drying of oil molding sands, while simultaneously assuring the possibility to reduce time and energy consumption necessary for production of foundry cores of proper functional characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The initial part of {{this works}} {{involves}} the evaluation of a related series of bisamides for rational correlation between anion complexation and organocatalysis: remarkable enhancement of hydrogen bonding to anions was observed along with significant increases in catalytic activity in the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction. In addition, X-ray crystallography showed a large degree of pre-organisation was observed in one receptor by incorporation of bis(trifluoromethyl) aniline groups along with a thioamide functionality. A novel bifunctional amide/N-acylsulfonamide within the series gave the best catalytic profile for the initial receptors/organocatalysts. Following on from the initial work, a series of bifunctional hybrid (thio) urea/amide molecules were designed and also tested for their anion binding properties and catalytic activites. A urea/amide hybrid produced the highest binding constants while a thiourea/amide analogue gave optimal catalytic properties in the aforementioned reaction with yield of up to 79 % obtained. Catalyst-substrate <b>binding</b> studies were <b>undertaken</b> for the most successful catalysts and a catalytic mechanism related to receptor/catalyst acidity was proposed. Another major {{part of this}} work involved the design and screening {{of a range of}} simple Naryl and N-heteroaryl pyrrolidine amide organocatalysts incorporating N-pyridyl and Nquinolinyl groups in the synthetically useful aldol reaction of isatin with acetone. The ‘reverse amide’ N-pyridyl pyrrolidinylmethyl amide catalysts proved highly catalytically active but gave disappointing enantioselectivities. However, an N- 3 -pyridyl prolinamide catalyst gave the aldol adduct in high yields and high enantioselectivity with up to 72 % ee of the (S) -isomer. Conditions were optimised for this catalyst and in particular an additive screen identified a link between the pKa of the acid additive and the yield and enantioselectivity. An N-acylsulfonamide prolinamide was also identified as a catalyst for this reaction giving the (R) -enantiomer in 68 % ee...|$|R
40|$|The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is broader {{in policy}} {{coverage}} than conventional trade agreements for goods and, {{at the same}} time, offers governments more flexibility, in various dimensions, to tailor their obligations to sector- or country-specific needs. An overview of existing commitments on healthcare and health insurance services shows that WTO Members have made abundant use of these possibilities. While most participants elected not to <b>undertake</b> <b>bindings</b> on healthcare services {{at the end of}} the Uruguay Round, nor to make offers in the ongoing negotiations, insurance services have been among the most frequently committed sectors. If there is a common denominator, regardless of the Members concerned (except for recently acceded countries), it is the existence of a lot of 'water' between existing commitments and more open conditions of actual access in many sectors. This may also explain, in part, why there have been very few trade disputes under the GATS to date - far fewer than under the GATT in merchandise trade. Also, governments appear to be generally hesitant in politically and socially sensitive areas to take action in the WTO. There are indications, however, that the same 'players' have acted differently in other policy contexts. For example, it appears that under recent preferential trade agreements (PTAs) the European Communities has been even more cautious in committing on hospital services and protecting scope for (discriminatory) subsidies than under the GATS. Yet, this is not necessarily true for the obligations assumed by many countries, including individual EC Member States, under bilateral investment treaties (BITs). These treaties overlap with the GATS, as far as commercial presence is concerned, and may be used by aggrieved investors to challenge policy restrictions in host countries. However, though frequently invoked, BITs do not meet the same standards, in terms of transparency, open (consensual) rulemaking and legal certainty, as commitments under the GATS...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} solid-phase synthesis protocol {{has been}} developed which, together with regioselective sequential formation of the three disulfide bonds, enabled the preparation of specifically monolanthanide (europium) -labeled human insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL 3) {{for the study of}} its interaction with its G-protein-coupled receptor, RXFP 2, via time-resolved fluorometry. A commercially available chelator, diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), was coupled to the N-terminus of the INSL 3 A-chain on the solid phase, and then a coordination complex between europium ion and DTPA was formed using EuCl 3 to protect the chelator from production of an unidentified adduct during subsequent combination of the A- and B-chains. The labeled peptide was purified in high yield using high-performance liquid chromatography with nearly neutral pH buffers to prevent the liberation of Eu (3 +) from the chelator. Using time-resolved fluorometry, saturation <b>binding</b> assays were <b>undertaken</b> to determine the binding affinity (p K d) of labeled INSL 3 for RXFP 2 in HEK- 293 T cells stably expressing RXFP 2. The dissociation constant of DTPA-labeled INSL 3 (9. 05 +/- 0. 03, n = 3) that was obtained from saturation binding experiments was comparable to that of (125) I-labeled INSL 3 (9. 59 +/- 0. 09, n = 3). The receptor binding affinity (p K i) of human INSL 3 was determined to be 9. 27 +/- 0. 06, n = 3, using Eu-DTPA-INSL 3 as a labeled ligand, which again is similar to that obtained when (125) I-INSL 3 was used as labeled ligand (9. 34 +/- 0. 02, n = 4). This novel lanthanide-coordinated, DTPA-labeled INSL 3 has excellent sensitivity, stability, and high specific activity, properties that will be particularly beneficial in high-throughput screening of INSL 3 analogues in structure-activity studies.

40|$|Rationale +/- 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) {{produces}} {{effects on}} a number of neurochemical systems. Many studies have shown that repeated MDMA administration produces deficits in central serotonergic neurotransmission, which have been suggested to underlie some of the behavioural changes associated with use. Objectives The present studies sought to evaluate the functional statuses of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the serotonin 2 c (5 -HT 2 c) and serotonin 2 a (5 -HT 2 a) receptors following treatment with MDMA to determine whether behavioural deficits could be attributed to alterations in these proteins. Methods Rats received a pretreatment regimen of MDMA (4 x 10 mg/kg MDMA injections administered at 2 h intervals) or the saline vehicle and, 2 weeks later, [3 H] paroxetine <b>binding</b> was <b>undertaken</b> to assess densities of SERT. In other groups, dose-effect curves for MDMA-produced hyperactivity were determined. Additional groups were tested following a 12 -week withdrawal period from MDMA in order to assess whether there was recovery of function. The functional status of the SERT was further examined by determining the effect of MDMA pretreatment on the reduction in MDMA-produced hyperactivity (0. 0 - 10. 0 mg/kg) produced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, clomipramine (0. 0 - 5. 0 mg/kg). The ability for the 5 -HT 2 c receptor agonist, m-CPP (0. 0 - 2. 5 mg/kg) to produce hypolocomotion or increased emergence latency or for the 5 -HT 2 a receptor agonist, DOI (0. 0 - 2. 0 mg/kg) to produce wetdog shakes (WDS) were examined in MDMA pretreated rats. The ability for the 5 -HT 2 c receptors to modulate MDMA-produced hyperactivity was assessed by examining the effect of MDMA pretreatment on the potentiation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity produced by the selective antagonist, RS 102221 (0. 0 - 1. 0 mg/kg). Conversely, the modulatory abilities of the 5 -HT 2 a receptors were assessed by examining the effect of MDMA pretreatment on the attenuation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity produced by the antagonist, ritanserin (0. 0 - 10. 0 mg/kg). Results MDMA pretreatment produced widespread reductions in SERT binding densities 2 weeks following administration. Prior exposure to MDMA rendered rats tolerant to MDMA-produced hyperactivity when tested 2, but not 12, weeks following MDMA administration. Two weeks following MDMA pretreatment rats were also less responsive to the clomipramine-produced attenuation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity. MDMA pretreatment failed to alter M-CPP -produced hypolocomotion or increased emergence latency, but decreased the ability for DOI to induce WDS. Further, MDMA pretreated rats exhibited tolerance to RS 102221 as shown by a rightward shift in the dose effect curve and complete tolerance to ritanserin. Conclusions Following MDMA pretreatment, the decreased SERT binding densities and inability of clomipramine to attenuate MDMA-produced effects might explain tolerance to the locomotor activating effects produced by MDMA. Functional recovery also occurred with extended abstinence from the drug, suggesting that MDMA produced transient serotonergic alterations. The results support the idea that the 5 -HT 2 a and 5 -HT 2 c receptors that modulate MDMA-produced hyperactivity are functionally distinct from the receptors that mediate m-CPP- and DOI-induced behavioural responses, as m-CPP-produced behaviours were resilient, yet RS 102221 -induced effects were reduced, by MDMA pretreatment. RS 102221 is highly selective in comparison to ritanserin, yet there was only one dose that produced significant potentiation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity, whereas there were several effective ritanserin doses. This suggests that the 5 -HT 2 a receptors had a greater role in modulating MDMA-produced hyperactivity. Additionally, 5 -HT 2 a receptors might be more susceptible to MDMA-induced desensitisation than 5 -HT 2 c receptors, as MDMA pretreated rats exhibited some tolerance to the potentiating effects of RS 102221 but were unresponsive to any ritanserin dose. In conclusion, MDMA-induced locomotor tolerance was attributable to decreased SERT densities and function as well as desensitisation of 5 -HT 2 a receptors that facilitate hyperactivity...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{political}} {{statements by}} the world leaders on the urgency of reaching an ambitious climate deal in Copenhagen notwithstanding, the actual discussions at the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) continue to be shrouded by daunting North-South divide, dimming the hope of sealing a deal in December 2009. The negotiating climate has been further queered by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), which have, in the recent past, made attempts to include certain unilateral trade measures in their domestic climate change regimes. Among the issues that have fuelled the debates on the climate-trade interface {{in the run-up to}} Copenhagen, perhaps the most contested one is the proposed use by developed countries of border measures on imports from countries (read ‘major-emitting’ developing countries) not implementing comparable GHG (green house gas) emissions reduction policies on the grounds of addressing the risk of what has been coined as ‘carbon leakage’. The issue of carbon leakage has its origin in the purported apprehension in these developed countries that in the energy intensive, trade-exposed sectors, the carbon costs imposed by their domestic climate policies (e. g. carbon tax or cap-and-trade scheme) will put domestic producers at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis producers in countries not imposing similarly strict carbon constraints. It is argued that if stringent domestic climate action causes their firms to relocate to other countries with less stringent or no carbon constraint, or to lose market share to firms from countries having low emission standards, then the emission reduction achieved in countries imposing stringent measures will be offset to a great extent by an increase in emissions elsewhere. According to the developed countries, such carbon leakage could end up undermining the environmental integrity of the carbon constraining domestic policy measures. In keeping with the above arguments, law makers in both the US and the EU have proposed introduction of carbon tariffs in order to obviate the disadvantages that their domestic products may face vis-à- vis imports as a result of emission reduction measures being adopted by them. While the inclusion of such onerous proposals in the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (the Waxman-Markey Bill), as approved by the US House of Representatives in the end-June 2009, has generated significant furore over the past several months, somewhat similar provisions were already included in the post- 2012 climate change and energy package finalized by the EU in December 2008. It is widely argued by developing countries that such carbon tariffs on imports would be akin to protectionism in the guise of preventing global warming. Concerns have emerged among the so-called ‘major-emitting developing countries’ (such as, China and India), who are the main target of such measures, that these measures could act as a discriminatory market access barrier affecting their exports to the developed countries concerned in energy intensive sectors that may come under the purview of these measures. Hence, it is apprehended by them that the proposals to impose such carbon tariffs may act as an effective threat to induce them to <b>undertake</b> <b>binding</b> emission reduction commitments in the ongoing climate negotiations. It is this tacit protectionist intent allegedly underlying the proposed border measures that has triggered a huge furore among the developing countries. Another controversial issue pertaining to such carbon tariffs is whether they could be compatible with the WTO (World Trade Organization) commitments of the countries introducing such measures. This concern has found reflection not only in the post- 2012 climate-energy package of the EU itself, but also in the debates on the domestic climate legislations in the EU and US. Against this backdrop, this paper makes an attempt to analyze the WTO compatibility or otherwise of the border measure proposed by the EU in its post- 2012 climate- energy package. The analysis focuses on two sets of issues: (i) whether the proposed border measure could conform to the ‘border tax adjustment’ provisions and the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and if not then (ii) whether the EU could justify it under the ‘General Exceptions’ provisions included in Article XX of the GATT that allow WTO Members, subject to certain conditions included in its chapeau, to deviate from their GATT obligations to serve certain legitimate policy objectives, including environmental objectives. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the EU could face significant difficulties in establishing that the proposed border measure would be WTO-compliant. However, the devil would finally lie in the details. World Trade Organisation, Carbon Leakage, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change...|$|R
40|$|It has {{traditionally}} been believed that the function of intracellular lipid binding proteins (iLBPs) is to solubilize and chaperone endogenous ligands in aqueous spaces and to facilitate their transport across the cytosol. In recent years, however, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that iLBPs are also able to bind to a diverse range of poorly water soluble compounds and are therefore likely to be involved in a range of additional functions. Notably, iLBPs have been shown to play specific roles in regulating the biological activities and metabolic properties of their ligands. For example, a number of proteins of the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) class of iLBPs have been shown to promote the transport of their ligands to the nucleus and to facilitate the activation of specific nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). There are nine different subtypes of human FABPs. The current studies have focussed on liver FABP (hLFABP) and intestine FABP (hIFABP), since these iLBPs are highly expressed in organs that play significant roles in lipid processing and are important target organs in metabolic disease. The ability of hLFABP and hIFABP to bind a broad range of compounds including long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARα) agonists and other drug molecules has been studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. The ligand binding abilities of these FABPs has been further characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a structural insight into the binding relationships has been probed by resolving the structure of several different protein-ligand complexes. hIFABP ligand <b>binding</b> studies were <b>undertaken</b> using a fluorescence displacement assay and showed that ketorolac is able to displace the fluorescent probe 11 -dansylamino undecanoic acid (DAUDA), but not an alternate fluorescent probe, 1 -anilinonapthalene 8 - sulfonic acid (ANS). The thermodynamics of binding was investigated using ITC, which revealed differences in the mode of binding of these ligands. Thus, ketorolac displayed a unique thermodynamic profile that involved an entropy driven, endothermic binding interaction with hIFABP, in contrast to the more commonly observed exothermic and enthalpy driven interaction for most other ligands (including LCFA, most drugs and the model fluorophores) with hIFABP. The X-ray crystal structure of the DAUDA-hIFABP complex was subsequently determined and revealed a FA-like binding mode where the carboxylate of DAUDA formed a network of hydrogen bonds with residues {{at the bottom of the}} binding cavity and the dansyl group interacted with residues in the portal region. For ANS, NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data also indicated binding deep inside the β-barrel, whereas ketorolac appeared to occupy the portal region of hIFABP. The CSP data further suggested that both ANS and ketorolac were able to bind simultaneously to hIFABP, consistent with the lack of displacement observed by fluorescence. The NMR solution structure of the ketorolachIFABP complex was subsequently determined and confirmed a newly characterized, hydrophobic ligand binding site in the portal region of hIFABP. The binding of endogenous ligands to hIFABP was further characterized via a detailed evaluation of oleate binding using ITC and NMR spectrometry. The ITC data showed that oleate binding occurred with low micromolar affinity (KD: 0. 8 μM) and via an enthalpy driven process. NMR titration studies subsequently revealed that the complex was in slow exchange on the NMR time scale. The overall binding pose of oleate was consistent with previous data describing the rat IFABP (rIFABP) oleate complex. A similar ion pair interaction between the carboxylate of oleate with Arg 106 and Trp 82 of hIFABP was consistent with the enthalpy driven binding. Two populations of oleate methyl protons were apparent in the bound state compared to a single population in free oleate. The presence of major and minor populations suggests that there are two distinct binding modes – although the stoichiometry of the interaction was found to be 1 : 1. This is most consistent with a model in which oleate is bound at a single site in hIFABP but can adopt two different conformations at that site. The fact that distinct resonances were only observed for the methyl protons of oleate and there were no clearly observed peaks reflecting a minor conformation either for other oleate resonances, or for protein resonances in hIFABP, suggests that the two bound conformations are highly similar. Cell based assays were subsequently employed to probe the impact of ligand binding on FABP cellular distribution and in particular the ability of hIFABP and hLFABP to promote nuclear localization and ligand activation of PPARα. Interestingly, while all the PPARα agonists examined bound to hI and hLFABP, the ability of these drugs to stimulate nuclear redistribution and PPAR activation was ligand and FABP specific. Thus, in the presence of GW 7647, hLFABP, but not hIFABP, preferentially redistributed to the nucleus, and enhanced ligand activation of PPARα (when compared to the absence of hLFABP). In contrast, nuclear localization of hIFABP (but not hLFABP) and PPAR activation was enhanced in the presence of fenofibrate. Interestingly, nuclear localization of hIFABP and hLFABP did not appear to be mediated via binding to importins, in contrast to previous data obtained with adipocyte FABP (AFABP). The binding of GW 7647 to hLFABP was subsequently examined and revealed a nanomolar binding affinity (KD: 115 nM), favorable enthalpy and entropy of binding and a binding stoichiometry of 1 : 1, instead of the widely reported 1 : 2 binding stoichiometry for hLFABP binding to LCFA. We hypothesize that ligand binding to FABPs results in a conformational change that stabilizes a direct protein-protein interaction between PPAR and hI and hLFABP and that this is the mechanisms of nuclear localization and PPAR activation. To support this suggestion, the structure of GW 7647 bound to hLFABP was solved in an attempt to provide evidence of conformational change on binding. The data suggest that ligand binding does indeed result in conformational change and redistribution of charge on the protein surface. Specifically, GW 7647 binding led to opening of the portal cavity due to movement of key internal side chain residues (I 52, M 74 and R 122), a shift in the position of β strands βD and βF and movement in the helix-turn-helix lid of holo hLFABP. Significant conformational change on one side of holo hLFABP was also observed including protrusion of K 57, E 77, F 95 and K 96, making them more accessible to surface interaction. This raises the possibility that this is a site of protein-protein interaction with PPARα and will be the subject of future studies. Together these studies advance knowledge of the structure and mechanisms of ligand binding to FABP. They also provide an insight into a potential role for FABP in regulating the intracellular activity of its ligands...|$|R
