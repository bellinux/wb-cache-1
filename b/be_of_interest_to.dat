5|$|In early 1922 Marquis started {{considering}} {{working as}} an Indian agency physician. This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans of the West, and provide a subject that might <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work on a novel, Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Accounting Review was {{established}} in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were more relevant to accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow The Accounting Review to focus more heavily on quantitative articles.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} demands {{placed on}} the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots {{and other forms of}} resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason {{to do business with}} the people of Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. To guarantee that this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E

25|$|Kryptos is a {{sculpture}} by the American artist Jim Sanborn {{located on the}} grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the four encrypted messages it bears. Of the four messages, the first three have been solved, while the fourth message remains as one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. The sculpture continues to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> cryptanalysts, both amateur and professional, who are attempting to decipher the fourth passage. The artist has so far given two clues to this passage.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the Jubilee cycle {{continues}} to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> modern scholarship, as does {{the question of the}} practicality of the legislation, and whether it was ever put into effect on a nationwide basis. Regarding the {{length of the}} cycle, three significant scholarly studies devoted to the Jubilee and Sabbatical years agree that it was 49 years, while disagreeing somewhat on the interpretation of the other issues involved. These major studies were those of Benedict Zuckermann, Robert North, and Jean-François Lefebvre. The reasons given by these authors to support a 49-year cycle are both textual (examining all relevant Biblical texts) and practical.|$|E

25|$|Gravitational waves can {{penetrate}} {{regions of}} space that electromagnetic waves cannot. They {{are able to}} allow the observation of the merger of black holes and possibly other exotic objects in the distant Universe. Such systems cannot be observed with more traditional means such as optical telescopes or radio telescopes, and so gravitational-wave astronomy gives {{new insights into the}} working of the Universe. In particular, gravitational waves could <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very early Universe. This is not possible with conventional astronomy, since before recombination the Universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation. Precise measurements of gravitational waves will also allow scientists to test more thoroughly the general theory of relativity.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, King {{released}} the second installment, , in which Roland draws three people from 20th-century United States into his world through magical doors. Grant published The Drawing of the Three, with illustrations by Phil Hale, {{in a slightly}} larger run of 30,000 copies, which was still well below King's typical initial hardcover print run of a new book. It, published in 1986, had an initial print run of 1,000,000 copies, King's largest to date. King had believed that the Dark Tower books would <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> only {{a select group of}} his fans, and had resisted releasing them on a larger scale. Finally, in the late 1980s, bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books (at this point fewer than 50,000 of his millions of readers {{would have been able to}} own any of the Dark Tower books), King agreed to release The Gunslinger and all subsequent Dark Tower books in trade paperback and mass-market formats.|$|E
25|$|On arrival, Reilly {{was taken}} to the office of Roman Pilar, a Soviet {{official}} who the previous year had arrested and ordered the execution of Boris Savinkov, a close friend of Reilly. Pilar reminded Reilly that he had been sentenced to death by a 1918 Soviet tribunal for his participation in a counter-revolutionary plot against the Bolshevik government. While Reilly was being interrogated, the Soviets publicly claimed that he had been shot trying to cross the Finnish border. Historians debate whether Reilly was tortured while in OGPU custody. Cook contends that Reilly was not tortured other than psychologically by mock execution scenarios designed to shake the resolve of prisoners. During OGPU interrogation, Reilly maintained his charade of being a British subject born in Clonmel, Ireland, and would not reveal any intelligence matters. While facing such daily interrogation, Reilly kept a diary in his cell of tiny handwritten notes on cigarette papers which he hid in the plasterwork of a cell wall. While his Soviet captors were interrogating Reilly, he in turn was analysing and documenting their techniques. The diary was a detailed record of OGPU , and Reilly was understandably confident that such unique documentation would, if he escaped, <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> the British SIS. After Reilly's death, Soviet guards discovered the diary in Reilly's cell, and photographic enhancements were made by OGPU technicians.|$|E
