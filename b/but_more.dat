5|$|Foliose lichens such as Physcia caesia are {{intermediate}} {{in their}} response to air pollution — less sensitive than fruticose lichens, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> sensitive than crustose lichens.

5|$|Steel (with smaller {{carbon content}} than pig iron <b>but</b> <b>more</b> than wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity {{by using a}} bloomery.

These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.|$|E
