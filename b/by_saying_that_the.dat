5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5|$|Gummadi Venkateswara Rao was {{recommended}} to Chakrapani by Madhavapeddi Venkatramaiah. After auditioning other actors, Chakrapani asked Venkateswara Rao {{to make a}} cameo appearance as an interviewer. He received 5001,000 for a day's work, a generous salary for the time; actors in major film roles received 2,000 for 20 days of work. Chakrapani justified Venkateswara Rao's salary <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actor's family included three children who had moved to Madras (now Chennai). For a photo shoot, Rama Rao lent Venkateswara Rao his coat and placed a tilaka on his forehead. Allu Ramalingaiah was cast as the comic teacher-cum-ayurvedic-doctor Panthulu.|$|E
5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long and Winding Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He explained this <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they {{had to listen to}} themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen made {{his case to}} bowl {{officials}} <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4–4 teams and not played {{a game against the}} fifth, Miami. Three of those teams were selected ahead of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby North Carolina team; the Gator Bowl chose Clemson, a school with a traditionally well-traveling fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami. After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference. Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base, well-traveled fans, and greater television marketing potential.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Pain was {{too young}} to serve King William Rufus, but {{according}} to the later 12th-century writings of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlain—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that Pain was involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a body servant. Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental. Other evidence against Map's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.|$|E
5|$|Topologically, the Pythagorean tiling has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the truncated square tiling by squares and regular octagons. The smaller squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles, as are the squares in the truncated square tiling, while the larger squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small, just as the octagons in the truncated square tiling. However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this can be explained <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> truncated square tiling has dihedral symmetry around {{the center of each}} tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it p4 symmetry. It is a chiral pattern, meaning {{that it is impossible to}} superpose it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations.|$|E
