40|$|Background: For allied health {{professionals}} wishing {{to assess the}} functional balance of older adults living in the community, the vast number of functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> available {{makes it difficult to}} decide which assessment is most appropriate. Objective: To identify the reliability, concurrent validity and clinical practicality of functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> with community dwelling older adults. Methods: A systematic review of published literature relevant to 17 functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> was undertaken. The 17 functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> were identified by a preliminary literature search and through consultation with an expert in the field of functional balance assessment. Studies published in English before January 2007, assessing the use of these functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> with community dwelling adults aged 65 years or above were included. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, Ageline, Amed, PubMed, Cochrane library, PEDro and Joanna Briggs Institute databases were searched. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using a checklist criteria adapted from the Cochrane Working Group for Screening and Diagnostic Tests. Results: Eight databases were searched and 21 studies were included. The majority of studies demonstrated low to moderate methodological quality scores. Despite limitations reported for clinical application with community dwelling older adults, the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go Test have been most rigorously tested. Reliability and concurrent validity of the Balance Screening Tool and the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale had also been established in this population, however only one study was retrieved for each.

Sixty-six residents of two independent life-care communities, aged 69 to 94 years (X= 79. 2, SD= 6. 2), partic-ipated. Methods. Subjects completed a questionnaire pertaining to their fall history and activity level. The Berg <b>balance</b> <b>test,</b> consisting of 14 functional subtests, was then administered. Six months later, subjects again completed the questionnaire. Results. Perfornlance of activities of daily living predicted 43 % of the subjects ' scores. There was a difference between the subjects who were prone to falling and those who were not prone to falling, but the test demonstrated poor sensitivity for predicting who would fall. The specificity of the test was very strong. The use of an assistive device was a strong predictor of perfor~nance on the Berg <b>balance</b> <b>test.</b> No relationship was noted between increasing age and decreasing performance on the Berg <b>balance</b> <b>test.</b> Conclusion and Discussion. Although the Berg <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> demonstrated only 53 % sensitivity, the results support the test developers ' use of 45 (out of 56) as a generalized cutoff score. Older adults who scored higher than the cutoff score on the test were less likely to fall than were those adults who scored below the cutoff score. Decreased scores, however, did not predict increased frequency of falls. Results must be viewed cautiously because self-report was the sole Ineans of documenting fall history.

To date, normative data on the Wii Board Basic <b>Balance</b> <b>Test</b> is not available. Purpose: This study will compare the performance of concussed and nonconcussed individuals on the Wii Basic <b>Balance</b> <b>Test.</b> Method: A between subject design between the two groups of participants is used. The nonconcussed sample group consisted of 84 college students, 53 females and 31 males. The second group consists of 20 concussed participants, 12 males and 8 females. A parametric Univariate Analysis (1 way ANOVA) and a non-parametric Chi-Square test were used to compare between group performances. Results: Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the number of trials completed between groups (F(1, 102) = 6. 475, p=. 012, η 2 =. 060) and the difference, in time, required to complete trial 1 on the Wii Basic <b>Balance</b> <b>Test</b> (p 3 ̆c. 001).

40|$|Objective: The {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to examine the effect using specific balance training methods in order to improve competence and balance during the initial phase snowboarding. Method. 20 recreational snowboarders (22 ± 1. 5) were split into two separate conditions, a control condition (n= 10) and an experiment condition (n= 10). The control condition completed specific strength training, and the experiment condition performed specific balance training exercises. Each condition performed three separate balance tests on the RS footscan, Star Excursion <b>Balance</b> <b>Test</b> and Snowboard <b>balance</b> <b>test,</b> both pre and post intervention. Results. Specific balance training does have an effect on balance abilities in relation to the snowboarding <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> compared to strength training. Increasing stability by 37 % for the balance training and 1 % in strength training. However, specific balance training has minimal to no effect in relation to strength training on footscan balance capabilities and Star Excursion <b>Balance</b> <b>Test</b> scores. Both conditions diminish postural control in single foot capability tasks. Conclusion. Specific balance training has a positive effect on snowboarding balance when on the snowboarding test; the use of stability cushions was a key factor in this result. The results of the other tests showed no difference between the two conditions, which is down to the duration of the intervention training being too short.
