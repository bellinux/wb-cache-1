50|$|Apart from agriculture, {{there are}} minimal {{economic}} and trade barriers between the European Union and Switzerland. In {{the wake of}} the Swiss voters' rejection of the European Economic Area Agreement in 1992, the Swiss Government set its sights on negotiating bilateral economic agreements with the EU. Four years of negotiations culminated in Bilaterals, a cross-platform agreement covering seven sectors: research, public procurement, technical barriers to trade, agriculture, civil aviation, land transport, and the free movement of persons. Parliament officially endorsed the Bilaterals in 1999 and it was approved by general referendum in May 2000. The agreements, which were then ratified by the European Parliament and the legislatures of its member states, entered into force on June 1, 2002. The Swiss government has since embarked on a second round of negotiations, called the <b>Bilaterals</b> <b>II,</b> which will further strengthen the country's economic ties with the organisation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the treatment success rate of Class II malocclusion without extractions, according to initial severity. Methods: Class II subjects (n = 276) were divided into 2 groups according to the severity of the malocclusion. Group 1 comprised 144 patients with <b>bilateral</b> half Class <b>II</b> malocclusion at the initial mean age of 12. 27 years. Group 2 comprised 132 patients who initially had <b>bilateral</b> complete Class <b>II</b> malocclusion at the initial mean age of 12. 32 years. The patients` initial and final study models were evaluated with Grainger`s treatment priority index. Chi-square tests were used to test for differences between the 2 groups for categorical variables. Variables regarding occlusal results were compared with independent t tests. Results: Group 1 had a significantly better final occlusal result, a shorter treatment time, and a higher treatment efficiency index. Conclusions: Based on these results, it was concluded that <b>bilateral</b> half Class <b>II</b> malocclusion has a better treatment success rate than <b>bilateral</b> complete Class <b>II</b> malocclusion when treatment is conducted without extractions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to investigate the perception of esthetic changes in the facial profile of <b>bilateral</b> Class <b>II</b> patients treated with the Modified Thurow Appliance for extraoral treatment. Silhouettes were traced of profiles of patients who initially presented a <b>bilateral</b> Class <b>II</b> molar relationship and who, post-treatment, presented molars in a Class I relationship. Three groups were formed: the first composed of patients with maxillary protrusion (SNA > 84 °), the second with maxillary retrusion (SNA < 80 °), and the third with a well-positioned maxilla (SNA 80 - 84 °). A panel of 200 lay evaluators judged the profile esthetics by a randomized drawing of the silhouettes. The multiple analysis results showed that the profile esthetic scores for the three positions of the maxilla were greatly influenced by significant interactions with the characteristics (like sex and age) of the evaluators: retrusive maxilla (Score *Age Group, p< 0. 001), normal maxilla (Score *Sex, p= 0. 024; Score *Age Group,p= 0. 050) and protrusive maxilla (Score *Age Group,p< 0. 001). It was observed that the profile of Class II patients with protrusion, normal relationship and retrusion of the maxilla, improved in their esthetic post-treatment result; however, the evaluators showed greater satisfaction with the groups of protrusion and normal position of the maxilla. The Modified Thurow Appliance provided significant improvements in the esthetics of the profile of patients who presented protrusion and normal position of the maxilla.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of patient position (supine and prone) on conventional bilateral field, three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans in patients of brainstem glioma with a view to exploring the possibility of avoiding beam entry through immobilization accessories. Methods: Five patients of brainstem glioma were immobilized and scanned in supine and prone positions with a combination of head rest and thermoplastic cast. Each patient was planned with three techniques: (i) 2 -fields <b>bilateral</b> (<b>ii)</b> 3 -fields 3 DCRT, and (iii) 5 -fields IMRT. Plan quality was analyzed in terms of planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose to various critical organs at risk (OAR) for both the supine and prone treatment positions. Results: In case of bilateral fields (parallel opposed) planning, the PTV coverage and dose to the OAR were almost similar for both the supine and prone positions. In 3 DCRT plan, although the PTV coverage and dose to critical structures were comparable for both the supine and prone position, dose to cochlea was lower for the prone position plan. A modest decrease in maximum dose to optic nerves and mean dose to temporal lobes were also observed for the prone position plan. In IMRT plans, the PTV coverage and homogeneity were comparable in both the supine and prone positions. Reduction in average maximum and mean doses to all OARs with functional subunit (FSU) in series and parallel respectively was observed in the IMRT plan for prone position when compared to the supine position. Conclusion: Supine and prone positions resulted in almost similar dose distribution in all the three techniques applied. At some instances, the prone position showed better normal tissues sparing when compared to supine. Moreover, prone position is more likely to avoid attenuation due to immobilization devices and uncertainty in dose calculation under large inhomogeneities. </p...|$|R

The number of infiltrating leucocytes was investigated by flow cytometry. Sciatic nerve injury transiently increased the proportion of neurons expressing bradykinin receptors {{not only in the}} ipsilateral ganglia L 4 /L 5, but also in the homonymous contralateral ganglia and also bilaterally in the adjacent ganglia L 2 /L 3. Neurons of the ganglia T 12 /T 13 were not affected. The time course of upregulation was different between neurons of the injured nerve and uninjured ones. Furthermore, the proportion of neurons expressing a high density of receptors increased also bilaterally in ganglia L 4 /L 5 and L 2 /L 3. As on the ipsilateral side, the increase in neurons expressing bradykinin receptors in the contralateral homonymous ganglia was due to an induction of the B 1 receptor subtype and an upregulation of the B 2 subtype. As a possible source for stimulating factors for induction of bradykinin receptors the number of macrophages and lymphocytes was investigated two to twenty days after nerve ligation. No increase was observed prior to day ten and only in ipsilateral ganglia L 4 /L 5, not contralaterally and not in adjacent ganglia L 2 /L 3 and T 12 /T 13. The experiments show that the induction of bradykinin receptors following a unilateral nerve lesion is not restricted to neurons projecting into the damaged nerve but is (i) <b>bilateral,</b> (<b>ii)</b> different in time course between injured and uninjured neurons, and (iii) locally confined to neurons of the adjacent ganglia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: <b>Bilateral</b> Class <b>II</b> furcation lesions were surgically created and allowed to become chronic in the mandibular third premolars of 9 dogs. The defects were randomly assigned to: A) GTR+BG and B) GTR+BG+PRP. Similar defects were created in the maxillary third premolars and received the same treatments after 45 days. Dogs were sacrificed 90 days after the first treatment. The histometric parameters evaluated were: connective tissue adaptation, new cementum, new bone, mineralized bone area, non-mineralized bone area, and residual BG particle area.

Reconstructive procedures have been used with varying success during the past decades to accomplish this goal. Aim: To evaluate whether the use of porous hydroxyapatite alone or a bioresorbable membrane alone would enhance the clinical results in the treatment of class II furcation defects in human lower molars. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with chronic periodontitis, aged between 39 and 49 years, with a pair of similar <b>bilateral</b> class <b>II</b> furcation defects (classification of Hamp et al.) in mandibular first molars were selected.
