Therefore, the cooling capacity will vary as the engine speed changes. To meet the air conditioning (AC) demand, the compressor continually cycles on and off. In the research, the compressor of the AAC is driven by an electric motor {{which in turn is}} operated by electrical <b>battery</b> (<b>12</b> <b>volt).</b> The use of direct current compressor (DCC) is seen as a solution of the existing system. Using the proposed system, DCC gets significant improvements in energy efficiency. Compared with AAC system, the energy conservation effect is about 77. 5 % to 86. 35 %...|$|E

To change the wind energy become electric energy was needed a generator (Y. Daryanto, 2007). The problem often faced by the power station were the damage on electricity component, efficient energy conversion, handle input that often change, and also output form was appropriate with requirement (Sugata Pikatan, 1999), related with it was needed was conducted characteristic test of windmill electricity component as generator of electric energy. To make performance suitable with average wind speed in Malang 2 - 5 m/s, and maximize speed 13 m/s (BMG Karang Ploso Malang).

5000|$|Although the ME F was an {{interchangeable}} lens camera (the photographer could remove and exchange its lens for another), its AF function required the unique SMC Pentax AF 35 mm-70 mm f/2.8 Zoom Lens autofocus lens using a special Pentax K-F lens mount. Unlike all later Pentax AF SLRs, the ME F {{did not have}} the focusing drive motor and keying shaft built into the camera body. The drive motor was in the lens instead. This lens also had a bulky underslung battery compartment that held four 1.5 <b>Volt</b> AAA alkaline <b>batteries</b> (<b>1.2</b> <b>Volt</b> rechargeables not compatible) to power the motor. It had 7 elements in 7 groups, was 76.5 mm long, 73 mm in diameter, 87 mm high through the battery compartment, weighed 580 g, had a minimum focusing distance of 1.2 m and was threaded for 58 mm accessories.

It is one of two [...] "bottle shaped" [...] beacons located in Buffalo Harbor; the other is the South Buffalo North Side Light. It is a 29 ft high beacon constructed of boiler plate. It measures 10 ft at the bottom and 2 ft at the top. It is distinguished by four cast iron port windows and a curved iron door. It was first lit on September 1, 1903, and originally equipped with a 6th-order Fresnel lens. A <b>battery</b> operated <b>12</b> <b>volt</b> lamp with a 300 mm green plastic lens was installed in the beacon c. 1960, when a domed roof formerly mounted over the lens was removed.

40|$|Electric wrist {{rotation}} {{has been}} available with electric hands for approximately 20 years. Although it is integrated with the Otto Bock electric hand, via their quick-disconnected wrist component, the electric wrist {{has been used in}} only a fraction of electric prostheses because of four perceived problems: 1) the additional length required in he forearm, which could eliminate mid-to-long transradial amputees as candidates, 2) the additional weight of the component, although only about 100 gm, 3) the speculation of most prescribing MD's and prosthetists that the function of electric writs rotation is unnecessary and unused by amputees, and 4) the difficulty of using the tiaditional wrist control methods. The introduction in 1989 of a proportional controller, which allows a simple switching method using muscles cocontraction, possibly makes an impact on problems # 3 and # 4 above. The control method is speculated to be easier to learn and to use, and also allows proportional control of the wrist rotation Powered by a 9 <b>volt</b> <b>battery,</b> or <b>12</b> <b>volt</b> in above-elbow applications, greater speed of wrists rotation is also provided. The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the actual usage of electiic wrist by the wearers of proportional systems, and to document the functions in which electric wrist rotation has proved valuable, if any. Also, the stuvey hopes to provide indications of the present drawbacks which remain, and provide direction for future improvements. The results to-date of the survey will be presented, and any conclusions which are warranted by the data. Future developments which could impact upon electric prosthesis usage will also be discussed.
