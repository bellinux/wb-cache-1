On the front of the bag is a depiction of a big western black hat, a trademark piece of clothing for Shelby. He was a founder of the Terlingua International Chili Championship in Terlingua, Texas.|$|E
25|$|Genetic drift is a {{cause of}} allelic {{frequency}} change within populations of a species. Alleles are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles {{of the same size}} and weight but of different colors from a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag.</b> In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales {{selection}} bias is a perceived bias by selectors of the Australian cricket teams towards players from New South Wales. It was exemplified in a quote by former South Australian captain David Hookes who said that, [...] "when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, {{they give you}} a baggy green one in a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> as well to save making two presentations". This is an example of confirmation bias and Hookes' comment came at a time when, especially during the 1980s, there was a public perception that strong performances by non-NSW players were often ignored by the Australian selectors in favour of seemingly under-performing NSW players who were selected for the Test and/or One-Day team. The claims persist {{in spite of the fact}} that no New South Welshman has occupied a position on the National Selection Panel since John Benaud in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Vander Zalm {{became the}} new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, {{and led the}} party to victory in the {{election}} later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in {{a conflict of interest}} scandal following the sale of Fantasy Gardens, a Christian and Dutch culture theme park built by the Premier, to Tan Yu, a Filipino Chinese gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor Faye Leung of a party in the [...] "Howard Hughes Suite" [...] on the top two floors of the Bayshore Inn, where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a bag of money in a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and Rita Johnston became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor Mike Harcourt.|$|E
25|$|A bag is a non-rigid or {{semi-rigid}} container usually made of paper {{which is used}} to hold items or packages. In 1868, Margaret E.

2500|$|The {{original}} album featured {{an unusual}} gimmick: the album had an outer sleeve {{which was made}} to look like a plain <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> (reminiscent of similarly packaged bootleg album sleeves with the title rubber-stamped on it), and the inner sleeve featured black and white line artwork which, if washed with water, would become permanently fully coloured. There were also six different sleeves featuring a different pair of photos (one on each side), and the external brown paper sleeve meant that it was impossible for record buyers to tell which sleeve they were getting (there is actually a code on the spine of the album jacket which indicated which sleeve it was—this could sometimes be seen while the record was still sealed). The pictures all depicted the same scene in a bar (in which a man burns a Dear John letter), and each photo was taken from the separate point of view of someone who appeared in the other photos. [...] The walls are covered with thousands of yellowed business cards and dollar bills. The photo session in a London studio was meant to look like a re-creation of the Old Absinthe House, in New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, 1978, Washington, D.C. police detectives {{received}} {{a tip from}} a reliable source describing a man known as [...] "Bandit" [...] who was selling illegal narcotics stored {{in the trunk of}} his car. The informant gave the location of the car and a description of both car and driver. The detectives discovered the parked car, and called for a computer check on the car, which confirmed that the car's owner matched the description and used the alias [...] "Bandit". Shortly thereafter they observed the car being driven by a man matching the description. They stopped the car and ordered the driver out. After noticing a bullet on the front seat, they searched the glove compartment and discovered a pistol, at which point they arrested the driver, identified as Albert Ross. A detective then opened the trunk and discovered a closed <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag.</b> He opened the bag and found numerous bags containing white powder, which were later identified as heroin. During a later search, they also found and opened a zippered red leather pouch, which contained $3,200 in cash. No warrant was obtained for these searches.|$|E
2500|$|On the October 16, 2008 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hoyt and Rave were {{attacked}} by Kurt Angle, and were hospitalized. As Hemme attempted to leave the building {{and go to the}} hospital, The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) and Cute Kip confronted and insulted her, which led to the trio attacking her and placing a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> over her head. Hemme transitioned into a [...] face by defeating Sky on the October 23, 2008 episode of Impact!. She feuded with the Beautiful People, which resulted in two consecutive tag team matches with ODB and Sojourner Bolt as per partners, respectively. After showcasing improved wrestling skills, Hemme was then placed into a more active in-ring role, being pushed to challenge Awesome Kong for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at Final Resolution, after defeating Raisha Saeed on the November 27 episode of TNA Impact!. Hemme then teamed with A.J. Styles in a mixed tag team match against Kong and Scott Steiner, where Hemme pinned Kong. At Final Resolution, Hemme was attacked by Saeed and Rhaka Khan and won the match by disqualification, and thus Kong retained the title. Hemme was subsequently granted a rematch at Genesis. A week later, Hemme teamed with ODB against Khan and Saeed in a winning effort. On January 2009, Hemme sustained a neck injury while training in the ring with Styles for her match, and was deemed unable to compete at Genesis.|$|E
50|$|Knight {{moved to}} Springfield, Massachusetts in 1867 and {{was hired by}} the Columbia <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Company. In 1868, Knight invented a machine that folded and glued paper to form the {{flat-bottomed}} <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> familiar to shoppers today. Knight built a wooden model of the device, but needed a working iron model to apply for a patent. Charles Annan, who was in the machine shop where Knight's iron model was being built, stole her design and patented the device. Knight filed a successful patent interference lawsuit and was awarded the patent in 1871. With a Massachusetts business partner, Knight established the Eastern <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Co. and received royalties.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Brown</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Test was a type {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in the United States. A <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> {{was used as a}} way {{to determine whether or not}} an individual could have certain privileges; only individuals with a skin color that is the same color or lighter than a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were allowed. The test was used in the 20th century within many social institutions such as African-American sororities, fraternities, and churches. In addition, brown paper bags were used in multi-racial social events. The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification within the African-American population. The <b>Brown</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Test arose from the practice of discrimination based on skin color.|$|E

50|$|Colorism is not {{a synonym}} to racism as colorism can occur, and often does, within racial and ethnic groups. The <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test was used in America for black people to be further divided: those lighter than a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were allotted some {{privilege}} that those darker were not permitted to. The <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test and colorism add to the fuel of intersectionality: recognizing the different identities of an individual {{in order to better}} understand one's lived experiences which can be different by race, gender, sexuality, as well as color, amongst other qualities. The <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test is not used outright today but there are still implications of colorism; for example in media, lighter skin black females are often more sexualized than their darker counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|Wise Foods {{started as}} Wise Potato Chip Company, founded in Berwick, Pennsylvania, in 1921 {{by a young}} man named Earl Wise, Sr.. He owned Wise Delicatessen and began making potato chips as a way to make use of excess potatoes, {{initially}} cooking them in his mother's kitchen, and then selling them to customers in <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bags.</b> At the time, potato chips were generally kept in glass display cases, or cracker barrels, and scooped into <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> for customers. The bags developed grease spots and did not keep the chips fresh for very long, eventually leading to the development of waxed <b>paper</b> <b>bags.</b> Wise's chips proved an immediate hit with customers and soon the delicatessen owner became a regional potato chip mogul.
