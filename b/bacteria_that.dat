5|$|Linezolid is an {{antibiotic}} {{used for the}} treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may be used for a variety of other infections including drug resistant tuberculosis. It is used either by injection into a vein or by mouth. Linezolid {{is a member of the}} oxazolidinone class of medications.|$|E
5|$|A few {{bacteria}} have {{chemical systems}} that generate light. This bioluminescence often occurs in <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> live {{in association with}} fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5000|$|M. pneumoniae is a <b>bacterium</b> <b>that</b> {{belongs to}} the phylum Firmicutes, class Mollicutes, order Mycoplasmatales and family Mycoplasmataceae. [...] It is either {{filamentous}} or spherical. Individual spindle-shaped cells of M. pneumoniae are 1 to 2 µm long and 0.1 to 0.2 µm wide. [...] M. pneumoniae is a motile, mesophilic <b>bacterium</b> <b>that</b> exhibits obligate aerobic respiration. It is an extracellular, host-associated <b>bacterium</b> <b>that</b> lacks a cell wall [...] and is unable to survive outside of a host due to osmotic instability in the environment.|$|R

5|$|Bog turtles {{may suffer}} from {{bacterial}} infections. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas are two genera of <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> cause pneumonia in individuals. Bacterial aggregates (sometimes known as biofilms) {{have also been}} found in the lungs of two deceased specimens discovered in 1982 and 1995 from colonies in the southern population.|$|E
5|$|Gallium maltolate, an oral, highly {{absorbable}} form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells, particularly {{cancer cells}} and some <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> accept {{it in place}} of ferric iron (Fe3+). Researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment {{for a number of}} cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of drug-resistant <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E

5|$|Microbes {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with larger organisms. For example, the <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> {{live within the}} human digestive system contribute to human health through gut immunity, the synthesis of vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and the fermentation of complex indigestible carbohydrates.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{study showed}} the {{potential}} for using probiotics for controlling S.iniae infection in trout. This study used the gastrointestinal contents of rainbow trout to scan for <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> inhibited growth of S.iniae and Lactococcus garvieae. They identified Aeromonas sobria as a potential candidate for control of S.iniae and L.garvieae infections in aquaculture. A.sobria, given live in the feed, protected the trout when challenged with S.iniae or L.garvieae.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E

5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid {{in the skin}} may {{contribute}} to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{contains}} a bioactive compound named clitocine that has antibiotic activity against {{a number of}} <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> are pathogenic to humans, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis; an earlier (1945) study showed antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, and Brucea abortus. Clitocine {{has also been shown}} to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa). The mycelia of L.giganteus, when grown in liquid culture, has been shown to produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E

5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E
5|$|Pet rats {{can also}} develop {{pituitary}} tumors {{if they are}} given high-calorie diets, and ringtail if they are placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures. Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> commonly reside {{on the top of}} the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various <b>bacteria</b> <b>that</b> form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
