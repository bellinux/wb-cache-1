The purpose of the study is to investigate hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> genotypes distribution, the high-risk genotypes and the occult infection in north-western China's hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Methods Hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> genotypes A-D of hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissues and serum samples in 268 north-western China hepatocellular carcinoma patients were detected by fluorescence polarization assay. The hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> genotypes in serum and matched primary tumor tissue samples were compared. Hepatitis B surface antigen and α-fetoprotein in serum were detected. Occult hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> infections were analyzed. The relationship between hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> genotypes and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed statistically using SPSS v. 10. 0.

40|$|Plasmacytoid {{dendritic}} cells (pDC) are {{a specialized}} group of circulating dendritic cells that respond to viral nucleic acids with Type I IFN production {{as well as}} other cytokine and chemokines. These pDC responses lead to the production of antiviral molecules and recruitment of defense cells. During zoonotic <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> infection, a simplex virus of the subfamily Alphaherpesviridae, our lab has observed that infected individuals who succumb to infection have little-to-no-antibody or cell-mediated defenses. To identify whether this was partly due to failure of pDCs to produce antiviral interferon responses or produce chemokine and cytokines, we tested the hypothesis that <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> modulates the IFN response during zoonotic infection by blocking pDC activation and subsequent IFN signaling pathways to circumvent host defenses, while these pathways remain intact in the macaque hosts. We showed that human pDCs respond to <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> through the production of IFN-a, IL- 1 a, IL- 6, TNF-a, MIP- 1 a/b and IP- 10. Human pDCs co-cultured with <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> infected fibroblasts produced fewer cytokines and at lower levels. The macaque response to <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> was measured using PBMCs, as there are no specific reagents available to enrich macaque pDCs. Human and macaque PBMCs produced IFN-a when exposed directly to <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> infected lysates. Co-cultures of PBMCs with <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> infected fibroblasts from both hosts failed to produce any significant amounts of IFN-a. To quantify the antiviral effects of PBMC induced IFN-a, we measured <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> titers after exposure to supernatants from <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> exposed PBMCs, PBMC co-cultures with infected fibroblasts and exogenous recombinant Type I IFN. Our data further suggest that <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> resistance was not due to virus specific blockade of the Type I IFN signaling pathway because STAT- 1 was activated in infected fibroblasts when treated with Type I IFNs. These data demonstrate {{for the first time that}} <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> replication is unimpeded in the presence of any source of IFN-a in either host cell type.

The ƒ× 134. 5 gene of HSV- 1 {{plays a major role}} in counteracting dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activity. HSV- 1 Us 11 protein, if expressed early as a result of mutation, binds to PKR and prevents PKR activation. The results of experiments in this dissertation revealed that although <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> lacks a ƒ× 134. 5 gene homolog, it is able to inhibit PKR activation, and subsequently, eIF 2 ƒÑ phosphorylation. The initial hypothesis was that <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> Us 11 protein substitutes for the function of ƒ× 134. 5 gene homolog by blocking cellular PKR activation. Using western blot analysis, Us 11 protein (20 kDa) of <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> was observed early following infection (3 h post infection). Expression of <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> Us 11 protein was not blocked by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), an inhibitor of DNA replication, confirming Us 11 is not a ¡§true late¡¨ gene of <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> as it is in HSV- 1. Analysis of these results suggested that <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> Us 11 protein compensates for the lack of the ƒ× 134. 5 gene homolog and prevents PKR activation. Next, the results demonstrated that <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> Us 11 recombinant protein prevented PKR activation by dsRNA in vitro. A <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> Us 11 protein stable expression cell line (U 373 -BVUs 11) was established to investigate whether Us 11 protein inhibited PKR activation in vivo.
