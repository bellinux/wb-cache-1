6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> LAW, OR <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of <b>the</b> law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse; for mark, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, seeing those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> other covenant <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but <b>the</b> rest <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law (Gal 3:9).|$|R

Amendments to the Parliament Act 1911 were made to prolong the life of the 1910 parliament following the outbreak of the First World War and 1935 parliament because of the Second World War. These made special exemptions to the requirement to hold a general election every five years.|$|E

For a number of years, William's position was very insecure. In order to project his influence northwards to control the people of the Danelaw (an area that had for a time <b>been</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York.

5|$|Arad has, {{since its}} {{inception}} in 1962, <b>been</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> governance of a regional council and local council, before being designated as a city council in 1995.

The first mayor of the city of Arad was Betzalel Tabib who served as both head of the local council and city council. He was replaced by Mordechai Brill in 2003, although due to his inability to pass a yearly budget, Brill was dismissed by the Minister of the Interior Meir Sheetrit in August 2007, and a government-appointed clerk, Gideon Bar-Lev, took his place. An election took place again 13 April 2010, won by Tali Ploskov of the Yisrael Beiteinu party. The longest serving head of Arad's municipality was Avraham Shochat who served as head of the local council between 1967 and 1986.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English in language and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having <b>been</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E

30|$|Tirumandiram {{goes further}} {{and says that}} even <b>the</b> popular deities <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of the innate impurities (v 2183). Brahma <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of the five mala, Vishnu <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of four, Hara <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of three, Isa <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of two and Sadāsiva <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of ānava mala. Thus, the mala-free states begin only from Sakthi. Tirumūlar describes the ānava, kanmam and maya as the inner covering, husk and awn that encase a paddy grain. Thus, the mala do not change the soul but cover it like a shell (v 2192). Paul Murphy (1986 : 27) quotes verse 57 from Abhnivagupta’s Paramartasara which uses an identical imagery of a husk, awn and chaff and says that without these coating the seed will be “freed” from growth.|$|R

5|$|Established on 25 March 1941 in {{response}} to lobbying by women wanting {{to serve in the}} war, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy. Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June; this number would grow to around a thousand {{by the end of the}} year. For the first three months of its existence the WAAAF had <b>been</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> temporary command of Flight Officer Mary Bell, wife of an RAAF group captain and former Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an organisation of female pilots and ground staff that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force. Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson's appointment, rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity; she later rejoined at Wrigley's request, on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than flight officer.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became alienated from them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over Epirus {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of Ioannina. Within a short time, the Nicaeans had been evicted from Epirus. John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as playing a role in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, which seem rather to have <b>been</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of Nikephoros.|$|E
5|$|Government troops killed Jonas Savimbi on 22 February 2002, in Moxico province.

After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over how to proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had <b>been</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier.
