5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it {{is golden}} in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the <b>barley</b> <b>flour</b> that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5|$|The {{male who}} {{performs}} the shraddha {{should take a}} purifying bath beforehand {{and is expected to}} wear a dhoti. He wears a ring of kush grass. Then the ancestors are invoked to reside in the ring. The shraddha is usually performed bare-chested, as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony. The shraddha involves pinda-daan, which is an offering to the ancestors of pindas (cooked rice and <b>barley</b> <b>flour</b> balls mixed with ghee and black sesame seeds), accompanying the release of water from the hand. It is followed by the worship of Vishnu in form of the darbha grass, a gold image or Shaligram stone and Yama. The food offering is then made, cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof. The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of the ancestors. A cow and a dog are also fed, and Brahmin priests are also offered food. Once the ancestors (crow) and Brahmins have eaten, the family members can begin lunch.|$|E

5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened <b>barley</b> <b>flour</b> and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

40|$|Addition or supplementation of legumes and {{oilseeds}} into cereal-based foods {{has many}} health benefits. Objective: This study was aimed {{to analyze the}} sensory, nutritional and glycemic properties of biscuits from cereal (oats and barley) and legume based (soybean and chickpea) combinations for diabetic patients. Design: Intervention study. Different blends of salty biscuits were prepared using the cereal and pulses above mentioned. Subjects: Ten healthy subjects in {{the age group of}} 20 - 40 years were selected from department of Food and Nutrition, Punjab Agricultural University for examining the glycemic index. Results: Biscuits made from these cereal pulse combinations were highly acceptable and were chosen for nutritional analysis. The results of nutritional analysis showed increased protein (11. 72 g/ 100 g), crude fiber (1. 5 g/ 100 g) and ash content (4. 68 g/ 100 g) and decreased content of carbohydrates (47 g/ 100 g) in blend containing refined wheat <b>flour,</b> <b>barley</b> and soy <b>flour</b> (25 : 50 : 25). Glycemic index of the acceptable and highly nutritious blend (Refined wheat <b>flour,</b> <b>barley</b> and soy <b>flour</b> 25 : 50 : 25) was 38. 7, whereas for control salty biscuits, it was 84.

25|$|Libyan cuisine derives {{much from}} the traditions of Mediterranean, North African, and Berber cuisines. One {{of the most popular}} Libyan dishes is Bazin, an unleavened bread {{prepared}} with barley, water and salt. Bazin is prepared by boiling <b>barley</b> <b>flour</b> in water and then beating it to create a dough using a magraf, which is a unique stick designed for this purpose. Pork consumption is forbidden, in accordance with Sharia, the religious laws of Islam. Tripoli is Libya's capital, and the cuisine is particularly influenced by Italian cuisine. Pasta is common, and many seafood dishes are available. Southern Libyan cuisine is more traditionally Arab and Berber. Common fruits and vegetables include figs, dates, oranges, apricots and olives.|$|E
25|$|Ladakhi {{food has}} {{much in common}} with Tibetan food, the most {{prominent}} foods being thukpa (noodle soup) and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as ngampe (roasted <b>barley</b> <b>flour).</b> Edible without cooking, tsampa makes useful trekking food. A dish that is strictly Ladakhi is skyu, a heavy pasta dish with root vegetables. As Ladakh moves toward a cash-based economy, foods from the plains of India are becoming more common. As in other parts of Central Asia, tea in Ladakh is traditionally made with strong green tea, butter, and salt. It is mixed in a large churn and known as gurgur cha, after the sound it makes when mixed. Sweet tea (cha ngarmo) is common now, made in the Indian style with milk and sugar. Most of the surplus barley that is produced is fermented into chang, an alcoholic beverage drunk especially on festive occasions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{structural}} {{characteristics and}} physicochemical properties of barley starch differ with granule size, which {{are important in}} final product applications of <b>barley</b> <b>flours.</b> A <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar, Yangsimai 3, was used to investigate the development of small starch granule in endosperm under electron microscope to provide references to barley breeding. Large starch granules were formed and developed at the early stage of endosperm development. Large amyloplasts with large starch granules were divided and increased in number through binary fission. One large amyloplast had only 1 large starch granule. Small starch granules could be formed and develop at the middle and late stage of endosperm development. Endosperm cells had large amyloplasts that exhibited protrusion, {{and some of the}} protrusions contained small starch granules. Small amyloplasts with small starch granules formed new small amyloplasts to produce small starch granules by the way of protruding their envelopes. Many small starch granules were formed and developed in 1 small amyloplast. The amyloplast envelope began to degrade and release starch granules into cell matrix when amyloplast was full of starch granules. These results showed that small amyloplasts came from the protrusion of amyloplast envelopes. Many small starc...|$|R

25|$|Barley meal, a wholemeal <b>barley</b> <b>flour</b> {{lighter than}} wheat meal but darker in colour, {{is used in}} {{porridge}} and gruel in Scotland. Barley meal gruel is known as sawiq in the Arab world.

Barley soup is traditionally eaten during Ramadan in Saudi Arabia. Cholent or hamin (in Hebrew) is a traditional Jewish stew often eaten on Sabbath, in a variety of recipes by both Mizrachi and Ashkenazi Jews, with barley cited throughout the Hebrew Bible in multiple references. In Eastern and Central Europe, barley is also used in soups and stews such as ričet. In Africa, where it is a traditional food plant, it has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.|$|E
25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and <b>barley</b> <b>flour</b> continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.|$|E
