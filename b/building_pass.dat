Following a chance meeting with the Bolshoi's new artistic director, Makhar K. Vaziev, Dmitrichenko was granted a <b>building</b> <b>pass</b> and returned the Bolshoi for morning practice routines only. General director Vladimir Urin stated after Dmitrichenko's release that the dancer could audition to rejoin the company provided there was an opening and provided he proved himself as an artist.|$|E
50|$|On April 13, 2010, the United States Army {{announced}} that it would court-martial Lt. Colonel Terrence Lee Lakin, an osteopathic physician and surgeon in the Army Medical Corps, for refusing to report for deployment to Afghanistan. Lakin asserted that Obama was not a U.S. citizen, was not legally the commander-in-chief and, therefore, lacked the authority to send him to Afghanistan. The military revoked Lakin's Pentagon <b>building</b> <b>pass</b> and confiscated his government-issued laptop computer. Lakin was assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center while awaiting trial.|$|E
50|$|On July 23, 2003 at 2:08 p.m., City Hall was {{the scene}} of a rare {{political}} assassination. Othniel Askew, a political rival of City Councilman James E. Davis, opened fire with a pistol from the balcony of the City Council chamber. Askew shot Davis twice, fatally wounding him. A police officer {{on the floor of the}} chamber then fatally shot Askew. Askew and Davis had entered the building together without passing through a metal detector, a courtesy extended to elected officials and their guests. As a result of the security breach, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg revised security policy to require that everyone entering the <b>building</b> <b>pass</b> through metal detectors without exception.|$|E

5000|$|Dmitrichenko stated {{during a}} bail hearing {{that he was}} {{frustrated}} with the inequitable and [...] "unjust" [...] allocation of funds distributed to dancers in the company. When he voiced his frustration, Zarutsky suggested that they [...] "beat up" [...] Filin. In the courtroom, the judge questioned Dmitrichenko {{whether or not he}} would like to apologize to Filin. Dmitrichenko defiantly responded with [...] "For what?" [...] At that point, the judge denied bail, which resulted in incarceration for six weeks, while investigators and attorneys prepared for the trial. The three men who confessed to the crime faced a maximum sentence of 12 years. Dmitrichenko was sentenced to six years in prison, but he was released early for good behavior in May 2016. In October 2016, Dmitrichenko was granted a <b>building</b> <b>pass</b> to the Bolshoi Theater, and returned for morning exercises.|$|E
5000|$|Lack of {{maintenance}} {{meant that the}} exterior of the building deteriorated rapidly but the interior remained in surprisingly good condition, with most of the original architectural and theatre features still in situ. January 1992 saw ownership of the <b>building</b> <b>pass</b> to the London-based Launchsign Ltd, which announced their intention to completely restore the building and introduce a Covent Garden style indoor market to the former theatre area. Despite the grandiose plans, no effort was made to repair or even secure the theatre building, which became increasingly vandalised and a meeting place for local youths. The process of decay accelerated, until the almost inevitable arson attack in 1994 destroyed the main theatre building. The site has never been cleared properly and remains an eyesore until the present day. Attempts by Conwy County Council to redevelop the site have been constantly rebuffed by the current owner, a Worcester businessman called David Taylor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} {{a simple way}} to parallelize the algorithm for computing Morse decompositions and nearly recurrent sets for piecewise constant vector fields. In this chapter, we focus on the most computationally expensive component of the algorithm, namely refinement of the transition graph, which often takes up over 90 % of the running time. The original implementation of the refinement algorithm refines nodes of the graph one at a time, in an arbitrary order. As a node is refined, arcs out of and into the resulting node are updated to preserve the key property of the graph, i. e. its ability to represent every trajectory of the vector field as a path in the graph. A significant portion of time is spent on updating and maintaining the integrity of the graph for each node that undergoes refinement. This approach is attractive and el-egant since it allows one to refine the nodes in arbitrary order and to an arbitrary depth while guaranteeing the correctness of the graph. However, its performance is suboptimal for most transition graph refinement scenarios, {{not only because of the}} cost of maintaining the integrity of the graph for each node refinement operation, but also because of uncontrollable memory access patterns. The method described in this chapter is tailored for the special case of nodes of the graph refined to the same depth, which is sufficient for most applications de-scribed in prior work. The idea is to stream through the set of arcs of the coarse graph to generate a compact bitmap based representation of the set of arcs of the refined graph. In the subsequent pass over the bitmap, the refined transition graph’s arcs are constructed from scratch, using only arc additions. The simplicity of the two passes makes them easy to parallelize and results in better cache performance. The bitmap <b>building</b> <b>pass</b> can be offloaded to the GPU to further increase the per-formance...|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the building started in 1787. Almost immediately, however, the Russian state ran low on funds {{as a result of}} expenditures in connection with the ongoing Russo-Turkish War. As a result, the province became indebted to Stenbock, and the unfinished <b>building</b> <b>passed</b> into his possession. He subsequently used it as his Tallinn residence, and the building still bears its name in his remembrance. In 1828, after Stenbock's death, the <b>building</b> <b>passed</b> between different owners until 1899, when it finally became the property of the Governorate administration and at last actually began {{to be used as a}} courthouse.|$|R
