5000|$|A resistance-capacity {{oscillator}} of {{the type}} just described should be well suited for laboratory service. It has the ease of handling of a <b>beat-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> and yet few of its disadvantages. In the first place the frequency stability at low frequencies {{is much better than}} is possible with the beat-frequency type. There need be no critical placements of parts to insure small temperature changes, nor carefully designed detector circuits to prevent interlocking of oscillators. As a result of this, the overall weight of the oscillator may be kept at a minimum. An oscillator of this type, including a 1 watt amplifier and power supply, weighed only 18 pounds, in contrast to 93 pounds for the General Radio <b>beat-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> of comparable performance. The distortion and constancy of output compare favorably with the best beat-frequency oscillators now available. Lastly, an oscillator of this type can be laid out and constructed on the same basis as a commercial broadcast receiver, but with fewer adjustments to make. It thus combines quality of performance with cheapness of cost to give an ideal laboratory oscillator.|$|E
50|$|By {{varying the}} BFO {{frequency}} around 44000 Hz, the listener can vary the output audio frequency; {{this is useful}} to correct for small differences between the tuning of the transmitter and the receiver, particularly useful when tuning in single sideband (SSB) voice. The waveform produced by the BFO beats against the IF signal in the mixer stage of the receiver. Any drift of the local oscillator or the <b>beat-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> will affect the pitch of the received audio, so stable oscillators are used.|$|E
5000|$|Eimert invited Stockhausen {{to become}} his {{assistant}} at the Cologne studio, and he arrived in March 1953 [...] In Paris, Stockhausen had already acquired some experience with various sound and tape editing processes. From this he knew that pitches, durations, and amplitudes could in fact be determined very accurately, but timbre eluded serial organisation. Soon after his arrival, Stockhausen came to regard the Monochord and Melochord (which had been purchased {{on the recommendation of}} Meyer-Eppler) as useless for the production of music that was to be organised in all its aspects, especially timbre. He turned to Fritz Enkel, the head of the calibration and testing department, and asked for a sine-wave generator or a <b>beat-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> capable of producing sine waves, from which Stockhausen intended to build sound spectra. Enkel was shocked, since the two recently acquired keyboard instruments, which Stockhausen was now telling him were of no use at all, had cost 120,000 Marks. Besides, Enkel told him, “It will never work!” Stockhausen responded, [...] "Maybe you're right, but I want to try it all the same" [...]|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with the study of aircraft and propeller noises, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics has developed an instrument for sound-frequency analysis which differs fundamentally from previous types, and which, owing to its simplicity of principle, construction, and operation, {{has proved to be}} of value in this investigation. The method is based on the well-known fact that the Ohmic loss in an electrical resistance is equal to the sum of the losses of the harmonic components of a complex wave, except for the case in which any two components approach or attain vectorial identity, in which case the Ohmic loss is increased by a definite amount. The principle of frequency analysis has been presented mathematically and a number of distinct advantages relative to previous methods have been pointed out. An automatic recording instrument embodying this principle is described in detail. It employs a <b>beat-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> as a source of variable frequency. A large number of experiments have verified the predicted superiority of the method. A number of representative records are presented...|$|E
