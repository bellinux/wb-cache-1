5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more rugged and consists of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called buttes. These buttes sometimes rise 400 to 600feet (120 to 180m) above the plains. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota <b>Badlands.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Kameo {{advances}} through a castle—with {{the help of}} three elemental powers—to rescue her family. As the tutorial prologue ends, Kameo loses her elemental powers and is ejected from the castle into the Enchanted Kingdom to grow stronger and try again. Kameo travels through four themed worlds (water, ice, fire, and swamp) at {{the outskirts of the}} <b>Badlands,</b> the overworld that connects the areas. Each of the worlds are interspersed with townsfolk and combat-oriented puzzles. Kameo can either travel to the worlds through the <b>Badlands,</b> where the elves and trolls skirmish, or warp from the Enchanted Kingdom. A help system built into the game provides hints or direct solutions for struggling players. Throughout the kingdom, Kameo finds and defeats the seven shadow creatures each guarding one of her elemental powers, while saving her family earning the other 3.|$|E

40|$|Bob Hawke's recent {{proposal}} for turning Australia's “dead heart” into the world's nuclear waste dump {{is a classic}} example of <b>badland</b> making and a timely reminder of the relevance of Ross Gibson‘s Seven Versions of an Australian <b>Badland</b> (2002). Closer to my home, in Central Queensland, a controversy is raging about globally significant developments in the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area. Australia (if not the whole world) may well be a <b>badland</b> in the making. The ways in which a powerful institution exploits a place is intimately related to pre-existing ideas (myths and assumptions) about that place. Ross Gibson asks us to seek “something good we can do in response to the bad in our lands” (3). One response begins by asking: is the badness in the land or does it reside elsewhere? If we analyze the discourses and practices of the various agencies and institutions governing the <b>badland</b> we may be able to formulate useful tactics of resistance to their strategies of domination...|$|R

5|$|In 1986, {{the park}} sold off {{a large number}} of horses, {{including}} herd stallions, and released several stallions with outside bloodlines into the herds. At this point, brothers Leo and Frank Kuntz began purchasing the horses with the aim of preserving the breed, and founded the Nokota Horse Conservancy in 1999, later beginning a breed registry through the same organization. Later, a second, short-lived, registry was begun by another organization in Minnesota. In 2009, the North Dakota <b>Badlands</b> Horse Registry was created, which registers the slightly different type of horses which have been removed from the park in recent years. Today, the park conducts regular thinning of the herd to keep numbers between 70 and 110, and the excess horses are sold off.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{has several}} sites {{administered}} by the National Park Service. Two national parks have been established in South Dakota, both in the state's southwestern part. Wind Cave National Park, established in 1903 in the Black Hills, has an extensive cave network {{as well as a}} large herd of bison. <b>Badlands</b> National Park was created in 1978. The park features an eroded, brightly colored landscape surrounded by semi-arid grasslands. Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925. The sculpture of four U.S. Presidents was carved into the mountainside by sculptor Gutzon Borglum.|$|E

5|$|The Edmontonian land {{vertebrate}} age {{is defined}} by the first appearance of Edmontosaurus regalis in the fossil record. Although sometimes reported as of exclusively early Maastrichtian age, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was of somewhat longer duration. Deposition began approximately 73million years ago, in the late Campanian, and ended between 68.0 and 67.6million years ago. Edmontosaurus regalis is known from the lowest of five units within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, but is absent from at least the second to the top. As many as three quarters of the dinosaur specimens from <b>badlands</b> near Drumheller, Alberta may pertain to Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Nokota {{horse is}} a feral and semi-feral horse breed {{located in the}} <b>badlands</b> of southwestern North Dakota in the United States. The breed {{developed}} in the 19th century from foundation bloodstock consisting of ranch-bred horses produced from the horses of local Native Americans mixed with Spanish horses, Thoroughbreds, harness horses and related breeds. The Nokota was almost wiped out during the early 20th century when ranchers, in cooperation with state and federal agencies, worked together to reduce competition for livestock grazing. However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park {{was created in the}} 1940s, a few bands were inadvertently trapped inside, and thus were preserved.|$|E

5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, <b>badlands,</b> and monoliths we see today.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Black Hills, much {{of western}} South Dakota {{features}} rock formed during the Mesozoic Era, from 250 million to 66million years ago. At the time, much of western and central South Dakota was again {{covered by a}} shallow inland sea. Marine skeletons from this ocean settled to the seafloor and were compacted to form the sedimentary rocks in the area today. During this period, the Black Hills, which had been pushed up to an elevation of around 15,000feet (4,500m), lost around 6,000feet (1,800m) worth of rock layers due to erosion. Many of these sediments {{ended up in the}} same area as the marine deposits from the inland sea, and both contribute to western South Dakota's present-day geological makeup. In several areas in western South Dakota, tertiary deposits may also be found. These were formed between 66 and 2.5million years ago from eroded mountains to the west. There is also volcanic material deposited here that presumably came from the Yellowstone area. These layers of sedimentary rock are distinctly visible in the multi-colored rocks and cliffs of <b>Badlands</b> National Park.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{is a state}} {{located in}} the north-central United States. It is usually {{considered}} {{to be in the}} Midwestern region of the country. The state can generally be divided into three geographic regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than {{the western part of the}} state, and the Black Hills are a low, isolated mountain group in the southwestern corner of the state. Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and the <b>Badlands.</b> Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years. South Dakota is the 17th-largest state in the country.|$|E

40|$|Deeply entrenched {{channels}} namely <b>badland</b> gullies {{occur on}} the gently sloping valley floors of any alluvial basins in the semi-arid environments of Fossa Bradanica, Basilicata, southern Italy. Valley fills in this region consist of predominantly Holocene alluvium; late Pleistocene deposits occur as terraces above the present flood plain or as eroded benches buried beneath younger alluvium. Historical fluvial deposition began before 7000 a cal. BPand ended at around 120 a cal. BP. In this study, {{we focus on the}} channel entrenchment (<b>badland</b> gullies incision) in the last 4500 years, based on a detailed study of chronostratigraphic alluvial sequences of Basento River. Four main phases of incision have been recorded at around 4500 - 4350, 1500, 900 - 800, and 120 a cal. BP. The formation of lateHolocene <b>badland</b> gullies can be related to changes in climate, vegetation and groundwater conditions. Environmental history mainly derived from the high-resolution pollen record of Lago Grande di Monticchio. <b>Badland</b> gullies formation appears to be linked to repeated dry-wet cycles. During dry periods, water tables significantly dropped and vegetation cover decreased with increase in runoff and water discharge from rainfall, leading to deepening and widening of stream channels...|$|R
