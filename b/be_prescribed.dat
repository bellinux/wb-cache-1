The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930.

5|$|Medications may <b>be</b> <b>prescribed</b> {{to treat}} sleep {{problems}} and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage.

5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} <b>be</b> <b>prescribed</b> to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It {{should be avoided}} in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E

5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may <b>be</b> <b>prescribed</b> when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to <b>be</b> <b>prescribed</b> to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should <b>be</b> <b>prescribed</b> to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|The Infantry {{has made}} two {{complete}} cycles between white and light blue. During the Revolutionary War, white facings <b>were</b> <b>prescribed</b> for the Infantry. White {{was the color}} used for Infantry until 1851 at which time light or Saxony blue <b>was</b> <b>prescribed</b> for the pompon and for the trimming on Infantry horse furniture. In 1857, the color <b>was</b> <b>prescribed</b> as light or sky blue. In 1886, the linings of capes and trouser stripes <b>were</b> <b>prescribed</b> to <b>be</b> white. However, in 1902, the light blue <b>was</b> <b>prescribed</b> again. In 1917, the cape was still lined with light blue but the Infantry trouser stripes were of white as were the chevrons for enlisted men. The infantry color is light blue; however, infantry regimental flags and guidons have been National Flag blue since 1835. White {{is used as a}} secondary color on the guidons for letters, numbers, and insignia.|$|R

Because severe cystic acne has the potential to cause permanent scarring over a short period, restrictions on its more immediate availability have proved contentious.

40|$|Background: Millions of {{patients}} <b>are</b> <b>prescribed</b> drugs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{in developing countries}} each year, yet the treatment effect of these prescriptions is largely unknown. Objectives: To determine if the prescribing of erythromycin and ceftriaxone to pregnant women with STI symptoms leads {{to a reduction in}} the prevalence among these women of chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively. Methods: We compared the prevalence of chlamydia among 116 pregnant women who had <b>been</b> <b>prescribed</b> erythromycin for a history of STI symptoms in their current pregnancy with the prevalence in a control group of 557 pregnant women who had not <b>been</b> <b>prescribed</b> this drug. Similarly we compared the prevalence of gonorrhoea among 110 pregnant women who had and 561 women who had not <b>been</b> <b>prescribed</b> ceftriaxone. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of chlamydia among the women who had and the women who had not <b>been</b> <b>prescribed</b> erythromycin four times daily for 10 days (7 % v 8 %). Contrarily, none of the women who had <b>been</b> <b>prescribed</b> a single dose of ceftriaxone had gonorrhoea, whereas 4 % of the women who had not had this drug prescribed did have gonorrhoea.
