500|$|Matt Brassil of Heave Media ranked [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as the seventh-best {{television}} {{episode of}} 2013, {{stating that the}} episode's handling of Louise's crush [...] "cracks through that little girl surface into the inevitable woman [...] will become, and the writing starts to show how even the most maniacal girl with a bunny hat can be humanized." [...] Phillip Maciak, writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, named Kristen Schaal's voice acting as Louise on Bob's Burgers as his favorite television performance {{of the year and}} cited her performance in the episode: [...] "Schaal's handling of the anger and betrayal Louise feels as she finds herself attracting to a boy for the first time is actually quite moving. <b>But,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> it opens up a new register of this top-register performance as Louise’s murderous rage turns to murderous romance." ...|$|E
500|$|As war clouds cast {{an ominous}} shadow over Europe {{in the late}} 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders {{considered}} how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: [...] "...the program of persecution has stirred up our hearts and minds as nothing else that has happened before has done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy." [...] During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership {{in support of the}} nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war material, distribution of war bond and air raid posters, assisting Civil Defense officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable [...] "victory gardens".|$|E

500|$|Heydrich {{spoke for}} nearly an hour. Then {{followed}} about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation. Otto Hofmann (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA)) [...] and Wilhelm Stuckart (State Secretary of the Reich Interior Ministry) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative. Erich Neumann from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital {{to the war effort}} and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed. Josef Bühler, State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible. Towards the end of the meeting cognac was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained. [...] "The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together", Eichmann said, [...] "and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all... they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination". Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead he had found [...] "an atmosphere not only of agreement {{on the part of the}} participants, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected".|$|E

2500|$|Edwards {{resigned}} from coaching in 1969, {{when he was}} 63 years old, although he continued to work at Wittenberg as the school's athletic director. Dave Maurer, his long-time assistant, took over as the school's coach. By {{the end of his}} career, Edwards's 168–45–8 overall college record gave him the second-best winning percentage in the country among active coaches with at least 100 wins. Edwards was given a commendation by President Richard Nixon for his achievements as a coach and won a Football Writers Association of America award for contributions to the game. [...] "His retirement is Wittenberg's loss, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> it is college football's loss," [...] University of Alabama coach Bear Bryant said at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Noting that Lumet's [...] "compelling {{stories and}} unforgettable {{performances}} were his strong suit," [...] director and producer Steven Spielberg believes that Lumet was [...] "one {{of the greatest}} directors in {{the long history of}} film." [...] Al Pacino, upon hearing of Lumet's death, stated that with his films, [...] "he leaves a great legacy, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> to the people close to him, he will remain the most civilized of humans and the kindest man I have ever known." [...] Boston Herald writer James Verniere observes that [...] "at a time when the American film industry is intent on seeing how low it can go, Sidney Lumet remains a master of the morally complex American drama." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vin Scully's call of {{the final}} play in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series on NBC {{television}} would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: [...] "So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. [...] little roller up along first... behind the bag! It gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it!" [...] Scully then remained silent {{for more than three}} minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with [...] "If one picture is worth a thousand words, you have seen about a million words, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> you have seen an absolutely bizarre finish to Game6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well; and they will play the Red Sox in Game7 tomorrow!" ...|$|E
