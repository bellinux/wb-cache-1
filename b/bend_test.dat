30|$|We {{conducted}} asymmetric four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> of {{wood and}} obtained the shear moduli {{on the basis of}} Timoshenko's theory of bending. Akamatsu (Japanese red pine,Pinus densiflora D. Don) and shioji (Japanese ash,Fraxinus spaethiana Lingelsh.) were used for the <b>tests.</b> Asymmetric four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were undertaken by varying the depth/span ratios; and Young's modulus and the shear modulus were calculated by Timoshenko's bending theory. Independent of the asymmetric <b>bending</b> <b>tests,</b> we also conducted three-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests,</b> free-freeflexural vibration tests, and numerical calculations by the finite element method. Young's and shear moduli obtained by these methods were compared with those derived from the asymmetric <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on these comparisons, we concluded that the shear modulus can be properly obtained by the asymmetric four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> when the span is 20 times larger than the depth.|$|R
30|$|We {{measured}} Young's modulus, {{proportional limit}} stress, and bending strength by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> {{and examined the}} applicability of the testing method by comparing it with conventional <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> methods. Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens. A compressive load was axially applied to the specimen supported with pin ends. Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R

The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement.
