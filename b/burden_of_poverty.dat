60|$|The {{difficulty}} of inducing {{people to talk}} sensibly about the family {{is the same as}} that which I pointed out in a previous volume as confusing discussions of marriage. Marriage is not a single invariable institution: it changes from civilization to civilization, from religion to religion, from civil code to civil code, from frontier to frontier. The family is still more variable, because the number of persons constituting a family, unlike the number of persons constituting a marriage, varies from one to twenty: indeed, when a widower with a family marries a widow with a family, and the two produce a third family, even that very high number may be surpassed. And the conditions may vary between opposite extremes: for example, in a London or Paris slum every child adds to the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> and helps to starve the parents and all the other children, whereas in a settlement of pioneer colonists every child, from the moment it is big enough to lend a hand to the family industry, is an investment in which the only danger is that of temporary over-capitalization. Then there are the variations in family sentiment. Sometimes the family organization is as frankly political as the organization of an army or an industry: fathers being no more expected to be sentimental about their children than colonels about soldiers, or factory owners about their employees, though the mother may be allowed a little tenderness if her character is weak. The Roman father was a despot: the Chinese father is an object of worship: the sentimental modern western father is often a play-fellow looked to for toys and pocket-money. The farmer sees his children constantly: the squire sees them only during the holidays, and not then oftener than he can help: the tram conductor, when employed by a joint stock company, sometimes never sees them at all.|$|E

40|$|To {{achieve their}} poverty {{reduction}} goals, PRSPs must mainstream gender. Although {{women and men}} share many <b>of</b> the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> they frequently experience poverty differently, have different poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions.

There is, however, limited evidence of mental health implications <b>of</b> working <b>poverty,</b> despite its representing a rapidly expanding segment of impoverished populations in many developed nations. In this study, we examined whether working poverty in Switzerland, a country with substantial recent growth among the working poor, was correlated with two dependent variables of interest: psychological health and unmet mental health need. Methods This cross-sectional study used data drawn from the first 3 waves (1999 – 2001) of the Swiss Household Panel, a nationally representative sample of the permanent resident population of Switzerland. The study sample comprised 5453 subjects aged 20 – 59 years. We used Generalized Estimating Equation models to investigate the {{association between}} working poverty and psychological well-being; we applied logistic regression models to analyze the link between working poverty and unmet mental health need.

40|$|The paper lists {{estimates}} of chronic poverty incidences in 25 countries. Research reveals its ‘patterns ’ and socioeconomic ‘correlates’, but hardly ‘explanations’. The patterns are three (economic insecurity, short-range mobility and path dependency) and the correlates are four (spatial, demographics and household type, human capital and labor, and physical assets). Important similarities are observed between developing and affluent countries in such patterns and correlates. In countries of vastly differing wealth, apparently people face some similar problems in fully participating and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> is unequally shared over time, i. e. chronic poverty. Recognizing this, the paper draws on research in affluent countries centered more closely on life experiences.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe overall aim of {{this paper}} is to outline the major methodological and {{conceptual}} challenges to understanding poverty from a gender perspective. The paper is divided into three main sections. Section one reviews the ways in which the frontiers <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> analysis have been pushed forward and progressively 'engendered' during three decades of dedicated feminist research and activism in Latin America and other parts of the South. This includes discussion of past deficiencies and cumulative improvements in data on Women's <b>poverty,</b> <b>of</b> the ways in which burgeoning research on gender has contributed to evolving conceptual approaches to <b>poverty,</b> and <b>of</b> key factors signalled as leading to gender-differentiated <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> In section two, the discussion turns to outstanding barriers to understanding poverty from a gender perspective. The principal challenges identified include varying forms of gender exclusion in mainstream analytical and methodological approaches, continued inadequacies in data on gender and poverty, and the ways in which advocacy for directing resources to women has given rise to certain stereotypes which narrow the optic through which poverty is conceptualised and addressed. The third and final section offers thoughts on future directions in research and policy. How might gender and poverty investigation move forward in the 21 st century so as to sharpen our instruments for measurement, and to better inform and influence policy interventions? In turn, to which areas might policy be most usefully directed? While Latin America is the main focus of analysis throughout the paper, given the global reach of discourses on gender and poverty, insights are also drawn from academic and policy discussions outside the region...|$|R
