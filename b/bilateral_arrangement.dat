40|$|Although it is {{generally}} acknowledged that international mobile roaming charges are too high, a successful formula for achieving reduction has so far proven elusive. Direct regulatory intervention to lower prices may be required. The success of such an approach depends upon the ability of countries to implement mutual reductions in the inter-operator tariffs (IOTs) that mobile operators charge each other for originating and terminating roaming calls. In {{the absence of a}} multilateral response, some countries have entered into <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> to reduce IOTs. Questions have been raised about the compatibility of such <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> with countries' obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (the GATS), which generally forbids member countries from maintaining preferential arrangements with other countries that affect international trade in services. I identify and discuss two issues that arise about the application of the GATS to these bilateral arrangements: (1) How do the provisions of the GATS requiring parties to treat each others' service suppliers 'no less favourably' than they treat service suppliers of other countries and to offer non-discriminatory terms for network access apply to such <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements?</b> (2) Given that the GATS applies only to official measures affecting international trade in services, how does the GATS apply to <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> between mobile operators which are ostensibly private in character but which are concluded at the instigation of officials? As I note in the conclusion, these issues have yet to be resolved...|$|R

The value of the Czech and Slovak Clearing Agreement (CSCA) depended on its ability to relieve pressure on convertible currency reserves and preserve inter-republic trade. The assessment is made by measuring the trend in the Czech and Slovak cases and comparing these results to instances without a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The CSCA experience reveals that a more widespread use of bilateral clearing arrangements by other transition economies might have provided little in terms of stability to convertible currency reserves. However, the evidence indicates a more positive effect on inter-republic trade than that attained under a number of non-bilateral scenarios. ...|$|E
40|$|Tripartite {{contracts}} between workers, a firm, and {{an insurance}} broker Pareto dominate the usual bilateral arrangements if coalitions are not feasible. They {{do this by}} allowing the broker to run surpluses over a reservation expected utility in some states and deficits in others. We show that these contracts are manipulable by coalitions. This motivates our main contribution [...] the definition and characterization of coalition incentive compatible tripartite contracts. We then ask whether broker intermediation can still be useful. The answer is that not every coalition incentive compatibility requirement annuls the critical budget-breaking property. Specifically, if firm-broker coalitions are feasible, there is no three-party contract that is coalition incentive compatible and Pareto superior to bilateral firm-worker contracts, except in the extreme case where the workers' demand for leisure is income inelastic But if only a firm-worker coalition can form, {{the addition of a}} broker to a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> does reduce the welfare losses caused by the existence of asymmetric information. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of globalization, the rate of migration of people from one nations to another nations is getting higher. This might result in causing the problems for those migratingpeople in the destination countries. Most of these problems related to the violation of the destination 2 ̆ 7 s state immigration rules, for example, illegal entry, forged passport, and so forth.

Therefore, all states would put high priority to this duty. In dealing with this matter, most states refer to the existing International convention, such as the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as well as the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. However, some states need more than these International conventions to solve the problem. Some states would have a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> to provide protection to their own citizens. These arrangements could touch upon very specific matters to ease the potential problems. This article would describe the protection programs in Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore comprehensive, {{strategic}} investment structure by examining the factor interactions revolving around the current issues which confront New Zealand forestry internationalisation in the global economic perspectives. This thesis presents the prototype of a conceptual model of international forestry as a modified joint venture trust system by examining the existing institutional and legal structure. Considering the global, conceptual nature of this thesis, macro-theoretical and institutional approach were adopted instead of statistical, micro analysis. In order to derive a micro, realistic solution from the macro, global issues, the flow of basic logic and scope of this research has been advanced progressively such as Worldwide (global) [...] - Asia Pacific Rim (multilateral) Bilateral (eg., New Zealand versus Korea) [...] - <b>Bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> (eg., modified joint venture Trust system). Also, basic components and scenarios which are useful to seek out alternatives were proposed to solve the current problems which face New Zealand forestry. The conceptual model which is proposed in this thesis could be tested and applied not only in bilateral but also in multilateral trade and investment relationships by modifying it to adjust to specific circumstances. In this way, the credibility gap between the conceptual model and real world is greatly diminished. Ultimately, the conceptual model could contribute as a useful mechanism to analyse international factor mobility between resource-demanding and supplying countries...|$|E
30|$|The {{applicants}} in M 70 {{were both}} citizens of Afghanistan who arrived at Christmas Island on 4 August 2011 {{in a boat}} that had sailed to Australia from Indonesia. The applicants both claimed that ‘they had a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan’ (M 70, 2011, para. 3). The fear of persecution is a required trait for someone seeking recognition as a refugee according to the Refugee Convention. Since there is no absolute right to asylum but only a right to seek it, the principle of non-refoulement is considered an absolutely critical aspect of the Refugee Convention since it seeks to prevent the return of refugees to places of danger (O’Sullivan, 2014). This protection is not, strictly speaking, undermined if refugees are sent to third countries designated as ‘safe’. On 7 May 2011, a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> was entered into between the Prime Ministers of Australia and Malaysia meaning that asylum seekers arriving by sea would be transferred to Malaysia for assessment. In exchange, Australia would expand its humanitarian program in resettling refugees who were residing in Malaysia (M 70, 2011, para. 8). This Solution aimed to dismantle the ‘people smugglers’ business model’ as per former Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s statement in May 2011 (Maiden, 2011, para. 20). The logic of this new and ‘good deal’ furthered the concept of ‘good refugee’ (McAdam, 2013, p. 437) who waits in the camp as distinct from her opposite: the ‘criminal’ and ‘undeserving’ ‘queue jumper’. Four years earlier in 2007 Italy and Libya signed a bilateral cooperation agreement ‘to combat clandestine immigration’ which according to Article 2 of the Agreement required both countries to undertake ‘surveillance, search and rescue operations’ in ‘the departure and transit areas of vessels used to transport clandestine immigrants’ (Hirsi, 2012, para. 19).|$|E

40|$|At {{the heart}} of any {{investment}} fund (whether public or private) is an investor protection concern that arises from the collectivized nature of the fund. In a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement,</b> a client may negotiate ‘bespoke’ terms with a prospective investment manager. By contrast, an investment fund provides ‘off the shelf’ terms to prospective participants, many of whom may have relatively small percentage positions in the ultimate fund, although the sums of money they provide may often be very significant to them. The governance challenge at {{the heart of}} all collectivized investment structures is most clearly seen in connection with private investment funds. Largely, the structure of such funds has been driven by the need to comply and obtain necessary exemptions under the financial regulatory rules, while simultaneously addressing a series of interrelated tax issues arising from various pieces of antiavoidance legislation adopted over the years. Three private monitoring solutions are identified which would enable fund investors to address more directly the problems arising from the governance challenge by facilitating a better flow of information from the fund manager to the investors: (1) side letters, which provide a particular investor with further information and/or control rights with regard to the operation of the fund; (2) improving the operation {{of the board of directors}} in either corporate-based funds or the general partner vehicle of limited partnership structures by the inclusion of independent directors; and (3) listings of private investment funds on securities exchanges as a means of adopting ongoing compliance oversight. Each approach recognizes the commercial contexts in which private investment funds operate by emphasizing voluntary steps that fund managers and investors can take incrementally. Further, each focuses on the provision of information as the means to overcome the investment protection concerns that arise due to the collectivized nature of the private investment fund...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{many nations}} have shifted their trade policy {{focus away from}} {{multilateral}} efforts to reduce trade barriers, and have instead moved towards regional preferential trading arrangements. New Zealand is one such nation. As well as pursuing trade liberalisation on a global basis via the World Trade Organisation and its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, New Zealand entered a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Australia - the Closer Economic Relations (CER) trade agreement - and has recently looked to expand this agreement. Singapore, Chile and the United States have all been suggested as potential members of an expanded CER. This study provides a quantitative economic analysis of {{the expansion of the}} CER, focusing on the implications for New Zealand. The GTAP computable general equilibrium model, using the GTAP version 4 database, is employed. After aggregating the database to seventeen sectors and fourteen regions, policy shocks representing the removal of tariffs between the potential members of the expanded CER preferential trading agreement are carried out. Four possible scenarios of potential members of the preferential trading arrangement are examined. Two liberalisation strategies are considered. First, tariffs are completely removed on all sectors except for six agricultural sectors. Second, tariffs are removed in all sectors, and export subsidies in the agricultural sectors are also eliminated. The results show that an expanded CER agreement would increase global welfare by up to US$ 432 million. These welfare gains accrue mainly to the United States and Singapore. New Zealand, Australia, and Chile all suffer non-trivial welfare losses. New Zealand's loss is attributable largely to a deterioration in its terms of trade, caused by falling export prices, particularly in the agricultural sectors. New Zealand also suffers decreased economic growth and a worsening trade balance. This clearly indicates that New Zealand should be careful when considering its future trade policy direction, and that it may need to re-evaluate its attitude towards regional trade agreements...|$|E
40|$|The authors propose {{solutions}} for constructing mechanical structures for electronic equipment {{in terms of}} plug-in units and subracks, allowing to increase the layout characteristics of electronic modules, sections and desktop devices and increase their functional capacity without changing the architecture of standard mechanical structures. The paper shows effectiveness of the developed solutions. There {{is a problem of}} restraining of mass redundancy of mechanical structures for electronic equipment in relation to the weight of the electronic components. On the other hand, the weight is an indicator of structural strength, providing of which is not less important problem. These problems can be solved in different ways, the main of which are the following: a) development of new mechanical structures for electronic equipment taking into account the development of the electronic components; b) improving layout characteristics of mechanical structures for electronic equipment without significant changes in their architecture. The aim {{of the study was to}} research mechanical structures of the first level (plug-in units and modules of the second level) of subracks to improve layout characteristics, and to develop methods for the use of connections for surface mounting and for the use of printed circuit boards of smaller dimensions without changing the architecture of the mechanical structures in order to improve layout characteristics. The research allowed the authors to develop the following solutions: 1. The design of plug-in units in which instead of one printed circuit board (PCB) may be two, three or more PCBs of smaller dimensions to compensate a decrease in PCB fill factor in time and to increase the functional capacity of electronic modules. 2. Construction of block designs with a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> of plug-in units and the organization of the electrical connections by way of backplanes with electrical connectors for surface mounting, which allows performing independent installation of plug-in units on both sides of the backplane and creates conditions for increasing the number of plug-in units.
