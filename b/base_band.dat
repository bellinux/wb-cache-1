2500|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a beat frequency oscillator (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning.(mixing down to <b>base</b> <b>band).</b> For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1951, Howard {{organized}} the 543rd Air Force Band {{made up of}} 19 female airmen from the Women in the Air Force (WAF) program. He expanded this group to some 50 members and in June 1955, in Air Force Regulation 190-21, they were officially designated [...] "United States WAF Band", acknowledging their de facto status as USAF representatives rather than their original status as a simple <b>base</b> <b>band.</b> Their official mission became to [...] "assist, within their capabilities, in promoting Air Force objectives and enhancing {{the prestige of the}} Air Force and the United States." [...] This meant there were now two bands serving as ambassadors of the USAF: the all-male Air Force Band and the all-female WAF Band. The WAF Band was dissolved in 1961 following its commander's contravention of a directive from Howard restricting performances at civilian schools and county fairs.|$|E
2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a <b>base</b> <b>band</b> complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E
