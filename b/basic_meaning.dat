There is no uniform agreement concerning exactly which historical persons fit the description, or the territorial range over which the role was in effect, or the calendar dates of the period.

25|$|Une marée has the <b>basic</b> <b>meaning</b> of 'a sea tide'. Fish is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} commodity. Before the days of conservation by salting, canning or freezing, it was brought ashore as near to its market as possible. Therefore, each coastal place had its harbour or its beach on which fish were landed, originally for that community. Berths in small ports and the upper parts of beaches were accessible from the sea only towards high tide. Where estuaries allowed entry farther inland, harbours were established some way into them. Consequently, the fishermen landed their catches towards high tide; in other words the landings were half-daily events, though particularly on the morning tide. They occurred in time with la marée so the landing of fish itself {{came to be known}} also as la marée; not only the process of landing but the batch of fish too. La marée therefore, now means any of 'the tide', 'the landing of fish' or 'sea fish marketed as a fresh product'. The last is nowadays, usually taken as including shellfish.|$|E

5000|$|This verb has two <b>basic</b> <b>meanings.</b> In a less marked context it is {{a simple}} copula (I'm tired; That's a shame!), a {{function}} which in non-Indo-European languages can be expressed quite differently. In a more heavily marked context it expresses existence (I think therefore I am); the dividing line between these is not always easy to draw. Some languages have shared these functions between several verbs: Irish, Spanish and Persian all have multiple equivalents of to be, making a variety of distinctions. Many Indo-European languages also use the conjugations of the verb [...] "to be" [...] as an auxiliary for the formation of compound (periphrastic) tenses (I'm working; I was bitten). Other functions vary from language to language. For example, although in its <b>basic</b> <b>meanings,</b> to be is a stative verb, English puts it to work as a dynamic verb in fixed collocations (You are being very annoying).|$|R

5000|$|In Western civilisation, the <b>basic</b> <b>meanings</b> of κακός and ἀγαθός are [...] "bad, cowardly" [...] and [...] "good, brave, capable", {{and their}} {{absolute}} sense emerges only around 400 BC, with Pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus. Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of Plato, {{together with the}} emergence of monotheistic thought (notably in Euthyphro, which ponders the concept of piety (τὸ ὅσιον) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in Late Antiquity by Neoplatonists, Gnostics, and Church Fathers.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{others have}} {{suggested}} that the name of the island originates from the Proto-Indo-European root *bhel meaning [...] "white, fair". This root and its <b>basic</b> <b>meaning</b> were retained in both Lithuanian (as baltas) and Latvian (as balts). On this basis, a related hypothesis holds that the name originated from this Indo-European root via a Baltic language such as Lithuanian. Another explanation is that, while derived from the aforementioned root, the name of the sea is related to names for various forms of water and related substances in several European languages, that might have been originally associated with colors found in swamps (compare Proto-Slavic [...] "swamp"). Yet another explanation is that the name originally meant [...] "enclosed sea, bay" [...] as opposed to open sea. Some Swedish historians believe the name derives from the god Baldr of Nordic mythology.|$|E
2500|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{virtually}} unpredictable whether the change in meaning (as compared to the mere sum of its elements) is attributed to one element or the whole compound.

On the other hand, gyorsétterem ’fast food restaurant’ (lit. ’fast restaurant’) is written as one word – probably because the change of meaning was attributed to the whole compound, leaving the lexical meaning of the word gyors intact.

40|$|The {{linguistic}} sub-fields of semantics and pragmatics {{are both}} {{concerned with the}} study of meaning. We might say that semantics studies what Grice (1967) (Chapter 5) called the timeless meaning of a linguistic expression φ—the <b>basic</b> <b>meanings</b> of the words in φ composed {{as a function of}} the syntactic structure of φ. Formal semantics, especially since the seminal work of Montague (1973), attempts to develop an empirically adequate theory of semantics for a given language by developing rules which are clear and unambiguous in their application and effect, hence making clear predictions about the possible meanings for a given expression. We assume that words do have <b>basic</b> <b>meanings,</b> and that a given syntactic structure corresponds to a determinate way of composing the meanings of its sub-parts. 1 Pragmatics, on the other hand, studies utterances of expressions like φ, attempting to explain what someone meant by saying φ on a particular occasion. It is clear that there is quite often a difference between the timeless meaning of φ and what someone meant by uttering φ on a given occasion. It is a truism among native speakers that this difference arises because of the way that the context of utterance influences interpretation. We complain if someone cites what we sa...|$|R
