5|$|The {{avifauna}} of the West Indies {{is predominantly}} of tropical North American (southern North America and Central America) origin with aggressive South American species having colonized the area only recently. The South American families {{occurring in the}} Greater Antilles are the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), bananaquit (Coerebidae) and tanagers (Thraupidae), {{all of which are}} represented in Puerto Rico. The prevailing theory suggests that <b>bird</b> <b>fauna</b> colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. The most primitive West Indies birds are the todies which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican tody.|$|E
5|$|The park's fauna {{includes}} notably several endemic {{bird species}}, such as Barau's petrel, the Réunion harrier, and the Réunion cuckooshrike. In total, 18 bird species are found at Réunion, {{half of which}} are endemic. At least 22 bird species have already gone extinct since human colonisation. A major threat to the <b>bird</b> <b>fauna</b> are introduced cats and rats. Of mammals, the Mauritian flying fox recolonised the Réunion after going extinct from the island. Notable butterfly species include Papilio phorbanta and Salamis augustina, and an endemic reptile is the Reunion Island day gecko.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bird</b> <b>fauna</b> of the Faroe Islands is {{dominated}} by seabirds and birds attracted to open land like heather, probably {{because of the lack}} of woodland and other suitable habitats.

40|$|Abstract. A {{study of}} the two Eneolithic and Iron Age sites {{containing}} the richest Holocene <b>bird</b> <b>faunas</b> of Romania is presented. Borduºani-Popinã yielded 36 taxa and at least 67 in-dividuals from 187 bird bones, while Hârºova furnished 32 taxa and at least 64 individuals from 225 pieces. Although the subfossil deposits share many of the species, the composi-tion of the species lists differs in the two localities. This is probably explained by both the different geographical position of the two sites, and the varying hunting customs and fa-cilities of the human inhabitants...|$|R

60|$|Birds.--The late Marquis of Tweeddale made {{a special}} study of Philippine birds, and in 1873 {{published}} a catalogue in the Transactions of the Zoological Society (Vol. IX. Pt. 2, pp. 125-247). But since that date large collections {{have been made}} by Everett, Steere, and other travellers, the result of which has been to more than double the known species, and to render the ornithological fauna an exceedingly rich one. Many of the Malayan genera which were thought to be absent when the first edition of this work was published have since been discovered, among which are Phyllornis, Criniger, Diceum, Prionochilus, and Batrachostomus. But there still remain a large number of highly characteristic Malayan genera whose absence gives a distinctive feature to the Philippine <b>bird</b> <b>fauna.</b> Among these are Tiga and Meiglyptes, genera of woodpeckers; Phænicophaes and Centropus, remarkable cuckoos; the long-tailed paroquets, Palæornis; all the genera of Barbets except Xantholæma; the small but beautiful family Eurylæmidæ; many genera allied to Timalia and Ixos; the mynahs, Gracula; the long-tailed flycatchers, Tchitrea; the fire-backed pheasants, Euplocamus; the argus pheasants, the jungle-fowl, and many others.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, the affinities {{of these}} birds are, {{as might be}} expected, chiefly with Australia and the Pacific Islands; but they exhibit in the buzzard, one of the owls, and perhaps {{in some of the}} Drepanididæ, slight {{indications}} of very rare or very remote communication with America. The amount of speciality is, however, wonderful, far exceeding that of any other islands; the only approach to it being made by New Zealand and Madagascar, which have a much more varied <b>bird</b> <b>fauna</b> and a smaller proportionate number of peculiar genera. The Galapagos, among the true oceanic islands, while presenting many peculiarities have only four out of the ten genera of Passeres peculiar. These facts undoubtedly indicate an immense antiquity for this group of islands, or the vicinity of some very ancient land (now submerged), from which some portion of their peculiar fauna might be derived. For further details as to the affinities and geographical distribution of the genera and species, the reader must consult Mr. Scott Wilson's work The Birds of the Sandwich Islands, already alluded to.|$|E

50|$|The {{formation}} of the Asian fauna began in the Mesozoic with the splitting of Laurasian supercontinent. Asia blends elements from the both ancient supercontinents of Laurasia and Gondwana. Gondwanian elements were introduced from Africa and by India, which detached from Gondwana approximately 90 MYA, carrying its Gondwana-derived flora and fauna northward. Glaciation during the most recent ice age and the immigration of man affected the distribution of Asian fauna (see also Sahara pump theory).Eurasia and North America were many times connected by the Bering land bridge, and have very similar mammal and <b>bird</b> <b>faunas,</b> with many Eurasian species having moved into North America, and fewer North American species having moved into Eurasia (many zoologists consider the Palearctic and Nearctic to be a single Holarctic ecozone).

40|$|Understanding {{distributions}} of wildlife species {{is a key}} step towards identifying biodiversity hotspots and designing effective conservation strategies. In this paper, the spatial pattern of diversity of birds in Golestan Province, Iran was estimated.

Richness maps across all birds, and separately for rare and threatened species, were prepared as approximations to hotspots. Results showed close similarity between hotspots for all birds and those for rare birds; hotspots were concentrated in the southern and especially the southwestern parts of the province. Hotspots for threatened birds tended more to the central and especially the western parts of the province, which include coastal habitats. Based on three criteria, {{it is clear that the}} western part is the most important area of the province in terms of <b>bird</b> <b>Faunas.</b> Despite some shortcomings, hotspot analysis for birds could be applied to guide conservation efforts and provide useful tool towards efficient conservation action...|$|R

40|$|The <b>bird</b> <b>faunas</b> of two {{vegetation}} gradients {{ranging from}} open grassland to high forest were compared in southern France and Corsica. On the whole, species richness is lower (ca. 30 %) in Corsica {{than on the}} mainland. However, a low bird species richness does not characterize all Corsican habitats. Moreover, the bird communities of Corsican shrubby habitats are closer in their diversity and frequency distribution to mainland bird forest communities than to the bird communities of mainland shrubby habitats. The study of species composition and species distribution of the birds common to the two areas studied (i. e. 79 % of the species found in Corsica) demonstrates that the existing differences are attributable to a broader habitat use by forest birds which formerly colonized Corsica (i. e. an increased niche breadth). Not only have these species spread into all the available shrubby habitats, but their present local abundance is greater than on the mainland. Several, but not forcibly exclusive, hypotheses are put forward to explain the present Corsican situatio...|$|R
50|$|Plasmodium relictum reproduces in {{red blood}} cells. If the {{parasite}} load is sufficiently high, the bird begins losing {{red blood cells}}, causing anemia (USDI and USGS 2005). Because red blood cells are critical for moving oxygen about the body, loss of these cells can lead to progressive weakness and, eventually, death (USDI and USGS 2005). Malaria mainly affects passerines (perching birds). In Hawaiʻi, this includes most of the native Hawaiian honeycreepers and the Hawaiian crow. Susceptibility to the disease varies between species, for example, the iiwi is very susceptible to malaria while the ʻApapane less so (USDI and USGS 2005). Native Hawaiʻian birds are more susceptible than introduced birds to the disease and exhibit a higher mortality rate (Van Riper et al. 1982; Atkinson et al. 1995). This has serious implications for native <b>bird</b> <b>faunas</b> (SPREP) with P. relictum being blamed for the range restriction and extinctions {{of a number of}} bird species in Hawaiʻi, primarily forest birds of low-land forests habitats where the mosquito vector is most common (Warner 1968; Van Riper 1991; USDI and USGS 2005).|$|R
