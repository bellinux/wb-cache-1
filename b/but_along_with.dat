5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD <b>but,</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of American {{intervention in the}} Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq {{and a total of}} ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part of the purpose of these visits was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects. He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011. He also supports Obama's renewal of the War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, <b>but</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic, {{tetrapod}} vertebrates of {{the class}} Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit {{a wide variety of}} habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards <b>but,</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.|$|E
5|$|Hiddink {{resigned}} {{and was replaced}} by his assistant Frank Rijkaard, who rarely picked Hasselbaink at international level. He next played on 18 August 1999, alongside Kluivert and Ruud van Nistelrooy in a friendly against Denmark; he was taken off for Clarence Seedorf and the game ended 0–0. He next appeared six months later, playing ten minutes against Germany and 70 minutes against Scotland, and despite van Nistelrooy being injured Hasselbaink was not selected for UEFA Euro 2000 as the five forwards chosen were Bergkamp, Kluivert, van Hooijdonk, Roy Makaay and Peter van Vossen.

5|$|In 518, Scupi was {{destroyed}} by a violent earthquake, possibly the most devastating one Macedonia has ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by the Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled in forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. Scupi was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. Scupi was thus transferred on another site: the promontory on which stands the fortress. However, Scupi was sacked by Slavs {{at the end of}} the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 695. The Slavic tribe which settled in Scupi were probably the Berziti who had invaded the entire Vardar valley. The city is not mentioned during the three following centuries <b>but</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the rest of Upper Vardar it became part of the expanding First Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.|$|E

25|$|The {{conservation}} of archaic phonological {{features of the}} Arabic borrowings furthermore suggests that Arabic-incorporated Persian was absorbed into pre-Ottoman Turkic at an early stage, when the speakers were still located to the northeast of Persia, prior to the westward migration of the Islamic Turkic tribes. An additional argument {{for this is that}} Ottoman Turkish shares the Persian character of its Arabic borrowings with other Turkic languages that had even less interaction with Arabic, such as Tatar and Uyghur. From the early ages of the Ottoman Empire, borrowings from Arabic and Persian were so abundant that original Turkish words were hard to find. In Ottoman, one may find whole passages in Arabic and Persian incorporated into the text. It was however not only extensive loaning of words, <b>but</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> them much of the grammatical systems of Persian and Arabic.|$|E
