5|$|Other historians regard {{politics}} as a stronger factor within the conclave than pure simony, with the personal rivalvry between Giuliano della Rovere and Ascanio Sforza (who had met to discuss the upcoming conclave in Castel Gandolfo even before Innocent VII had died) substituting for the ancient struggle between Naples and Milan, with the intractability <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> making Borja a viable candidate.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{troops of}} the {{competing}} Archbishops of Cologne fought {{for control of the}} Electorate; within a few months, the local feud <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> expanded to include supporters from the Electorate of the Palatinate on the Protestant side, and the Duchy of Bavaria on the Catholic side.

5|$|On July 24, 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza {{the first}} city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian {{municipal}} elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won {{the majority of}} seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome was}} {{unacceptable}} for the rebellious barons, and war <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> broke out {{almost immediately after}} {{the announcement of the}} settlement. After a victory at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, Montfort took over control of government, but the success was short-lived. Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed.

Five Hoosier politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets held between 1868 and 1916, as the nation's political parties vied for the support of the state's electorate. In 1888, at the height of the state's post-war political influence, former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president, and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial {{movement}} had {{split into two}} parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller tribal groups. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its President, although the government vetoed it, insisting {{that he had been}} an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|E

Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E

There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Liverpool, Merseyside. The club {{was formed in}} 1892 following a disagreement between the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. The disagreement <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park from Anfield, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C. {{to play in the}} empty stadium. Liverpool won the First Division title {{for the first time in}} 1901; since then, the club has won a further seventeen league titles, along with seven FA Cups and eight Football League Cups. They have also been crowned champions of European football on five occasions by winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005.

The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to {{play an active role}} in the civil war, however, soured relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties,</b> and the Lebanese Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.|$|E

Wenger {{was a member of}} the football governing body's technical committee, responsible for analysing the 1994 World Cup, and made a presentation to coaches of emerging football nations. His speech was closely followed by Japanese delegates, whose country had invested millions into the restructuring of its football league system. Representatives of Toyota, the majority owner of Nagoya Grampus Eight soon met with Wenger and offered him the chance to become the club's manager. Wenger deliberated, even though the idea of working abroad appealed to him; negotiations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> lasted for two months. In that time, he sought the advice of his closest friends and family, and flew to Japan to watch Nagoya Grampus' striker Gary Lineker make his final appearance before his professional retirement. In December 1994, Wenger agreed to become manager of Nagoya Grampus, on a two-year contract worth ¥75m annually.|$|E

Ranariddh was particularly critical of the CNRP and in March 2014, he denied accusations by CNRP leader Sam Rainsy that the CRPP was formed {{with the aim of}} splitting the opposition voter base. Ranariddh also charged that the Rainsy would end Cambodia's status as a constitutional monarchy if they were elected to power. In May 2014, Ranariddh called on the CPP and CNRP to form a unity government and proposed that the CRPP was keen to act as a mediator <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Second Sino-Japanese War {{caused a}} pause in the {{conflict}} between the CPC and the KMT. The Second United Front was established between the CPC and the KMT to tackle the invasion. While the front formally existed until 1945, all collaboration <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> had ended by 1940. Despite their formal alliance, the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with the KMT. In 1939 the KMT began to restrict CPC expansion within China. This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces but which subsided rapidly on the realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option. Yet, by 1943, the CPC was again actively expanding its territory {{at the expense of the}} KMT.|$|E
