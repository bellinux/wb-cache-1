50|$|Digest access {{authentication}} {{is one of}} the agreed-upon methods a {{web server}} can use to negotiate credentials, such as username or password, with a user's web browser.

It applies a hash function to the username and password before sending them over the network. In contrast, <b>basic</b> access <b>authentication</b> uses the easily reversible Base64 encoding instead of encryption, making it non-secure unless used in conjunction with TLS.|$|R
