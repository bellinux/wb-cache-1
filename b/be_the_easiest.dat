25|$|Bonsai are {{sometimes}} marketed or promoted as house plants, {{but few of}} the traditional bonsai species can thrive or even survive inside a typical house. Most bonsai are located out of doors. The best guideline to identifying a suitable growing environment for a bonsai is its native hardiness. If the bonsai grower can closely replicate the full year's temperatures, relative humidity, and sunlight, the bonsai should do well. In practice, this means that trees from a hardiness zone closely matching the grower's location will generally <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to grow, and others will require more work or will not be viable at all.|$|E
25|$|Surratt and {{the others}} stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath clapped his hands. Four {{soldiers}} of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight {{at the end of}} the rope, swinging back and forth. Surratt's death appeared to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest.</b> Atzerodt's stomach heaved once and his legs quivered; then, he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{shows the}} oxidation of p-cresol in a sulfate-enriched environment. P-cresol {{was seen to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to degrade through the sulfate-enriched environment, while m-cresol and o-cresol where inhibited. In the chart above, p-cresol was oxidized under an anaerobic sulfate reducing condition and formed four different intermediates. After {{the formation of the}} intermediates, the study reported further degradation of the intermediates leading to the production of carbon dioxide and methane. The p-hydroxylbenzyl alcohol, p-hydroxylbenzaldehye, p-hyrdoxylbenzoate, and benzoate intermediates all are produced from this oxidation and released into the sediments. Similar results were also produced by different studies using other forms of oxidation such as: iron-reducing organisms, Copper/Manganese Oxide catalyst, and nitrate- reducing conditions.|$|E
25|$|Hognose snakes are {{frequently}} found in herpetoculture. Heterodon nasicus are often considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to care for, and captive-bred stock is easily found. Heterodon platirhinos is also commonly found, but their dietary requirements {{can be a}} challenge for some keepers, and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that feeding them a diet of exclusively rodents contributes to liver problems and a shortened life span. Leioheterodon species are imported regularly from Madagascar, and are not often bred in captivity and get much larger, so can pose a set of different challenges for care. Lystrophis species are fairly new to the commercial reptile trade, and are now commonly bred in captivity, but can be some of the more expensive hognose snakes available.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur's {{vision of}} what was {{required}} of an officer came not just from his recent experience of combat in France but also {{from that of the}} occupation of the Rhineland in Germany. The military government of the Rhineland had required the Army to deal with political, economic and social problems but he had found that many West Point graduates had little or no knowledge of fields outside of the military sciences. During the war, West Point had been reduced to an officer candidate school, with five classes graduated in two years. Cadet and staff morale was low and hazing [...] "at an all-time peak of viciousness". MacArthur's first change turned out to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest.</b> Congress had set the length of the course at three years. MacArthur was able to get the four-year course restored.|$|E

Of the storyline Breeds states: [...] "It's going to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> thing I've {{ever had to}} do. There's no acting involved at all. But he's got a girlfriend so Ruby has {{to find a way}} to justify going after someone who has a girlfriend. So that's kind of hard. But he's the hero. She believes he's the love of her life. I guess with that in mind you wouldn't let anything get in the way of that. Who knows, he might be." [...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E
500|$|The {{altitude}} of the troposphere most similar to Earth {{is near the}} tropopause—the boundary between troposphere and mesosphere. It is located slightly above 50km. According to measurements by the Magellan and Venus Express probes, the altitude from 52.5 to 54km has a temperature between 293K (20°C) and 310K (37°C), and the altitude at 49.5km above the surface is where the pressure becomes the same as Earth at sea level. As manned ships sent to Venus {{would be able to}} compensate for differences in temperature to a certain extent, anywhere from about 50 to 54km or so above the surface would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> altitude in which to base an exploration or colony, where the temperature would be in the crucial [...] "liquid water" [...] range of 273K (0°C) to 323K (50°C) and the air pressure the same as habitable regions of Earth.

He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what they do and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!"

500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew that would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|The {{extended}} shooting schedule owed much to {{the fact}} that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a blue screen. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of split screen photography. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air. The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the Grim Reaper, which went through many transformations before finding physical form. [...] "We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod puppet, maybe shooting it in a water tank," [...] Jackson commented. [...] "We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds." [...] Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using computer animation would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> task. Another entirely computerized character called [...] "the Gatekeeper", a winged cherub who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the final cut.|$|E
500|$|Masuda {{considers}} the starter Pokémon {{to be among}} the most important in the franchise; Yoshida goes further and calls them [...] "the face of that generation" [...] and says that [...] "they're the ones that should be on the packaging". The three starter Pokémon of each generation are Grass-, Water-, and Fire-types, a trio that Masuda considers to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to understand for new players. In an interview with GamesRadar in 2009, Masuda stated that simple Pokémon take around six months to design and develop, whereas Pokémon that play a more important part in the games (such as starter Pokémon) may take over a year. Masuda added, [...] "We also want the designer to have as much freedom as possible, we don't want to narrow down their imagination by saying 'We want this kind of Pokemon.' When we talk to the designer we always stress that they shouldn't think of Pokemon necessarily, but should instead just be as creative as they can." [...] After the Pokémon is designed it is sent to the [...] "Battle Producer", who decides which moves and stats the Pokémon should have.|$|E

500|$|Chandler and Phoebe had {{originally}} been written as more secondary characters who were just there to provide humor around the other four; Matthew Perry described Chandler in the pilot script as [...] "an observer of other people's lives". They had {{become part of the}} core group by the time casting concluded. Crane believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as [...] "a droll, dry guy", would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped. Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of Dream On, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in LAX 2194, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of Friends saw LAX 2194, it became clear to them {{that it would not be}} picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and got it in under a week. Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry's, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. He was doing a play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered.|$|E

Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday rated Thrive four and a half stars, ranking the album's songs as among the best he had heard from group and saying that it is [...] "sure {{to be one of the}} year's best [...] ". Laura Chambers of Christian Music Review rated the album 4.9 out of 5, describing it as [...] "one of the best albums I’ve heard in a long time". Although she noted the album covered some lyrical topics the band had discussed before, she felt this was not a bad thing, considering it [...] "less of a rehash and more of a reminder". Jeremy Armstrong of Worship Leader rated Thrive three and a half out of five stars, praising the band as having a [...] "broad appeal" [...] and describing the album as a [...] "fine release". At CM Addict, Brianne Bellomy rated the album four stars out of five, remarking that the release [...] "is another power packed album full of songs that speak to everyone".

500|$|Ventus' {{name means}} [...] "wind" [...] in Latin; both it and his Keyblade are called Wayward Wind, known in Japan as , {{and have a}} [...] "sky" [...] theme {{similar to that of}} Sora's. During {{development}} of Birth by Sleep, the Osaka team in charge of developing the game suggested that Ventus should be related with Vanitas, something which Nomura liked as he wanted to add more connections within the story, so Vanitas' name was made to sound similar to Ventus' name. Nomura had trouble designing the armor for Ventus, Terra and Aqua since the gameplay mechanism for activating their armor had not been fleshed out. Therefore, an [...] "X" [...] was added to their clothes as a way to activate the armors as well as due to the fact {{it was one of the}} game's keywords. Ever since development of Birth by Sleep started, the staff already decided that Ventus', Aqua's and Terra's stories would be told in separate scenarios, with Ventus' story being the second one written. They also wanted emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series, leading to the interaction between the three scenarios. In gameplay perspective, Ventus was designed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> character to play with in Birth by Sleep, although Nomura recommended to players that Ventus should be the second character to play with in order to understand the story better. Additionally, the way Ventus handles his Keyblade backwards is meant to show the gameplay differences between his and Terra's and Aqua's scenarios. Nomura also remarked Ventus' encounter with the characters Lea and Isa as an important event from the game, hoping both newcomers and older gamers will also find it important from Ventus' perspective.|$|E

500|$|... "Since Germans are the {{perennial}} disturbers of the world's peace ... {{they must be}} dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to put the whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them. [...] The army groups, as organized units, would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> and quickest to deal with. ... The population of Germany, excluding conquered and annexed territories, is about 70,000,000, almost equally divided between male and female. To achieve the purpose of German extinction it would be necessary to only sterilize some 48,000,000 -- a figure which excludes, because of their limited power to procreate, males over 60 years of age, and females over 45. ... Taking 20,000 surgeons as an arbitrary number and on the assumption that each will perform a minimum of 25 operations daily, it would take no more than one month, at the maximum, to complete their sterilization. ... The balance of the male civilian population of Germany could be treated within three months. Inasmuch as sterilization of women needs somewhat more time, it may be computed that the entire female population of Germany could be sterilized within a period of three years or less. Complete sterilization of both sexes, and not only one, is to be considered necessary in view of the present German doctrine that so much as one drop of true German blood constitutes a German. Of course, after complete sterilization, there will cease to be a birth rate in Germany. At the normal death rate of 2 per cent per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1,500,000 yearly. Accordingly in the span of two generations that which cost millions of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely, the elimination of Germanism and its carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation German Will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance." ...|$|E
