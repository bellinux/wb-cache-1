The system identifies the back plate of the brake shoe, and then works out how much <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> is left in millimetres.If the system detects no <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> beyond the back plate, the system typically identifies the pad as missing.|$|R
25|$|For {{increased}} safety, each {{vehicle is}} also fitted {{with an automatic}} brake that is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a specific speed, such as a carriage running away or a locomotive engine failure. This system slows the train down using the same <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> and drums as the hand brake. The running speed at which the automatic brake comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of design methods for tread braking systems is given with special {{focus on the}} braking capacity of the wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, are assessed, such as <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> materials, residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. The influence of heat partitioning between wheel, <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> and rail on wheel temperatures for different braking cycles is considered.

2500|$|Each car has {{two sets}} of bogies (trucks), each with four sets of support tires, guide tires and backup {{conventional}} steel wheels. The motor cars bogies each have two direct-current traction motors coupled to reduction gears and differentials. Montreal's Metro trains use electromagnetic brakes, generated by the train's kinetic energy until it has slowed down to about [...] The train then uses composite <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> made of yellow birch injected with peanut oil {{to bring it to}} a complete stop. Two sets are applied against the treads of the steel wheels for friction braking. Hard braking produces a characteristic burnt popcorn scent. Wooden brake shoes perform well, but if subjected to numerous high-speed applications they develop a carbon film that diminishes brake performance.|$|E
2500|$|A coal {{storage shed}} was {{attached}} to the locomotive shed, which was extended in 1882 using materials from the dismantled Kaitoke goods shed. [...] In 1889, the locomotive shed was extended, but by 1899 operational requirements meant that further storage space was required. [...] With insufficient room to extend the locomotive shed on its existing site, a new four-road depot was constructed – with a fitter’s workshop attached to the western side – {{at the north end of}} the yard. [...] The Locomotive Foreman’s office was built in 1914 on a bank above the engine shed. [...] A coaling stage was provided alongside one of the roads to the engine shed, from which coal was shovelled into the Fell locomotives. [...] A shelter and pit were installed on a nearby siding which was used for changing the <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> on the Fell brake vans.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the line}} opened, {{there were two}} Fell brake vans in service, each [...] long and [...] from floor to ceiling, with open {{platforms}} at either end. [...] The wear on the <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> fitted to these vans was so severe that a set of blocks seldom lasted more than one trip down the incline. [...] Like the positioning and loading of the locomotives, the arrangements for positioning of the Fell vans varied until they were largely standardised by 1897. [...] For ascending trains, Fell vans were placed {{at the rear of}} the train. [...] For descending trains, a Fell van was placed between the locomotives and the leading vehicle. [...] If the gross weight of the train exceeded 120 tons or included more than 15 vehicles (excluding the locomotives in both cases) a second Fell van was attached to the rear of the train. [...] These rules applied before the introduction of the Westinghouse continuous air brake. The Fell locomotives were never turned, running cab first on descending trains.|$|E
40|$|Conventional brakes {{require a}} {{powerful}} actuator, leading to large, heavy {{and in most}} cases energy consuming brakes. This paper introduces a fundamen-tally different brake concept called statically balanced brakes (SBBs). SBBs do not require any actuation force to maintain a braking torque and only have to move a small mass to vary that torque. Therefore, their energy consumption is potentially very low. In an SBB, one of the two friction surfaces is connected through springs to a <b>braking</b> <b>block.</b> This <b>braking</b> <b>block</b> is connected through a mechanism to a second set of springs, the other side of which connects to the ground. The total energy in the two sets of springs is constant, which results in a zero-force characteristic at the <b>braking</b> <b>block.</b> The position of this statically balanced <b>braking</b> <b>block</b> determines the displacement of the first set of springs and thus the normal force between the friction surfaces. We categorize mech-anisms {{that can be used in}} SBBs and show two embodiments: one with leaf springs with a range of positions with negative stiffness and one with torsion springs and a non-linear cam mechanism. Results show that the actuation force can be reduced by approximately 95 - 97 % in comparison to regular brakes. This shows that in SBBs, the actuation force can be almost eliminated and thus showing the potential of SBBs to be small, lightweight and energy efficient...|$|R

50|$|Around {{the same}} time, the Victorian Railways was experimenting with {{replacing}} cast-iron <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> with a non-metallic compound (probably asbestos), so Set 11 was fitted with these, and tested between Seaford and Frankston, in 5 mph increments up to line speed, in both directions.

If the saw detects a change in this current (as would occur if a hand or other body part came into contact with the blade), an automatic braking system is activated, forcing an aluminum <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> into the blade. This aluminum block is designed to absorb the energy of blade by deforming.|$|R
40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> and wheel tread during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the wheel tread. This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor {{to the development of a}} wavy tread surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the wheel tread and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest of the tread surface. The non-even wear results in roughness on the tread of the wheel after cooling. In the present paper, a theoretical and numerical model of the interaction between wheel rim and <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> has been developed. Simulations with this model demonstrate the principal phenomena occurring at the wheel/block contact. Furthermore, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented...|$|R

50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{sections}} of brakes located on any roller coaster wherever {{more than one}} train is intended to run. They act as virtual barriers between the trains running on the roller coaster, preventing collisions should one train stop along the course for any reason. Because of this, <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> must be capable of completely stopping the train (should a vehicle preceding the block stop) and starting a train (after it has been stopped). <b>Block</b> <b>brake</b> sections usually start the train again either by using a slight downward slope to let gravity take its course, or by using drive tires to push the train out of the <b>block.</b> Like trim <b>brakes,</b> <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> {{can also be used}} to control the speed of the train. These are usually known as mid-course brake runs. An example of a mid-course brake run is on Titan at Six Flags Over Texas, which consists of such a brake run (which slows the train down drastically, almost to the point of stopping) due to the severe G-forces in its downward 540-degree helix following the brake run. Mid-course brake runs give more time for another train to be loaded. Often times, mid-course brake runs give so much time that another train can be fitted onto the track without the worry of bumping.|$|R
