40|$|Stress {{produces}} significant {{alterations in}} sleep {{that appear to}} vary with the type, intensity and duration of the stressor. <b>Brief</b> <b>manual</b> restraint may be stressful in rodents, but is often required for experimental procedures. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>brief</b> <b>manual</b> restraint on sleep and its possible influence on sleep induced after footshock and after the opportunity to explore a neutral enclosure. Sleep was recorded during non-interrupted baseline and during 8 -h light and 12 -h dark periods after three sessions of 5 -min manual restraint (M 1 - 3), after 30 -min in neutral enclosure alone (NE) or with previous manual restraint (mNE), and after 20 footshocks presented over the course of 30 -min alone (FS) or with previous manual restraint (mFS). Compared to baseline, M 1 - 3 increased total sleep and NREM during both light and dark periods, and significantly increased dark period REM. Both NE and mNE increased dark-period total sleep, NREM and REM; however, mNE also increased light-period total sleep and NREM, but not REM. FS and mFS increased total sleep, NREM and REM during the dark period and total sleep and NREM during light period. FS also significantly decreased light-period REM whereas mFS did not. M 1, mNE and mFS significantly increased EEG delta power during NREM, but M 2 - 3, NE and FS alone did not. The results revealed that manual restraint can increase sleep and EEG delta power and that increases in sleep may persist across repeated sessions whereas the magnitude of EEG delta power may vary across sessions. In addition, prior manual restraint may significantly alter the changes in sleep and EEG induced by footshock and by the opportunity to explore a neutral enclosure. The results suggest that mild stressors may interact in their effects on sleep...|$|R

For example, it has been suggested that response suppression during punishment may be facilitated if reinforcement is concurrently available for an alternative response. However, results of basic research demonstrating this finding have not been replicated with interventions more commonly prescribed as treatments for problem behavior. We evaluated the effects of relatively benign punishment procedures (reprimands or <b>brief</b> <b>manual</b> restraint) on the self-injurious behavior of 4 individuals who had been diagnosed with mental retardation, when access to reinforcement for alternative behavior (manipulation of leisure materials) was and was not available.

40|$|Rice is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crop in the world. It feeds nearly half of the population worldwide. Diseases and insect pests are important natural factors that threat rice production in China. Therefore, it is necessary to develop agricultural production standards, which are coherent, scientifically reasonable and easy to perform, especially the standard for prevention and control of rice insect pests. In 2012, China issued the technical regulation for rice disease control. However, so far there is not any systematic technical regulation on control and management of rice insect pests in China.

30|$|The {{findings}} suggest that this initial algorithm is able to extract and classify individual journeys {{much more quickly than}} manual processing of the dataset, although a (relatively) <b>brief</b> <b>manual</b> check of the profiles chosen for use in further investigations is still required to correct or discard those where there is any doubt about the classification accuracy.

Given the size of the dataset however, manually checking and correcting the entire dataset appeared to be impractical. The algorithm is therefore not suitable if there is a requirement for a large number of journeys {{with a high level of}} confidence in the classification accuracy, especially if a representative group of journeys is needed rather than a sample that is biased towards those journeys that are more likely to be classified correctly and are easy to verify.|$|R

Electrical parallel fiber stimulation at threshold intensity was used to study the variability as well as the delayed activation of transmission at single parallel fiber synapses. In addition, the synaptic responses to <b>brief</b> <b>manual</b> skin stimulation, which mimicked the natural synaptic activation pattern and evoked intense spike bursts in these neurons, were analyzed to gain clues about the physiological role of these parallel fiber-specific properties.
