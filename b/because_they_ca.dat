The diary study is a method of understanding participant behavior and intent in situ that minimizes the effects of observers on par-ticipants. We first situate diary studies within a framework of field studies and review related literature. We then report on three diary studies we conducted that involve photographs, audio recordings, location information and tangible artifacts. We then analyze our findings, specifically addressing the fol-lowing questions: How do context information and episodic memory prompts captured by participants vary with media? In what way do different media “jog ” memory? How do dif-ferent media affect the diary study process? These questions are particularly important for diary studies <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} {{reported that the}} yeast chromatin-remodeling factor Swi 1 can exist as a prion, [SWI], demonstrating a link between prionogenesis and global transcriptional regulation. To shed light on how the Swi 1 conformational switch influences Swi 1 function and to define the sequence and structural requirements for [SWI] formation and propagation, we functionally dissected the Swi 1 molecule. We show here that the [SWI] prion features are solely attributable to the first 327 amino acid residues (N), a region that is asparagine rich. N was aggregated in [SWI] cells but diffuse in [swi] cells; chromosomal deletion of the N-coding region resulted in [SWI] loss, and recombinant N peptide was able to form infectious amyloid fibers in vitro, enabling [SWI] de novo formation through a simple transformation. Although the glutamine-rich middle region (Q) was not sufficient to aggregate in [SWI] cells or essential for SWI/SNF function, it significantly modified the Swi 1 aggregation pattern and Swi 1 function. We also show that excessive Swi 1 incurred Li/Na sensitivity and that the N/Q regions are important for this gain of sensitivity. Taken together, our results provide the final proof of “protein-only ” trans-mission of [SWI] and demonstrate that the widely distributed “dispensable ” glutamine/asparagine-rich regions/ motifs might have important and divergent biological functions.

40|$|Calcium influx via {{voltage-gated}} channels plays {{important roles}} in muscle excitation-contraction coupling, hormone and neurotransmit-ter stimulus-secretion coupling, regulation of gene transcription, and neuronal firing. To fulfill these diverse roles, mammals have evolved ten genes encoding voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav channels) (Figure 1). These channels also serve as important drug targets, with most therapeutically useful calcium-channel blockers targeting L-type channels, such as Cav 1. 2, found on cardiac or smooth muscle. These drugs (e. g., amlodipine) are useful {{in the treatment of}} high blood pressure <b>because</b> <b>they</b> block <b>Ca</b> 2 + influx via L-type channels into smooth muscle cells (SMC), which results in relaxation. SMCs also express T-type calcium currents (1).

40|$|International audienceBackground: Diverse transposable {{elements}} are abundant in genomes of cellular organisms {{from all three}} domains of life. Although transposons are often regarded as junk DNA, {{a growing body of}} evidence indicates that they are behind some of the major evolutionary innovations. With the growth in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes, previously unnoticed mobile elements continue to be discovered. Results: We describe a new superfamily of archaeal and bacterial mobile elements which we denote casposons <b>because</b> <b>they</b> encode <b>Cas</b> 1 endonuclease, a key enzyme of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems of archaea and bacteria. The casposons share several features with self-synthesizing eukaryotic DNA transposons of the Polinton/Maverick class, including terminal inverted repeats and genes for B family DNA polymerases. However, unlike any other known mobile elements, the casposons are predicted to rely on Cas 1 for integration and excision, via a mechanism similar to the integration of new spacers into CRISPR loci. We identify three distinct families of casposons that differ in their gene repertoires and evolutionary provenance of the DNA polymerases. Deep branching of the casposon-encoded endonuclease in the Cas 1 phylogeny suggests that casposons played a pivotal role in the emergence of CRISPR-Cas immunity. Conclusions: The casposons are a novel superfamily of mobile elements, the first family of putative self-synthesizing transposons discovered in prokaryotes. The likely contribution of capsosons to the evolution of CRISPR-Cas parallels the involvement of the RAG 1 transposase in vertebrate immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, suggesting that recruitment of endonucleases from mobile elements as ready-made tools for genome manipulation is a general route of evolution of adaptive immunity...|$|R
40|$|Wild {{birds are}} {{important}} to public health <b>because</b> <b>they</b> carry emerging zoonotic pathogens, either as a reservoir host or by dispersing infected arthropod vectors. In addition, bird migration provides a mechanism {{for the establishment of}} new endemic foci of disease at great distances from where an infection was acquired. Birds are central to the epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV) <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are the main amplifying host of the virus in nature. The initial spread of WNV in the U. S. along the eastern seaboard coincided with a major bird migration corridor. The subsequent rapid movement of the virus inland could have been facilitated by the elliptical migration routes used by many songbirds. A number of bird species can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme dis-ease, but most are not competent to transmit the infection to Ixodes ticks. The major role birds play in the geographic expansion of Lyme disease is as dispersers of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks.

40|$|Cav 1. 4 {{channels}} are unique among the high voltage-activated Ca 2 + channel family <b>because</b> <b>they</b> completely lack <b>Ca</b> 2 +-dependent inactivation and display very slow voltage-dependent inactivation. Both properties are of crucial importance in ribbon synapses of retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells, where sustained Ca 2 + influx through Cav 1. 4 channels {{is required to}} couple slow graded changes of the membrane potential with tonic glutamate release. Loss of Cav 1. 4 function causes severe impairment of retinal circuitry function and {{has been linked to}} night blindness in humans and mice. Recently, an inhibitory domain (ICDI: inhibitor of Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation) in the C-terminal tail of Cav 1. 4 has been discovered that eliminates Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation by binding to upstream regulatory motifs within the proximal C terminus. The mechanism underlying the action of ICDI is unclear. It was proposed that ICDI competitively displaces the Ca 2 + sensor calmodulin. Alternatively, the ICDI domain and calmodulin may bind to different portions of the C terminus and act independently of each other. In the present study, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments with genetically engineered cyan fluorescent protein variants to address this issue. Our data indicate that calmodulin is preassociated with the C terminus of Cav 1. 4 but may be tethered in a different steric orientation as compared with other Ca 2 + channels. We also find that calmodulin is important for Cav 1. 4 function because it increases current density and slows down voltage-dependent inactivation. Our data show that the ICDI domain selectively abolishes Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation, whereas it does not interfere with other calmodulin effects...|$|R

40|$|Our {{recent data}} show that in cardiac myocytes {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (PUFAs) are antiarrhythmic. They reduce INa, shorten the action potential, shift the threshold for excitation to more positive potentials, and prolong the relative refractory period. In this study we use patch-clamp techniques in whole-cell mode and confocal Ca 2 + imaging {{to examine the effects}} of PUFAs on the voltage-gated L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L), elementary sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-release events (Ca 2 +-sparks), and [Ca 2 +]i transients in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. Extracellular application of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C 20 : 5 n − 3) produced a prompt and reversible concentration-dependent suppression of ICa,L. The concentration of EPA to produce 50 % inhibition of ICa was 0. 8 μM in neonatal rat heart cells and 2. 1 μM in adult ventricular myocytes. While the EPA induced suppression of ICa,L, it did not significantly alter the shape of the current–voltage relation but did produce a small, but significant, negative shift of the steady-state inactivation curve. The inhibition of ICa,L was voltage- and time-dependent, but not use- or frequency-dependent. Other PUFAs, such as docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, linoleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid, and eicosatetraynoic acid had similar effects on ICa,L as EPA. All-trans-retinoic acid, which had been shown to suppress induced arrhythmogenic activity in rat heart cells, also produced a significant inhibition of ICa,L. The saturated stearic acid and the monounsaturated oleic acid had no effect on ICa,L. Because both ICa,L and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-release underlie many cardiac arrhythmias, we examined the effects of EPA on ICa,L and Ca 2 +-sparks. While EPA suppressed both, it did not change the temporal or spatial character of the Ca 2 +-sparks, nor did it alter the ability of ICa,L to trigger Ca 2 +-sparks. We conclude that PUFAs may act as antiarrhythmic agents in vivo in normal and Ca 2 +-overloaded cells principally <b>because</b> <b>they</b> reduce <b>Ca</b> 2 + entry by blocking ICa,L. Furthermore, PUFAs act directly to decrease INa and ICa,L, but indirectly to reduce the [Ca 2 +]i transients and [Ca 2 +]i-activated membrane current. Although a negative inotropic action is associated with application of PUFAs, it is clear that by reducing ICa,L, INa and Ca 2 +-sparks, PUFAs can reduce spontaneous extrasystoles in the heart. The mechanisms by which PUFAs act are discussed...|$|R
