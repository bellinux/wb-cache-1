40|$|Abstract. By proving a local limit theorem for higher-order transitions, we {{determine}} {{the time required}} for necklace chains {{to be close to}} stationarity. Because necklace chains, built by arranging identical smaller chains around a directed cycle, are not reversible, have little symmetry, do not have uniform stationary distributions, and can be nearly periodic, prior general <b>bounds</b> on <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> convergence of Markov chains either do not apply or give poor bounds.
