5|$|Andy Hawkins lost a game on July 1, 1990 to the Chicago White Sox {{while on}} the road by the score of 4–0 without {{allowing}} a hit. Because the White Sox were winning entering the ninth inning at home, they did not bat, and thus Hawkins pitched only 8 innings, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was considered a no-hitter at the time. However, following rules changes in 1991, the game is no longer counted as a no-hitter. Additionally, Tom L. Hughes held the Cleveland Indians without a hit through the first nine innings of a game on August 6, 1910 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> went into extra innings and he lost the no-hitter in the tenth inning and ultimately lost the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{only the}} PlayStation version and a PC port were planned, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{appeared}} on the Nintendo 64 in 1999 as Nuclear Strike 64. The PC port was developed by EA Tiburon, with both the PlayStation original and PC published by Electronic Arts in 1997. Nuclear Strike 64 was developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light and published by THQ. Another sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was later planned, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
5|$|Players earn {{an extra}} life at either 1,000 or 1,500 points, but no extra lives thereafter. The high score is maxed at 9,990 points; players may exceed this score, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> keeps {{the last four}} digits.|$|E

5|$|A Dexter's Laboratory combat-style action {{video game}} for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube was set to be {{developed}} by n-Space, published by BAM! Entertainment, and distributed by Acclaim Entertainment for a 2004 release, but the project was cancelled. On February 15, 2005, Midway Games announced plans to develop and produce a new Dexter's Laboratory video game for multiple consoles, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> never saw the light of day.|$|E
5|$|A prostitute is {{available}} {{as soon as}} the game starts. Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her, he will contract a sexually-transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter. This fate may be avoided by buying a condom at the convenience store. Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> resumes without a time limit.|$|E
5|$|American {{football}} leagues exist {{throughout the}} world, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{has yet to}} achieve the international success and popularity of baseball and basketball. NFL Europa, the developmental league of the NFL, operated from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 2007. At {{the time of its}} closure, NFL Europa had five teams based in Germany and one in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{real-time}} strategy games began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{fell short of}} commercial expectations. Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the excitement over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.|$|E
5|$|City went {{another two}} weeks before playing again when their FA Cup run {{came to an end}} with a 2–1 defeat at their fellow Second Division side Chesterfield in the fourth {{qualifying}} round. They returned to league action on 21 November against Bolton Wanderers, nearly a month since their win against Barnsley. Drain, who had scored on his debut against Barnsley, scored Bradford's first ever hat-trick, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> finished in a 3–3 draw. A week later, Drain scored for the third successive league match but City lost 3–2 to Burnley.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary chess is an {{organized}} sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments, and congresses.

5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was {{positively}} received, with reviewers praising the story, writing and puzzles, but criticizing the game's tone {{and how the}} player is required to re-do the puzzles every time they play through the game. Reception of the game's presentation was mixed. The Japanese release was a commercial failure, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> sold better than expected for the genre in the United States.|$|E

He set up an attack for Dirk Kuyt but the shot went straight at the Chelsea goalkeeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, {{during the}} 1990–91 season. Arsenal {{won by a}} single goal, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the {{unprecedented}} step of deducting league points from the two clubs.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas {{had to play}} Florida State {{twice to}} move on to Omaha, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> were again at Baum Stadium. The Diamond Hogs prevailed, 7-4 and 4-2 and went on to Omaha.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{objective}} of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> is {{to solve the}} main mystery in <b>the</b> story, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> also involve side investigations not central to the plot.

5|$|Parker Brothers/Hasbro now claims {{trademark}} {{rights to the}} name and its variants, and has asserted it against others such as the publishers of Ghettopoly.

The previous publishers were a company called Talicor, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is currently distributed and sold by University Games worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Qwest Field {{hosted the}} 2002 Seattle Bowl, in which Wake Forest beat Oregon 38–17. The inaugural Seattle Bowl was played {{a year earlier}} at Safeco Field, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was {{discontinued}} when organizers could not secure financing before 2003. Later attempts to revive the Seattle Bowl were unsuccessful. The Seattle Sports Commission is pushing for a proposal of a new bowl game.

50|$|Wanderers {{defaulted}} scheduled <b>games</b> against <b>the</b> Canadiens (Jan. 2, 1918) and Toronto (Jan. 5, 1918), {{when their}} arena burned down. These appear as losses in <b>the</b> standings, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> were not played.|$|R
50|$|After the fight, Tomić, Bodiroga, {{and several}} other players were sent out of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> {{momentum}} had changed, and Olympiacos won <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and advanced to the league's finals against AEK Athens.

5|$|The game's puzzles {{are divided}} into groups set on {{different}} planets. Players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress to the next one, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> includes optional harder puzzles. Final boss levels, called out as defense levels, complete each planet; here, the player must efficiently create chemicals and deliver them in a timely manner, once the reactor systems have been started, to trigger defense systems to ward off attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure.|$|E
5|$|We write jokes, and {{the jokes}} are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very unlikely that the team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, would extend an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, and Ball State of the Mid-American Conference. However, Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E
