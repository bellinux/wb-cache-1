500|$|A {{homeless}} man {{lives on the}} corner of Miranda's street. She calls him the [...] "laughing man" [...] for his tendency to laugh without cause. Miranda notices that he always utters the words [...] "book <b>bag</b> <b>pocket</b> shoe." [...] She later realizes the phrase refers to the order and place he will send Miranda notes—her library book, a bread bag, her coat pocket and Richard's shoe. The first three notes instruct Miranda to write a letter describing the future events. The notes, whose writer claims to be coming to Miranda's time to save a life, offer three signs of the truth of the messages. As the plot develops, the proofs come true, and Miranda is intrigued.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays Computer-aided design (CAD) {{techniques}} such as Lectra Modaris are becoming exceedingly popular in the apparel industries worldwide for pattern construction because of its accuracy, efficiency and time-saving solutions to much arduous operation. The principle objective {{of this article is}} to draft a set of pattern pieces by applying Lectra Modaris design environment after selecting a convenient style of trouser by different retail websites or fashion manuals. This paper contains all the essential draft patterns for the selected trouser such as front, back, waistband, pocket <b>bag,</b> <b>pocket</b> facing and fly piece which are constructed in Lectra Modaris V 6 R 1 design software. These patterns are prepared after incorporating measurements into the design extracted from the body-scan point cloud data and from manual tape measurement.

Ultrasonic systems being frequently utilized have many advantages on semi products of synthetic textile and technical textile. First of all, sewing – cutting process can be accomplished under high speeds and rate of losses can be minimized. Cutting seal applications are frequently used for underwear and sportswear. Slicing and unit cutting machines, as well as portable sealing machines are available for labeling sector. Products such as <b>bag,</b> <b>pocket</b> and cover can be sewed in a seamless manner for promotion purposes. All objects in terms of accessories are obtained in same standard. Our quilting machines are preferred in worldwide due to its threadless, high quality sealing. An alternative to the classic sewing assembly, with thread and needles is ultrasonic seaming. In ultrasonic welding, there are no connective bolts, nails, soldering materials, or adhesives necessary to bind the materials together. Ultrasonic is defined as acoustic frequencies above the range audible to the human ear. Ultrasonic frequencies are administered to the fabric from the sonotrode of bonding machine. The high frequency and powerful energy produced, when is release in one special environment, the ultrasound heating this environment. The ability to ultrasonic weld textiles and films depend on their thermoplastic contents and the desired end results. The paper defines the weld ability of more common textiles and films. The welding refers to all types of bonding and sealing, as in point bonding of fabric, or continuous sealing of film. ...|$|E

It may have a full-zippered front opening, or pull over the head like an original anorak and close with snaps or a short zipper, has an integral hood, and elasticated or drawstring cuffs.

50|$|The hair of the European badger {{has been}} used for centuries for making sporrans and high end shaving brushes. Sporrans are {{traditionally}} worn as part of male Scottish highland dress. They form a <b>bag</b> or <b>pocket</b> made from a pelt and a badger or other animal's mask may be used as a flap. Compared to the fur of other animals, badger's hair is ideal for shaving brushes because it retains the hot water that needs to be applied to the skin while wet shaving. Although some brushes are made from wild badger hair, most hair is sourced from China where badgers are farmed for this purpose. The pelt was also formerly used for pistol furniture.|$|R
50|$|While {{a pocket}} mask {{is not as}} {{efficient}} as a bag valve mask, it does have its advantages when only one rescuer is available.

Also, in contrast to the bag valve mask, which requires two hands to operate (one to form a seal and the other to squeeze the <b>bag),</b> the <b>pocket</b> mask allows for both of the rescuer's hands to be on the patients head. This hand placement provides a superior seal on the patient's face, and allows the responder to perform a jaw thrust on patients suspected of a spinal injury.|$|R

50|$|Strictly speaking, many {{so-called}} mobile {{devices are}} not mobile. It {{is the host}} that is mobile, i.e., a mobile human host carries a non-mobile smart phone device. An example of a true mobile computing device, where the device itself is mobile, is a robot. Another example is an autonomous vehicle. There are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts: accompanied, surface-mounted or embedded {{into the fabric of}} a host, e.g., an embedded controller embedded in a host device. Accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host, e.g., a mobile phone can be carried in a <b>bag</b> or <b>pocket</b> but can easily be misplaced. Hence, mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocket-sized.|$|R
