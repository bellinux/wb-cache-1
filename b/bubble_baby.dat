5000|$|Severe {{combined}} immunodeficiency, SCID, {{also known}} as alymphocytosis, Glanzmann-Riniker syndrome, severe mixed immunodeficiency syndrome, and thymic alymphoplasia, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the disturbed development of functional T cells and B cells caused by numerous genetic mutations that result in heterogeneous clinical presentations. SCID involves defective antibody response due to either direct involvement with B lymphocytes or through improper B lymphocyte activation due to non-functional T-helper cells. Consequently, both [...] "arms" [...] (B cells and T cells) of the adaptive immune system are impaired due to a defect in one of several possible genes. SCID is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiencies, and there are now at least nine different known genes in which mutations lead {{to a form of}} SCID. [...] It is {{also known as}} the bubble boy disease and <b>bubble</b> <b>baby</b> disease because its victims are extremely vulnerable to infectious diseases and some of them, such as David Vetter, have become famous for living in a sterile environment. SCID is the result of an immune system so highly compromised that it is considered almost absent.|$|E
40|$|This report builds upon {{previous}} CEPR projections to {{more accurately}} describe the current wealth {{prospects for the}} baby boom cohorts aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64. The severity of the housing market meltdown, coupled with the recent collapse of the stock market, has had a severe {{negative impact on the}} wealth of these cohorts. Using data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance and the November 2008 Case-Shiller 20 City Price Index, the authors create three possible scenarios for baby boomer wealth and find these households will enter retirement with little wealth beyond Social Security. For each cohort in 2004 and 2009, the paper analyzes net worth, financial assets, equity in real estate, percent of households in each cohort who will need cash to close on their primary residence, net worth of homeowners, net worth of non-homeowners, and the percent of homeowners who would need cash to close on their primary residence. housing <b>bubble,</b> <b>baby</b> boomers, economic crisis, household wealth...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study is performed {{to examine the}} breaking of an air bubble in the flow passage of a simulated cardiopulmonary bypass system {{by means of a}} flow constriction. The purpose of the study is to discover a geometry of the flow constriction which is efficient in breaking air bubbles while providing the least resistance to the flow of blood, i. e. to develop a new device for the oxygenation of the blood in extracorporeal circulation. Both plasma and water are used in the study. The use of plasma is to simulate the principal transport properties of the human blood and enable direct visualization of bubbles. Water is used for comparison with plasma to determine the influence of fluid properties on the breaking of bubbles. Several different shapes of flow constriction are tested. It is observed {{that as a result of}} rapid changes in the liquid pressure and bubble shape, an air bubble breaks into many bubbles at downstream from the flow constriction. The results are quantatively expressed by the number of <b>baby</b> <b>bubbles</b> vs. the flow rate. It is disclosed that the flask-shape constriction is efficient in breaking air bubbles while providing ideal passage for the flow of blood. The number of <b>baby</b> <b>bubbles</b> is found to increase with an increase in the fluid viscosity...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{evolution}} of an excited electron bubble in superfluid 4 He for several tens of picoseconds combining {{the dynamics of the}} liquid with an adiabatic evolution for the electron. The path followed by the excited bubble in its decay to the ground state is shown to strongly depend on pressure. While for pressures below 1 bar the 1 P excited electron bubble has allowance for radiatively decay to the deformed ground state, evolving then non-radiatively towards the ground state of the spherical electron bubble, we have found that above 1 bar two distinct <b>baby</b> <b>bubbles</b> appear {{in the course of the}} dynamical evolution, pointing to a different relaxation path in which the electron may be localized in one of the <b>baby</b> <b>bubbles</b> while the other collapses, allowing for a pure radiationless de-excitation. Our calculations are in agreement with experiments indicating that relaxed 1 P bubbles are only observed for pressures smaller than a critical one, of the order of 1 bar, and that above this value the decay of the excited bubble has to proceed differently. A similar analysis carried out for the 2 P bubble shows that the adiabatic approximation fails at an early stage of its dynamical evolution due to the crossing of the 2 P and 1 F states.

40|$|Variations in {{fertility}} {{have caused}} a problematic situation in Sweden among other European countries. According to the Council of Europe we are facing an economic and demographic challenge, when the baby boomers of the 1940 ’s are retiring. Economists have {{for a long time}} studied the connection between economic factors and fertility, and several studies have found a correlation between business cycles and birth rates. This connection is again of current interest 2008, when a financial bubble bursts {{at the same time as}} a baby boom occurs. A similar event happened in 1992 when the latest baby boom occurred at the same time as a financial bubble.   This study investigates the correlation between real disposable income, employment among women, the price development of small houses, family policies and fertility during the period 1960 - 2008. The conclusions are reached by studies of earlier research and literature on economic theory of fertility. In the analysis theories and the results of earlier research are compared to empiric macro data taken from the Swedish Statistical Agency.   The conclusions are that a causal relation between economic factors and fertility exists, but it is not obvious; is fertility affected by variations in economic factors or the opposite? Employment affects both women’s income and their entitlement to parental benefit, which means that fertility and female employment are closely connected. Both financial <b>bubbles</b> and <b>baby</b> booms arise from the same psychological factors, which are rarely explained in economic models. When the Swedish parental benefit was introduced it had two effects; first it made the average age of women having their first baby increase, and secondly fertility became more closely connected to business cycles. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of our vacuum is analyzed and several aspects concerning this question are reviewed. 1) In the standard Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model we review the instability towards {{the formation of}} a bubble of lower energy density and how the rate of such bubble formation process compares with the age of the Universe for the known values of the GWS model. 2) We also review the recent work by one of us (E. I. G) concerning the vacuum instability question {{in the context of a}} model that solves the cosmological constant problem. It turns out that in such model the same physics that solves the cosmological constant problem makes the vacuum stable. 3) We review our recent work concerning the in{{stability of}} elementary particle embedded in our vacuum, towards {{the formation of a}}n infinite Universe. Such process is not catastrophic. It leads to a "bifurcation type" instability in which our Universe is not eaten by a <b>bubble</b> (instead a <b>baby</b> universe is born).

This universe does not replace our Universe rather it disconnects from it (via a wormhole) after formation. 1 On Vacuum Stability in the Weinberg-Salam model. In modern theories of elementary particle interactions, the vacuum is defined by the expectation value of a scalar field. In the Weinberg-Salam 1 model such scalar field (the Higgs field) is responsible for the gauge symmetry breaking and fermion masses production. Let us begin our studies of vacuum instability by considering a model containing just a scalar field with a potential V (φ) as depicted in fig 1. The theory is governed by an action in the form S = ∫ d 4 x (1 2 ∂µφ ∂ µ φ − V (φ)), where ∂µφ ∂ µ φ = (∂ 0) 2 − (∇φ) 2 As it is obvious, there is no classical (in Minkowski space) solution connecting φ+ and φ−. There is however a Euclidean solution connecting a point close to φ − to φ+, the tunneling solution. This is a solution in imaginary time. Defining τ = it, ρ = √ x 2 + ρ 2 and considering solutions of the form φ = φ(ρ), we obtain the following equation of motion d 2 φ dρ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} occupations related to {{well-being}} requires research methods that capture transformative processes that extend beyond discrete changes in sensory-motor or psychosocial terms. Determinations of therapeutic efficacy, particularly modes {{of being with}} that include future participation in social worlds, must be able trace how bodily sensing transformations lead to a healing of belonging; that is, experiences of being a fully recognized by others. The intent {{of this paper is}} to propose how an “aesthetic frame” can be used to trace and make visible how the simple pleasures of mundane interactions lead to participation in larger social worlds. Occupational science is situated between the disciplines of biomedicine and social sciences and, thus, between what Kenneth Burke called terministic screens—or sets of terms—that permit one way of seeing while occluding others. Drawing from an ethnography of the “gaps between” children with autism and therapists, this paper tacks back-and-forth between biomedical-positivist and literary-philosophical terms to render visible the aesthetics ofbodily-sensing and imaginative practices central to cultural forms of beauty. Using an aesthetic frame, then, a microanalysis of bodily-sensing actions reveals how children and adults alike throw breaches—creating forms of rhythm and its disruptions—that lead to the emergence of, what I am calling, embodied pleasures. The emergence of embodied pleasure marks moments of heightened intersubjectivity. Such moments of heightened intersubjectivity, in turn, lead to the integration of novel postural stances of self-in-relation-to-other (blowing <b>bubbles</b> for a <b>baby,</b> caresses, familial tussling) with particular moral stances of how [...] be-with-others. Pinpointing moments of rhythmic disruption can also bracket the rich complexity of how the type of bodily sensing transformation can be traced to experiences of social participation and a healing of belonging that can extend outside the clinical context. Occupational science must find a language that can bridge the key antimonies created between disciplines. A both-and integration of disciplinary terms accentuates the at-stakeness of utilizing research methods that can make visible and bridge both (1) changes of bodily and psychosocial components as measures of biomedical efficacy and (2) transformations in moral experiences as central to healing of belonging to larger communities...|$|R
