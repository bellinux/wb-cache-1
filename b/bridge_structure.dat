After the United States entered World War II, construction and reconstruction in the area had ended, while the nation transformed into a war economy. and the residents had received their new bridge span just in time. The <b>bridge</b> <b>structure</b> lasted through World War II and several river floods. The bridge lasted for several decades, until {{the start of the}} 21st century, when plans were made to replace the deteriorating truss structure.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the <b>bridge</b> <b>structure.</b> Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally the {{lightweight}} aggregate concrete (LWAC) made from expanded clay {{has been applied}} in buildings for many years. The improvement of the technology of production, mix composition and execution, has considerably changed the nowadays LWAC properties. The uses of various admixtures have increased the strength, stress-strain modulus and decreased creep that allowed the use of LWAC for the hardly loaded <b>bridge</b> <b>structures</b> worldwide. Paper describes the experience of use of LWAC for four <b>bridge</b> <b>structures</b> in Latvia.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest in using non-linear vibration techniques to detect damage in concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>structures,</b> It is necessary to understand the nonlinear behavior of concrete structures under vibration loading for damage detection, In this paper, a damage beam element is developed 10 analyze the non-linear dynamic behavior of damaged concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>structures</b> subject to moving vehicular loads, The damage is modeled as {{a combination of a}} rotational spring and shear effect due to the concrete cracking and local bond deterioration of the concrete-steel interface. Numerical simulations are presented to study the damage effects on the dynamic behavior of concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>structures</b> under moving vehicular loads.

5|$|On January 28, 2011, DelDOT filed {{a lawsuit}} against bridge design firm Figg Bridge Engineers and subconsultant MACTEC Engineering and Consulting for {{geotechnical}} errors. In February 2011, DelDOT awarded George & Lynch an $11.6 million contract to build the approach roads to the new Indian River Inlet Bridge as well as to demolish the old bridge. A minor fire occurred {{on the north side of}} the bridge construction site; no damage was reported to the <b>bridge</b> <b>structure.</b> The north side of the bridge was finished in August 2011 when the form travelers were removed.

5|$|The G3s {{incorporated}} several novel {{features for}} dreadnought-era capital ships, {{or at least}} for British designs of this type. Most immediately noticeable was the concentration of the main battery forward of the bridge and engineering spaces, giving the ships a tanker-like appearance. Since the G3s were to use existing dockyard facilities, this layout allowed designers to keep {{the length of the}} ships, as well as the weight of armour, to a minimum. The resulting loss of heavy fire astern was considered justifiable since the ships were intended to fight on the broadside. A related feature of the G3 and N3 designs was their tower <b>bridge</b> <b>structure</b> behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the {{superstructure}} were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the <b>bridge</b> <b>structure</b> was enlarged {{around the base of}} the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the isomers of E 2 X 2 (E=Si-Pb, X=H, F, Cl, Br and I) were investigated. In most structures, the E-E {{bond length}} and the E-X-E angle {{correlate}} with the halogen atoms. The relative energies {{showed that the}} non-planar doubly <b>bridged</b> <b>structures</b> A are global minima for all investigated E 2 X 2 molecules except for Si 2 F 2, although the global minimum for Si 2 F 2 is the vinylidene structure in the triplet state. The linear isomers G are always found as energetically higher lying transition states. The investigation of the EX fragments presented that the molecules need very high excitation energies from the X 2 Π ground state to the a 4 Σ- first excited state. Due to the large excitation energies, the bond dissociation energies of the linear XEEX structures are very small, or negative, and {{it is found that}} the E-E triple bond formation is quite unfavorable. The Energy Decomposion Analyses presented that the stability of the E 2 X 2 molecules correlate with the bond dissociation energies. The non-planar doubly <b>bridged</b> <b>structures</b> A show the largest dissociation energies. The large dissociation energies of A stem from the large dipole-dipole electrostatic interactions and the effective three-center-two-electron orbital interaction. The preparation energies of the <b>bridged</b> <b>structures</b> are larger than those of the bent structures due to the elongation of E-X bond to form the E-X-E <b>bridged</b> <b>structure.</b> The ring structures of Si 2 X 2 show large preparation energies and those of Si 2 F 2 are especially quite large. Due to that, the doubly <b>bridged</b> <b>structures</b> cannot compensate the energetic loss of the E-X bond elongation to form <b>bridged</b> <b>structures.</b> As a result, the dissociation energies of SiA for Si 2 F 2 become smaller and the isomer cannot be the global minimum...|$|R
