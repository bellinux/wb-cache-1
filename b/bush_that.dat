5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. Bush for reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.|$|E

25|$|Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had {{previously}} warned <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> replacing Thurgood Marshall, who was widely revered {{as a civil}} rights icon, with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make the confirmation process difficult. Civil rights and feminist organizations opposed the appointment based partially on Thomas's criticism of affirmative action and suspicions that Thomas {{might not be a}} supporter of Roe v. Wade.|$|E
25|$|The Surveillance Bush is a <b>bush</b> <b>that</b> is {{only seen}} in the first episode and the last episode. Karen is seen hiding behind it in the Police Cruiser in Ruby Reborn. Davis and Karen are also seen on the last episode hiding behind it before tailing Brent in the final episode. Since there is no wind a cast member is {{actually}} lying down shaking the bush. The bush was only planted for those two scenes.|$|E

25|$|Justice William Brennan {{stepped down}} from the Supreme Court in 1990. Thomas was one of five {{candidates}} on Bush's shortlist and was the one that Bush was most interested in nominating. Bush's staff made three arguments against nominating Thomas at the time: Thomas had only served eight months as a judge at the time; Bush could expect to replace Thurgood Marshall with Thomas in due time; and multiple senior advisors told <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> they did not feel that Thomas was ready. Bush eventually decided to nominate Judge David Souter of the First Circuit instead, who was easily confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Land parcels were {{allocated}} {{in early}} 1851. The order {{by which the}} settlers could choose was determined by ballot. Watts-Russell's name came up early and he chose land adjacent to the farm established by the Deans brothers in the early 1840s at Riccarton <b>Bush.</b> <b>That</b> land parcel was bounded by what are now Riccarton, Waimairi and Clyde Roads and the Waimairi Stream. While a cob house was built for them on their land, they lived with Charlotte and John Robert Godley; Godley is considered the founder of Canterbury. He called their home Ilam after his birthplace.|$|E
25|$|Marshall {{had been}} the first African American Justice on the Court, and while the {{appointment}} of Thomas would preserve the existing racial composition of the Court, it was seen as likely to move its ideological balance to the right. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had previously warned <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> replacing Thurgood Marshall, who was widely revered as a civil rights icon, with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make the confirmation process difficult. Civil rights and feminist organizations opposed Thomas' appointment, partially citing Thomas' criticism of affirmative action and also because they were suspicious that Thomas might not be a supporter of Roe v. Wade.|$|E

25|$|Pre-eminent {{among the}} saints is the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the {{fulfillment}} of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant (because she carried the New Covenant {{in the person of}} Christ) and the burning <b>bush</b> <b>that</b> appeared before Moses (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed). Accordingly, the Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant and give her the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.|$|E
25|$|Mahony {{spoke out}} on {{provisions}} in immigration bills, {{such as the}} Sensenbrenner-King Bill, debated by Congress in late 2005 and 2006. He wrote to President <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> certain proposed measures would effectively outlaw the provision of charitable assistance and religious ministry to individuals not in valid immigration status. On Ash Wednesday, 2006, Mahony {{announced that he would}} order the clergy and laity of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to ignore H.R. 4437 if it were to become law. He personally lobbied senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein to have the Senate consider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than the enforcement-only bill that passed the House of Representatives. Mahony also blamed the Congress for the illegal immigration crisis due to their failure to act on the issue in the previous 20 years, opposed H.R. 4437 as punitive and open to abusive interpretation, and supported S. 2611.|$|E
25|$|A {{defensive}} stop on USC's next {{possession and}} a 15-yard punt return gave Texas the ball near midfield, and the Longhorns capitalized when Young found Thomas for 14yards on one play, and Taylor running 30yards {{for a touchdown}} on another. Pino's extra point extended the Longhorns' lead to 16–7. On the next drive, Leinart threw a pass intended for Reggie <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> was grabbed by Texas linebacker/safety Drew Kelson. But Kelson landed on his back after catching the pass and the ball popped out. The pass was ruled incomplete; equipment issues again prevented a review. USC's drive continued with a Leinart pass to wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett, the top Trojan receiver of the day with ten catches totaling 121yards, a quarterback keeper of 14yards, and a Bush 12-yard run took the Trojans to the Texas 13-yard line with 40seconds {{to play in the}} half. But two sacks by defensive tackle Frank Okam pushed USC back 13yards and forced the Trojans to use two timeouts. Consequently, Danelo's 43-yard field goal allowed USC three points, and the half ended with Texas still ahead, 16–10.|$|E

25|$|Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari record various recensions of a hadith where Muhammad had prophesised {{that the}} Day of Judgment {{will not come}} until Muslims and Jews fight each other. The Muslims will kill the Jews with such success that they will then hide behind stones or both trees and stones {{according}} to various recensions, which will then cry out to a Muslim that a Jew is hiding behind them {{and ask them to}} kill him. The only one not to do so will be the Gharqad tree as it is the tree of the Jews. Different interpretations about the Gharqad tree mentioned in the Hadith exists. One of the interpretations is that the Gharqad tree is an actual tree. Israelis have been alleged to plant the tree around various locations for e.g., their settlements in West Bank and Gaza, around Israel Museum and the Knesset. Other claims about the tree are that it grows outside Herod's Gate or that it is actually a <b>bush</b> <b>that</b> grows outside Jaffa Gate which some Muslims believe where Jesus will return to Earth and slay the Dajjal, following the final battle between the Muslims and unbelievers which some believe will take place directly below the Jaffa Gate below the Sultan's Pool. Another interpretation that exists is that the mention of the Gharqad tree is symbolic and is in reference to all the forces of the world believed to conspire with the Jews against Muslims.|$|E
500|$|Poco Pine {{was shown}} {{about five times}} as a weanling, winning all the halter classes he was shown in. Curtner, however, {{felt that he was}} slow to develop and {{therefore}} didn't show him as a yearling or as a two-year-old. By 1957 Curtner felt that Poco Pine was once again ready to perform, and took him to a show in Fort Worth, Texas. Although Poco Pine won his class, Curtner was sure the horse wouldn't win either Grand Champion or Reserve Grand Champion, and ended up betting B. F. Phillips and Billy <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> Poco Pine would not win the championship or reserve. [...] Poco Pine won the Championship, which meant that Curtner lost money on his horse winning.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{definitive}} {{is known}} about the island's biogeography {{at the time of the}} colonization, however, the paleoclimate (ancient weather patterns) may have been affected by Madagascar's location below the subtropical ridge at 30° S latitude and disruption of the weather patterns by India as it drifted northward. [...] Both would have created a drying effect on Madagascar, and as a result, the arid spiny <b>bush</b> <b>that</b> is currently found in the south and southwest of Madagascar would have dominated the island. [...] This would have placed strong selection pressure for drought tolerance on the inhabitants of the island between the Cretaceous and the Eocene. [...] As Madagascar edged above the subtropical ridge and India moved closer to Asia, the climate became less dry and the arid spiny bush retreated to the south and southwest.|$|E

500|$|Gore was a speculated {{candidate}} for the 2004 Presidential Election (a bumper sticker, [...] "Re-elect Gore in 2004!" [...] was popular). On December 16, 2002, however, Gore {{announced that he would}} not run in 2004. Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running. One observer concluded it was [...] "Al Gore who has the best chance to defeat the incumbent president", noting that [...] "of the 43 Presidents, only three have been direct descendents of former Presidents:" [...] John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, and George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "all three won the office only after... anomalies in the Electoral College", that the first two were defeated for re-election in a populist backlash, and finally that [...] "the men who first lost to the presidential progeny and then beat them" [...] (i.e. Andrew Jackson and Grover Cleveland) [...] "each won a sort of immortality—having his image placed on a unit of US currency", and that Gore should answer this call of history. The draft movement, however, failed to convince Gore to run.|$|E
500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After Everything Changed, was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't sure {{what to expect when}} the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian <b>Bush</b> <b>that</b> includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture." [...] In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is [...] "a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career." ...|$|E
