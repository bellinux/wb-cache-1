5|$|Lansdale {{accompanied}} the Alsos Mission on Operation Harborage, which began on 22 April 1945. A special Allied force called T-Force went deep <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> lines, seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured {{a number of}} scientists, including Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge and Otto Hahn.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} also charged with {{gathering}} intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project.

5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> lines by air-ship. In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} a frontal {{assault on the}} Gustav Line stronghold at Monte Cassino, and VI Corps, under Major General John P. Lucas from 20 September, was assigned to Operation Shingle, detached from the 15th Army Group to land <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> lines at Anzio on 22 January 1944. For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the 1st Armored Division {{was attached to the}} 45th Infantry Division. Landing on schedule, VI Corps surprised the Germans, but Major General Lucas's decision to consolidate the beachhead instead of attacking gave the Germans time to bring the LXXVI Panzer Corps forward to oppose the landings.|$|E
5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up <b>behind</b> <b>enemies</b> allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|R
50|$|Enemies are {{generally}} difficult to kill in straightforward combat, although characters developed {{for this purpose}} may have an easier time. Characters with high stealth can sneak up <b>behind</b> <b>enemies</b> and perform a lethal backstab maneuver, while players skilled with a bow {{can use it to}} snipe enemies from a distance. Developing a character for resilience and strength for melee combat is still possible and completely viable, but even with proper specialization, successful close combat requires careful application of tactics, timing and kicking. Kicking is emphasized by spikes and pitfalls being in almost every combat area.|$|R

2500|$|In Corridor Mode, the player's vehicle can be maneuvered {{around the}} screen to dodge {{obstacles}} and shoot incoming enemies with laser cannons, and can also perform a somersault to get <b>behind</b> <b>enemies</b> or dodge projectiles. The Arwing is also capable of deflecting enemy fire while performing a spinning maneuver called a [...] "barrel roll" [...] (actually an aileron roll in real life aviation terms). The Arwing and Landmaster can charge up their laser cannons to unleash a powerful lock-on laser. [...] The Arwing can perform one new maneuver in All-Range Mode: an Immelmann up-and-over to change direction. In-game, {{this is called a}} U-turn.|$|R

5|$|In February 1944 it {{joined the}} élite British Special Air Service (SAS) Brigade and was renamed the 5th SAS Regiment in March, {{even though it}} was only battalion-strength. The 5th SAS was {{deployed}} on numerous missions <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> lines. In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and to link up with the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German retreat from the Falaise Gap.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September he {{attacked}} a Rumpler C.IV which he {{drove down to}} 1,000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates fall from the machine as it took violent evasive action. He abandoned the chase and spotted another. This time {{he attacked}} {{from the sun and}} from behind and below. His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> lines. Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill. A DFW C.V followed on 23 September—his 13th victory.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} three armies the Wehrmacht also {{designed}} two special units {{to aid the}} offensive. One of these was a battalion-sized airborne formation tasked with dropping behind American lines during {{the first day of}} the offensive, allowing a panzer division from the Sixth Panzer Army easy access across the Meuse. The second unit was a panzer brigade, intending to go <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> lines dressed in American uniforms to give false orders and spread confusion among American defenders in the Ardennes. Also earmarked for the offensive were around 800 aircraft, deployed by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), to provide air support to German forces and destroy much of the Allied air power on the ground.|$|E
