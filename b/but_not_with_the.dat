5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is {{important in terms of}} marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|It is ectomycorrhizally {{associated}} with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, A.phalloides {{may also be}} {{associated with}} these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, A.phalloides is associated with coast live oak, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> various coastal pine species, such as Monterey pine. In countries {{where it has been}} introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range. There is, however, evidence of A.phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand. This suggests the species may have invasive potential.|$|E

5|$|Abelisauroids are {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} Cretaceous group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species Eoabelisaurus mefi) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species); possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left tibia, right femur and right tibia) were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania. Abelisaurid remains are mainly known in the southern continents, which once made up the supercontinent of Gondwana. When first described in 1985, only Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus were known, both from the Late Cretaceous of South America. Abelisaurids were then located in Late Cretaceous India (Indosuchus and Rajasaurus) and Madagascar (Majungasaurus), which were closely connected {{for much of the}} Cretaceous. It was thought that the absence of abelisaurids from continental Africa indicated that the group evolved after the separation of Africa from Gondwana, around 100 million years ago. However, the discovery of Rugops and other abelisaurid material {{from the middle of the}} Cretaceous in northern Africa disproved this hypothesis. Mid-Cretaceous abelisaurids are now known from South America as well, showing that the group existed prior to the breakup of Gondwana. In 2014, the description of Arcovenator escotae from southern France provided the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Abelisaurids in Europe. Arcovenator presents strong similarities with the Madagascan Majungasaurus and Indian abelisaurids, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> South American forms. Arcovenator, Majungasaurus and Indian forms are united in the new clade Majungasaurinae.|$|E

25|$|Payne proved {{impossible}} to contact to illustrate James the Red Engine – {{he had suffered}} from a nervous breakdown – and so C. Reginald Dalby was hired. Dalby also illustrated the next eight books in the series.

Dalby's work on the series proved popular with readers, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> author, who repeatedly clashed with him over issues of accuracy and consistency. Dalby resigned from the series in 1956, following an argument over the portrayal of Percy the Small Engine {{in the book of}} the same name.

25|$|Converse et al. (1969) {{assesses the}} {{significance}} of the 1968 presidential election. Many people were dissatisfied with Johnson <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party. Their dissatisfaction was connected to the Vietnam War, civil rights, and law and order. Humphrey, the choice of an older generation, suffered from identification with the Johnson administration. Wallace attracted many Richard Nixon-bound Democrats and thus was a threat to Nixon. McCarthy's popularity in the New Hampshire primary was a nondifferentiated anti-Johnson vote from which many voters went to Wallace. These were not, however, the hard-core McCarthyite followers. Wallace's success {{was the result of the}} voter's identification with his stand on the primary issues – continuing segregation, getting out of Vietnam, a focus on liberal economic policies and law and order. Wallace's supporters were rural and small town residents in the South and skilled labor in the North. They were disgusted with public policy and were often alienated from politics.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of future NY17F {{was divided into}} multiple parts, the {{construction of}} the road between Addison village and the hamlet of Rathbone and one between Rathbone and the town of Canisteo. The first section constructed was the stretch between Addison and Rathbone, with construction beginning in 1921. The contract was signed to Frank J. Foote, Inc for construction of the new road. By October 1921, the new road was constructed a mile (1.6km) from the village of Addison to Baldwin Cemetery. The project was not without its controversy. In July 1922, six workers went on strike after the contractor did not meet their demands to raise wages from 35 an hour to 40. The strikers amounting to six would make it appear to the contractor that a change of heart was had by most of the workers. The company stated that if they all had struck, {{there might have been a}} raise in wage, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lack of workers. The new road was about complete in August1922, with the exception of the tarva top that would go on the roads. By August 10, the road was completed with a speculated opening date of September 1, 1922. By November1922, the road was open to traffic.|$|E
