50|$|Most road {{bicycles}} use 700C bicycle wheels (622 mm {{bead seat}} diameter) with matching 20-25 mm wide tires. The wheels greatly affect {{the performance of}} a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the tire. For hill climbs, however, energy losses due to the higher weight of most aerodynamic rims are greater than the aerodynamic drag reduction that they offer, so a traditional lighter <b>box-sectioned</b> rim is often used to make it go faster.|$|R
25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone <b>box-section</b> ladder-type steel frame. Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, trailing link, and a sway bar.

25|$|Astres were {{confined}} to a single series for 1976, but they were refined with extensive engine, chassis, and body integrity improvements. A modest facelift included a revised grill. The 2.3L engine, named Dura-built 140, received improved cooling and durability refinements, and a five years/60,000 mile warranty. The chassis received the new Pontiac Sunbird's upgraded components including the <b>box-section</b> front cross-member, larger rear brakes and torque-arm rear suspension, replacing the four-link design, and effectively eliminating wheel-hop on rough roads. The body received extensive anti-rust improvements.|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{in a concrete}} bridge is affected by complex interactions of climatic factors. Varying concrete temperature will give rise to movements in the longitudinal {{as well as the}} transverse directions. Inspections of certain box girder bridges have shown cracks in only the thin vertical walls, which may be an indication of a geometrical influence. A sequence of climate input data deemed as an extreme event in a previous study was used to calculate the transverse thermal stresses in concrete <b>box-sections</b> with various geometries. The results show that the most influencing geometrical parameter is the member thickness ratio. If the thicknesses in the horizontal slabs and the vertical walls are different, large tensile stresses will occur in the section. The actual thickness is not as important, nor whether the slabs or walls are the thinner parts. The width and height of the cross-section is not as influential as the thickness ratio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} direct {{analysis}} method (DAM) for design of high-strength steel members and frames allowing explicit modeling of residual stresses. A section analysis technique, based on quasi-Newton iterative scheme, is employed {{taking into account}} {{for the effects of}} residual stress. Two distributed patterns of residual stress for the welded <b>box-sections</b> and H-sections fabricated by high-strength steel are discussed. To consider second-order effects associated with initial imperfections and the highly inelastic behavior along the member length, the curved arbitrarily-located-hinge (ALH) element is introduced. A plastic fiber hinge model using the sectional strength-iteration surfaces is proposed for modeling of material yielding. Finally, several examples are given for verifying the accuracy and validity of the proposed method. The distinct feature of this paper is about the development of a versatile numerical procedure accounting for residual stress and geometric imperfections separately and independently for stability design of high-strength steel members.

25|$|The curved-tube chassis was {{the more}} {{controversial}} of the two novel ideas. The existing Cooper 500 chassis design process {{had been one of}} evolution since the earliest production 500s rolled out of the Surbiton works in 1947, and had been based on simple, traditional twin longitudinal <b>box-section</b> ladder frame. With the introduction of the Mark V in 1950 this was augmented by a beefed-up and stiffened body support structure, creating a semi-space frame chassis. This was refined further over the next two years, with the Mark VI marking a switch to equally sized tubular upper and lower longerons, and the Mark VIIA introducing tubular upright sections as well. However, for 1953's Mark VIII the Coopers decided to start afresh with a completely new chassis design.|$|E
25|$|For 1974, a new {{rear bumper}} system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a <b>box-section</b> aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The anti-theft alarm key activator was moved from the rear panel to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover was {{designed}} to only be in production {{for two or three}} years to gain some cash flow and export orders for the Rover Company so it could restart up-market car production. Once car production restarted, however, it was greatly outsold by the off-road Land Rover, which developed into its own brand that remains successful today. Many of the defining and successful features of the Land Rover design were in fact the result of Rover's drive to simplify the tooling required for the vehicle and to use the minimum amount of rationed materials. As well as the aluminium alloy bodywork (which has been retained throughout production despite it now being more expensive than a conventional steel body due to its ideal properties of light weight and corrosion resistance) other examples include the distinctive flat body panels with only simple, constant-radius curves (originally used because they could be cut and formed by hand from aluminium sheet on a basic jig) and the sturdy <b>box-section</b> ladder chassis, which on Series vehicles was made up from four strips of steel welded at each side to form a box, thus cutting down on the complex welding operations required when making a more conventional U- or I-section frame.|$|E

40|$|Moment–curvature–thrust {{relationships}} (M–κ–N) are {{a useful}} resource for {{the solution of}} a variety of inelastic and geometrically non-linear structural problems involving elements under combined axial load and bending. A numerical discretised cross-section method is used in this research to generate such relationships for I-sections, rectangular <b>box-sections</b> and circular or elliptical hollow sections. The method is strain driven, with the maximum strain limited by an a priori defined local buckling strain, which can occur above or below the yield strain depending on the local slenderness of the cross-section. The relationship between the limiting strain and the local slenderness has been given for aluminium, mild steel and stainless steel cross-sections through the base curve of the Continuous Strength Method. Moment-curvature-thrust curves are derived from axial force and bending moment interaction curves by pairing the curvatures and moments for a given axial load level. These moment–curvature–thrust curves can be transformed into various formats to solve a variety of structural problems. The gradient of the curves is used to find the materially and geometrically non-linear solution of an example beam-column, by solving numerically the moment–curvature ordinary differential equations. The results capture the importance of the second order effects, particularly with regard to the plastic hinge formation at mid-height and the post-peak unloading response...|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand de Joux is {{best known}} for his Mini derivative, the de Joux Mini GT. In 1965 he began the design of his GT, a car he {{described}} as [...] "a Mini in a Bermuda jacket". Due to other projects the prototype was not finished until 1971. The Mini GT was a fibreglass sports GT body bonded onto a Mini floorpan that had had extra <b>box-sectioning</b> added on top of both sills and across the back where the rear seat had previously been on the standard Mini. Whilst the standard Mini bulkhead was retained it was also braced to a new bulkhead off of which the doors were hung. This arrangement proved to be very stiff and did not require any stiffness to be added by the body. De Joux personally made the first six cars along with his team; after this his interest was on other things and he subsequently only sold bodies with plans for the chassis. The car was about nine inches lower than the standard Mini, two inches wider, and, thanks to the extended front radiator, three inches longer. Frontal area was reduced by 22%, giving better top end performance. Engines of course could be any A-series. The prototype was fitted with a 997cc Cooper engine, but the potential for a full-race spec 1380cc was enormous. The bonnet was fitted with a power bulge, which provided enough space for fitting twin carburettors. The original door windows were Perspex pull-up arrangement. The door locks from a Mini were mounted on an angle which caused some problems as the Mini locks were mounted vertical.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{and application of}} finite element methods {{in the area of}} material processing has increased rapidly in recent years. Application of FEM is reported in the processing of most engineering materials including new materials like metal matrix composites. In metal forming, FEM is mostly applied to conventional forming situations like forging and upsetting, extrusion, drawing, rolling, sheet metal forming, casting and moulding and machining Most of these forming operations are also well analysed by theories of plastic deformation like limit theorems, slip-line field theory etc. In contrast, new and unconventional metal forming cases, which are often very complex, are relatively under-analysed either by the theoretical methods mentioned above or by numerical methods like finite element. This work is mainly devoted to computer simulation and study of one of the unconventional metal forming process called bulge forming. There are various type of industrial products made by bulge forming process. In some processes the main forming load is the hydrostaic pressure {{on the surface of the}} blank plate or shell. While in others, an in-plane compressive load is also applied simultaneously with the pressure load. Depending on the initial blank shape and final product shape, the simultaneous loading case becomes a complex forming situation. This project has simulated the later category of bulge forming by finite element method. Number of such cases were simulated to cover initial blank shape viz flat circular plate, flat rectangular plate and initially curved shell In the latter category axisymmetric expansion of tubes, T-branch forming from straight cylindrical tubes and forming of <b>box-sectioned</b> elbow from cylindrical tubes were simulated. In each case different loading and friction conditions were tried Distribution of stress and strain were studied for all the cases Companson were made between comparable forming conditions. Response of certain parameter with respect to the changes of different forming variables of the process were also studied for most of the simulated cases. In case of the bulging of flat circular plate, optimum forming condition were identified for different objective criteria Taguchi parameter design method was applied to transform the above optimum values to practicable engineering values. All the simulations were carried out using well known commercial finite element packages. Both static frontal solvers and explicit dynamic solvers were used for the simulations...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work of this thesis sets out to give a clearer in-depth understanding of the failure mechanics of thin-walled compression members which are associated with complex interactions between the different buckling modes during the loading process. This thesis employs the finite element method {{in order to examine}} the effect of the modelling techniques imposed at the section junctions of short struts and to investigate the influence of the local and global end conditions with regard to support and loading on the compressive response of various sections, i. e. I-sections, plain channel sections, <b>box-sections,</b> and lipped channel sections. The thesis also details appropriate finite element modelling strategies and solution procedures taking due account of the influence of material nonlinearity and geometrical imperfections for the determination of the coupled mode interactive response of thin-walled compression members. A detailed account of the complete loading history of the compression members from the beginning of loading through to final collapse is given in the thesis. This involves elastic local buckling, nonlinear elastic and elasto-plastic post-buckling interaction behaviour and yield propagation leading to the development of an appropriate failure mechanism which causes final collapse and unloading. A new finite element modelling strategy has been developed in the thesis with particular reference to being able to deal with the classical assumption of the stress-free in-plane boundary conditions existing at the section junctions of short length strut members during post-local buckling. Also, for fixed-ended columns, with particular reference to singly-symmetric plain channel sections, {{it has been shown that}} column deflections are initiated from the onset of local buckling for the case of the constituent plate elements of the section being locally rotationally constrained at their ends. Such columns should not therefore be considered as an overall bifurcation problem of the locally buckled member. In the case of the pinned and fixed-ended boundary conditions of the columns, the finite element simulations are shown to be able to accurately describe the rather different complex failure mechanics with a high degree of imperfection sensitivity being shown to be in evidence for the pin-ended case. Considerably good agreement has been shown to occur with the independent simulations of other researchers using the finite strip method of analysis, with the analytical solution procedures of others and with the findings from independent test work and this has provided confidence in the viability and usefulness of the modelling strategies and solution procedures developed in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of glassfibre reinforced plastics for structural uses in Civil Engineering construction. The first stage was primarily concerned with the design of GRP lamintes with structura 1 properties and method of manufacture suitable for use with relatively large structural components. A cold setting, pressure moulding technique was developed which proved to be efficient in reducing the void content in the composite and minimising the exothermic effect due to curing. The effect of fibre content and fibre arrangement on strength and stiffness of the cornposite was studied and the maximum amount of' fibre content that could be reached by the adopted type of moulding technique was determined. The second stage of the project was concerned with the introduction of steel-wire "sheets" into the GRP cornposites, {{to take advantage of the}} high modulus of steel wire to improve the GRP stiffness and to reduce deformation. The experimental observations agreed reasonably well with theoretical predictions in both first and second stages of the work. The third stage was concerned with studying the stability of GRP flat rectangular plates subjected to uniaxial compression or pure shear, to simulate compression flanges or shear webs respectively. The investigation was concentrated on the effect of fibre arrangement in the plate on buckling load. The effect of the introduction of steel-wire sheets on the plate stability in compression was also investigated. The boundary conditions were chosen to be close to those usually assumed in built-up <b>box-sections</b> for both compression flanges and webs. The orthotropic plate and the mid-plane symmetric were used successfully in predicting the buckling load theoretically. In determining the buckling load experimentally, two methods were used. The Southwell plot method and electrical strain gauge method. The latter proved to be more reliable in predicting the buckling load than the former, especially for plates under uniaxial compression. Sample design charts for GRP plates that yield and buckle simultaneously under compression are also presented in the thesis. The final stage of the work dealt with the design and test of GRP beams. The investigation began by finding the optimum cross-section for a GRP beam. The cross-section which was developed was a thin walled corrugated section which showed higher stiffness than other cross-sections for the same cross-sectional area (i. e. box, I, and rectangular sections). A cold setting, hand layings technique was used in manufacturing these beams wbich were of nine types depending on the type of glass reinforcement employed and the arrangement of layers in the beam. The simple bending theory was used in the beam design and proved to be satisfactory in predicting the stresses and deflections. A factor of safety of 4 was chosen for design purposes and considered to be suitable for long term use under static load. Because of its relatively low modulus, GRP beams allowable deflection was limited to 1 / 120 th of the span which was found to be adequate for design purposes. A general discussion of the behaviour of GRP composites and their place relative to the more conventional structural material was also presented in the thesis...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{continued}} rapid {{development in the}} increasingly competitive international voiturette class, {{and the introduction of}} the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, twin <b>box-section</b> spars ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller cross members, although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium componentry than its forebear.

These are connected by the floor pan, the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 [...] "Moke, Special Export", commonly referred to as a [...] "Californian" [...] Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the rear floor area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.|$|E
