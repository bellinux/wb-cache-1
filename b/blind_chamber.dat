40|$|Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva®) {{is used as}} a {{bronchodilator}} {{in chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, clinical evidence suggests that tiotropium bromide may improve COPD by mechanisms beyond bronchodilation. We hypothesized that tiotropium bromide may act as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting monocyte chemotaxis, a process that {{plays an important role in}} the lung inflammation of COPD. To test this hypothesis monocytes were pretreated with tiotropium bromide prior to exposure to chemotactic agents and monocyte chemotactic activity (MCA) was evaluated with a <b>blind</b> <b>chamber</b> technique. Tiotropium bromide inhibited MCA in a dose- and time- dependent manner (respectively, p< 0. 01) by directly acting on the monocyte. Acetylcholine (ACh) challenge increased MCA (p< 0. 01), and tiotropium bromide effectively reduced (p< 0. 01) the increase in MCA by ACh. The inhibition of MCA by tiotropium bromide was reversed by a muscarinic type 3 (M 3) -muscarinic receptor antagonist (p< 0. 01), and was not effected by an M 2 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, a selective M 3 receptor agonist, cevimeline, and Gq protein stimulator, Pasteurella multocida toxin, significantly increased MCA (P < 0. 01), and tiotropium bromide pretreatment reduced (p< 0. 01) the increase in MCA induced by these agents. These results suggest that tiotropium might regulate monocyte chemotaxis, in part, by interfering with M 3 -muscarinic receptor coupled Gq protein signal transduction. These results provide new insight that an anti-cholinergic therapeutic may provide anti-inflammatory action in the pulmonary system...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - To {{examine the}} effect of {{elevated}} extracellular glucose, thus simulating diabetes, on migration, adhesion and proliferation of SV 40 transformed human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Methods - HCE cells were maintained in serum supplemented media containing 5 mM, 17. 5 mM or 38 mM D-glucose. Cell migration was determined using <b>Blind</b> well <b>chambers</b> fitted with fibronectin/collagen I coated filters. In adhesion experiments, cells were allowed to adhere to extracellular matrix protein-coated wells for 90 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing, then the fluorochrome calcein-AM was added to quantitate the number of attached cells. Proliferation was determined by plating the cells at low density, then quantitating viable cells with calcein-AM 5 to 7 days later. Results - Raising extracellular glucose from 5 mM to 17. 5 mM significantly increased cell migration by 42...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} chemotactic activity o neutrophil to S. mutans. Chemotaxis assay was performed in <b>blind</b> well <b>chambers.</b> Materials and Methods: Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 10 6 S. mutans,   10 8 S. mutans,  10 - 8 M fMLP, or HBSS alone were placed in the lower wells of the chamber and covered with polycorbonate membrane filter. Neutrophils suspension (2 x 10 5 cells) was then placed in the upper compartment. After incubation for 60 mins at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2, the filters were removed and stained with Giemsa. Result: ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences among groups (p< 0. 05), indicating that S. mutans induced neutrophils chemotaxis. The number of neutrophils migration in response to 10 8 S. mutans and 10 6 S. mutans were signifiantly greater compared to fMLP (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: S. mutans may activate human neutrophils, resulting in the chemotaxis of the neutrophils. DOI:  10. 14693 /jdi. v 16 i 2. 99 </p...|$|R
40|$|Tendon {{healing is}} {{subjected}} {{to a number of}} regulating actors. Fibroblast growth factor, FGF, serving a wide spectrum of bioactivities, is a potential mitogenic and chemotactic factor to enhance wound healing. This study investigates the effect of basic FGF (bFGF) on an in vitro wound closure assay, and the proliferative and chemotactic response of cultured rat patellar tendon fibroblasts. In quiescent confluent cells of patellar tendon tissue culture, a cell-free-zone was generated. The width of the wound was measured at 0, 6, 12, 24 hours post injury, in the presence of 0, 2, 10, 50 ng/ml of bFGF Cell proliferative response was measured by BrdU (5 -Bromo- 2 'deoxyuridine) incorporation as the number of cells that are in S-phase per unit area. Chemotactic response was measured as the number of cells migrating along a concentration gradient of bFGF per unit area, in a <b>blind</b> well <b>chamber.</b> bFGF, at an optimal concentration of 2 - 10 ng/ml, gives a statistically significant increase in wound closure rate, as well as cell proliferation. However, bFGF seems not to be a chemotactic agent under these conditions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Reductions in prefrontal {{oxygenation}} near maximal exertion {{may limit}} exercise performance by impairing executive functions {{that influence the}} decision to stop exercising; however, whether deoxygenation also occurs in motor regions that more directly affect central motor drive is unknown. Multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy {{was used to compare}} changes in prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortices during exhaustive exercise. Twenty-three subjects performed two sequential, incremental cycle tests (25 W/min ramp) during acute hypoxia [79 Torr inspired Po 2 (PiO 2) ] and normoxia (117 Torr PiO 2) in an environmental chamber. Test order was balanced, and subjects were <b>blinded</b> to <b>chamber</b> pressure. In normoxia, bilateral prefrontal oxygenation was maintained during low- and moderate-intensity exercise but dropped 9. 0 ± 10. 7 % (mean ± SD, P 0. 94). In hypoxia, prefrontal oxygenation was reduced 11. 1 ± 14. 3 % at rest (P 0. 61), but deoxygenation was greater in prefrontal than premotor and motor regions (P < 0. 05). Prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortex deoxygenation during high-intensity exercise may contribute to an integrative decision to stop exercise. The accelerated rate of cortical deoxygenation in hypoxia may hasten this effect...|$|R
40|$|Circadian {{misalignment}} affects total sleep time, but it {{may also}} affect sleep architecture. The objectives of this study were to examine intra-individual effects of circadian misalignment on sleep architecture and inter-individual relationships between sleep stages, cortisol levels and insulin sensitivity. Thirteen subjects (7 men, 6 women, age: 24. 3 ± 2. 5 y; BMI: 23. 6 ± 1. 7 kg/m 2) stayed in a time <b>blinded</b> respiration <b>chamber</b> during three light-entrained circadian cycles (3 x 21 h and 3 x 27 h) resulting in a phase advance and a phase delay. Sleep was polysomnographically recorded. Blood and salivary samples were collected to determine glucose, insulin and cortisol concentrations. Intra-individually, a phase advance decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS), increased time awake, decreased sleep and REM sleep latency compared to the 24 h cycle. A phase delay increased REM sleep, decreased stage 2 sleep, increased time awake, decreased sleep and REM sleep latency compared to the 24 h cycle. Moreover, circadian misalignment changed REM sleep distribution with a relatively shorter REM sleep during {{the second part of the}} night. Inter-individually, REM sleep was inversely associated with cortisol levels and HOMA-IR index. Circadian misalignment, both a phase advance and a phase delay, significantly changed sleep architecture and resulted in a shift in rem sleep. Inter-individually, shorter REM sleep during the second part of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Gc-globulin {{has been}} found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in {{patients}} with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been shown to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis to C 5 -derived peptides in vitro. We proposed that Gc-globulin may enhance the inflammatory response in lungs by influencing monocyte chemotaxis to C 5 -derived peptides as it does with neutrophils. Monocyte chemotaxis was measured in <b>blind</b> well <b>chambers</b> by a leading-front technique. Purified human Gc-globulin had no intrinsic chemotactic activity for monocytes at concentrations ranging from 1 fM to 1 tiM. However, Gc-globulin, at concentrations as low as 10 pM, increased monocyte chemotaxis over 10 -fold in a concentration-dependent fashion when added to nonchemotactic doses of C 5 a (0. 1 nM) and C 5 a des Arg (0. 5 nM). The chemotaxis-enhancing effect of Gc-globulin was specific for CS-derived peptides, as Gc-globulin did not enhance monocyte chemotaxis to other chemoattractants such as leukotriene B 4 or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. The enhancement of monocyte chemotaxis to CS-derived peptides by Gc-globulin was not a nonspecific effect of anionic proteins, as other serum proteins of similar size and charge did not enhance monocyte chemotaxis to C 5 a des Arg. These results indicate that Gc-globulin enhances the monocyte response to CS-derived peptides and, together with previous work, indicates that its presence in the airways of patients with COPD and ARDS may up-regulate the monocyte inflammatory response in the lungs.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{migration}} of bovine blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in vitro on their phagocytic activity was studied. PMNs were examined before and after migration through various membranes for rosette formation with sensitized sheep erythrocytes to detect Fc receptors (FcRs), phagocytic activity mediated through FcRs with opsonized staphylococci (Smith strain), and phagocytic activity mediated through nonimmunological receptors with unopsonized staphylococci (strain 305). Migration of PMNs was observed from the upper to the lower compartment of the <b>blind</b> well <b>chamber</b> through Millipore and Nuclepore membranes; through Millipore, Nuclepore, and nylon membranes coated with collagen; and through collagen-coated Millipore, Nuclepore, and nylon membranes overlaid with MA- 104, BHK- 21, MDBK- 99, TB, or FBHE cells. Random migration of PMNs toward the plain medium (the same medium in {{the upper and lower}} compartments) through the membranes with and without a monolayer of cells increased the percentage of PMNs forming rosettes. In contrast, migration toward the medium containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP), or zymosan-activated serum (Act. serum) did not change the percentage of PMNs forming rosettes. The increased percentage of PMNs forming rosettes was associated with the enhanced phagocytosis of opsonized staphylococci (mediated by FcRs). In contrast, migration of PMNs toward LPS, FMLP, or Act. serum did not enhance phagocytosis mediated through FcRs. However, PMNs after migration toward LPS, FMLP, Act. serum, and plain medium enhanced phagocytosis of unopsonized staphylococci (mediated through the nonimmunological receptors) ...|$|R
40|$|Glomerular mesangial cells migrate in {{response}} to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), but to date these cells have not been examined for migratory behavior {{in response}} to other platelet secretory products. Because migration might provide an additional mode of cell redistribution and local mesangial hypercellularity in certain forms of glomerular disease, we examined, in vitro, the potential of isolated rat mesangial cells to migrate toward gradients of platelet releasate and selected platelet secretory proteins. Chemotaxis assays were performed in two compartment <b>blind</b> well <b>chambers,</b> each compartment separated by a porous membrane. Releasate of activated platelets was added in incremental concentrations (25, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml) to lower compartments, and mesangial cells were placed in upper compartments. The chambers were then incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 hours. Mesangial cell migration through the membranes was quantitated by scanning electron microscopy. Mesangial cells migrated toward platelet releasate in a linear dose-response, achieving cell numbers of approximately 40 times those of controls. Examination of specific platelet alpha granule secretory proteins disclosed a potent mesangial cell migratory response to platelet-released fibronectin (Fn), but not to transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), -beta (TGF-beta), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or platelet factor 4 (PF 4). Secretory levels of platelet Fn (1 to 25 micrograms/ml) induced a maximum migratory response of approximately 60 -fold over controls. Mesangial cell migration {{in response to}} both platelet Fn and platelet releasate was abrogated by blocking the integrin receptor for Fn with RGDS tetrapeptide. Thus, platelet Fn {{appears to be a}} prominent component of platelet releasate responsible for mesangial cell migration...|$|R
60|$|That is the {{conclusion}} to which you would probably have come if you had entered his sitting-room, where the bare tables, the large old-fashioned horse-hair chairs, and the threadbare Turkey carpet perpetually fumigated with tobacco, seemed {{to tell a story}} of wifeless existence that was contradicted by no portrait, no piece of embroidery, no faded bit of pretty triviality, hinting of taper-fingers and small feminine ambitions. And it was here that Mr. Gilfil passed his evenings, seldom with other society than that of Ponto, his old brown setter, who, stretched out at full length on the rug with his nose between his fore-paws, would wrinkle his brows and lift up his eyelids every now and then, to exchange a glance of mutual understanding with his master. But there was a chamber in Shepperton Vicarage which told a different story from that bare and cheerless dining-room--a chamber never entered by any one besides Mr. Gilfil and old Martha the housekeeper, who, with David her husband as groom and gardener, formed the Vicar's entire establishment. The <b>blinds</b> of this <b>chamber</b> were always down, except once a-quarter, when Martha entered that she might air and clean it. She always asked Mr. Gilfil for the key, which he kept locked up in his bureau, and returned it to him when she had finished her task.|$|R
40|$|Chinese hamster {{ovary cell}} populations were enriched for cells {{displaying}} low surface {{expression of the}} 140 -kD integrin fibronectin receptor (FnR) by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting using monoclonal anti-FnR antibodies. Selected cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and the resulting clones were screened for low cell surface FnR expression by ELISA. Two multiply sorted populations gave rise to variant clones possessing approximately 20 or 2 % FnR expression, respectively, compared with wild-type cells. Growth rates of the " 20 %" and " 2 %" clones on serum-coated plastic dishes were {{similar to that of}} wild-type cells. Variant cells expressing 20 % FnR could attach and spread on substrata coated with purified fibronectin, although somewhat more slowly than wild-type cells, while cells expressing 2 % FnR could not attach or spread. Cells from all variant clones attached normally to vitronectin substrata, but some of the 2 % clones displayed altered morphology on this type of substratum. Motility assays in <b>blind</b> well <b>chambers</b> showed a correlation of movement with level of expression of FnR. The number of cells migrating in response to fibronectin was greatly reduced compared with wild-type cells for the 20 % FnR variant clones, while variant clones with 2 % FnR showed virtually no migratory activity. Surface labeling with 125 I and immunoaffinity purification of FnR showed reduced levels of intact FnR on the plasma membranes of variants with 20 % FnR, while none was detected in variants expressing 2 % FnR. Nevertheless, beta subunits were detected on the surfaces of all variant clones. Immunoblots of cell lysates from wild-type cells and from both types of variant clones showed substantial amounts of FnR beta chain as well as enhanced amounts of a pre-beta moiety in the variants. alpha chain was markedly reduced in the 20 % variants and essentially absent in the 2 % variants, indicating that failure to assemble intact FnR in these variants was due to deficiencies of alpha chain production. Dot blots of total mRNA from a representative clone expressing 20 % FnR showed reduced levels of material hybridizing to an 0. 97 -kb hamster FnR alpha chain cDNA probe as compared with wild type, while mRNA from a representative clone expressing 2 % FnR had no detectable hybridizable RNA; this seems to agree well with the results obtained by immunoblotting. Thus, the defect in the variant clones seems to be due to reduced levels of alpha chain mRNA leading to a deficit of mature FnR and consequent alterations in cell adhesion and motility on fibronectin substrata...|$|R
