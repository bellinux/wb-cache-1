50|$|The Mount Moran Battery {{contains}} {{the remains of}} a five head stamp battery including mortar box, stamper rods and <b>belt</b> <b>wheel.</b> The battery frame has been removed. A colonial boiler, {{the remains of a}} steam engine with fly wheel and several berdan pans are located alongside the stamp battery. A collapsed corrugated iron camp is located across a gully {{to the west of the}} battery. A small steam pump is located near a well on a watercourse east of the battery. The place includes several early open workings.|$|E
50|$|The devices {{shown are}} on steam engines. Power is {{supplied}} {{to the governor}} from the engine's output shaft by a belt or chain connected to the lower <b>belt</b> <b>wheel.</b> The governor is connected to a throttle valve that regulates the flow of working fluid (steam) supplying the prime mover. As {{the speed of the}} prime mover increases, the central spindle of the governor rotates at a faster rate and the kinetic energy of the balls increases. This allows the two masses on lever arms to move outwards and upwards against gravity. If the motion goes far enough, this motion causes the lever arms to pull down on a thrust bearing, which moves a beam linkage, which reduces the aperture of a throttle valve. The rate of working-fluid entering the cylinder is thus reduced and the speed of the prime mover is controlled, preventing over-speeding.|$|E
50|$|The place, {{which is}} {{situated}} {{on a small}} flat {{on the side of}} a spinifex covered hill, contains an almost intact five head stamp battery and the remnants of a small battery shed. A large number of early surface workings extend along the line of reef on which the battery stands. A camp site is situated about 100 metres east of the battery. Immediately south and west of the stamp battery are several earth benches of the former battery shed. A number of non-insitu items of plant are located in the immediate vicinity including two berdan pans, a stamper <b>belt</b> <b>wheel,</b> a cog wheel, a small set of scales, a forge constructed from half of a ship's tank, and the base of a grinding pan. An area of confused diggings and old mullock dumps extends north of the stamps. Immediately east is a shallow open cut and associated shallow workings.|$|E
50|$|The battery outflow and mill area {{below the}} boxes {{comprises}} a shallow excavated bench with collapsed <b>belt</b> <b>wheels</b> and a removed camshaft. The only surviving item of secondary processing plant is a grinding pan, {{which is not}} in situ. Other items of plant lying around the site include another <b>belt</b> shaft and <b>wheels,</b> a duplex pump, and {{the body of a}} smaller grinding pan. An extensive area of tailings extends west from the battery to the creek.|$|R
50|$|The Mill Site is {{represented}} by the remains of boilers and other machinery, concrete mounting blocks, <b>belt</b> <b>wheels</b> and stacks of corrugated iron sheeting. There are traces of rail embedded in the grass. A feature of the sawmill site that can be seen for some distance away is a metal chimney belonging to the boiler and machinery that once ran the sawmill. For safety reasons, steel cables currently brace this chimney. Industrial equipment immediately adjacent to the chimney consists of the main boiler, secondary boiler, steam engine and a steam generator interconnected by a series of cast iron pipes. Concrete pads represent the previous location of other industrial equipment.|$|R
50|$|Brushed or dull {{polished}} metal is metal with a unidirectional satin finish. It {{is produced}} by polishing the metal with a 120-180 grit <b>belt</b> or <b>wheel</b> then softening with an 80-120 grit greaseless compound or a medium non-woven abrasive belt or pad.|$|R
50|$|The place {{contains}} mine workings, {{a battery}} and concentration plant foundations arranged in close association. The main {{component of the}} place is an almost intact five head stamp battery set on rendered brick and stone mounts. Concrete foundations for the diesel power plant (which has been removed) are located alongside the stamp battery. Parts of another five head stamp battery are scattered to the south west of the battery area, however there are no foundations to indicate installation of a second stamper. A timbered shaft, partly caved at the surface, is situated 8 metres south of, and {{in line with the}} battery's mortar box. The former hoisting gear over this shaft comprises a light bush timber whip pole and metal pulley. The battery area contains bush timber uprights of varying lengths which formed supports for the battery shed roof, water tanks and <b>belt</b> <b>wheel</b> shafts. Southeast of the stamper are the remains of an elevated tank and tank stand. The stand's timber stumps remain in place, but the corrugated iron tank has fallen and lies between the stumps and an adjacent mineshaft. A mullock heap about 3 metres wide and 30 metres in length stretches in an east-west direction {{to the north of the}} stamper. A line of shallow, open stopes extends northward of the stamp battery from the north edge of the mullock heap.|$|E
50|$|Further upstream, a {{watermill}} at Layer de la Haye {{was first}} {{mentioned in the}} Domesday Book. The manor of Layer de la Haye {{had been given to}} Eustace, Earl of Boulogne, after the Norman conquest, and he had built a water mill. It was the only place where his tenants were allowed to grind their corn, and he charged them for the service. In 1536, the mill was {{one of a number of}} properties in the area seized by Sir Thomas Audeley, Lord Chancellor of England, in the wake of the dissolution of the monasteries. The mill appears on a map of 1767, and about that time was let to a tenant miller called Edward Willsmore. In the nineteenth century, the millers were recorded as Dan Cooper until 1826, John Royce until 1870 and Joseph Norfolk until 1890. It was still shown on maps as a corn mill in 1923 but ended is days grinding a product used in the cultivation of mushrooms, when a mushroom farm was established on the north bank of the river nearby. It was converted into a house in 1960, when the wheel and machinery were removed, but retains a <b>belt</b> <b>wheel</b> on the front of the house, which suggests that the grindstones were powered by a steam portable engine when river flows were low. It was a conventional river-powered watermill, with a bypass channel to the north. The present building is of two storeys, with a timber frame, external weatherboarding, and a slate roof, which was Grade II listed in 1982.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} a fine satin finish. This finish is {{produced}} by polishing with a 220-280 grit <b>belt</b> or <b>wheel</b> softened with a 220-230 greaseless compound or very fine non woven abrasive belt or pad. Polishing lines will be soft and less reflective than a #4 architectural finish.|$|R
50|$|Abrasives {{are shaped}} for various purposes. Natural {{abrasives}} are often sold as dressed stones, {{usually in the}} form of a rectangular block. Both natural and synthetic abrasives are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or coated abrasives, including blocks, <b>belts,</b> discs, <b>wheels,</b> sheets, rods and loose grains.|$|R

30|$|The current complex {{spiral groove}} {{polishing}} techniques used mainly include manual or semi-manual polishing, {{the use of}} a <b>belt,</b> <b>wheel</b> polishing, and electrochemical polishing [25 – 27]. Among these, manual polishing is inefficient, and the surface processing effect is greatly influenced by the technical level of the workers, the processing consistency is poor, the production environment is harsh, and the health of the operators is impaired [25]. In addition, accessibility to the belt used in grinding wheel polishing for complex inner surfaces is not high, and cannot meet the processing requirements. Moreover, the problem of environmental pollution caused through the use of chemical solutions when applying electrochemical polishing needs to be solved [26].|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} brushed, {{directional}} or satin finish. A #4 architectural finish {{is characterized by}} fine polishing grit lines that are uniform and directional in appearance. It is produced by polishing the metal with a 120-180 grit <b>belt</b> or <b>wheel</b> finish and then softened with an 80-120 grit greaseless compound or a medium non woven abrasive belt or pad.|$|R
50|$|Knife makers will {{sometimes}} contract {{out to a}} shop with the above capabilities to do blanking. For lower production makers, or lower budgets, other methods must suffice. Knife makers may use many different methods to profile a blank. These can include hacksaws, files, <b>belt</b> grinders, <b>wheel</b> grinders, oxy-acetylene torches, CNC mills, or {{any number of other}} methods depending on budget.|$|R

50|$|A #7 finish is {{produced}} by polishing with a 280-320 <b>belt</b> or <b>wheel</b> and sisal buffing with a cut and color compound. This is a semi-bright finish that will still have some polishing lines {{but they will be}} very dull. Carbon steel and iron are commonly polished to a #7 finish before chrome plating. A #7 finish can be made bright by color buffing with coloring compound and a cotton buff. This is commonly applied to keep polishing costs down when a part needs to be shiny but not flawless.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a mirror finish. This finish is {{produced}} by polishing {{with at least a}} 320 grit <b>belt</b> or <b>wheel</b> finish. Care will be taken in making sure all surface defects are removed. The part is sisal buffed and then color buffed to achieve a mirror finish. The quality of this finish is dependent {{on the quality of the}} metal being polished. Some alloys of steel and aluminum cannot be brought to a mirror finish. Castings that have slag or pits will also be difficult, if not impossible, to polish to a #8.|$|R

50|$|This finish is {{commonly}} used for the medical and food industry and almost exclusively used on stainless steel. This finish is much finer than a #4 architectural finish. This finish enhances the physical appearance of the metal as well as increases the sanitary benefits. One takes great care to remove any surface defects in the metal, like pits, that could allow bacteria to grow. A #4 dairy or sanitary finish is produced by polishing with a 180-240 grit <b>belt</b> or <b>wheel</b> finish softened with 120-240 grit greaseless compound or a fine non woven abrasive belt or pad.|$|R

50|$|Stationary {{belt sanders}} {{are used for}} {{removing}} non-ferrous metals, such as aluminum. Non-ferrous metals tend to clog grinding wheels, quickly making them useless for grinding soft metals.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a quadratic programming formulation for the solution of layered elastic contact problems {{in the presence of}} friction is presented in this paper. Conveyor <b>belts,</b> tyred <b>wheels,</b> composite cylinders, and conrod bearings, are classical examples of systems which can be studied using the efficient numerical methodology proposed here. In this type of mechanical assembly, micro-slip between the mating surfaces often occurs and may eventually lead to system failure. Accurately capturing the evolution of slip and stick areas using a computationally inexpensive procedure (as an alternative to full finite element analysis) is therefore key to preventing these failures and to improving the design of various engineering components...|$|R
2500|$|For {{external}} flow tunnels various systems {{are used to}} compensate for [...] {{the effect of the}} boundary layer on the road surface, including systems of moving <b>belts</b> under each <b>wheel</b> and the body of the car (5 or 7 belt systems) or one large belt under the entire car, or other methods of boundary layer control such as scoops or perforations to suck it away.|$|R
5000|$|To {{achieve the}} above objectives, it is {{essential}} to look in more detail to the variables which affect them. These include the work material properties, the grit and abrasive type of the grinding belt, belt speed, <b>belt</b> sequences, contact <b>wheel</b> hardness and diameter, serration, type of lubricant (or dry) and grinding pressure. Changing these variables will affect the performances of the belt grinding process.|$|R
40|$|Like {{any other}} {{mechanical}} detail, the belts under {{the impact of}} the force suffer deformation. In this paper are treated the relative longitudinal deformations of some profiles of trapezoidal belts under {{the impact of the}} pertaining force. It is known that if belts undergo large longitudinal deformations from the impact of forces on its branches, then the contact pressure between <b>belt</b> and <b>wheel</b> decrease. This decrease of the contact pressure follows with the reduction of the transmitter’s conveying ability. Therefore, determining the relative longitudinal deformation dependant on the force is important for other calculations on the conveying capacity of the belt, respectively of the trasmitter with trapezoidal belts. The paper shows a summary of the results obtained from experimental research for certain profiles of the aforementioned belts...|$|R

Further distribution and use {{of this paper is}} not permitted without permission from SAE. This paper was part of the International Congress and Exposition, Detroit, Michigan, February 23 th- 26 th 1998. The principal development tool for the vehicle aerodynamicist continues to be the full-scale wind tunnel. It is expected that this will continue for many years {{in the absence of a}} reliable alternative. As a true simulation of conditions on the road, the conventional full-scale wind tunnel has limitations. For example, the ground is fixed relative to the vehicle, allowing an unrepresentative boundary layer to develop, and the wheels of the test vehicle do not rotate. These limitations are known to influence measured aerodynamic data. In order to improve the representation of road conditions in the wind tunnel, most of the techniques used have attempted to control the ground plane boundary layer. Only at model scale has the introduction of a moving ground plane and rotating wheels been widely adopted. The Pininfarina full-scale wind tunnel now incorporates the Ground Effect Simulation System which allows testing with a moving <b>belt</b> and rotating <b>wheels.</b> A major feature of this facility is that test vehicles can be easily installed with only minor modifications. This paper compares aerodynamic drag measurements for a large saloon, in various configurations, obtained both in the wind tunnel and on the road. The wind tunnel results are presented for various ground simulations. These are: moving <b>belt</b> with rotating <b>wheels</b> and stationary <b>belt</b> with fixed <b>wheels</b> at Pininfarina, and the conventional fixed ground in the MIRA full-scale wind tunnel. The on-road data is derived from coastdown tests...|$|R

50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine or electric motor {{can be added}} to a cylinder mower to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers. One type of reel mower, now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a <b>belt.</b> The <b>wheels</b> in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower.|$|R
