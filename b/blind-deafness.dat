25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} {{is named after}} the Scottish ophthalmologist Charles Usher, who examined the pathology and transmission of this illness in 1914 {{on the basis of}} 69 cases. However, it was first described in 1858 by Albrecht von Gr√§fe, a pioneer of modern ophthalmology. He reported the case of a deaf patient with retinitis pigmentosa, who had two brothers with the same symptoms. Three years later, one of his students, Richard Liebreich, examined the population of Berlin for disease pattern of deafness with retinitis pigmentosa. Liebreich noted Usher syndrome to be recessive, since the cases of <b>blind-deafness</b> combinations occurred particularly in the siblings of blood-related marriages or in families with patients in different generations. His observations supplied the first proofs for the coupled transmission of blindness and deafness, since no isolated cases of either could be found in the family trees.|$|E
