The pressure and velocity distributions were obtained, the empirical equation of local resistance coefficient from numerical experiments was conducted, providing the interrelations between the best <b>bend</b> <b>diameter</b> ratio and flow velocity in engineering design. The results indicate that the pressure and velocity distributions were non-linear, and which become tremendous with increasing Reynolds numbers. The results suggest that the dot of maximum velocity occurs the wall outside of a pipe bend, and which is more near to the wall outside of a pipe bend along the flowing direction and increasing the velocity.

Investigation of fiber rolling loss mechanisms in plastic optical fiber by intensity modulation of the transmitted light is reported. The transmitted light powers in the plastic fibers in bend-free and under bending deformation are measured and compared. By reducing the <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> (from 18 cm to 7. 33 cm) the bending power loss is increased, accordingly. For the green LED for the force-free case the transmitted power is 7456. 0 nW, while for <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> of 18 cm is 7349. 8 nW, for <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> of 15 cm is 7291. 4 nW, for <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> of 9. 82 cm is 6687. 6 nW and finally for the <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> of 7. 33 cm is decreased to 5863. 6 nW.

Theoretically, the critical bending radius is computed {{as a function of}} the core index of refraction for a fixed value of the cladding index of refraction for different core radii. For the core radius of 430 m the critical bending radius is about 12 cm, while for the core radius of 50 m it is reduced to 1. 8 cm. For a fixed refractive index of the cladding (1. 43), the critical bending radius is decreased by increasing the core refractive index (1. 44 - 1. 52).

Cracking on the bend faces of steel is a major defect, which usually causes rejection of the sufficient volumes of steel.

40|$|High power fiber lasers {{have several}} {{applications}} {{thanks to their}} outstanding features such as good beam quality, all fiberized compact device size, robustness, wavelength tuning, high wall-plug efficiency, and low cost. Due to these features high power fiber lasers are replacing other solid-state lasers for several applications. Fiber lasers are being used commercially for several applications such as surgery, material processing (cutting, drilling, polishing etc.), oil and gas sensing, pumping several other lasers, and space communication etc. However, nonlinear effects restrict the output power level of fiber lasers. Although reducing power density by using large core diameter fibers can increase the threshold of non-linear effects, however large core diameter leads to multimode behavior and is prone to bend-induced effective area reduction. Several novel large mode area fibers have been proposed to scale the output power level. However, the advantages of all-fiberized device and low cost disappear as most of these fibers involve complex fabrication and cannot be spliced to optical components such as conventional pump fibers. This thesis deals with novel large mode area fibers which are suitable for mass scale production and can offer low cost production compared to other competitive fiber designs thanks to their simple design. These novel fibers are all-solid and can be easily spliced to other fibers, thus can lead to an all-fiberized device. Moreover, some of the novel fibers proposed in this thesis offer the delocalization of powers of the higher order modes outside the core. This delocalization of the higher order modes can be useful to ensure an effective single mode operation in a double clad configuration. The proposed novel fibers offer better or competitive mode area scaling performance compared to other competitive fibers. In this thesis, firstly conventional step-index fibers have been exploited for mode area scaling by reducing the refractive index of the actively doped core {{with respect to the}} cladding. Prior to this thesis, the lowest reported NA of a Yb-Al doped fiber was 0. 048 corresponding to 0. 0008 refractive index of core with respect to cladding. In this thesis, optimized solution doping process leads to a NA of 0. 038 for a Yb and Al doped core corresponding to 0. 0005 refractive index of core with respect to cladding. This reduction in NA of core leads to an effective area increase from ~ 450 µm 2 to ~ 700 µm 2 at 32 cm <b>bend</b> <b>diameter</b> ensuring effective single mode operation. This is the lowest NA ever reported using cost-effective solution doping process to the best of author’s knowledge, which is widely used in manufacturing of rare-earth doped fiber. Further, in a 4 %- 4 % laser configuration, a 35 µm core diameter 0. 038 NA fiber shows high laser efficiency (~ 81 %) with good M 2 (~ 1. 1) value of output beam at 1040 nm. Thesis also reports a novel fiber design known as single trench fiber, where a passive Ge-doped ring has been added around the core. This ring known as resonant ring facilitates the suppression of the higher order modes thanks to resonant coupling between modes of core and ring. The combination of ultra-low NA (~ 0. 038) and a surrounding ring can lead to an effective single mode operation of fiber having a core diameter as large as of 50 µm offering an effective area of ~ 1, 500 µm 2 at ~ 40 cm <b>bend</b> <b>diameter.</b> A 40 µm core diameter single trench fiber has been successfully fabricated in house and shows robust effective single mode behavior. Further, a 30 µm single trench fiber has been tested in a master oscillator power amplifier configuration delivering ~ 23. 5 ps pulses at 13. 5 MHz repetition rate carrying up to ~ 3. 8 µJ pulse energy corresponding to > 160 kW peak power and ~ 52. 3 W of average power, while maintaining ~ 76 % slope efficiency. Numerical Performance of STF has also been reported at other wavelengths such as 1550 nm and 2000 nm. A detailed comparative analysis has been performed with other competitive fiber designs showing the advantages of single trench fiber over other fiber designs. Further, another fiber design known as multi trench fiber has also been proposed. Multi trench fiber can scale effective area as large as of 12, 000 µm 2 in a rod-type configuration. Multi-trench fibers offer several advantages such as easy cleaving and splicing thanks to the all solid structure; however refractive index of active core has to be same as of passive cladding. Nevertheless, this fiber has shown a strong potential for applications in ultrafast rod-type fiber lasers. A 90 µm core diameter passive fiber has been fabricated in house using rod-in-tube technique in conjunction with modified chemical vapour process. Experiments ensure an effective single mode operation. Furthermore, this fiber also shows the potential to be used for beam delivery applications with a small core diameter thanks to effective single mode operation over a wide range of bend radii. MTFs of 30 µm and 20 µm core diameter have been successfully fabricated and both ensure robust single mode operation over a wide range of bend radii at 1060 nm and 632 nm respectively. Numerical simulations show the possibility of a 10 µm fiber to be effectively single moded at a wavelength of 300 nm. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{experimental}} investigations {{toward the}} mode instability (MI) threshold in low-NA fibers are performed. By testing several fibers with varying V-parameters {{drawn from the}} same preform, {{a high degree of}} reproducibility of the experimental conditions could be achieved. This allows for systematic investigations on isolated parameters influencing the complex behavior of MI. A maximum MI threshold of 2 kW could be demonstrated for the tested fibers, which represents a new record output power for narrow linewidth fiber amplifiers. The MI threshold was found to sensitively depend on the V-parameter for large V-parameters (> 2), but to be robust for smaller V-parameters. Furthermore, the fiber <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> and the seed excitation conditions were identified to sensitively influence the MI threshold...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A tunable {{spectral}} {{bandpass filter}} which includes two fibers with different bend loss edges—a solid-core photonic bandgap fiber with short wavelength bend loss edge and a Bragg fiber with long wavelength bend loss edge—is {{presented in this}} letter. The central wavelength and the bandwidth can be widely tuned around 1100 nm by controlling the <b>bend</b> <b>diameters</b> of the two fibers respectively. It can be a low-loss in-line fiber device due to its all solid structure and standard splice connection. Index Terms—Bend loss, Bragg fibers, fiber filter, solid-core pho-tonic bandgap fibers (SC-PBGFs). OPTICAL fiber filters have been given special interestas the important components for the all-fiber system.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of macrobend losses in Single Mode Fibre (SMF) and Multimode Fibre (MMF) is presented. The increased demand on information has seen optical fibres slowly replacing {{the use of}} copper coaxial cables for signal transmission, and this, {{largely due to the}} high bandwidth and speed of transmission, large carrying capacity and security offered by optical fibres. Signal attenuation however remains a limitation to efficient and quality signal transmission and macrobending is one of the loss mechanisms that contributes to this signal attenuation. Appreciating the responses of the different optic fibres in use to macrobending is therefore instrumental in ensuring macrobending contribution to overall attenuation in optic fibres is minimum at all times. In this study the macrobend losses trends with <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> were investigated for the SMF and MMF in similar experimental setups. To do this improvisions were done for a light source using 555 timer astable multivibrator powering a green LED, a light detector using an LDR in a Wheatstone bridge circuit and optic fibres off-cuts. Optic power was measured at the input and output points of the optic fibres using the light detector in bend and straight conditions for determination of signal attenuation in each case. The experimental measurement results show that macrobending losses are more pronounced in a SMF than in a MMF. Characteristic values for macrobending loss are 1268 dB/km for SMF compared to 1155 dB/km for MMF for <b>bending</b> <b>diameter</b> value 4. 19 cm. In the SMF macrobending loss trend showed an exponential variation which agrees with work by previous authors. The contribution of macrobending loss in multimode fibre attenuation was however minimal and therefore difficult to quantify. Results also showed that MMF have a higher overall signal attenuation than SMF which justifies the use of SMF in long distance signal transmission. Research findings confirm the significant contribution of macrobending to optic fibre signal attenuation hence the need for careful iv consideration in installations for optimal operation of optic fibres. This would mean the choice of optic fibre in any particular instance should consider the high attenuation in MMF not neglecting the insignificant macrobending contribution of MMF to attenuation at any preferred wavelength in order to obtain required transmission characteristics.,University of Zimbabwe,DAAD and the Research Council of Zimbabw...|$|R
