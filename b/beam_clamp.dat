40|$|International audienceString {{instruments}} are usually composed of several strings {{connected to a}} vibrating body allowing efficient sound radiation. For some special string tunings, sympathetic vibrations can occur: if one string is excited, some others are also excited via the body. In order to investigate this phenomenon, an analytical model of a simplified generic string instrument has been developed. The body of the instrument is represented by a <b>beam</b> <b>clamped</b> at both ends, to which several strings are attached. The state vector formalism and the transfer matrix method are {{used to describe the}} propagation of bending and extensional waves in each sub-structure (strings and beam). Coupling conditions between sub-structures take into account the angle formed by the beam and the strings. This leads to a linear system from which the normal modes of the assembly are computed. Numerical computations are carried out {{in the case of the}} beam- 2 strings assembly and mode shapes are classified thanks to a criterion, the kinetic energy ratio (KER). Four kinds of modes may be identified: beam modes, string modes, beam-string modes and string-string modes. The latter are responsible for sympathetic response. An experimental modal analysis carried out on a <b>clamped</b> <b>beam</b> equiped with two strings confirms our theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a flexible <b>beam</b> <b>clamped</b> to a rigid base {{at one end}} and free at the other end. We assume that the rigid base rotates with a constant angular velocity and that the motion of the flexible beam takes place on a plane. To suppress the beam vibrations, we propose dynamic control laws for boundary control force and torque, both applied to the free end of the beam. We show that, under some conditions, one of which is the strict positive realness of the actuator transfer functions which generate the boundary control force and torque, the beam vibrations asymptotically decay to zero if the rigid base angular frequency is sufficiently small. Moreover, if the transfer functions are proper but not strictly proper, we show that the decay is exponential. We also give a bound on the constant angular velocity above which the system becomes unstable. © 1994...|$|R
