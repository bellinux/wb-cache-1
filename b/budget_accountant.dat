40|$|The study aims at {{explaining}} {{the impact of}} devolving the budget decision {{to the lowest level}} of management on managerial performance in higher education institutions. The study uses the questionnaire to achieve this objective. It distributes 131 to department heads in five private Jordanian universities. 77 valid questionnaires were used in this research. The study splits the sample into two main groups. Centralized group and decentralized group based on the existence of <b>budget</b> <b>accountant</b> and budget committee. Kruskal-Wallis has been employed to test the differences between the groups. It tests the differences between the centralized, moderated and decentralized groups. The results show that managerial performance in the decentralized group is different with the centralized one. The results show that decentralized group performs better than centralized...|$|E

40|$|This book {{is based}} on a {{research}} study carried out by the author in 1964 and 1965. This study covered the budget systems in six manufacturing plants in the Netherlands, belonging to five different industrial companies in different industries : printing, metal products, textiles, electronics :md food. The study used both an analysis of company records and extensive interviewing. Altogether about 90 flrSt-, second-:md third-line manufacturing managers and about 50 controllers, <b>budget</b> <b>accountants</b> and work study engineers were interviewed: over 400 hours were spent in these interviews, which followed a structured pattern with both open and closed (pre-coded answer) questions. The research method was tried out in the first two plants and thereafter standardized for the relmining four plants. The data coHected in the interviews are partly qll 3 litative and partly quantitative. The qualitative data consist of the interviewees' comll 1 ents, written down as literally as possible. The quantitative data consist of the coding of the interviewees' answers where coding was possible and of data collected from company records. A selected part of the quantitative data was subjected to a statistical analysis (correlation :md factor :malysis) {{with the help of a}} large-scale denronic computer. The results of this statistical analysis were mcd to test some hypotheses set before or in the beginning of the project. They were also used to explore tht' data as fully as possible in search for relationships which had not been predicted but which looked meaningful for understanding the functioning of the budget systems in the six plants. Most of the conclusions in this book are based upon this exploration; they are therefore tentative and do not have the value of scientific proof, but they can serve as hypotheses for further studies. The qual. itative data and the statistically treated quantitative data were related to all relevant theoretical concepts available to the author, from the fields of accounting theory, the psychological theory dealing 'with motivation, and organization theory. The total investigation was guided by a systems conception: the budget system was seen as a part of the larger organizational system and having its own inputs and outputs. The purpose of the study can be interpreted as discovering the relationships between the inputs and the outputs of a budget system and explaining them in terms of different disciplines, mainly accounting, psychology and organization theory. The book is divided for this purpose into four parts: part I investigates the existing relevant theory; part H describes the research method; part III applies the theory and the data collected in the research to draw the picture of the input-output relationships of the budget system and to arrive at conclusions; part IV translates these conclusions rather freely into practical recoll 1 mendations for those actually involved in the process of budgetcontrol [...] .

40|$|The Lincoln College Farm Budget Manual is {{revised and}} {{published}} annually to assist {{people involved in}} the preparation of farm budgets. This 1971 edition has been heavily revised and a considerable amount of new material added. Whilst no claim is made that the contents are exhaustive they are, we feel, quite comprehensive. In a period of rapid cost inflation and short term price freeze the expenditure section has been especially hard to prepare. To {{the best of our knowledge}} the prices quoted were those operating at 9 th February 1971. The Lincoln College budget is designed primarily as a teaching aid and thus lays considerable emphasis on formalizing the farm programme for the budget year. The Society of <b>Accountants</b> <b>budget</b> on the other hand is designed for use by accountants whose main interest lies in the finances of the farm rather than the details of the farm programme. Both of these budget layouts contain too much detail for some purposes, and for some people. The third budget that used by the New Zealand Dairy Board is an example of a budget layout reduced to its bare bones. For a seasonal supply dairy farm with only a small number of variables to be considered it is quick to use and easy to understand. In addition to the three layouts reproduced in this manual there are many more in use servicing the agricultural sector. The general layout of this manual follows the layout of the Lincoln College budget. Section I is devoted to data required to plan the physical operation of the farm over twelve months. The succeeding two sections contain the revenue and expenditure data required to convert the physical programme into a financial one. Section IV contains some relevant notes on taxation as applied to farming enterprises. In the final section a considerable number of gross margins have been reproduced for the benefit of those people who may be interested in analysing individual enterprises...|$|R
40|$|In {{an era of}} {{increasing}} sophistication in farm management analytical techniques the budget remains the simplest and yet most versatile technique available to the farmer and his adviser. Essentially a farm budget is a written plan which formalizes an anticipated farm programme and translates it into expected financial results.

Thus budgets produced for the same farmer by his farm adviser and his accountant might vary quite markedly in approach and presentation.
