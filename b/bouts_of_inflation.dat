40|$|Abstract Oil prices, {{associated}} with <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and economic instability {{over the last}} 30 years, have been rising in recent months. We argue that the inflationary consequences of a rise in oil prices depend upon the policy response of the monetary authorities. They can ameliorate the short term impacts on output, but only {{at the cost of}} higher inflation. In the short term the size and distribution of output effects from an increase in oil prices depends on the intensity of oil use in production and on the speed at which oil producers spend their revenue. In the medium term higher oil prices change the terms of trade between the OECD {{and the rest of the}} world and hence reduce the equilibrium level of output in the OECD. In this paper we first discuss oil market developments and survey previous studies on the impacts of increases in oil prices. We then use our model, NiGEM, to evaluate the impact of temporary and permanent oil price increases on the world economy under various policy responses, and also analyse the impact of a decline in the speed of oil revenue recycling. 1 This paper has benefited from inputs from a number of colleagues at the Institute, and we would like to than...|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} the"right"fiscal {{relationship}} between central, provincial, {{and local governments}} depends on how a government weighs the benefits of decentralized economic development policies against the costs of having less effective central fiscal management. Three strong forces justify more fiscal centralization in China's highly decentralized fiscal system. First, <b>Bouts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and recurrent fiscal deficits {{can be seen as}} calling for more central control over the budget. Second, Reform of an economic system relies heavily on the use of tax policy as an allocative instrument to influence economic decisions. Local control of the implementation of the tax system can and probably has compromised some objectives of the central government's tax policy. Gaining tighter control over the revenue system will probably require reducing if not eliminating local government discretion in providing special tax concessions. Third, if the center wants to move ahead with price reform and to encourage enterprise reform, it needs a more centrally controlled revenue sharing or assignment system that reduces the dislocating effects of such reforms. Bahl and Wallich conclude that a reformed system of intergovernmental finance must meet the center's needs for stabilization and the provinces'needs for revenue and equalized spending capacity, supplemented by an improved system of financing local capital expenditures through borrowing, a system of benefit charges and improved planning.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the potential mechanisms behind the blood flow restriction (BFR) stimulus in the absence of exercise. Nine participants completed a 10 minute time control and then a BFR protocol. The protocol was five, 5 -minute <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> with 3 -minutes of deflation between each bout. The pressure was set relative to each individual’s thigh circumference. Significant increases in muscle thickness were observed for both the vastus lateralis (VL) [6 %, p = 0. 027] and rectus femoris (RF) [22 %, p = 0. 001] along with a significant decrease in plasma volume [15 %, p = 0. 001]. Ratings of discomfort during the BFR protocol peaked at 2. 7 (light discomfort). There were no significant changes with whole blood lactate, electromyography (EMG), or heart rate (HR), however, there was a trend for a significant increase in HR during the 5 th inflation (p = 0. 057). In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that the attenuation of both muscle atrophy and declines in strength previously observed with brief applications of BFR may have been mediated through an acute fluid shift induced increase in muscle size.

40|$|Ghana's {{independence}} in March 1957 was celebrated with great flourish. "Free at last!" Kwame Nkrumah, the country's leader, proclaimed. Yes, Ghana {{was free to}} follow an independent political course, and free to experiment with an independent economic direction. But the exercise of that freedom proved to be destructive. Gradually removing internal agents of restraint, and unconcerned about external constraints, Nkrumah pursued his grand vision of Ghana. But, that vision became a nightmare. More than a quarter century of increasingly chaotic political and economic turbulence followed. Eventually a major reform program was launched, but after fifteen years its success has been modest. While the downward spiral has been halted, and real growth resumed, real GDP per capita and total factor productivity have barely exceeded the levels achieved at independence. The long-run economic and political records are both lackluster, each limiting {{the potential of the}} other. The question is, why has Ghana not achieved sustained and rapid long-term growth? This study seeks to provide an answer. As we review the experience of the forty plus years of independence, five explanatory themes recur. The first theme is excess demand. Repeatedly, fiscal and monetary policies have been excessively expansionary, generating <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> followed by painful adjustment. Ghanaian entrepreneurs have seldom been able to count on a stable macroeconomic environment {{for more than a few}} months into the future. Such a short-term horizon has been damaging. Currency overvaluation is the second theme. Initially the problem was a fixed nominal exchange rate, maintained in the face of domestic inflation. Exchange controls followed, while inflation accelerated. The real price of foreign exchange was depressed to a small fraction of its level at independence, and forced the economy to become virtually autarkic. Recovery of the real exchange rate under the reform program has occurred, but its instability remains a serious source of uncertainty for all - exporters, import competing producers, and foreign investors alike. Third, closely related to the foregoing, Ghana has frequently failed to realize the potential gains from pursuing and supporting its comparative advantage. Among the traditional exports, cocoa suffered from a variety of devices that suppressed the real producer price and depressed production to well belowits optimum. Minerals, until recently, endured state ownership, and neglect of infrastructure. The fourth theme is suppression of the financial sector. With the state heavily involved in running financial institutions, and repeated confiscation of assets both directly and via inflation, individuals are reluctant to hold financial assets. The financial sector, consequently, does not yet play its potential roles in bringing savers and investors together. The fifth theme concerns the role of the state. The state was stretched far beyond its abilities. The overextended reach of government and the administrative complexity of many programs pushed the state well beyond the limits of activities that it could handle efficiently and without corruption. This seriously compromised the effectiveness of nearly everything the state was involved in, ranging from education to health care to state-owned enterprises to administration of economic controls. The outcome was a near collapse of the state. Not only was the state ineffective in its economic activities, but it failed to consistently control predation by its agents. Real assets were confiscated, both by direct seizure and indirectly by economic policies. At various times agents of the state extorted huge rents from society and beat hapless victims. The lingering sense that such experiences might recur, leaves the economy achieving far less than its potential, in spite of significant economic and political reforms achieved over the past fifteen years. To appreciate why Ghana's modern history unfolded in this way, it is necessary to understand both the political and economic dimensions. We begin in Chapter 1 with an overview of the economic and political record of the various regimes that governed Ghana from independence through to the launch of the economic reform program in 1983. Those reforms and the consequences are the subject of Chapter 2. The major conclusions are presented in Chapter 3...|$|E

5000|$|Begin's {{economic}} policies sought to liberalize Israel's socialist economy towards a more free-market approach, and he appointed Simha Erlich as Finance Minister. Erlich unveiled {{a new economic}} policy that {{became known as the}} [...] "economic transformation". Under the new plan, the exchange rate would from then on be determined by market forces rather than the government, subsidies for many consumer products were cancelled, foreign exchange controls were eased, the VAT tax was raised while the travel tax was cancelled, and customs duties were lowered to encourage imports of more products. The plan generated some improvement; cheap and high-quality imported products began to fill consumer shelves, the business sector benefited greatly, and the stock market recorded rising share prices. However, the program did not improve the lives of the Israeli people as Begin had hoped. The combination of the increased VAT, the end of subsidies, and a rise in the U.S. dollar exchange rate set off a wave <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and price increases. In particular, the fact that government spending was not significantly reduced in tandem with the liberalization program triggered a massive <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> On July 17, 1978, the Israeli cabinet met to discuss rising inflation, but Begin, declaring that [...] "you cannot manage economics over the housewife's back", halted all proposals. In the end, the government decided not to take any actions and allow inflation to ride its course. Begin and his other ministers did not internalize the full meaning of the liberalization plan. As a result, he blocked attempts by Erlich to lower government spending and government plans to privatize public-sector enterprises out of fear of harming the weaker sectors of society, allowing the privatization of only eighteen government companies during his six-year tenure. In 1983, shortly before Begin's resignation, a major financial crisis hit Israel after the stocks of the country's four largest banks collapsed and were subsequently nationalized by the state. Inflation would continue rapidly rising past Begin's tenure, and was only brought under control after the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan, which among other things greatly curbed government spending, was introduced. The years <b>of</b> rampant <b>inflation</b> devastated the economic power of the powerful Histadrut labor federation and the kibbutzim, which would help Israel's approach towards a free-market economy.|$|R
50|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).By 301, however, the system was in trouble, strained by a new <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much.

40|$|This paper {{discuss the}} merits of an {{independent}} "EuroFed" {{within the context of}} a tax/seigniorage smoothing model for a monetary union. There is an incentive to use a surprise inflation tax to wipe out the real value of government debt and wage contracts because this allows a cut in distortionary taxes and boost employment and private consumption. If dependent central banks can pre-commit, there is no case for an independent EuroFed as this leads to a sub-optimal government revenue mix. If only an independent EuroFed can guarantee sufficient discipline, however, a case can be made for it over and above a monetary union with a non-cooperative or cooperative central bank. This case is stronger when the aversion to inflation is high, when the outstanding stock of nominal government debt is high, when the underground economy is insignificant and when there is little indexation. Even if all contracts are indexed, there is an incentive to create unanticipated inflation if money demand depends on expected inflation. If private agents are rational in their forecasts <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> however, government spending is financed through temporary <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> taxation and <b>inflation,</b> and given that all contracts are indexed, no case for an independent central bank can be made. Competition between central banks of a monetary union induces excessive inflation, because each bank fails to internalize the externalities associated with appropriating too much seigniorage from the common central bank.

40|$|Rising {{food prices}} played an {{important}} role in the acceleration <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> across Asia and the Pacific region during 2007 and the early months of 2008. Not only is food price inflation the most regressive of all taxes, it also leads to lower growth and accentuation of income inequality. Although the index of domestic food prices in Asia has exhibited an upward trend, it is not as pronounced as that of the global index. Yet the looming food crisis has the potential of slowing down the momentum of growth and poverty reduction in this region in the short and medium run. The surge in prices of foodgrains cannot be satisfactorily explained in terms of the fundamentals of supply and demand alone. Analysis suggests that a large part of the surge is attributable to speculation. Further, many countries resorted to protective measures without realising that such measures would force more drastic adjustments and higher prices in global markets. While global foodgrain supply shrank through export restrictions and prices rose faster, food importers escalated demand by bidding aggressively for larger imports to dampen domestic inflation. A vicious circle of spiralling food prices was thus sustained by policies designed to protect domestic consumers, but likely to deepen the food crisis. Even if this <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> food price <b>inflation</b> persists for some time, it would be pessimistic to conclude that the threat to the poor and vulnerable sections is inevitable. Much will depend on what the government and development agencies do – especially to strengthen support to smallholders. Given market imperfections, it is imperative that the benefits of more remunerative producer prices accrue in equal measure to smallholders. Expansion of marketable surplus may thus dampen foodgrain price inflation, as well as help to reduce rural poverty. ...|$|R

The quantity theory <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> rests on the quantity equation of money that relates the money supply, its velocity, and the nominal value of exchanges. Adam Smith and David Hume proposed a quantity theory <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> for money, and a quality theory <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> for production.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the implications <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> persistence for the inverted Fisher hypothesis that nominal interest rates do not adjust to <b>inflation</b> because <b>of</b> {{a high degree}} of substitutability between money and bonds. It is emphasized that the substitutability between nominal assets and capital renders the hypothesis inconsistent with the data when inflation persistence is high. Using a switching regression model, the analysis allows the reflection <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in interest rates to vary according to the degree <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> persistence or forecastability. The hypothesis is supported by U. S. data only when inflation forecastability is below a certain threshold.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how single <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> exercise may differentially modulate neuroelectric correlates of attentional orienting and processing. Using a within-participants design, ERPs and task performance were assessed {{in response to}} a perceptually challenging three-stimulus oddball task prior to and following a <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise or seated rest during two separate, counterbalanced sessions. Findings revealed that, following a single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise, attentional processing was sustained relative to pretest whereas prolonged sitting resulted in attentional decrements. Focal attention resulting from attentional orienting, in contrast, {{does not appear to be}} sensitive to the influences <b>of</b> single <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> physical activity. These findings suggest that acute exercise-induced changes in cognition do not originate from an overall modulation of attention but instead are specific to aspects of attentional processing.

40|$|One decade <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> {{targeting}} in {{the world}} offers lessons on the design and implementation <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting, the conduct of monetary policy, and country performance under inflation targeting. This paper reviews briefly the main design features <b>of</b> 18 <b>inflation</b> targeting experiences, analyzes statistically if countries under inflation targeting are structurally different from non-inflation targeting industrial countries, and reviews existing evidence about the success <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting. The interaction <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting design features and the conduct of monetary policy during transition to low inflation are tackled next. The paper ends by focusing on unresolved issues on design and implementation <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting and their relation to the conduct of monetary policy – open issues {{that have to be}} addressed in the next decade <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting. ...|$|R
40|$|Persistent {{inflation}} and slow stabilization {{are usually the}} result of policy accommodation resorted to {{in an attempt to}} avoid the recessionary costs of a sharp reduction <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> This paper reviews three explanations for why policymakers, despite their dislike <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> may nevertheless choose to adopt accommodative policies. It emphasizes the role of indexation, uncertainty about policymakers’ preferences, and the existence of fixed costs associated with the implementation of a stabilization program. The paper also presents some evidence on the extent <b>of</b> persistence <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> across countries.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between inflation and different sources <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> uncertainty is investigated in Turkey {{during the period}} of 1995 : 3 - 2000 : 12. A time-varying parameter model <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> with heteroscedastic disturbances is used to generate different sources <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> uncertainty and then Granger methods are employed to test for causality between inflation and different sources <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> uncertainty. The findings show that there is a causative influence <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> on its uncertainty arising due to time-varying parameters <b>of</b> the <b>inflation</b> model. No evidence is found on the correlation between inflation and inflation uncertainty arising due to heteroscedasticity in the disturbance terms. ...|$|R
