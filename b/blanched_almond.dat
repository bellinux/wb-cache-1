50|$|Aboukir almond is {{a variety}} of candy or sweet. These almonds are {{produced}} {{in the region of}} Aboukir in Egypt. The sweet is made by whole almonds are blanched, then roasted and set aside. This is then made to a paste and coloured green or pink. It is pressed into a ball or an oval. It is kirsch flavored and shaped {{in the form of a}} green almond, stuffed with a <b>blanched</b> <b>almond.</b> The product is then dipped into hot sugar syrup and placed on parchment paper to dry.|$|E
40|$|Immunoblotting {{was used}} to {{identify}} the allergenic proteins in various raw and processed almonds. Both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions were used to separate the proteins prior to electroblotting. Sera {{from each of the}} eight almond allergic individuals exhibited unique binding patterns with the almond proteins. As many as eight IgE-binding proteins were identified in immunoblots of SDS-PAGE separated almond proteins. Sera from four of the eight individuals reacted to a protein of approximate molecular weight of 70, 000 daltons. Another protein, of approximately 45, 000 to 50, 000 molecular weight was also recognized by four individuals. The three different varieties of almonds that were studied exhibited identical IgE-binding patterns. Processing reduced the allergenicity as was evidenced by reduced IgE-binding in immunoblots of blanched almonds and roasted blanched almonds. ^ Fewer IgE-binding proteins were identified in immunoblots of almond proteins separated using nondenaturing conditions. As many as four IgE-binding proteins were exhibited in raw almonds. One of these proteins was recognized by the same four individuals that reacted to the 70, 000 dalton protein in the SDS-PAGE immunoblots. Fewer IgE-binding proteins were exhibited in extracts of processed almonds separated under nondenaturing conditions as well. ^ The common IgE-binding protein in the nondenaturing immunoblots was purified using conventional chromatography. This protein (Pru a Bd 68 K) had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 68, 000 daltons. The IgE-binding activity of Pru a Bd 68 K was eliminated by heating at 100 - 121 ∘C and was absent in immunoblots of almond butter and roasted <b>blanched</b> <b>almond.</b> While this protein exhibited IgE-binding activity by immunoblotting, skin tests with three almond allergic individuals have failed to give positive results. Peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing were initiated but further studies await confirmation of in vivo allergenicity. ^ Five commercially prepared allergen extracts were also studied and compared using immunoblotting with sera from the same eight almond allergic individuals. The different extracts varied widely in quantity and quality of protein. While IgE-binding patterns differed between extracts, all exhibited some reactivity. ...|$|E
50|$|Almond meal, almond flour {{or ground}} almond {{is made from}} ground sweet almonds. Almond flour is usually made with <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> (no skin), whereas almond meal can be made both with whole or <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds.</b> The {{consistency}} is more like corn meal than wheat flour.|$|R
50|$|The dish {{consists}} of meat, such as of a boiled chicken or fish, boiled and pounded with <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> and milk into a smooth paste. This is then cooked gently with sugar.|$|R
5000|$|Amygdalotá or pastéli {{exist in}} many {{varieties}} throughout Greece and Cyprus, and are especially {{popular in the}} islands. They consist of powdered <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds,</b> confectioner's sugar and rose water, molded in various shapes and sizes. They are snow-white and are considered wedding and baptismal desserts.|$|R
50|$|Preparation of {{the dish}} {{involves}} boiling apricots with syrup until they assume the consistency of a thick soup or compote. The dessert is topped with <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> or apricot kernels, and is traditionally garnished with malai (extra thick cream, ideally from buffalo milk), but also with custard or ice cream.|$|R
5000|$|In Greece, ground <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> {{are used}} as the base {{material}} in {{a great variety of}} desserts, usually called amygdalota (αμυγδαλωτά). Because of their white colour, most are traditionally considered [...] "wedding sweets" [...] and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as soumada is made from almonds in various regions.|$|R
50|$|The praline {{comprises}} a spherical wafer {{which is}} filled with a white milk cream and white <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds.</b> It {{is surrounded by a}} coconut layer. Raffaello contains no chocolate, but does contain lactose, making Raffaello incompatible for consumers with lactose intolerance. Likewise, almonds instead of hazelnuts are included, which is relevant for those allergic to hazelnut.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit of}} the almond is a drupe, {{consisting}} of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, {{which is not a}} true nut, inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. <b>Blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal the white embryo.|$|R
5000|$|A sweet {{fruit and}} nut bread eaten at Christmas time. The term pan dulce means [...] "sweet bread" [...] in Spanish, but its origins {{may lie in}} Italy with the Genoese pandolce or Portuguese sweet bread. Its main {{ingredients}} can include lard, margarine, sugar, self-raising flour, <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds,</b> raisins, sultanas, pine nuts, candied peel, eggs, aniseed and anisette among others. It is sometimes decorated with hundreds and thousands just like the bollo de hornasso.|$|R
5000|$|The Greek word lambropsomo (λαμπρόψωμο) {{is derived}} from one Greek word for Easter, Lambri (Λαμπρή), which means bright light, and psomi (ψωμί), which means bread; {{referring}} to the light Christians believe is given to them by Christ's resurrection. Another name for the bread is lambrokouloura (λαμπροκουλούρα): kouloura (κουλούρα) means round and is used for various types of biscuits and round breads. This braided bread can be shaped either into a circle or into two large braids and sprinkled with nuts, usually slivered, <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds.</b> It is served with red Easter eggs that have been dyed to represent the blood of Christ.|$|R
60|$|He {{was coming}} at Christmas for five days. There {{had never been}} such preparations. Paul and Arthur scoured the land for holly and evergreens. Annie made the pretty paper hoops in the old-fashioned way. And there was unheard-of extravagance in the larder. Mrs. Morel made a big and {{magnificent}} cake. Then, feeling queenly, she showed Paul how to <b>blanch</b> <b>almonds.</b> He skinned the long nuts reverently, counting them all, to see not one was lost. It was said that eggs whisked better in a cold place. So the boy stood in the scullery, where the temperature was nearly at freezing-point, and whisked and whisked, and flew in excitement to his mother as the white of egg grew stiffer and more snowy.|$|R
5000|$|The cake {{is often}} made with currants, {{sultanas}} and almonds; sometimes, fruit peel may {{be added to}} it. The cake originated in nineteenth-century Scotland, and was originally made as a mass-produced cake by the marmalade company called Keiller's. Keiller's marmalade company first mass-produced the cake commercially and have been {{claimed to be the}} originators of the term [...] "Dundee cake". However, similar fruit cakes were produced across Scotland. A popular story is that Mary Queen of Scots did not like glace cherries in her cakes, so the cake was first made for her, as a fruit cake that used <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> and not cherries. The top of the cake is typically decorated with concentric circles of almonds. Today, the cakes are often sold in supermarkets throughout the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Besides the strudel dough the {{ingredients}} are: cream, egg yolks, <b>blanched,</b> ground <b>almonds,</b> sugar, 1 roll soaked in milk, 2 whites snow (stiffy beaten egg whites). Sprinkle with raisins and bake lightly. Then pour over sugared milk. Let it evaporate. Then bake in casserole. Serve {{in the pan}} with hot vanilla sauce.|$|R
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|R
5000|$|Whole fruit {{preserves}} can {{be found}} in most Greek and Cypriot homes. They are made by slowly and gently boiling fruit in water and sugar over several hours or days, until the syrup sets. Thus the main prerequisites to making good spoon sweets are said to be [...] "patience and a heavy pot". Some lemon juice is often added to preserve the fruit's original color, as the citric acid prevents oxidation. A small quantity of <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds,</b> slivered or whole, may also be added for crunch, often to baby eggplants, apples or grapes. Ingredients variously added during the boiling, and then discarded, include a quill of cinnamon bark, a mint bouquet, or the green, fragrant leaves of the shrub Pelargonium odoratissimum (apple geranium) or Pelargonium graveolens (rose geranium) which add some astringency and a slight aroma of frankincense and is especially popular in the Ionian islands.|$|R
50|$|Non-{{alcoholic}} and alcoholic {{versions of}} glögg {{can be bought}} ready-made or prepared with fruit juices instead of wine. The main ingredients of alcoholic glögg are red wine, sugar, spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and bitter orange, and optionally also stronger spirits such as vodka, akvavit, or brandy. Throughout Scandinavia, glögg spice extract and ready-mixed spices can be purchased in grocery stores. To prepare glögg, spices and/or spice extract are mixed into the wine, which is then heated to 60-70 °C. When preparing homemade glögg using spices, the hot mixture is allowed to infuse {{for at least an}} hour, often longer, and then reheated before serving. Ready-made wine glögg, as well as low- or non-alcoholic varieties, is normally sold at Systembolaget in Sweden, and in Alko in Finland, ready to heat and serve, and not in concentrate or extract form. Glögg is generally served with raisins, <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> and Ginger biscuits (Ginger Snaps), and is a popular hot drink during the Christmas season.|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{adsorption}} {{characteristics of}} California grown almonds (Nonpareil: pasteurized and unpasteurized almonds; Monterey: pasteurized, unpasteurized and <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds)</b> were obtained using the gravimetric method over {{a range of}} water activities from 0. 11 to 0. 98 at 7 - 50 ºC. The weights of almonds were measured until samples reached a constant weight. The relationship between equilibrium moisture content and water activity was established using the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer model. The diffusion coefficient of water in almond kernels was calculated based on Ficks second law. The monolayer moisture value of almonds ranged from 0. 020 to 0. 035 kg H 2 O kg- 1 solids. The diffusion coefficient increased with temperature at a constant water activity, and decreased with water activity at a constant temperature. The thermodynamic properties (net isosteric heat, differential enthalpy and entropy) were also determined. The net isosteric heat of adsorption decreased with the increasing moisture content, and the plot of differential enthalpy versus entropy satisfied the enthalpy-entropy compensation theory. The adsorption process of almond samples was enthalpy driven over the range of studied moisture contents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{outbreaks}} of salmonellosis {{were linked to}} the consumption of raw California almonds in 2001 and 2004. Current federal regulations mandate that all almonds grown in California are {{to be treated with}} a process that results in a 4 -log reduction of Salmonella. Since four out of the five approved technologies to pasteurize almonds rely on the application of heat to control Salmonella, the evaluation of alternative technologies against heat resistant Salmonella Senftenberg was imminent. In this study, almonds that were inoculated with S. Enteritidis PT 30 and S. Senftenberg, were treated with electron beam irradiation (e-beam), blanching and oil roasting. The thermal death time (D-value) for S. Enteritidis PT 30 when treated with e-beam was 0. 90 kGy, 15 s when subjected to blanching at 88 degrees C, and 13 s when treated with oil at 127 degrees C. Irradiation and thermal resistance of S. Senftenberg was not significantly different (P > 0. 05) from S. Enteritidis PT 30. The commercial application of e-beam as a pathogen intervention was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) and experimental measurements. The sensory characteristics of almonds commercially treated by e-beam, blanching and roasting were assessed by a consumer panel. Irradiated and <b>blanched</b> <b>almonds</b> did not differ in consumer overall like (P > 0. 05). Bitterness and rancidity attributes of irradiated almonds were between a "dislike slightly" and "dislike moderately", whereas <b>blanched</b> and roasted <b>almonds</b> were between "neither like nor dislike" and "like slightly". <b>Almonds</b> commercially irradiated, <b>blanched</b> and roasted were subjected to an accelerated shelf-life test (ASLT) evaluating percentage free fatty acids, peroxide value, and 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs). No clear differences between treatments were observed at any given point in time in any of the chemical tests. A gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry-olfactometry (MDGC-MS-O) technology was used to compare full aroma and flavor profiles from raw and e-beam irradiated almonds. Differences in the aroma/odor profile and the taste analysis revealed that the difference between raw and irradiated almonds is extremely subtle. In conclusion, e-beam may be a feasible technology to control Salmonella in almonds if used at low doses, {{as a part of a}} series of interventions...|$|R
50|$|In Morocco, almonds in {{the form}} of sweet almond paste are the main {{ingredient}} in pastry fillings, and several other desserts. Fried <b>blanched</b> whole <b>almonds</b> are also used to decorate sweet tajines such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of Essaouira and Souss are also known for amlou, a spread made of almond paste, argan oil, and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make sellou (also called zamita in Meknes or slilou in Marrakech), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{quantify}} the rate and extent of polyphenols released in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) from natural (NS) and <b>blanched</b> (BS) <b>almond</b> skins. A dynamic gastric model of digestion which provides a realistic simulation of the human stomach was used. In order to establish the effect of a food matrix on polyphenols bioaccessibility, NS and BS were either digested in water (WT) or incorporated into home-made biscuits (HB), crisp-bread (CB) and full-fat milk (FM). Phenolic acids were the most bioaccessible class (68. 5 % release from NS and 64. 7 % from BS). WT increased the release of flavan- 3 -ols (p < 0. 05) and flavonols (p < 0. 05) from NS after gastric plus duodenal digestion, whereas CB and HB were better vehicles for BS. FM lowered the % recovery of polyphenols, the free total phenols and the antioxidant status in the digestion medium, indicating that phenolic compounds could bind protein present in the food matrix. The release of bioactives from almond skins could explain the beneficial effects associated with almond consumption...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} effect of almond skin extracts on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) replication. Drug-resistant strains of HSV frequently develop following therapeutic treatment. Therefore, the discovery of novel anti-HSV drugs deserves great effort. Here, we tested both natural (NS) and <b>blanched</b> (BS) polyphenols-rich <b>almond</b> skin extracts against HSV- 1. HPLC analysis showed that the prevalent compounds in NS and BS extracts contributing to their antioxidant activity were quercetin, epicatechin and catechin. Results of cell viability indicated that NS and BS extracts were not toxic to cultured Vero cells. Furthermore, NS extracts were more potent inhibitors of HSV- 1 than BS extracts, and this trend was in agreement with different concentrations of flavonoids. The plaque forming assay, Western blot and real-time PCR were used to demonstrate that NS extracts were able to block the production of infectious HSV- 1 particles. In addition, the viral binding assay demonstrated that NS extracts inhibited HSV- 1 adsorption to Vero cells. Our conclusion is that natural products from almond skin extracts are an extraordinary source of antiviral agents and provide a novel treatment against HSV- 1 infections...|$|R
