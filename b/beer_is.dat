5|$|The {{process of}} making <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> known as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> made in the home. Brewing <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beer</b> <b>is</b> {{consumed}} out of {{a variety}} of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beer</b> <b>is</b> {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. <b>Beer</b> <b>is</b> brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beer</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be a social lubricant in many societies and is consumed in countries all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as Syria, and in some African countries. Sales of beer are four times those of wine, which is the second most popular alcoholic drink.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beer</b> <b>is</b> {{distributed}} in bottles and cans {{and is also}} commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms {{part of the culture}} of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beer</b> <b>is</b> {{measured}} and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness {{is measured by}} the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention. The international scale was a development of the European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, {{the use of a}} refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|Water, palm wine, and millet beer are the {{traditional}} mealtime drinks, although beer, soda, and wine have gained popularity. 33 Export <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> the official drink {{of the national}} soccer team {{and one of the}} most popular brands, joining Castel, Amstel Brewery, and Guinness.|$|E
5|$|Wheat <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> brewed {{with a large}} {{proportion}} of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley.

5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic drink that is mixed with water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color.

5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
5|$|In many societies, <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession {{is that of the}} beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's <b>beer</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} pale lager brewed in 1842 {{in the town of}} Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a {{noticeable}} carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E
40|$|Although {{currently}} light beers {{have a high}} {{market share}} in the US, this <b>beer</b> style <b>is</b> still not accepted oil the European continent because light <b>beers</b> <b>are</b> considered watery, mainly on account of lack of mouthfeel. In this paper, the flavour quality, including flavour stability, of five commercial light <b>beers</b> <b>was</b> evaluated in comparison with their corresponding pilsner beers derived from the same breweries. Through detailed physicochemical and sensory evaluation, followed by multivariate data analysis, the fresh <b>beers</b> could <b>be</b> differentiated according to their origin (US or European) and beer style (light or pilsner). Potential flavour deficiencies of fresh light <b>beers</b> <b>were</b> determined as too much sweetness, lack of bitterness, and especially reduced fullness. As a result, the fresh light <b>beers</b> <b>were</b> less preferred than their corresponding pilsner. Upon ageing, the light <b>beers</b> <b>were</b> generally less flavour stable than their pilsner counterparts. This is mainly ascribed to increased sensory perception of cardboard and ribes staling flavours in most aged light beers. Nevertheless, based oil detailed analytical/sensory investigation, it was clearly demonstrated {{that one of the}} light beers involved in this study showed enhanced flavour stability with respect to all other beers, including the pilsner beers. status: publishe...|$|R
