40|$|Numerous {{animal and}} human {{studies have shown}} that afferent {{information}} from the periphery contributes to the control of walking. In particular, recent studies have consistently shown that load receptor input is an important element of the locomotion control mechanism. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the contribution of load receptor feedback to the compensatory stretch reflex response. We examined the contribution of load receptor feedback to the magnitude of the short and medium latency components of the ankle plantar flexor stretch reflex responses following an unexpected dorsiflexion perturbation during human walking. Three <b>body</b> <b>load</b> conditions were investigated: normal <b>body</b> <b>load,</b> a 30 % increase in <b>body</b> <b>load,</b> and a 30 % decrease in <b>body</b> <b>load.</b> Healthy subjects walked on a treadmill at approximately 3. 6 km/h with the left ankle attached to a portable stretching device. Dorsiflexion perturbations (8 degrees; 350 - 425 degrees/s) were generated during the late stance phase of gate (approximately 400 ms following heel contact). Electromyographic activity was recorded from the soleus, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris muscles using bipolar surface electrodes. Stretch reflex responses were observed in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles for all of the <b>body</b> <b>load</b> conditions; however, increasing or decreasing the <b>body</b> <b>load</b> did not affect the timing and magnitude of the responses. This study provides evidence that load receptor input does not contribute strongly to the corrective response of the stretch reflex in the plantar flexor muscles during walking...|$|R

50|$|The {{causes of}} the {{experience}} of <b>body</b> <b>load</b> are unknown. However, one proposed mechanism is the stimulation of serotonergic 5-HT receptors, particularly those involved in tactile sensation and, equally importantly in many cases where nausea is experienced, those located along the lining of the digestive tract. Serotonin is heavily involved in appetite control, and over-stimulation of serotonergic receptors has been shown to cause nausea in overdoses of SSRIs or MDMA.

40|$|The {{development}} of methods {{to monitor the}} South African coastal waters offer major challenges. Knowledge and availability of suitable species that may serve as biomonitors will be valuable to obtain information to support good management decisions. It is therefore important to identify local species that show the basic characteristics required for biomonitoring. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare, as part of a wider seasonal field study of metals in the intertidal zone of False Bay, South Africa, the <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> of copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in the black mussel (C. meridionalis) and the barnacle (T. serrata), and to compare these with environmental concentrations. Also to draw conclusions about the animals’ relative abilities to accumulate priority metals. Specimens of both species were collected over several seasons at different points in False Bay and analysed chemically. The mean body load (soft tissue and shell) of metals was higher in the black mussel than in the barnacle during all seasons. A comparison between the <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> and environmental concentrations in water and sediment showed that the priority metals Cd, Ni and Pb are accumulated strongly by both C. meridionalis and T. serrata. The mean Cd <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> varied between 6. 43 µg/g and 14. 73 µg/g for the various seasons but was not statistically significantly different between seasons. Metal concentrations were in most cases highest during winter. Multiple regression analysis showed a strong correlation between body load of metals in the black mussel and the environmental concentration for most seasons, which indicates that the black mussel can be useful as an active rather than a passive biomonitor. The concept of biomonitoring has merit because it may show long-term tendencies, but it does not offer an absolute measure of immediate, varying pollution levels. It could serve as an additional management tool in a national marine programme for the protection of the intertidal zone’s biodiversity...|$|E

Assuming that the internal energy of the solid and the dissipation energy are positive definite forms, some uniqueness and continuous data dependence results are presented. Also, some estimates which describe the time behaviour of solution are established, provided the above two energies are positive definite forms. These estimates are used to prove that for the linearized equations, in the absence of <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> and for null boundary conditions, the solution is asymptotically stable. Then a uniqueness result under mild assumptions on the constitutive constants is given using the Lagrange–Brun identities method.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of {{a model of a}} standard size body in combination with a representative 45 deg swept-wing-fuselage model has been conducted in the Langley 8 -foot transonic pressure tunnel over a Mach number range from 0. 80 to 1. 43. The body, with a fineness ratio of 8. 5, was tested with and without fins, and was pylon-mounted beneath the fuselage or wing. Force measurements were obtained on the wing-fuselage model with and without the body, for an angle-of-attack range from - 2 deg to approximately 12 deg and an angle-of-sideslip range from - 8 deg to 8 deg. In addition, <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> were measured over the same angle-of-attack and angle-of-sideslip range. The Reynolds number for the investigation, based on the wing mean aerodynamic chord, varied from 1. 85 x 10 (exp 6) to 2. 85 x 10 (exp 6). The addition of the body beneath the fuselage or the wing increased the drag coefficient of the complete model over the Mach number range tested. On the basis of the drag increase per body, the under-fuselage position was the more favorable. Furthermore, the bodies tended to increase the lateral stability of the complete model. The variation of <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> with angle of attack for the unfinned bodies was generally small and linear over the Mach number range tested with the addition of fins causing large increases in the rates of change of normal-force coefficient and nose-down pitching-moment coefficient. The variation of body side-force coefficient with sideslip for the unfinned body beneath the fuselage was at least twice as large as the variation of this load for the unfinned body beneath the wing. The addition of fins to the body beneath either the fuselage or the wing approximately doubled the rate of change of body side-force coefficient with sideslip. Furthermore, the variation of body side-force coefficient with sideslip for the body beneath the wing was at least twice as large as the variation of this load with angle of attack...|$|E

40|$|The large sparse linear systems {{arising from}} the finite element or finite {{difference}} discretization of elliptic PDEs can be solved directly via, e. g., nested dissection or multifrontal methods.

METHODS: Nine subjects with PD, Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 - 3, not demented and with capability to ambulate independently took part in this study. The training program was divided into three phases (A 1 -B-A 2) : treadmill training with additional <b>body</b> <b>load</b> (A 1), control condition (conventional physical therapy group; B) and a second period of treadmill training with load (A 2).

The evaluations and the training were performed during the on-phase of the medication cycle. RESULTS: There was improvement in the total PDQ- 39 score across the training period. The subscores mobility, activities of daily living and cognition subscores significantly improved after the training period. The improvement in the total score was associated with motor and non-motor factors in all of the training phases.
