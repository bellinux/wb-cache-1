5|$|Besides championing the Southern {{cause in}} Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> state's {{support of the}} Confederacy. He presided over a {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Camp Burnett, a Confederate recruiting post two miles west of Clinton in Hickman County, Kentucky, was named after him.|$|E
5|$|Diageo {{maintained}} {{ownership of}} BK until 2000 when Diageo {{decided to focus}} solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain. In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block this because it believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands.|$|E

The troops included the 2d Anti-Tank Gun Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit.

5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} to <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> aims of Fortitude North, {{and overall}} this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by the Völkisch movement, {{the regime}} was against {{cultural}} modernism {{and supported the}} development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism.

5|$|On 8 April, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{continued}} with its limited objective attacks {{to expand their}} bridgeheads on the 4th Army front, including at Zákány.

The 36th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, which had been concentrating in the Ludbreg district northwest of Koprivnica, {{was transferred to the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska, in an attempt to <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> left flank of the divisional sector.|$|E

5|$|The Bahamas did {{not come}} under {{external}} threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 {{in an attempt to}} recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E

5|$|To <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> new amendment, Grant {{relied on}} the army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce federal laws in the South.

Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not very aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T.
