25|$|As soon as {{hostilities}} commenced in September 1965, the {{air forces}} {{of both countries}} launched attacks {{against each other in}} the eastern theater. The IAF bombed airfields and airstrips located in East Pakistan (at Chittagong, Dhaka, Lalmunirhat, and Jessore), while the PAF managed to launch two celebrated raids on the Indian Air Force base at Kalaikunda, near Kharagpur, West Bengal. The PAF raids, a five-plane strike followed up by a four-plane attack, took place on 7 September, destroying several Canberra bombers and Vampire aircraft on the ground, while the IAF claimed 2 aerial kills (Pakistani sources record 1 F-86 lost). The first PAF Kalaikunda raid (by 5 Sabres) achieved total surprise, but the second wave was opposed by Indian interceptors, leading to the loss of the aircraft. The PAF also launched attacks on Bagdogra on 10 September and Barrackpore on 14 September, with varying results. While the IAF hit <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> airstrikes <b>on</b> Dacca, Jessore, and Lalmunirhat, these failed to destroy any aircraft. Mid-air interceptions and dogfights rarely happened, and barring some skirmishing between the EPR and BSF along the border, the air forces of both countries were responsible for most of the combat activity in the eastern theater during the 1965 war. The final tally was 12 Indian aircraft destroyed on the ground (PAF claim 21 aircraft destroyed), 2 Pakistani Sabres shot down, (the PAF records one aircraft lost), and 1 PAF Sabre lost due to an accident. Following the war, the IAF continued its steady growth in combat capacity and logistical capabilities, while Pakistan boosted its squadron strength to 20 F-86 Sabres (although it neglected to expand its operational infrastructure substantially).|$|R

50|$|Though George {{rushed for}} 1,000 yards {{in all but}} one season, {{numerous}} sports writers suggested that a heavy workload caused a decline in George's productivity. In five of his eight seasons with the Titans, George carried the ball over 330 times. In 2001, George averaged just 2.98 per carry, the fourth lowest number in league history among running <b>backs</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> than 200 rushing attempts in a season. George's decline in production along with several toe and ankle injuries were contributing factors in Titans owner Bud Adams' decision to release him on July 21, 2004 in part due to salary cap considerations,after George would not agree to a pay cut.|$|R
