50|$|Two {{developments}} in the late 1980s helped in {{the rapid expansion of}} the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. The first was a change in the financing of company operations. Traditionally large firms obtained funding through bank loans rather than capital markets, but in the late 1980s they began to rely more on direct financing. The second development came in 1986 when the Tokyo exchange permitted non-Japanese brokerage firms to become members for the first time. By 1988 the exchange had sixteen foreign members. The Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange had 124 member companies in 1990. In 1990, five types of securities were traded on the Tokyo exchange: stocks, <b>bonds,</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts,</b> rights, and warrants alone.|$|R

5000|$|Price {{sensitivity}} to yield - As {{is the case}} with <b>bonds,</b> Real Estate <b>Investment</b> <b>Trusts</b> and other <b>investments</b> purchased for yield, a rise in interest rates will reduce the price that other investors {{are willing to pay for}} shares in the MIC. The degree of risk would depend upon the length of the mortgages held by the portfolio, with those focused on short-term construction mortgages having less risk than longer-term mortgages.|$|R
50|$|For {{the same}} reason, tax-exempt bonds, {{national}} savings certificates {{and other similar}} tax-privileged securities are best located in fully taxable accounts.

Individual stocks, passive index funds, or exchange-traded funds are generally regarded as tax-efficient and, consequently, better placed in taxable accounts, when more heavily taxed income generating assets, such as <b>bonds,</b> real estate <b>investment</b> <b>trusts,</b> and so on, are available for secretion in a tax sheltered location.|$|R
40|$|Reflecting the Asian {{currency}} crisis, the East Asian countries, including Japan, {{the economy}} of the region is attempting to build the strong fund channel by consolidating bond markets. On the other hand, there exists an agricultural society whose access even to commercial banks is difficult. Nevertheless, as seen in the success of Grameen Banks, and the Asian and Pacific Regional Agricultural Credit Association (APRCA), the fund channel based on market mechanism has been shaped through the intervention of NGOs, self-help financial groups, and public and private financial institutions. It seems possible that the financial system in the region has developed from microfinance into a market-oriented indirect finance system, which includes the trade of government bond, local <b>bond</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>trusts.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to consider a new type of fund channel which can adjust to households 2 ̆ 7 needs by citizen 2 ̆ 7 s participation...|$|R
