40|$|Abstract by Jason Katrina Abstract Statement: The {{purpose of}} this senior project {{is to create a}} jig that will enable a c-clamp to be locked in place while {{secondary}} machining processes can be performed. While it is held in place, a milling operation will be done to face the clamping surfaces. A separate <b>bushing</b> <b>holder</b> can be bolted onto the main mount so a hole can be drilled precisely on the threaded end of the c-clamp. To see this project through, it will require the use of engineering analysis techniques that have been learned in previous classes to find the forces applied to the c-clamp while it is held in place. The magnitude of the forces and dimensions of the C-clamp were used to develop the design of the fixture and drawn in Solidworks. After everything has been made to fit on the computer, raw material and hardware will be purchased to start the construction part of the project. The school has the necessary equipment to do all the machining operations needed for the project, so everything will be done on campus. The testing procedure involves putting the free end of the c-clamp under a pre-determined load in the x, y, and z-axes to test if the toggle clamps can hold it in place. The completed project meets all of the standards that were found in the analysis stage of the project and functions as originally envisioned. Keywords:,...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis work in mechanichal {{engineering}} performed at Volvo GroupTrucks Operations, Powertrain productions in KÃ¶ping by the student Christoffer Jansson. Thework of 15 ECTS credits is conducted over a 20 week period at half speed equivalent to 400 working hours. The background to the work is the desire to improve a workstation where the transmissions tothe IPS 2 / 3 and IPS 15 are assembled. The problem on the workstation is that the workers areperforming non value-added activities (NVAA) and it is of interest that one would examine thepossibility of how to squeeze two bearing rings in the same sequence. The aim is thus todevelop a suggestion of improvement for the bearing pressing method on the assembly line. The issue the thesis work is based on is: How does one manage to press together two bearingrings in the same sequence into a particular component? & How can one improve theergonomic circumstances on the workstation?To be able to perform this work, a case study based on the product development processaccording to Ulrich and Eppinger (2012) has been made. Product development tools are used tofacilitate the work of the student. Including Gantt chart, Pugh's analysis and functional analysis. The result of the work is a modification of the existing working table where the bearing ringsare pressed into the middle gear housing. The solution consists of a steel plate that rests on fivesprings which dampen the weight of the middle gear housing. The middle gear housing is thecomponent in which the bearing rings are pressed in. There are 5 guiding rods that are mountedon the steel plate, one for each spring, which has the function to keep the steel plate stablewhen the middle gear housing is set on top. These guiding rods are in turn controlled bybushings which serve to reduce friction. The bushings are standard components that aremounted into a component called the <b>bushing</b> <b>holder,</b> which is a component that is screwed intothe table. The new working process the solution provides eliminates the previous NVAA that has been onthe station before and allows the worker to press two bearing rings into the middle gearinghouse in the same sequence. The ergonomic circumstances have also been improved due to theelimination of the worker having to rotate the heavy middle gearing house 180 degrees. Thesolution thus meets the demands made in the report and solves the problems identified...|$|E
