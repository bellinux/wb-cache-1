The association of general names with specific countries is weaker: a drink labelled simply [...] "Sangria" [...] must have been produced in Spain or Portugal, for example, but it is permissible to label a drink [...] "Sangria produced in the United Kingdom: aromatised wine-based drink" [...] if the drink meets the other requirements to be described as sangria. Similarly, the denomination [...] "Clarea" [...] on its own is reserved for drinks produced in Spain. The protected geographical designations are: ...|$|R
50|$|Vermouth is {{the most}} widely used <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine</b> due to its use in cocktails and famous {{commercial}} brands such as Martini and Cinzano which are commonplace around the world.

40|$|The annual {{production}} of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) exceeds 100, 000 mt and is almost exclusively {{consumed by the}} brewing industry. The value of hops is attributed to their characteristic secondary metabolites; these metabolites are precursors which are transformed during the brewing process into important <b>bittering,</b> <b>aromatising</b> and preservative components with rather low efficiency. By selectively transforming these components off-line, both their utilisation efficiency and functionality can be significantly improved. Therefore, the chemical transformations of these secondary metabolites will be considered with special attention to recent advances in the field. The considered components are the hop alpha-acids, hop beta-acids and xanthohumol, which are components unique to hops, and alpha-humulene and beta-caryophyllene, sesquiterpenes which are highly characteristic of hops. status: publishe...|$|R
