5000|$|The American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 {{specifies}} {{the requirements}} for bolted structural connections. Structural bolts replaced rivets due to decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the [...] "faying" [...] surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction {{is proportional to the}} normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second type and more common connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a [...] "snug-fit". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. <b>Bearing</b> <b>type</b> connections are used in light weight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common <b>bearing</b> <b>type</b> connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.|$|E

50|$|When first deployed, CHL {{was used}} both for early {{detection}} of low-level targets, {{as well as a}} system for tracking individual aircraft over land; unlike CH which was permanently facing over water, CHL could be turned to look in any direction. This later role became outdated with the introduction of the Type 7 GCI in 1942. Electronically, the Type 7 was essentially a larger and more powerful version of the CHL concept, with a larger ground-level antenna. However, the antenna was continuously spun through a complete circle, and returns were plotted in a map-like form known as a plan-position indicator (PPI). Whereas CHL operators had to calculate a single target's position from the range and <b>bearing,</b> <b>Type</b> 7 operators saw all of the aircraft in their area simultaneously and could determine their map location directly. CHL was increasingly used purely for early warning, calling in the rough location of targets to Type 7 stations who would then know where to look. Later, 3 GHz-frequency Chain Home Extra Low (CHEL) radar were often co-sited with CHL sites, further extending detection as low as 50 feet m.|$|E

30|$|For {{the wing}} support bearings, {{vertical}} stiffness is desirable to prevent excessive deflection of the bearing {{and the corresponding}} bending of the rails. If a <b>bearing</b> <b>type</b> is selected that has different rotation capacities about different axes, the bearing should be oriented so that its largest capacity is available for rotation about the axis AC in Fig.  6, since that is the axis of applied rotation. Elastomeric bearings often provide the most economical support system and are particularly attractive when the primary axes of rotation are unclear, such as in a skewed or curved bridge. However, their vertical and rotational stiffnesses are linked, in that a high vertical stiffness requires a high shape factor, which in turn leads to a high rotational stiffness. Thus, in cases where large rotations need to be accommodated while maintaining high vertical stiffness, some other <b>bearing</b> <b>type</b> may be needed.|$|E
