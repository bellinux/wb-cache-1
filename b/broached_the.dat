5|$|Twice in May 1940 Churchill <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} {{bringing}} Lloyd George into the government. Each time Chamberlain indicated {{that due to}} their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud. However, Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} a new crusade through legates and {{encyclical}} letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice {{in the summer of}} 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in <b>the</b> <b>broaching</b> machine. <b>The</b> <b>broaching</b> machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> above <b>the</b> workholder, then lowers <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> through <b>the</b> workpiece. Once through, <b>the</b> <b>broaching</b> machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of <b>the</b> <b>broach.</b> <b>The</b> elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> through <b>the</b> workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> is raised back up to reengage with <b>the</b> elevator. <b>The</b> <b>broach</b> usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|R
5|$|For {{internal}} <b>broaching</b> <b>the</b> {{sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external <b>broaching</b> <b>the</b> sides are drafted outward, {{to make the}} pocket bigger. This draft keeps <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> from jamming; <b>the</b> draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> is pressed against the workpiece, but {{is driven by the}} tool holder.|$|R

5|$|Luther <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> {{subject with}} Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was {{simultaneously}} developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop {{spoke of the}} Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France. Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year {{for four years and}} abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state.|$|E
5|$|Robert Baden-Powell {{had become}} a {{national}} hero during the Boer War {{as a result of}} his successful defence of the town of Mafeking, which was under siege from October 1899 to May 1900. The Mafeking Cadets, made up of local boys aged 12 to 15, acted as messengers throughout the siege, and had impressed him with their resourcefulness and courage. Baden-Powell had also published a number of popular books on military scouting, including Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men, published in 1899. Though written for non-commissioned officers, it became a best-seller and was used by teachers and youth organisations. In the years after the war Baden-Powell <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> idea of a new youth organisation with a number of people, including William Alexander Smith, founder of the Boys' Brigade, with whom he discussed setting up a Boys Brigade Scouting achievement. To test his ideas while writing Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell conceived of an experimental camp, creating a program to take place on Brownsea Island during the summer of 1907. He invited his lifelong friend, Major Kenneth McLaren, to attend the camp as an assistant.|$|E

25|$|Persisting {{with further}} {{attempts}} {{to convince the}} composer, Ricordi had also <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> idea of a collaboration with Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare's Othello. Verdi admired the dramatic works of Shakespeare and had, throughout his career, desired to create operas based on his plays, although his one attempt at doing so, Macbeth in 1847, although initially successful, was not well received when revised for performance in Paris in 1865. Because of its relatively straightforward story, the play Othello was selected as a likely target.|$|E

25|$|Henry Clay had {{not taken}} his defeat in the presidential {{election}} well and was unsure on what position he could take in the tariff negotiations. His long term concern was that Jackson eventually was determined to kill protectionism along with the American Plan. In February, after consulting with manufacturers and sugar interests in Louisiana who favored protection for the sugar industry, Clay started to work on a specific compromise plan. As a starting point, he accepted the nullifiers' offer of a transition period but extended it from seven and a half years to nine years with a final target of a 20% ad valorem rate. After first securing the support of his protectionist base, Clay, through an intermediary, <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> subject with Calhoun. Calhoun was receptive and after a private meeting with Clay at Clay’s boardinghouse, negotiations preceded.|$|E
25|$|In 1849, he <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} medical reform {{in a letter}} to the lord advocate; in 1854 and 1857 he {{addressed}} open letters on the same subject to Lord Palmerston; and in 1858 a Medical Act was passed which largely followed the lines laid down by himself. As a member of the general medical council called into existence by the act, he made considerable stir in 1868 by an uncompromising statement of doctrines on medical education, which were thought by many to be reactionary; they were, however, merely an attempt to recommend the methods that had been characteristic of Edinburgh teaching since William Cullen's time—namely, a constant reference of facts to principles, the subordination (but not the sacrifice) of technical details to generalities, and the preference of large professional classes and the magnetism of numbers to the tutorial system, which he identified with cramming.|$|E
25|$|Soviet Russia {{had been}} {{attempting}} to conclude a peace since {{the spring of}} 1919. On 25 April 1919, Hungarian Communists offered to mediate a settlement between the Bolsheviks and the Estonians, but Admiral Cowan threatened withdrawal of support to the Estonians unless they rejected the Hungarian offer. The Russians then publicly <b>broached</b> <b>the</b> subject of peace talks in a radio broadcast on 27 and 28 April. On 5 June the Estonian Commune was abolished. A subsequent broadcast by the Russians on 21 July led to the British journalist Arthur Ransome sounding out the Commissar for Foreign Relations Georgy Chicherin {{on the subject of}} peace talks. As a result, the Soviet government made a formal offer for negotiations on 31 August 1919. The Estonians accepted on 4 September, and delegations started talks on 16 September. Estonia then proposed to stop the negotiations until Latvia, Lithuania and Finland have agreed to participate in joint negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear <b>broaching,</b> which is <b>the</b> more common process, <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect <b>the</b> cut. Linear <b>broaches</b> are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary <b>broaching,</b> <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of <b>the</b> <b>broach,</b> which makes it very efficient.|$|R

500|$|Rotary {{broaching}} requires two tooling {{components: a}} tool holder and a <b>broach.</b> <b>The</b> leading (cutting) edge of <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> has a contour matching the desired final shape. <b>The</b> <b>broach</b> is mounted {{in a special}} tool holder that allows it to freely rotate. The tool holder is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1°. This angle is what produces a rotating edge for <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> to cut <b>the</b> workpiece. Either the workpiece or the tool holder is rotated. If the tool holder is rotated, the misalignment causes <b>the</b> <b>broach</b> to appear as though it is [...] "wobbling", which is the origin of <b>the</b> term wobble <b>broach.</b>|$|R
