5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can <b>be</b> <b>conservative.</b> This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication as the morning partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to <b>be</b> <b>conservative).</b> On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed to go into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E

Streich returned to Germany and Generaloberst Franz Halder, the head of the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) and an acquaintance from his time at the Army Ordnance Office, soon found him a new assignment on the Eastern Front.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{follow-up}} to the IOM {{study found that}} medication errors {{are among the most}} common medical mistakes, harming at least 1.5 million people every year.

The report stated that these are likely to <b>be</b> <b>conservative</b> estimates. In 2000 alone, the extra medical costs incurred by preventable drug-related injuries approximated $887 millionand the study looked only at injuries sustained by Medicare recipients, a subset of clinic visitors.

25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected in the mode of writing which tended to <b>be</b> <b>conservative,</b> to say the least. This {{can be seen as a}} product of the physical remove at which American poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.|$|E
25|$|To {{curb the}} rise of the liberal force in the legislature, 21 {{appointed}} and indirectly elected Legislative Council members from the functional constituencies founded the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC) led by Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive and Legislative Councils Allen Lee, which transformed into the Liberal Party in 1993. About the same time, the traditional leftists, which were now considered to <b>be</b> <b>conservative,</b> also formed in the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) led by Tsang Yok-sing in 1992. The business elites, professionals, and rural leaders also further grouped themselves in the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA) headed by Ambrose Lau in 1994 {{under the direction of the}} New China News Agency (NCNA).|$|E
25|$|While {{a recent}} Gallup survey showed mass {{affluent}} households to <b>be</b> <b>conservative</b> {{on economic issues}} while liberal on social issues, the upper middle class seems to be relatively politically polarized. In the 2006 mid-term elections both Democrats and Republicans received over 40% of the vote from those with advanced degrees and those in households with six figure incomes. While households with incomes exceeding $100,000 tend to favor Republicans slightly, {{they are also the}} only income demographic where Ralph Nader won more than 1% of the vote. Among those with graduate degrees, a smaller group than those with six figure incomes, the majority tends to vote Democratic with roughly 1% having voted for Nader in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The first inmates imprisoned on 2 September 1939 were 150 Polish citizens, {{arrested on}} the streets of Danzig right after the {{outbreak}} of war. The inmate population rose to 6,000 in the following two weeks, on 15 September 1939. Tens of thousands of people, perhaps as many as 100,000, were deported to the Stutthof camp including non-Jewish Poles and both communists and Jews from all of Europe. These totals are thought to <b>be</b> <b>conservative,</b> as it is believed that inmates sent for immediate execution were not registered. When the Soviet army began its advance through German-occupied Estonia in July and August 1944, the camp staff of Klooga concentration camp evacuated the majority of the inmates by sea and sent them to Stutthof.|$|E
25|$|The German Palatinates {{who settled}} in Pennsylvania, erroneously {{known as the}} Pennsylvania Dutch, also left their homelands {{for a number of}} reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and {{economically}} they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to <b>be</b> <b>conservative,</b> religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of major}} tourist {{destinations}} in Indonesia, especially Bali, Yogyakarta, Batam, Bandung and Jakarta, has a rather relaxed modern cosmopolitan social outlook, {{which is quite}} conducive for tourism industry. However, certain regional provinces might not {{have that kind of}} luxury, and tends to <b>be</b> <b>conservative.</b> Next to national laws, several Indonesian provinces has applied regional autonomous law, which some of them based on Islamic sharia law, such as Aceh province, and the city of Palembang. Extra caution must be demonstrated by visitors to Aceh, since the province has a rather strict Islamic-based law, enforced by Islamic religious police, called Wilayatul Hisbah. Thus, some certain normally private matters, such as beach clothing (esp, bikini), modesty issue, party and the consumption of alcohol, to a display of affections between couple, are discouraged and frowned upon, and might led to a legal problem. Carefulness and discretion is highly required, especially for unmarried couple and LGBT travellers.|$|E
