50|$|Mutually {{inconsistent}} <b>buoyage</b> systems had proliferated in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, leading to many accidents at sea. As {{chairman of the}} IALA <b>Buoyage</b> Committee, Bury oversaw the introduction in the 1970s of a standardised maritime <b>buoyage</b> systems, involving cardinal marks painted yellow and black with topmarks and lights to indicate to mariners the direction of maritime dangers, and lateral marks painted red or green to indicate whether the mark was to be passed on the port or starboard. The new standardised system was ratified in 1980, and the <b>buoyage</b> system remains in international use.|$|E

These directions are relative to the direction of buoyage; this is usually a nominally upstream direction. In a river, the direction of <b>buoyage</b> is towards the river's source; in a harbour, the direction of <b>buoyage</b> is into the harbour from the sea. Where there may be doubt, it will be labelled on the appropriate chart. Often the cardinal mark system is used instead, when confusion about the direction would be common.|$|E

50|$|Captain John Bury (28 July 1915 - 17 October 2006) was {{a master}} mariner and Elder Brother of Trinity House. He was {{involved}} in the adoption of a standardised <b>buoyage</b> system internationally.|$|E
50|$|Its {{principal}} {{work since}} 1973 {{has been the}} implementation of the IALA Maritime <b>Buoyage</b> System. This system replaced some 30 dissimilar <b>buoyage</b> systems in use throughout the world with 2 major systems. This rationalised system was introduced as a result of two accidents in the Dover Straits in 1971 when the Brandenburg hit the wreck of the Texaco Caribbean off Folkestone and sank although the wreck was accurately buoyed. A short while later the Niki also struck the Texaco Caribbean and sank, despite the wreckage being adequately marked. The combined loss of lives in these two accidents was 51 persons.|$|E
50|$|Winter buoys are {{in place}} from December 1 to March 1 every year, and placing and {{replacing}} the <b>buoyage</b> has become a very extensive operation. The spring 2011 change from winter to warm weather buoys involved replacing 136 buoys.|$|E
5000|$|The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities defines {{one system}} of marks specifying the shapes, colours and {{characteristic}} lights of buoys {{depending on their}} purpose, the IALA Maritime <b>Buoyage</b> System.

5000|$|Admiralty charts include {{information}} on: depths (chart datum), coastline, <b>buoyage,</b> {{land and}} underwater contour lines, seabed composition, hazards, tidal information (indicated by [...] "tidal diamonds"), prominent land features, traffic separation schemes {{radio direction finding}} (RDF) information, lights, and other information to assist in navigation.|$|E
50|$|The Maritime Safety Administration was {{abolished}} by {{royal decree}} of 3 October 2011. Its tasks were redistributed: pilotage service and maritime <b>buoyage</b> {{were transferred to}} the Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs, oceanography {{was transferred to the}} Ministry of Climate and Energy and hydrographic surveying was transferred to the Ministry of Environment.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{international}} agreement of 1982 implementing a harmonized <b>buoyage</b> {{system is a}} major achievemnt for IALA the Organization, through its committees carried {{out a lot of}} works in other directions resulting in innovating techniques being adopted all over the work, such as the AIS (Automatic Identification System), DGNSS (Differential Global Navigation System) and many others.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Trinity House {{initiated}} {{the debut of}} helicopter reliefs to and from offshore lighthouses, succeeding the boat reliefs. These had been susceptible to being delayed by months during inclement weather. Trinity House played a major part {{in the design of}} the IALA Maritime <b>Buoyage</b> System, laying the first buoy off Dover, watched over by representatives of 16 nations on 15 April 1977.|$|E
50|$|For {{historical}} reasons, {{two different}} schemes are in use worldwide, differing {{in their use}} of colour. Previously there had been 30 different <b>buoyage</b> systems, before IALA rationalised the system. In 1980 on a conference convened by IALA, they agreed to adopt the rules of a new combined system, which combined the previous two systems (A and B) into one system, with two regions (A and B).|$|E
50|$|Responsibilities of DaMSA {{included}} authorizing navigation {{systems and}} <b>buoyage,</b> resolving issues concerning wrecks and their salvage in Danish waters, {{and running the}} Danish Pilotage Service (Lodsvæsenet).

DaMSA was a full member of the North West Shelf Operational Oceanographic System.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{projected}} {{under the}} 1883 Plano Geral de Alumiamento e Balizagem (Illumination and <b>Buoyage</b> General Plan) for {{the settlement of}} Ponta Delgada, its construction was pre-empted by the 1902 commission, which intended {{to develop a new}} lighthouse based on modern technologies at the time. The plan called {{for the construction of a}} fourth-order lighthouse, and was projected by the commission for the area of Ponta do Albarnaz, 3 km away from the settlement, in an elevated position along the western coast that allowed visibility in Corvo and the entire northwest coast of Flores (the promontory of Ponta do Albernaz).|$|E
50|$|Icing: Ice {{cover in}} the Bohai Bay is highest in February. Shore icing extends an average of 500 m, with an average {{thickness}} of 10-25 cm, maximum of 40 cm. Drift ice extends 15-20 nm, roughly to the 10-15 m isobath. Average drift ice thickness is around 5 cm, maximum thickness is 20-25 cm. Ice flows are SE-NW, at an average speed of 30 cm/s, maximum of 100 cm/s.Icing is a regular problem for the Haihe river port area, and requires continuous clearing. Icing is not normally a navigational hazard at the seaport, except on extremely severe winters like the 2009-2010 winter (the severest in over 30 years). Seasonal <b>buoyage</b> change is necessary.|$|E
50|$|Once the Armistice {{was signed}} in 1918, many yachtsmen wasted little time in getting afloat again and as early as April 1919 Frank Cowper, {{who was then the}} Cruising Association's Local Representative at Fowey {{reported}} that many small boats were fitting out, some already being in the water. They would have found that, superficially, there had been little change during the previous five years. A few familiar landmarks had disappeared: at the mouth of some rivers with shifting bars any <b>buoyage</b> that still existed might bear little relation to the channel, but the same boats were back afloat and, as before the war, it was regarded as bad form to display the boat's name anywhere except on the jerseys and caps of the crew.|$|E
50|$|Before long, the Corporation was {{responsible}} for the licensing of mariners and pilots and for 'keeping the sea lanes' between Whitby and Berwick-upon-Tweed. At the same time, the Corporation was (and had been since its early years) active in charitable work, including provision of almshouses for aged mariners and the establishment of a school on its premises. All these activities were financed principally through the levying of duties on every ship entering the Tyne to trade - a practice which only ceased in 1861. Following the passing of the Harbour and Passing Tolls Act in that year, the Corporation began to devolve some responsibilities to other bodies; in particular, a new Board took on responsibility for pilotage on the Tyne, and a new Commission took on maintenance of the river's channels and <b>buoyage,</b> together with the Corporation's lights at North and South Shields. Newcastle Trinity House continued though to be responsible for buoys, marks and lights along parts of the coast until the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{over the}} bar and into the harbour changes {{from time to time}} {{although}} the established <b>buoyage</b> system on the channel can usually be relied on to stay constant. A look out should be made for temporary pellet buoys and beacons to show changes in the channel. 175 degrees in from the leading buoy is a large conical buoy Number 1 flashing green and the large red Number 2, can buoy flashing red on the bar itself are both visible in most weather conditions. It is advisable to make good a course between these buoys until the smaller buoys of the channel become visible, after which it is better to favour the starboard side because there is a considerable east going tidal stream across the harbour entrance from approximately two hours before every high water. From the starboard buoy No.9 known as the 'Knock', the channel bends away towards the South East into considerably quieter waters. The wide sweep to the eastward just past the lifeboat house must be made with the red beacons close to port as the channel is quite narrow at this point. On passing the green buoy named the 'Pool', turn to the South West and follow the buoys to the last red can buoy (Number 14) then arc back Easterly close to the marsh edge and follow the red beacons to the Quayside.|$|E
50|$|Burry Port Lighthouse is a {{harbour light}} with a reflector, and is {{situated}} on the west breakwater of the outer harbour. It was built in 1842 and was erected {{with the permission of}} Trinity House and maintained at the joint expense of the proprietors of Burry Port Harbour and the Commissioners of the Burry Navigation. The light consists of a 24ft white painted, stone, circular tower with a black gallery and red lantern. As this was a harbour light, the annual cost of its upkeep, which cost £32 in 1844, was not met by a direct charge to shipping. However, in 1845 the superintendent of Burry Port Harbour reported that <b>buoyage</b> dues not exceeding 1d a ton had been regularly charged since the passing of an Act for the ‘Improvement of the Navigation of the Rivers Bury, Loughor and Lliedi’ on 2 July 1813.In 1995-6, Llanelli Borough Training, {{with the support of the}} Burry Port Yacht Club, restored the lighthouse and Trinity House donated a new light. The restored lighthouse is operated by Carmarthenshire County Council and was formally opened on 9 February 1996 by Councillor David T. James, the Mayor of Llanelli. The current white flashing light is visible for fifteen miles and is now an important landmark for the Burry Port Yacht Club and the Burry Port Marina. The lighthouse is accessed via the breakwater.The neighbouring small port of Pembrey Old Harbour also had a lighthouse to guide ships into port. Prior to its construction, the tall chimneys of Court Farm, Pembrey were used as a navigation aid.|$|E
50|$|Holmes on Thursday 19 August, {{the adverse}} southeasterly having eased to a breeze, around 8:00 AM entered the Vlie, using Tyger as his {{flagship}} and leaving Hampshire and Advice behind as a covering force. Normally the shifting shoals {{would have made}} an approach very difficult but Holmes had a stroke of luck. On the 17th the Dragon had taken a Danish merchantman with a Dutch pilot on board who Holmes considered more capable than Heemskerck; it also transpired {{that part of the}} <b>buoyage</b> had not been removed; this had been ordered by the Admiralty of Amsterdam but on the 18th the English were already so close that the official 'buoy man' had not dared to complete the job. Also the admiralty had some days before ordered all ships to return to the home port, at a penalty of six guilders per day, but almost none had complied; most ship-owners had explicitly given orders to stay, to be able to sail immediately {{at the end of the}} English blockade. As a result, Holmes found a fleet of about 140 merchantmen or smaller vessels at anchor — by himself estimated at about 150 to 160 —, guarded by two light frigates, the Adelaar and Tol. The Adelaar of the Amsterdam admiralty had been used as a permanent escort ship for the Vlie since 1652 and was armed with twelve cannon, all three-pounders. The crews of the ships were very confident of their ability to repulse an attack and many villagers from the islands had even brought their possessions aboard, assuming these to be more safe there than on land, where they expected the brunt of the English attack would be directed.|$|E

40|$|Native liver {{ferritin}} of Dasyatis akajei (DALF), apoDALF, and reconstituted DALF {{were employed}} to construct a ferritin reactor, respectively. An apparatus consisting of a mixer, a ferritin reactor, and a magnetic stirrer was constructed to study capacity and feasibility of trapping Cu 2 + in the flowing seawater. The experimental {{results showed that the}} numbers of trapping Cu 2 + with DALF reactor were higher than these with the reactors of apoDALF and reconstituted DALF, respectively, giving the maximal numbers of 98 +/- 5 Cu 2 + per molecular DALF in 120 h. We found that the iron layer with a high ratio of phosphate to ion {{on the surface of the}} ferritin core played an important role in increasing numbers of trapping Cu 2 +. In addition, we found two positive relations of dependence of trapping Cu 2 + numbers with the reactor on the incubation time and on the Cu 2 + concentration in the flowing seawater. Another apparatus consisting of a <b>buoyage,</b> an isolation basket equipped with griddling, and a scrolled ferritin reactor was constructed to study the feasibility of trapping Cu 2 + in the sea area. Moreover, the present studies indicated that this apparatus had been used to not only analyze and evaluate the concentration variety of various heavy metal ions such as Cu 2 + and Pb 2 + diluting by the seawater but also monitor the formation of pollution degree by various small organic molecules during the climax and the neap...|$|E
40|$|Belgium became officialy {{a federal}} state in 1993. The federal {{competence}} was reshuffeled {{and parts of}} it attributed to the Communities and Regions. Since the latter became competent in economic matters, it is mostly the redistribution of powers between the federal and regional level which is at order in this study. At first sight, a rather simple rule of thumb can be applied. All waters located on the land-side of the baseline, i. e. the low-water line in Belgium, belong to the competence of the Regions. All waters on the seaside of the baseline, on the other hand, remain a federal competence. This {{is the result of}} a basic interpretation given by the Conseil d’Etat in 1976. This body reached the conclusion that the territorial sea did not form part of the Belgian territory. Since the geographical situation is such that only one province borders the sea in Belgium, this interpretation was welcomed by the government at a time when the first steps of the federalization were being worked out. The territorial sea thus remained a federal competence, and the other maritime areas on the sea-side of the baseline followed this example. The application of this criterion of the baseline, it should be noted, sometimes leads to tensions between the federal and the regional authorities, as evidenced by the control of the quality of swimming water. But exceptions to this basic rule exist. First of all, a certain competence on the sea-side of the baseline has been attributed to the Flemish Region, such as the competence regarding pilotage, <b>buoyage</b> and towing at sea. Also the financial support of the fishing industry was regionalized. Secondly, the government has indicated its willingness to transfer certain other parts of its competence with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the territorial sea and the continental shelf. Even though this commitment was made in 1980, as of today no implementation has followed. Thirdly, new tendencies can be discerned. Recent opinions delivered by the Conseil d’ Etat, for instance, seem to establish a link between the international and external competence of the Communities and Regions. A kind, of Task Force has moreover been established within the Flemish Region with respect to the delimitation of the maritime areas with the Netherlands at the request. Of the federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the Regions have strictly speaking no competence in this area whatsoever, this development certainly contradicts the mere application of the above-mentioned rule of thumb. Fourthly, even in areas, which were transferred to the Regions, general police and shipping regulations remain a federal competence. Therefore, one can hardly consider this transfer of competence, which took place with respect to law of the sea matters in Belgium to be straightforward and well conceived according to a predetermined plan. Sometimes only accessories have been transferred, but not the essentials (ex. financial support of fisheries, but not fisheries at sea itself), at other occasions, some competence has been handed over, which should not have been touched upon ex. the custom and coastguard vessels, even though customs and police at sea remain a federal competence...|$|E
