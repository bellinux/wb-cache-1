40|$|The immunoregulatory {{cytokine}} transforming {{growth factor}} (TGF) -β 1 is secreted as a <b>biologically</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>complex</b> with latency-associated peptide, {{which must be}} modified by local factors to expose the functionally active cytokine. The epithelial integrin αvβ 6 mediates local activation of TGF-β 1 in the lung and β 6 −/− mice exhibit exaggerated pulmonary inflammation, but their response to inflammatory stimuli in the gut has not been investigated. We found that both β 6 and TGF-β 1 are constitutively expressed in the jejunal epithelial compartment in uninfected mice and during infection with the intestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. We also present data showing that β 6 −/− mice are seriously compromised {{in their ability to}} mount a mucosal mast cell response after infection, and there is a significant reduction in the expression and systemic release of the granule chymase, mouse mast cell protease- 1. Because in vitro expression of this chymase is regulated by TGF-β 1, these data indicate that in the absence of αvβ 6 epithelially expressed TGF-β 1 may not be activated, with a consequent absence of expression of mouse mast cell protease- 1 and down-regulation of the mucosal mast cell response...|$|E
40|$|Infection of mice {{with the}} {{nematode}} Trichinella spiralis triggers recruitment and differentiation of intraepithelial intestinal mucosal mast cells expressing mouse mast cell protease 1 (Mcpt- 1), which contributes to expulsion of the parasite. Expression of Mcpt- 1 is transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 -dependent in vitro. TGF-β 1, which is secreted within tissues as a <b>biologically</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>complex</b> with latency-associated peptide, requires extracellular modification to become functionally active. The integrin-ανβ 6 mediates local activation of TGF-β 1 {{in association with}} epithelia. Using T. spiralis-infected β 6 −/− mice, we show accumulation of mucosal mast cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine with minimal recruitment into the epithelial compartment. This {{was accompanied by a}} coordinate reduction in expression of both Mcpt- 1 and - 2 in the jejunum and increased tryptase expression, whereas Mcpt- 9 became completely undetectable. In contrast, the cytokine stem cell factor, a regulator of mast cell differentiation and survival, was significantly up-regulated in T. spiralis-infected β 6 −/− mice compared with infected β 6 +/+ controls. Despite these changes, β 6 −/− mice still appeared to expel the worms normally. We postulate that compromised TGF-β 1 activation within the gastrointestinal epithelial compartment is a major, but not the only, contributing factor to the observed changes in mucosal mast cell protease and epithelial cytokine expression in β 6 −/− mice...|$|E
40|$|Background. Diabetic {{nephropathy}} is {{the leading}} cause of end-stage kidney failure worldwide. It is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix accumulation. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-ß 1) is a fibrogenic cytokine playing a major role in the healing process and scarring by regulating extracellular matrix turnover, cell proliferation and epithelial mesanchymal transdifferentiation. Newly synthesized TGF-ß is released as a latent, <b>biologically</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>complex.</b> The cross-linking of the large latent TGF-ß to the extracellular matrix by transglutaminase 2 (TG 2) is one of the key mechanisms of recruitment and activation of this cytokine. TG 2 is an enzyme catalyzing an acyl transfer reaction leading to the formation of a stable e(?-glutamyl) -lysine cross-link between peptides. Methods. To investigate if changes in TG activity can modulate TGF-ß 1 activation, we used the mink lung cell bioassay to assess TGF-ß activity in the streptozotocin model of diabetic nephropathy treated with TG inhibitor NTU 281 and in TG 2 overexpressing opossum kidney (OK) proximal tubular epithelial cells. Results. Application of the site-directed TG inhibitor NTU 281 caused a 25 % reduction in kidney levels of active TGF-ß 1. Specific upregulation of TG 2 in OK proximal tubular epithelial cells increased latent TGF-ß recruitment and activation by 20. 7 % and 19. 7 %, respectively, in co-cultures with latent TGF-ß binding protein producing fibroblasts. Conclusions. Regulation of TG 2 directly influences the level of active TGF-ß 1, and thus, TG inhibition may exert a renoprotective effect by targeting not only a direct extracellular matrix deposition but also TGF-ß 1 activation and recruitment...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the ability of N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) - 3 - tri methylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), the cationically modified chitosan, to form <b>biologically</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>complexes</b> with unfractionated heparin and thereby blocking its anticoagulant activity. Experiments were carried out in rats in vivo and in vitro using the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) tests for evaluation of heparin anticoagulant activity. For the first time we have found that HTCC effectively neutralizes anticoagulant action of heparin in rat blood in vitro as well as in rats in vivo. The effect of HTCC on suppression of heparin activity is dose-dependent and its efficacy can be comparable to that of protamine-the only agent used in clinic for heparin neutralization. HTCC administered i. v. alone had no direct effect on any of the coagulation tests used. The potential adverse effects of HTCC were further explored using rat experimental model of acute toxicity. When administered i. p. at high doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight), HTCC induced some significant dose-dependent structural abnormalities in the liver. However, when HTCC was administered at low doses, comparable to those used for neutralization of anticoagulant effect of heparin, no histopathological abnormalities in liver were observed...|$|R

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 1 (FGF- 1) {{is a potent}} angiogenic and {{neurotrophic}} factor whose structure lacks a classical signal sequence for secretion. Although the initiation of these biological activities involves the interaction between FGF- 1 and cell surface receptors, the mechanism responsible for the regulation of FGF- 1 secretion is unknown. We report that murine NIH 3 T 3 cells transfected with a synthetic gene encoding FGF- 1 secrete FGF- 1 into their conditioned medium in response to heat shock. The form of FGF- 1 released by NIH 3 T 3 cells in response to increased temperature (42 degrees C, 2 hr) in vitro is not biologically active and does not associate with either heparin or the extracellular NIH 3 T 3 monolayer matrix. However, {{it was possible to}} derive biologically active FGF- 1 from the conditioned medium of heat-shocked NIH 3 T 3 cell transfectants by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The form of FGF- 1 exposed by ammonium sulfate fractionation is similar in size to cytosolic FGF- 1 and can bind and be eluted from immobilized heparin similarly to the recombinant human FGF- 1 polypeptide. Further, the release of FGF- 1 by NIH 3 T 3 cell transfectants in response to heat shock is reduced significantly by both actinomycin D and cycloheximide. These data indicate that increased temperature may upregulate the expression of a factor responsible for the secretion of FGF- 1 as a <b>biologically</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>complex</b> that requires an activation step to exhibit the biological activity of the extracellular polypeptide mitogen...|$|E

40|$|The {{thioredoxin}} (Trx) fold {{is a small}} monomeric domain that is {{ubiquitous in}} redox-active enzymes. Trxs are characterized by a typical WCGPC active-site sequence motif. A single active-site mutation of the tryptophan to an alanine in Staphylococcus aureus Trx converts the oxidized protein into a <b>biologically</b> <b>inactive</b> domain-swapped dimer. While the monomeric protein unfolds reversibly in a two-state manner, the oxidized dimeric form is kinetically stable and converts to the monomeric form upon refolding. After reduction, the half-life of the dimer decreases many orders of magnitude to approximately 4. 3 h, indicating that the active-site disulfide between Cys 29 and Cys 32 is an important determinant for the kinetics of unfolding.
