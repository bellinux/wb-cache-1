5|$|Henson's 1960s {{talk show}} {{appearances}} culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog.

Henson was so grateful for this <b>break</b> <b>that</b> he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966.

Compton's next over was more potent; he deceived Morris, who danced down the pitch {{and missed the}} ball, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. At the time, Morris was on 32 and Australia at 55/0. Laker beat Morris in the next over with an off <b>break</b> <b>that</b> spun a foot, and in the succeeding over, Hassett was dismissed by Compton with the score at 57.

He managed to persuade FC Red Bull Salzburg's manager Giovanni Trapattoni of his football skills and he signed a two-year contract with the Austrian club. After the signing of his contract {{he was sent to}} Red Bull Salzburg Juniors to get playing time. There he made his debut in a 5–1 away defeat by FK Austria Wien II.

He scored his first goal for his team in an 1–3 away win against DSV Leoben in the 70th minute after an assist by Öbster. In his next match Ngwat-Mahop scored once, in a 2–1 home win against Austria Lustenau. On 26 October, he netted a goal in the 80th minute of a 2–0 home win against Bad Aussee, to put the game beyond any doubt. In the next match against SK Schwadorf he proved himself a prolific forward by scoring the opening goal of the match, in the first minute, and serving the second to his teammate David Witteveen. Red Bull Salzburg Juniors finally lost the game by a 3–2 scoreline. Ngwat-Mahop continued scoring for his team in 2–1 home win against FK Austria Wien II, by scoring the opening goal of the match. Ngwat-Mahop featured in 13 matches and scored five goals for Red Bull Salzburg Juniors until the winter <b>break.</b> <b>That</b> resulted in him being called to play with FC Red Bull Salzburg's first team. After playing in some friendly matches with Red Bull Salzburg during the winter break, he made his league debut for the club on 23 February 2008, in a 3–1 away defeat from Austria Wien, as he replaced Alexander Zickler in the 52nd minute.

5|$|On 1 July 1916, {{the first}} day of the Battle of the Somme, the British Army endured the bloodiest day in its history, {{suffering}} 57,470 casualties and 19,240 dead; nine Victoria Crosses were awarded for action on that day. Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men. The war was not just fought on land; the First World War saw major naval battles as well as the first large-scale use of military aircraft. The war at sea was mainly characterised by the efforts of the Allied Powers in blockading the Central Powers by sea. In return, the Central Powers attempted to <b>break</b> <b>that</b> blockade and establish an effective blockade of the British Isles and France with U-boats and raiders. The largest naval battle of the First World War was the Battle of Jutland which was the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war. Four Victoria Crosses were awarded for action at Jutland. The war in the air saw 19 VCs being awarded to airmen. The First World War saw significant interest in flying aces, including the German Manfred von Richthofen—also known as The Red Baron—as well as British aces such as Albert Ball, Mick Mannock and Billy Bishop, who were all Victoria Cross recipients. Hostilities ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice Treaty in the Compiègne Forest, but the war was not officially over until the various peace treaties were signed in 1919. By the war's end, four major imperial powers – Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire—had been militarily and politically defeated, and the latter two ceased to exist as autonomous entities. Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilised from 1914–1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.|$|E
