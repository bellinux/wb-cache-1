5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> up to five minutes, its dives {{typically}} last about one minute {{and no more than}} four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E
5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> long and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E

5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
25|$|Breaths are {{classified}} as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.|$|E
25|$|Less common {{are closed}} circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which unlike {{open-circuit}} sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process {{all or part}} of each exhaled <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver.|$|E

25|$|Tetrachloroethylene {{exposure}} can {{be evaluated}} by a breath test, analogous to breath-alcohol measurements. Because it {{is stored in}} the body's fat and slowly released into the bloodstream, tetrachloroethylene can be detected in the <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> weeks following a heavy exposure. Tetrachloroethylene and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a breakdown product of tetrachloroethylene, can be detected in the blood.|$|E

5000|$|Bystanders without medical {{training}} who see an individual suddenly collapse should {{call for help}} and begin chest compressions immediately. The American Heart Association currently supports [...] "Hands-only"™ CPR, which advocates chest compressions without rescue <b>breaths</b> <b>for</b> teens or adults. This is to minimize the reluctance to start CPR due to concern for having to provide mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{respiratory}} rate {{in humans}} is measured {{when a person}} is at rest and involves counting the number of <b>breaths</b> <b>for</b> one minute by counting how many times the chest rises.

25|$|Myoglobin is {{the primary}} oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues.

Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures {{for hours in}} the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie {{for over an hour}} in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even trained himself to hold his <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Vampire is a 1985 Hong Kong comedy horror film {{directed}} by Ricky Lau in his directorial debut, and also produced by Sammo Hung. The film's {{box office success}} {{led to the creation}} of a Mr. Vampire franchise, with the release of four sequels {{directed by}} Ricky Lau from 1986 to 1992, and subsequent similarly themed films with different directors released between 1987 and 1991. The vampire of the film is based on the jiangshi, the hopping corpses of Chinese folklore. The film was released under the Chinese title 暫時停止呼吸 (literally: Hold Your <b>Breath</b> <b>for</b> a Moment) in Taiwan. The film was the breakthrough success of the jiangshi genre, a trend popular in Hong Kong during the 1980s, and established many of the genre's recognisable tropes.|$|E

25|$|Loons fly strongly, {{though they}} have high wing-loading (mass to wing area ratio), which complicates takeoff. Indeed, most species must run upwind across the water's surface with wings {{flapping}} to generate sufficient lift to take flight. Only the red-throated loon (G. stellata) can take off from land. Once airborne, loons are capable of long flights during migration. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, who have implanted satellite transmitters in some individuals, have recorded daily flights of up to 1078km in a 24-hour period, which probably resulted from single movements. North European loons migrate primarily via the South Baltic and directly over land to the Black Sea or Mediterranean. Loons can live as long as 30 years and can hold their <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> as long as 90 seconds while underwater.|$|E
500|$|Swimming {{and diving}} {{crocodilians}} appear {{to rely on}} lung volume more for buoyancy than oxygen storage. Just before diving, the animal exhales to reduce its lung volume and achieve negative buoyancy. When submerging, the nostrils of a crocodilian shut tight. All species have a palatal valve, a membranous flap of skin {{at the back of}} the oral cavity that prevents water from flowing into the throat, oesophagus, and trachea. This enables them to open their mouths underwater without drowning. Crocodilians typically remain underwater for fifteen minutes or less at a time, but some can hold their <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> up to two hours under ideal conditions. The maximum diving depth is unknown, but crocodiles can dive to at least [...]|$|E

500|$|The {{death of}} Admiral Horatio D'Ascoyne was {{inspired}} by the collision between HMS Victoria and HMS Camperdown off Tripoli in 1893 because of an order given by Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon.

While filming the scene Hamer asked Guinness if he could hold his pose—a salute, facing the camera while the water rose around him—so that the water went over his head; Hamer wanted to show the admiral's cap floating on the surface. Guinness agreed, telling Hamer that as he practiced yoga, he could hold his <b>breath</b> <b>for</b> four minutes.
