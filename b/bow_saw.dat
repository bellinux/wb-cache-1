50|$|The <b>Bow</b> <b>Saw</b> {{event is}} most {{typically}} {{run as a}} singles or as a team event. A 36-inch <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> fitted with a competition-grade peg and raker blade is most frequently used. In a singles event, a competitor is typically asked to cut a series of thin slices, called cookies, from a log, which is chained down to a stanchion. Each disk of wood sawn must be complete, or a penalty is assessed. As a team event, each member cuts one or two disks, and team members switch after completing their cuts. This event is scored for total time to complete all cuts.|$|E
50|$|This variant {{begins in}} a similar way to the jig sawing, with the {{assistant}} lying on a table and having a frame fixed over her midriff. The magician then presents a <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> and proceeds to saw through the assistant, with the blade guided within the frame. Once the blade has apparently passed {{all the way through the}} assistant the frame is released and removed. It is then revealed that the assistant is encircled by the handle and blade of the <b>bow</b> <b>saw.</b> Then he/she will have a member of audience come up and look at the props.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, a <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> is a {{woodworking}} tool used for straight or curved cuts. A <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a type}} of frame saw. Its thin blade is held in tension by a frame. In English and American vocabulary it denotes a toothed blade suspended between two long narrow handles called [...] "cheeks" [...] that are supported and separated by a thin stretcher {{in the center of the}} handles, making a wide H shape (the cheeks form the uprights of the H, the stretcher the crossbar of the H). The blade is kept in tension with a turnbuckle or a twisted cord that runs parallel to the blade between the two cheeks but on the opposite side of the stretcher. If a cord is used, the cord is twisted with a toggle attached to one loop of the cord, adding tension. The toggle hits the stretcher, which keeps the cord from untwisting. A finer version of the saw uses a narrow blade (1/4" [...] or less) with handles that allow the user to hold the saw and turn the blade. In this context it is also known as a turning saw which is larger than a coping saw.|$|E
5000|$|A bucksaw is a hand-powered {{frame saw}} {{generally}} {{used with a}} sawbuck to cut logs or firewood to length (bucking). Modern bucksaws usually have a deerskin and animal bone frame ("H" [...] or [...] "C"-shaped) and a removable blade with coarse teeth held in tension by the frame. Lightweight portable or foldable models used for camping or back-packing are also available. It {{is often referred to}} as a <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> in the North American hardware market, but that term traditionally refers to a different type of saw with a wooden frame.|$|E
50|$|Shevlin was {{the home}} of the Minnesota’s Logging Championships held during a festival known as Sawdust Dayz. The {{competition}} pitted both amateur and professional loggers against one another in logging events that included log toss, log rolling, axe throw, <b>bow</b> <b>saw,</b> speed cutting, stock saw, standing block chop, two man bucking saw, power saw and the Jack and Jill Crosscut competition. Part of the Sawdust Dayz celebration included parades, bed races, the nickel pick, a variety of kids games, horseshoe competition, and a battle of area fire departments. Sawdust Dayz began in 1987 a project of SCIP (Shevlin Community Improvement Project).|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{rotorcraft}} {{were not}} wholly forgotten. In July 1754, Mikhail Lomonosov demonstrated a small coaxial twin-rotor system, {{powered by a}} spring, to the Russian Academy of Sciences. The rotors were arranged one above the other and spun in opposite directions, principles still used in modern twin-rotor designs. In his 1768 Théorie de la vis d'Archimède, Alexis-Jean-Pierre Paucton suggested the use of one airscrew for lift and a second for propulsion, nowadays called a gyrodyne. In 1784, Launoy and Bienvenu demonstrated a flying model with coaxial, contra-rotating rotors powered by a simple spring similar to a <b>bow</b> <b>saw,</b> now accepted as the first powered helicopter.|$|E
50|$|This {{event is}} run {{as either a}} doubles or team event. As a {{crosscut}} saw is a two-man saw, each cut must be made {{with a pair of}} teammates. A series of cookies are sawed off for time, as in the <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> event. The saws used for these events tend to be the most expensive individual pieces of equipment for a woodsman team, running into thousands of dollars for a competition-filed peg and raker or M tooth saw. Great pains are taken before the event is run to examine the log being cut for knots or imperfections which can damage these very aggressively filed saws.|$|E
5000|$|After his {{marriage}} to Jamison in 1994, {{the two of them}} spent one year in the Canadian wilderness to attempt a paleolithic existence. They travelled to Goldsborough Lake (...) deep in the Wabakimi, first building a tipi then an attached A-frame while using no metal, plastic, or otherwise manufactured tools. For {{the first half of the}} year, they took a store of traditional foods such as wild rice, squash, beaver and moose meat, bear fat, and maple sugar. In late September, Stroud's friends Doug Getgood and Fred Rowe brought in food for the next six months and chopped firewood for the couple. Stroud and Jamison built and equipped a winter cabin using an axe, a modern <b>bow</b> <b>saw,</b> and trapper's tin wood stove left by Getgood and Rowe, along with a metal pot they found.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lumberjack}} competition {{includes a}} series of events such as axe throwing, <b>bow</b> <b>sawing,</b> block chopping, and a Jack and Jill style cut.

50|$|Handsaws {{have been}} around for {{thousands}} of years. Egyptian hieroglyphics exist depicting ancient woodworkers sawing boards into pieces. Ancient <b>bow</b> <b>saws</b> have been found in Japan. The cut patterns on ancient boards may be observed sometimes to bear the unique cutting marks left by saw blades, particularly if the wood was not 'smoothed up' by some method. As for preservation of handsaws, twenty-four saws from eighteenth-century England are known to survive.|$|R

5000|$|To {{start when}} looking at saws {{there are a few}} types to choose from, {{including}} M-Tooth, and Peg and Raker. Depending on your skill level most beginners will start on a M-Tooth because they are a much more [...] "forgiving" [...] saw and move up to the Peg and Raker as they become better. These saws can run you anywhere from $1000 to $2500. Next are the bow saws, not like the ones you can buy commercially. These frames and blades are 42" [...] long, but for most of the <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> equipment you'll be having to look much harder to find it. Now we have the axes, {{these are some of the}} sharpest and precise tools that you'll use. There are many different grinds and makes. Some of the more popular ones are Tuatahi and Keech, but there are others starting to become more popular such as Brute Force. The racing axes will run you around $550 and practice axes around $200. As far as other equipment goes it's sometimes easier to get out there and ask around, it's not always easy to find new equipment for this sport.|$|E
40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of burning on saw mark characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start kerfs, and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start kerfs, and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start kerfs and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start kerfs and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of shrinkage. The average width of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation widths. Shrinkage did not appear to alter the crosscut saw false start kerf widths or the <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the samples. Warping did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|E
