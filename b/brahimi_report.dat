40|$|Mandates for United Nations {{peacekeeping}} operations in Africa and South America {{have become more}} robust since the delivery of the <b>Brahimi</b> <b>Report</b> in 2000.

40|$|Several {{studies show}} that despite recent {{increases}} {{in the number of}} minor conflicts, long-term trends suggest that international and civil wars are declining. Analyzing the causes of the improvement in global security since 1990, the 2006 Human Security Report argues that the United Nations played a critically important role in spearheading a huge upsurge of international conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities. Although the number of wars has decreased, far too many remain — and there are still several places of instability around the globe that could easily turn into conflict areas. In August 2000, a famous UN report, the <b>Brahimi</b> <b>Report,</b> acknowledged the shortcomings of the UN peacekeeping efforts and recommended wide-ranging reforms aimed at strengthening the operations and making them more effective.

The objective of the article is to identify areas that need attention to make peacekeeping missions more effective.

First and second generation operations would typically describe the 2 ̆ 7 classical 2 ̆ 7 UN peacekeeping mission mounted during the Cold War.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the articulation of}} the security sector reform concept in the development, peace and security communities. Overview This background paper outlines issues that emerged from research commissioned by the Australian Civil-Military Centre (ACMC) in early 2013 to map international perspectives and trends in security sector reform (SSR). The concept of SSR has evolved {{over the last two}} decades to describe a range of efforts to improve the security of a state and its citizens through an effective, affordable, accountable and transparent security sector. In all cases, but particularly for conflict-affected states, SSR is about governance of the security sector. Many Australian government departments and agencies, civil society and other organisations have contributed to SSR throughout the post-Cold War period. One trend observed in war-to-peace transitions after the Cold War is that the more expansive peace processes that follow complex civil wars still centre on first gaining agreement about future security arrangements. Some of the most common provisions in peace agreements include restructuring the security apparatus, demobilisation, and re-establishing civilian oversight over state security institutions. These ambitious goals mean timing, sequencing and political legitimacy are critical to achieve meaningful reform within and between those institutions. Transitional political arrangements after conflict—in place until the first post-conflict elections—were shorter (under two years) in many cases in the 1990 s, and in recent coup cases. However, transitional arrangements have been in place much longer in several recent civil war cases (four to seven years). This has resulted in significant post-conflict strengthening and restructuring of armies and police forces before elected legitimate leaders and parliaments are in place, often embedding the composition of security institutions that were legacies of the conflict. Research points to a more sustainable peace if former enemies are incorporated into, and share power in, state security institutions. SSR has emerged as one element of a broader set of priorities for countries navigating their return from violent conflict. The research mapped improvements to international responses before and since the landmark <b>Brahimi</b> <b>Report</b> in 2000. This paper {{examines the}} articulation of the SSR concept in the development, peace and security communities. At the time of writing, there were five peacekeeping and five political missions with explicit SSR mandates from the UN Security Council, with the growth of political missions (Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Burundi and Nepal) a recent phenomenon. The paper discusses what SSR has come to encompass, including principles that underpin international support. Sovereignty is a fundamental principle for national actors receiving support in this area, and evaluations stress the need to be adaptable and to tailor each program. The politics of funding SSR is also examined, and found to manifestly affect how international actors support SSR. The paper concludes with a summary of the SSR community and its civilian capacity...|$|E
40|$|The Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations 2000 (<b>Brahimi</b> <b>Report)</b> {{proposed}} that the UN rely on a legal code as a potential response to problems of the kind encountered by transitional authorities in Kosovo and East Timor. These problems included limited or compromised local judicial capacity, loss {{of confidence in the}} pre-existing legal system, and the administration's lack of familiarity with local law and procedures. This research seeks to analyse the Brahimi Report's proposition in one of the two cases it refers to, relying on field work conducted in East Timor. Specifically, this paper seeks to identify the problems that were encountered by the UN justice teams and examine whether the availability of a model legal code would have significantly affected such issues. I also consider the connection between the problems encountered and the transitional authority's development and application of a mechanism for dealing with international crimes perpetrated. A final question it considers is if a model code would not have been enough to respond to the primary difficulties encountered, are there different approaches which might have been more successful, and could such approaches be useful in assisting future UN missions undertake judicial reconstruction and administration? As mentioned, the context of this research is an analysis of the UN-led judicial reconstruction and administration process undertaken in East Timor. The paper begins with a critique of the academic literature and proceeds to an analysis of research data collected over a nine-month period in rural East Timor. This data relies on firsthand observations of formal court proceedings, traditional dispute resolution procedures, the workings of the civilian police force and penitentiary system, and information obtained during 120 interviews conducted by the author. These interviews provide a unique and powerful insight into the impact that externally imposed judicial reform had on group that, while representing the principal socio-economic demographic, is often overlooked in academic studies, due to its isolation. It is this combination of academic analysis and primary field research that makes this paper an innovative and original contribution to the international legal discourse. The central argument is that the most significant problems affecting the judicial rehabilitation process in East Timor stemmed from incompatibilities between the legal models developed by the transitional administration and the legal cultures and resource endowments of East Timor. In many cases, these incompatibilities concerned provisions in the introduced law drawn from international human rights and criminal justice standards. The availability of a model legal code, based upon such standards, would not have resolved these problems. The central issue is the tension between the UN's commitment to upholding international legal principles and human rights, and the practicality and effectiveness of introducing such norms into post-conflict environments. Until this is resolved, {{the question of how to}} approach judicial administration, and how to respond when international standards are incompatible with the domestic legal tradition or national aspirations, will remain unanswered.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the United Nations (UN) role in the resolution, management and termination of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with specific reference to the UN Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). The aim emanates from the basic research question: To what extent did the deployment of MONUC contribute to the termination of internal conflict in the DRC and create conditions conducive for the holding of democratic elections? The research problem generated four subsidiary questions: Was the intention of the drafters of the Lusaka Agreement for the UN converted into a viable peacekeeping mission, especially in the early phases of the mission? Did MONUC receive adequate resources to fulfil its task, commensurate with the size and complexity of the operational theatre and its mandate? Why was a development such as the deployment of Interim Emergency Multi National Force (IEMF) in Ituri (2003) necessary, given the fact that MONUC was deployed? Were the expectations regarding MONUC involvement in the disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, resettlement and repatriation (DDRRR) programme and the domestic disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration (DDR) programme realistic? Therefore four sub-problems were addressed, namely the issue of the mission mandate; the resourcing of the mission relative to the mandate and the operational theatre; the external augmentation of the mission; and the MONUC role in DDRRR and DDR. Following a definition of the concept internal conflict and a discussion of the factors contributing to internal conflict, the theory of peacekeeping was described to determine a framework for the evaluation of the UN peace mission in the DRC, based on the recommendations of the 2000 <b>Brahimi</b> <b>Report.</b> Emphasis was placed on the mandate, force levels and composition, and operational capability. A historic overview contextualised the complex conflict situation in the DRC that the UN was required to help ameliorate. MONUC made a contribution to the termination of internal conflict in the DRC by managing the conflict in a fashion that permitted democratic elections to be held. This was achieved despite the fact that the actual deployment of MONUC (in terms of its functioning, especially regarding DDRRR) did not meet the requirements for a UN force as envisaged by the signatories of the 1999 Lusaka Agreement. The expectations of the signatories regarding DDRRR were not realistic, but the UN response in terms of the mandate and allocation of resources also fell far below what was required to establish a credible UN peace mission. The graduated approach ensured a reactive MONUC posture in the field, but the reticence to provide adequate resources in response to political and operational developments necessitated the external augmentation of the mission on two occasions. While this development brought a new facet of ‘co-deployment’ in UN peacekeeping operations to he fore, it also served to highlight the MONUC deficiencies in terms of its ‘responsibility to protect’ civilians under threat of violence. MONUC was mandated from its inception to discharge this responsibility, without receiving the necessary resources to enable the conduct of operations to protect civilians. This inability resulted in the mission lacking credibility amongst the population of the DRC. CopyrightDissertation (MSS) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Political SciencesMSSUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|More than {{a decade}} ago, the United Nations {{established}} a model for integrated missions – organising all assets under one leadership function – {{in order to facilitate}} comprehensive and coordinated mission efforts. This model creates a considerable span of control, with relatively few decision-making nodes. In turn, it requires information and decision support to reach decision-makers at the different levels of the organisation in a timely manner. One of the organisational steps taken to support decision-making was the establishment of the Joint Mission Analysis Centre (JMAC) in 2005. The All Source Information Fusion Unit (ASIFU) – an additional reinforcement to mission analysis capacity – was launched in Mali as a pilot in 2014. The purpose of the ASIFU was to provide intelligence on operational levels below the JMAC. The ASIFU was an intelligence entity {{that was part of the}} military component, under the command and control of the Force Commander (FC). This report demonstrates that the development of an intelligence community in integrated UN peace operations faces many of the challenges that other similar organisations have experienced. These include compression of organisational levels (the blurring of the lines between strategic, operational and tactical levels), challenges in disseminating and sharing products, an exaggerated and unrealistic belief in the use of technical sensors, and organisational changes that do not yield the desired results. While ASIFU is a recent invention, the introduction of intelligence structures in the UN is not new. Chesterman argued that efficient use of intelligence is a potential success factor from the strategic UN headquarters level down to the tactical level in peace operations (2006). Conversely, Dorn showed as early as 1999 the limitations of intelligence in UN peacekeeping. Ten years later, he considered that many of the same challenges remained, although intelligence, especially human intelligence (HUMINT), had been successful in supporting strong UN operations in Haiti to stabilise the gang-dominated slum areas (Dorn, 2009). Cammaert (2003) provided detailed recommendations on how intelligence in UN operations might be improved. For instance, he stressed the importance of competence standards for intelligence personnel, the utilisation of all assets and personnel for information gathering, and the reliability and consistency of the intelligence system and products. Although intelligence at all levels of the UN appears fraught with challenges, a near unanimous assessment from the existent literature is that an intelligence function is required in UN peace operations. The UN has increasingly acknowledged the need for intelligence to provide support for decision-making. As with other organisations involved in peace and stabilisation efforts, the UN needs knowledge to improve force protection, the planning of operations and the implementation of mission mandates. Two UN reports in particular have established the need for more systematic and efficient processing of information to support decision-making in UN peace operations. The so-called <b>Brahimi</b> <b>report</b> (UN, 2000) called for the increased collection and analysis of information on the relevant actors in a given mission area. Further, it stated that the UN does not have a system to process information about conflict areas – a system which covers information collection, analysis and the dissemination or distribution of products. Although the concept of intelligence in the UN has developed considerably since then, the so-called HIPPO report from 2015 (High-Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations) still called for improved support systems to enable more responsive and accountable peace operations – in other words, the UN still needs better intelligence (UN, 2015 b). So where does the UN stand in terms of effective operational intelligence? To begin to answer this overarching question, this report provides a case study of the cutting edge of UN intelligence in contemporary UN peace operations 1 – the ASIFU. First deployed in May 2014, the ASIFU was set up to support operational level decision-making in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Comprising military personnel and military resources, the ASIFU was placed under the FC in MINUSMA’s organisational chart. The ASIFU is largely based on North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) intelligence doctrine, and is currently composed of personnel and resources from NATO member, or NATO-associated, states. The core aim is to provide an efficient intelligence organisation that enables MINUSMA to protect its forces and civilians under threat and to fulfil its mission mandate. First, the report explains the role and utility of ASIFU in MINUSMA. Second, it analyses the intelligence processes in the UN mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which does not have an ASIFU. This helps provide an understanding of whether an ASIFU could also be useful there. Finally, the report evaluates how MINUSMA and UNMISS use intelligence to support the implementation of the prioritised mission mandate – the protection of civilians (POC) – for both missions. Specifically, this report tries to answer three questions: 1. How has the ASIFU affected the intelligence cycle of MINUSMA? 2. How does the intelligence cycle function in UNMISS, in the absence of an ASIFU? 3. How do intelligence units support POC mandates in MINUSMA and UNMISS? Chapter 2 defines the central concepts and describes intelligence resources in UN peace operations. Chapter 3 introduces the analytical framework – the four-phased intelligence cycle. Chapter 4 analyses ASIFU in MINUSMA, whilst Chapter 5 investigates UNMISS in order to compare MINUSMA with a UN mission that does not have an ASIFU. Both these chapters provide conclusions on intelligence resources and processes and recommendations for improvement. Chapter 6 briefly investigates how MINUSMA and UNMISS use intelligence resources to support their top priority task of POC. Chapter 7 makes recommendations on how to increase the utility of intelligence in UN peace operations. The report largely builds on information received through semi-structured interviews with UN practitioners – civilian and military – in Mali and South Sudan in June 2016. All interviewees agreed to provide information as long as they could remain anonymous. In addition, the report builds on UN policies, guidelines and handbooks, as well as other relevant literature. Both authors have previous experience with intelligence in NATO operations, and Lindboe was involved in the original construction, implementation, and deployment of the ASIFU in MINUSMA...|$|E
