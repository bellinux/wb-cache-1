Using S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 index (SPX) option prices, {{we find that}} BEX and BUX provide superior forecasts for the lower and upper partial moments of future market realised volatility, respectively.

Further, we show that BEX may be more suitable as the ‘investor fear gauge’ than VIX...|$|E
40|$|The ℎ ℎ (CBOE) SKEW {{index is}} {{designed}} to capture investors’ fear in the US stock market. In this paper we pursue two objectives. First, we investigate {{the properties of the}} CBOE SKEW index in order to assess whether it captures fear or greed in the market. Second, we introduce and compare three measures of asymmetry of the Italian index options return distribution. These measures include: (i) the CBOE SKEW index adapted to the Italian market (we call it ITSKEW) and (ii) two model-free measures of skewness based on comparison of a bear and a <b>bull</b> <b>index.</b> Finally, we explore the existence and sign of the skewness risk premium. Several results are obtained. First, the Italian skewness index (ITSKEW) presents many advantages compared to the two model-free measures: it has a significant contemporaneous relation with market index returns and with model-free implied volatility. Both the ITSKEW and the CBOE SKEW indices act as measures of market greed (the opposite of market fear), since returns react positively to an increase in the skewness indices. Trading strategies show that the Italian market is characterized by a significant positive skewness risk premium...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{longevity}} EBV of Italian Brown Swiss sires were predicted using a Weibull proportional hazards model. This trait {{was defined}} as the risk of culling from first calving. Records from 511, 596 Brown Swiss cows with first calving from 1985 to 2005 were used. The model include fixed (age at first calving) and random (sire’s additive genetic) time independent effects, fixed (herd, parity, quantile of mature equivalent deviation from the yearly herd mature equivalent average, and regression on the dynamic herd size) and random (herd-year with log-gamma distribution) time dependent effects. Predicted breeding values for functional longevity, expressed as relative risk ratios, ranged from 0. 58 to 1. 69. The EBV were standardized with mean 100 and standard deviation 12. EBV were positively submitted to Interbull trend validation procedure in order to assess EBV variation over time and the possibility of including them in the international exchange of <b>bull</b> <b>indexes...</b>|$|R

The Kansas <b>bull</b> test <b>index</b> (based 50 % on weight per- day-of-age and 50 % on test ADG) was the most significant single factor determining price in both Angus and Simmental bulls. Birth weight, final weight, and frame score were other major contributors to price in Angus bulls, whereas weaning weight ratio, birth weight, and being polled were important in Simmental bulls.

40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) publishes {{breeding}} values (BVs) for beef bulls. Historically, BVs were expressed in index form {{relative to the}} base population. Sometime ago this changed to expression in units of measurement of trait. This change occurred {{in the course of}} this project and was accompanied by some re-ranking of bulls. BVs are published for growth, carcass grades and calving traits. Growth BV is expressed as carcass weight but there is no indication if this results from higher live weight gain or from a higher kill-out proportion and there is no indication of any consequences for feed intake or efficiency. • The objectives of the project were (i) to compare progeny of bulls of high and low growth genetic index, for growth, feed intake, slaughter traits and carcass traits, (ii) to partition the extra live weight of progeny of high growth <b>index</b> <b>bulls</b> into carcass and non-carcass parts, and (iii) to partition any extra carcass weight of progeny from high growth <b>index</b> <b>bulls</b> into its component fat, muscle and bone fraction...|$|R

40|$|Selection {{differentials}} {{and selection}} indices in retrospect were calculated {{to determine the}} relative emphasis placed on production and type traits through <b>bull</b> selection. <b>Indices</b> in retrospect including only production traits indicated that, for Holsteins, fat yield was the trait most heavily selected for between 1978 and 1987, followed by protein percent and then milk yield. Fat percent and protein yield had negative index weights throughout the nine year period. In Ayrshires, similar weights were observed except that milk yield index weights were negative throughout the nine year period. It {{was found that the}} relative weight placed on type was small and did not affect the relative weights place on production traits.

40|$|Genetic {{selection}} {{strategies to}} improve longevity in Chianina beef cattle Longevity in beef cattle {{is an important}} economic trait.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate using DNA parentage testing on commercial cow-calf operations using multi-sire breeding groups to determine the associations between various traits of bulls and number of calves sired. Four commercial Saskatchewan ranches with 7 breeding groups collaborated in this study, where all potential sires and progeny were sampled to determine the sire of each calf. Expected vs observed calf {{data were analyzed using}} Chi-square analysis. In all but 2 of the 7 breeding groups, it was determined that each bull sired a different (P< 0. 01) number of calves. Age of sire was found to effect (P< 0. 01) bull prolificacy or number of calves sired. A <b>bull</b> prolificacy <b>index</b> (BPI) was developed to compare which bulls are siring more or less than expected number of progeny. All bulls were required to pass a breeding soundness exam (BSE) before breeding season, therefore weak correlations were found between scrotal circumference (R 2 = 0. 04) or percent normal sperm (R 2 = 0. 13) and BPI values. No sire match ranged from 2 - 7 % of calves tested. Testing only calves born in the 3 rd week of calving, indicated that bulls could be assigned accurately to high or low prolificacy categories, but bulls with the fewest number of calves sired could not be detected. Economic models were developed to evaluate the value of adopting parentage testing on farm using a cost benefit analysis. The model showed bulls that sired more calves had a lower cost per calf sired. Based on the model, if bulls were siring < 25 calves it would be more economical to use AI in the breeding program. The model also determined that if one bull was causing increased dystocia rates in a herd, testing calves from difficult births to cull responsible bulls did provide an economic return on investment to the operation. There is potential to increase overall bull prolificacy in a herd and increase other economically important traits by using DNA parentage to aid in sire selection...|$|R

In this study we sequenced RNA of granulosa cells collected from Holstein cows at oocyte aspiration prior to IVP, to identify candidate genes and biological mechanisms for favourable IVP-related traits in donor cows where IVP was performed separately for each animal. We identified 56 genes significantly associated with IVP scores (BL rate, kinetic and morphology). Among these, BEX 2, HEY 2, RGN, TNFAIP 6 and TXNDC 11 were negatively associated while Mx 1 and STC 1 were positively associated with all IVP scores.

30|$|Although Islamic {{funds have}} shown a massive growth {{over the past few}} decades, the {{empirical}} literature on the performance analysis of such funds is still at its initial stage. The limited literature provides somewhat mixed results regarding performance of Shari’ah screened funds/Indices compared to their un-screened counterparts. For example, Hakim and Rashidian (2002) analyzed the performance of Dow Jones Islamic Index (DJIM) against its conventional counterparts; Dow Jones world index (DJW) and Dow Jones Sustainability World index (DJS). They applied capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and reported that DJIM index has outperformed DJW but has underperformed DJS index. The same results are reported by Hussein and Omran (2005).

40|$|Breeding indices need to {{be looked}} at {{periodically}} to evaluate the objective of the breeding program. In recent times the economic perspective of the breeding program has received a higher priority in deciding breeding objectives than in the past. However, prices of input and output products are becoming more difficult to predict with increased fluctuations in most prices, which adds a level of complexity to their inclusion in the selection index. With these challenges in mind, the breeding program in a new EU country (Slovenia) was evaluated. All three national Breeding Associations joined the deliberations. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an economic selection index for three breeds (Simmental, Brown Swiss and Holstein-Friesian) in Slovenia. Because farming circumstances differ within Slovenia, differences in the production systems were also taken into account; e. g., flat land vs. hilly/mountainous areas, and for conventional vs. organic farming. Economic values (€) were calculated for milk, fat and protein yields (€/cow/year/kg), survival (€/cow/year/%survival), calving interval (€/cow/year/day), and beef daily gain (€/cow/year/kg). Economic values were calculated by changing one of these traits whilst keeping the other traits at the default level. Economic indices were calculated using a farm economic model (Moorepark Dairy Systems Model). Herd parameters (e. g., number of milking cows, replacements, young stock and calving pattern), milk production, feed requirements and ration, land use and labour requirements were re-parameterised in order to be relevant to the Slovenian circumstances. Absolute economic values were slightly negative for milk yield for all breeds (- 0. 02 to - 0. 04 € per kg milk), but positive for milk components (0. 55 to 1. 45 € per kg fat, and 2. 89 to 3. 38 € per kg protein). High absolute economic values were calculated for survival (7. 37 to 9. 55 € per %). Absolute economic values for calving interval were approximately - 1 € per day for all breeds, while the economic value for beef daily gain was 0. 14 € per kg for Brown Swiss and 0. 32 € per kg for Simmental. The constructed economic <b>indices</b> ranked <b>bulls</b> in a significantly different manner than how the Slovenian Total Merit <b>Indices</b> ranked the <b>bulls.</b> The economic <b>indices</b> were robust towards changes in prices and farming system.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} at the Massey University Dairy Research Unit to investigate the effect of genetic merit for milk fat production on the physiology and metabolism of Friesian calves. Twenty four Friesian calves divided into four groups namely High Breeding Index (HBI) heifers, HBI <b>bulls,</b> Low Breeding <b>Index</b> (LBI) heifers, and LBI bulls were challenged with four different experimental treatments, ie. fasting, feeding, intravenous arginine infusion, and subcutaneous synthetic corticosteroid injection at ten to eighteen days of age. A total of eighteen blood samples were collected from each calf through an indwelling jugular cannula and the concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, GH and cortisol were determined. Some statistically {{significant differences were found}} in plasma metabolite and hormone concentrations between the HBI and LBI groups. 1. The basal glucose concentration in HBI group was significantly higher than that in LBI group (P< 0. 05). The basal plasma insulin concentration was also significantly higher in HBI group than in LBI group (P< 0. 01). The basal GH concentration in HBI calves was higher in HBI calves than in LBI calves, but the difference was not quite significance at 5 % level (P= 0. 059). 2. Following feeding, plasma insulin and GH concentrations in HBI group were significantly higher than those in LBI group (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05 respectively). 3. Acute intravenous arginine infusion induced hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in all calves. LBI calves had significantly higher increments of plasma insulin measured as a percentage of basal levels than HBI calves. The response of GH concentration to arginine challenge differed significantly in terms of level and pattern between HBI and LBI groups, with the HBI calves having more prolonged higher GH concentration than LBI calves (P< 0. 05). 4. Subcutaneous injection of synthetic corticosteroid resulted in significant increments in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, and a significant decrease in endogenous cortisol production in all calves. (P< 0. 01, P= 0. 05, P< 0. 01 respectively). But no significant differences were detected between HBI and LBI groups. Effects of sex on plasma metabolite and hormone concentrations were also found in the present study. Plasma insulin concentration was consistantly higher in bulls than in heifers and the differences were significant at the time of fasting, after feeding, and after arginine infusion (P< 0. 01). Plasma glucose concentrations following feeding were significantly higher in bulls than in heifers (P< 0. 05). GH concentration was slightly but not significantly higher in bulls than in heifers for most of the experiment. It was concluded that differences exist in some important metabolic and endocrinological characteristics between HBI and LBI calves, and these differences could become significant under certain physiological conditions and experimental treatments such as those applied in the present study. This study also showed the promise of identifying genetically superior Friesian dairy cattle at an early age by using physiological markers. However this possibility has yet to be tested by earring out measurements on calves for which breeding index value for milk fat production will be determined by methods such as progeny test...|$|R
