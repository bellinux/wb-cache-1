Os depósitos dos traçadores foram também avaliados em plantas da cultura, utilizando-se o pulverizador de barra tratorizado, com pontas de jato plano da série 110 -SF- 03, aplicando o volume de 250 L ha- 1 de calda preparada com 0, 18 % de corante Azul Brilhante e 0, 18 % de Amarelo Saturn Yellow. Os alvos naturais utilizados foram: plantas de soja com 150 repetições; B. plantaginea no estádio de duas a oito folhas, coletadas na linha da cultura com 141 repetições; e B. plantaginea e C. benghalensis nas entrelinhas, com 150 e 50 repetições, respectivamente. Os alvos artificiais foram constituídos por lâminas distribuídas a 0, 12, 2 e 22, 5 cm da linha da cultura. Após a aplicação, os alvos foram coletados individualmente e lavados com 30, 20 e 15 mL de água deionizada, para soja, lâminas e plantas daninhas, respectivamente. Estas originaram as amostras analisadas em espectrofotômetro, estimando-se o depósito de calda em µL por planta e µL cm² de área foliar. Foram ajustadas curvas de regressão entre os depósitos unitários e as freqüências acumuladas, utilizando-se o modelo de Gompertz. As relações entre os depósitos máximos e mínimos foram de 7, 4, 10 e 6 para soja, C. benghalensis e B. plantaginea na linha e na entrelinha, respectivamente. As plantas de B. plantaginea da entrelinha receberam, em média, 34 % a mais de depósito do que as plantas da linha. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the variability of individual tracer deposits (simulating herbicides applied in post-emergence) on Brachiaria plantaginea and Commelina benghalensis infesting soybeans crop. The tracer deposits were evaluated also on the crop. A boom sprayer was used, equipped with 110 -SF- 03 nozzles and 250 L ha- 1 of a solution was applied containing 0. 18 % of each of the following dyes: FDC- 1 and Satur-Yellow; 150 soybean plants; 141 and 150 Brachiaria plantaginea plants were used as targets located in <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of <b>the</b> crop, respectively; 50 Commelina benghalensis plants located <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and 125 glass plates of 19. 76 cm² (25 in the rows; 50 and 50 at 12. 25 cm and 22. 5 from <b>the</b> <b>rows).</b> <b>The</b> <b>spray</b> deposits (mL per plant or plate and mL cm- 2) were individually estimated in each of the 566 targets by washing them in de-ionized water and measuring the concentration of dye FDC- 1 in the solutions by spectrophotometry. The results for each target type and position were expressed in an increasing order and associated to accumulated frequencies from 0 to 100 %. Regression analysis was performed according to the Gompertz model and using the individual deposits and the accumulated frequencies as independent and dependent variables, respectively. The values for ratio maximum deposit/minimum deposit were 7, 4, 10 and 6 for soybean, Commelina benghalensis and Bachiaria plantaginea in <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> average deposits were 34 % superior in the plants of Brachiaria plantaginea located in <b>the</b> <b>rows,</b> compared to <b>the</b> plants <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work shows morphometric {{characteristics}} of Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil. pruned under reforestation. The study {{was carried out}} in Catanduvas, Santa Catarina State. All trees (about 14 years old) were cultivated in soil with similar characteristics. The experiment followed a randomized block design arranged in a factorial 3 x 3 corresponding to three distances <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of trees (3, 4, and 5 m) and three distances <b>between</b> trees within <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> (2, 3, and 4 m). The trees were divided into two groups. Each group was pruned in September or in January, when the crown was 24 or 28 months old, respectively. All trees were bifurcated near the ground, and, therefore, the perimeter at this level did not show a significant correlation with the crown biomass. The comparison of basal area and number of trunks per plant at the highs of 0. 3, 0. 6, and 0. 9 m, showed that the ideal position to evaluate the trunk attributes was 0. 60 m above the ground. The basal area of the trees at this position (g 6) reduced with the reduction of <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and <b>between</b> <b>the</b> trees within <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> (P < 0. 05). The number of trunks per plant measured at 0. 6 m above the ground (Nt 6) was significantly affected by <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> plants within <b>the</b> <b>row,</b> with <b>the</b> lowest value been observed when <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> plants was 2 m. The crown diameter of the trees (Dc 8) was higher on trees cultivated under higher spacing <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> Crown length and the total high of the trees (ht) were significantly affected by <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and by <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> trees within <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> Crown ratio (Cc/ht) was only affected by <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> plants within <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> <b>The</b> degree of coverage (Dc 8 /ht) was affected by <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>rows.</b> <b>The</b> crown shape (Dc 8 /Cc) values were close to unity, since the trees showed crown diameter proportional to the crown length...|$|R
