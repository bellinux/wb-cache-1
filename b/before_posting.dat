5|$|Angle {{was arrested}} on September 4, 2011, by Virginia State Troopers for {{allegedly}} driving under the influence. Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> $2,000 bail and being released in the early morning. State police revealed that Angle's initial breath test at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not admissible and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with reckless driving. On November 8, 2011, Angle entered a plea of no contest and was fined $1,500.|$|E

During the ensuing Battle of Port Moresby, Les shot down four Japanese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Poppy interferes in Dot's {{relationship}} with her son, Nick (John Altman), telling him that his mother {{does not want to}} speak to him. She then allows Fatboy to stay with her after Tamwar throws him out. Poppy is then devastated to learn that Fatboy shared a passionate kiss with Denise Fox (Diane Parish), after hearing the pair whispering about it. She then learns that Fatboy and Denise had slept together before he was even in a {{relationship with}} Poppy. This infuriates Poppy, who storms over to the Minute Mart and confronts Denise, leading to the two women clashing in the shop. Poppy then returns home and tells Fatboy that she has forgiven him, but she needs to move away from Walford so that they can have a fresh start. Fatboy refuses to move and says he wants to end their relationship. She packs her bags and leaves Walford for Hemel Hempstead, but not <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> a letter through Ian's letterbox, detailing about his fiancée's infidelity.|$|E

5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

The following month, he began his victory string.|$|E

After a 3-game win streak, the Ambassadors would drop 11 {{straight}} games. Despite the losing, {{there were some}} bright lights. First overall draft pick Pat Peake with 39 goals & 51 assists was the team's offensive leader, figuring in over 40 percent of the team's goals.|$|E

Starting at Texas, Tracy Hines had a streak of 8 straight top-17 finishes, capped off by a 9th at IRP. He also led 2 laps at Gateway. Hines finished off the 2004 season, with a pair of 13ths and earned an 18th-place points finish.|$|E
25|$|The website {{alleged that}} Frey {{had never been}} incarcerated and that he greatly exaggerated the {{circumstances}} of a key arrest detailed in the memoir: hitting a police officer with his car, while high on crack, {{which led to a}} violent melee with multiple officers and an 87-day jail sentence. In the police report that TSG uncovered, Frey was held at a police station for no more than five hours <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> a bond of a few hundred dollars for some minor offenses. The arresting officer, according to TSG, recalled Frey as having been polite and cooperative.|$|E
500|$|Bohr {{recognised}} {{early that}} nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, {{he received a}} letter from Peter Kapitza, written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the Soviet Union. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain <b>before</b> <b>posting.</b> Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that [...] "we did not speak the same language". [...] Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: [...] "It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giuliani's critics claim he {{arranged}} public arrests of people, then dropped charges {{for lack of}} evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his public arrests of alleged white-collar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened, sparked controversy, and damaged the reputations of the alleged [...] "perps". He claimed veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of Kidder, Peabody & Co., was guilty of insider trading; in February 1987 he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company's trading floor, with Wigton in tears. Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late {{that he had to}} stay overnight in jail <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> bond.|$|E
2500|$|His {{military}} career {{was spent in}} the Military Police and attached to the second battalion, the Cameronians, starting on the 16 July 1920. [...] In spite of hailing from Bengal, his {{military career}} was mostly spent in the violent Western region of India, first taking participation in the Waziristan war in 1920. After the campaign, he {{was transferred to the}} 17th Poona Horse (Queen Victoria's Own), as an army inspector but left the military police to join the Indian Political Service (IPS) on August 1926. His first assignment was posted in Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh as an assistant commissioner <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> as political agent in Hazara in the North West Frontier Province. His commission in the British Indian Army was continuously subjected to promotion, having been promoted as army captain on 17 October 1927.|$|E
2500|$|Buxton {{started his}} career at Derby County, helping them to an 18th-place finish in the Second Division in 1959–60. Making his debut under Harry Storer, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win over Ipswich Town. He proved to be [...] "adept at holding the ball and {{bringing}} others into play." [...] The [...] "Rams" [...] then rose to 12th in 1960–61, before dropping to 16th in 1961–62. Derby finished 18th again 1962–63 under new boss Tim Ward, just five points ahead of relegated Walsall. They rallied to 13th in 1963–64, <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> ninth and eighth-place finishes in 1964–65 and 1965–66. Derby then dropped to 17th in 1966–67, just six points above relegated Northampton Town. However manager Brian Clough was not comfortable with a player splitting his loyalties between football and cricket, and so he moved Buxton on.|$|E

After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the Mana Bar, which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod. Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games. Wreden also got some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as {{at the time it was}} [...] "not the kind of scene" [...] he wanted to work in. Instead, Wreden started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of The Stanley Parable and leading towards a completely new title in the future.|$|E
2500|$|No {{significant}} preseason expectations {{attended the}} 1977–78 Texas Longhorns, {{a team that}} would produce {{one of the more}} successful seasons in Longhorn basketball history. After a one-point loss in the opening game against Southern California in Los Angeles, Texas inaugurated the $37-million, 16,231-seat Special Events Center with an 83–76 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners, the first of eight straight wins. Texas lost 65–56 to fifth-ranked, defending national champion Marquette <b>before</b> <b>posting</b> another nine straight victories, including a 75–69 upset of third-ranked and eventual Final Four participant Arkansas, with its famed [...] "Triplets" [...] (guards Sidney Moncrief, Ron Brewer, and Marvin Delph). The win over Eddie Sutton's Razorbacks vaulted Lemons' Longhorns to a No. 15 ranking in the Associated Press Poll, Texas' first appearance in the poll since a one-week showing at No. 20 in 1949, the inaugural season of the AP basketball poll. Texas would finish the regular season ranked No. 12 in the AP poll with records of 22–4 overall and 14–2 in conference play, sharing the Southwest Conference Championship with the Razorbacks. Despite the impressive season, Texas saw its hopes of playing in the 32-team NCAA Tournament dashed in a two-point loss to Houston in the SWC Tournament Final. Houston claimed the automatic bid to the Tournament, Arkansas received an at-large bid, and the Longhorns were left to accept a bid to the 1978 National Invitation Tournament. Texas would storm through the tournament to reach the NIT Championship Game against the North Carolina State Wolfpack, defeating Temple, Nebraska, and Rutgers by an average of over 17 points in the first three rounds. The Longhorns posted an easy 101–93 victory over the Wolfpack to win the NIT Championship behind 22, 26, and 33 points, respectively, from point guard Johnny Moore and 1978 NIT Co-MVPs Ron Baxter and Jim Krivacs. After the end of the 1977–78 season, Abe Lemons was named National Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Lemons remains the only men's basketball coach in UT history to earn National Coach of the Year honors.|$|E
