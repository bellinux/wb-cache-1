25|$|Some trains still {{require the}} {{assistance}} of <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{to ensure that the}} train reaches the top.|$|R
50|$|Several sidings were {{provided}} for the stabling of <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives,</b> vital for assisting trains up the steep gradients to the station from Ilfracombe (1-in-36) or Braunton (1-in-40).|$|R
5000|$|Beccles Bank (1885-1958: {{destroyed}} by fire). Box provided {{to allow for}} <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> operation for heavy trains.|$|E
50|$|On the {{ascending}} {{grades of}} the Arlberg railway, the eastbound locomotive-hauled train often received assistance from a pilot or <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} station, sliding sheds were built {{next to the}} station. These were to store a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive,</b> to aid trains with more than 16 wagons with the {{difficult}} climb to Lindal summit.|$|E
5000|$|Eight Class EF60 {{locomotives}} {{were converted}} between 1977 and 1979 to become Class EF61-200 <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{for use on}} the [...] "Senohachi" [...] section of the Sanyo Main Line.|$|R
50|$|Wellington was an {{important}} station as it stood {{at the foot of}} a steep incline. <b>Banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} depot for the <b>bank</b> <b>locomotives</b> was superfluous after the electrification and was disbanded in September 1966. Until its demolition in the 1990s, {{it served as}} a depot of the Dresden Transport Museum.|$|R
50|$|A {{freight train}} became divided at Pendlebury, Lancashire. The rear portion {{was too heavy}} for the <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> to hold, and it was pushed back {{downhill}} and derailed by catch points, as were the wagons.|$|E
50|$|Southbound trains {{would stop}} at Wellington, where a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> would {{be applied to}} the rear of the train. This would bank the train up the {{embankment}} and through the tunnel, before releasing itself before Tiverton, where it would reverse back down the bank.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel floors between Paekakariki and Wellington were lowered so that DA class diesel {{locomotives}} could haul trains through to Wellington {{without having to}} stop at Paekakariki {{to be replaced by}} an ED or EW; the work was completed in 1967. The EWs continued to have a role in this, primarily as a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Five 6th-batch Class EF65-0 locomotives, numbers EF65 131 to EF65 135, were {{converted}} in 1990 and 1991 to become Class EF67-100 <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{for use on}} the [...] "Senohachi" [...] section of the Sanyo Main Line.|$|R
50|$|Cowlairs Bank, outside Glasgow Queen Street {{station is}} short but steep (2.4%, or 1 in 42), {{and much of}} it is in a tunnel. Cable worked until 1909, the use of <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> finally ended in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1886. Initially <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{attached}} at Paekakariki for the steep [...] "hill" [...] up to Pukerua Bay, and steam locomotives were changed there for electric locomotives to Wellington from 1940 to the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|A steam {{locomotive}} shed was {{located on the}} west side of the line just south of the station and provided <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> assistance for heavy trains up the steep 1 in 75 gradient to the nearby Shap summit. This was closed in 1968 shortly before {{steam locomotive}}s were entirely withdrawn from British Railways main line scheduled services.|$|E
50|$|The Franconian Forest line {{branches}} {{off from}} the Ludwig South-North Railway at Marktzeuln. Climbing the ramps from Pressig-Rothenkirchen and Probstzella to Steinbach am Wald the line ascends the heights of the Franconian Forest (Frankenwald). The ramps have a maximum incline of 29 ‰ and, even today, heavy goods trains require an additional <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> at the front or rear of the train.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} {{was situated}} {{almost at the}} bottom of an incline with a gradient of approx. 1 in 27 to be climbed to reach the main line with the return trains. It was often the case that the train was reversed a short distance to more level track to give it a run at the gradient and a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> provided, sometimes on damp days too.|$|E
50|$|The EF67-0s were {{equipped}} with an automatic uncoupling mechanism at the No. 1 end to enable the <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> to be uncoupled on the fly, but uncoupling while in motion was discontinued {{from the start of}} the 22 March 2002 timetable revision.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company had}} {{experience}} of both diesel and electric locomotives, having built thirty-one so-called [...] "Crocodile" [...] 2600 hp 1,500V DC electric <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1929 for India. India's National Railway Museum in New Delhi exhibits an electric locomotive from the Vulcan foundry.|$|R
50|$|By 2005, the end {{of their}} career related to the {{reorganization}} of Fret SNCF and pushed them quickly towards withdrawal. <b>Banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> became less necessary with the introduction of the more powerful Class BB 36000. If the occasion arose, a Class BB 7200 was used.|$|R
5000|$|Between [...] and Hirwaun, a {{distance}} of only 6 mi, there were: five collieries; two quarries; and one gunpowder/silica factory. Each had their own private sidings, all to be tackled over the steep Glynneath embankment, which required a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> for northbound trains to be attached at [...] During World War II, the Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Hirwaun added to both the goods and passenger traffic load.|$|E
50|$|From Page's Park {{the line}} curves north towards a summit at Red Barn. From there it descends at 1 in 60 (1.7%) before {{climbing}} again to cross Stanbridge Road. On {{the left is}} the site of Marley's Tile Works, now a housing estate, which was connected to the railway for most of its existence. The line descends Marley's Bank at a maximum of 1 in 25 (4%). Loaded sand trains to Grovebury Sidings often needed a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of speeds of 57 mph, but it {{was found to be}} unsteady at high speed due to the absence of a leading bogie on each engine unit. It could handle a load of 1245 lt t on 1 in 80 (1¼%) gradients and hauled 340 lt t up the 15 mi of 1 in 40 (2½%) gradient of the Hex River Railpass in sixty-two minutes without the help of the usual <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Steam <b>locomotives</b> {{frequently}} required <b>banking</b> {{assistance in}} getting their heavy trains up the incline, {{particularly in the}} northbound direction, which had steeper gradients. There was an engine shed at Beattock which had <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> on standby twenty-four hours per day to minimise train delays.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} one {{platform}} and a passing loop. It had a locomotive turntable, primarily for bank engines {{used on the}} steeply graded banks over the Liverpool Range to Ardglen Tunnel south of the village. Aurizon and Pacific National still use <b>bank</b> <b>locomotives</b> on some services today.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line was}} worked under {{permissive}} block regulations, {{but these were}} suspended when passenger trains were to work over the line and absolute block substituted. There was a rising gradient towards Hexthorpe Junction which if trains were heavy and had been stood in the queue from Sprotborough Junction a <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive</b> was provided. This came from Mexborough depot and was usually a J11, N5 or L3 but sometimes a G.C."Fish" [...] engine which was on shed at the time. This locomotive also was used on the [...] "Top Yard" [...] to York Road goods {{and when it was}} away from its post Doncaster's passenger pilot locomotive would deputise if required ...|$|E
50|$|Specialised types {{included}} AA8 {{which had}} a low, central body to allow forward visibility (for the <b>banking</b> <b>locomotive)</b> on the steeply-graded Pontnewynydd line in south Wales; it had an open veranda at each end. AA7 were small 12 ton vans for working over the Metropolitan Railway’s underground lines to Smithfield Market. AA4 were fully enclosed vans for working through the lengthy Severn Tunnel. Other fully enclosed vans were built for use on permanent way trains and were given diagram AA6. The next batch of permanent way vans were rated at 25 tons and fitted with ploughs to spread newly laid ballast (AA10). Diagram AA23 was the last GWR design of TOAD, and several vans from this lot of 326 never saw GWR service, having been completed under British Railways.|$|E

50|$|The 489 series trains were {{developed}} from the earlier 485 series specially for use on the Hakusan and Asama limited express services operating over the steeply graded Usui Pass (Yokokawa Station - Karuizawa Station of old JNR Shinetsu Main Line). They were designed to operate in multiple with the JNR Class EF63 electric <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Garratts were {{acquired}} {{in response to}} traffic growth over the heavy grades of the North Island Main Trunk and to eliminate the use of <b>banking</b> <b>locomotives</b> on steep gradients. However, since they proved to be unsuccessful and problem-ridden in service, they were withdrawn in 1937 and rebuilt to six three-cylinder 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives by the NZR’s Hillside Workshops.|$|R
