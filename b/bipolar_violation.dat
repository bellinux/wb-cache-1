50|$|A <b>bipolar</b> <b>{{violation}},</b> bipolarity violation, or BPV, is {{a violation}} of the bipolar encoding rules where two pulses of the same polarity occur without an intervening pulse of the opposite polarity. This indicates an error in the transmission of the signal.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{descriptions}} below, [...] "B" [...] denotes a balancing mark {{with the opposite}} polarity {{to that of the}} preceding mark, while [...] "V" [...] denotes a <b>bipolar</b> <b>violation</b> mark, which has the same polarity as the preceding mark.In order to preserve AMI coding's desirable absence of DC bias, the number of positive marks must equal the number of negative marks. This happens automatically for balancing (B) marks, but the line code must ensure that positive and negative violation marks balance each other.|$|E
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} bipolar {{encoding}} compared to unipolar is error detection. In the T-carrier example, the bipolar signals are regenerated {{at regular intervals}} so that signals diminished by distance are not just amplified, but detected and recreated anew. Weakened signals corrupted by noise could cause errors, a mark interpreted as zero, or zero as positive or negative mark. Every single-bit error results in {{a violation of the}} bipolar rule. Each such <b>bipolar</b> <b>violation</b> (BPV) is an indication of a transmission error. (The location of BPV is not necessarily the location of the original error).|$|E
50|$|The {{clock rate}} of an {{incoming}} T-carrier is extracted from its bipolar line code. Each signal transition {{provides an opportunity}} for the receiver to see the transmitter's clock. The AMI code guarantees that transitions are always present before and after each mark (1 bit), but are missing between adjacent spaces (0 bits). To prevent loss of synchronization when a long string of zeros is present in the payload, deliberate <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations</b> are inserted into the line code, to create a sufficient number of transitions to maintain synchronization; this is a form of run length limited coding. The receive terminal equipment recognizes the <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations</b> and removes from the user data the marks attributable to the <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Modified AMI {{codes are}} a digital {{telecommunications}} technique to maintain system synchronization. Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI) line codes are modified by deliberate insertion of <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations.</b> There are {{several types of}} modified AMI codes, used in various T-carrier and E-carrier systems.|$|R
5000|$|At the North American T2 rate (6.312 Mbit/s), <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations</b> are {{inserted}} if 6 or more consecutive zeros occur. This {{line code}} is called bipolar with six-zero substitution (B6ZS), and replaces 6 consecutive zeros with the pattern [...] "0VB0VB". Depending on the polarity {{of the preceding}} mark, that could be 0+−0−+ or 0−+0+−.|$|R
50|$|Reliable {{transmission}} of data using this scheme requires a regular stream of pulses; too many zero bits in succession can cause a loss of synchronization between transmitter and receiver. To ensure that this is always present, there exist a number of modified AMI codes which use judiciously placed <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations</b> to encode long strings of consecutive zeroes.|$|R
5000|$|At the North American T3 rate (44.736 Mbit/s), <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations</b> are {{inserted}} if 3 or more consecutive zeros occur. This {{line code}} is called bipolar with three-zero substitution (B3ZS), {{and is very}} similar to HDB3. Each run of 3 consecutive zeros is replaced by [...] "00V" [...] or [...] "B0V". The choice is made to ensure that consecutive violations are of differing polarity, i.e. separated by an odd number of normal B marks.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{pattern of}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>violations</b> that is {{transmitted}} {{in any given}} case depends on the line rate (i.e., {{the level of the}} line code in the T-carrier hierarchy) and the polarity of the last valid mark in the user data prior to the unacceptably long string of zeros. It would not be useful to have a violation immediately following a mark, as that would not produce a transition. For this reason, all modified AMI codes include a space (0 bit) before each violation mark.|$|R
