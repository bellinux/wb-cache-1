50|$|Several {{institutions}} {{which produce}} Braille materials distribute BRF files. BRF files are files which primarily contain Braille ASCII, but also include control characters, which affect how the Braille is printed or displayed. These files {{can then be}} <b>embossed</b> with a <b>Braille</b> <b>embosser</b> or <b>printed,</b> read on a Refreshable Braille display, or back-translated into standard text, which can then be read by a Screen reader or other similar program. Many find BRF files {{to be a more}} convenient way to receive brailled content, and it has increasing use as a distribution format.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Braille is {{a writing}} system used by {{visually}} impaired community. The <b>Braille</b> writing is <b>embossing</b> dots arranged in {{different combinations of}} three rows and two columns. <b>Braille</b> can be <b>embossed</b> only one side using Braille slate. Braille printer or <b>Braille</b> <b>embosser</b> can <b>print</b> simultaneously {{on both sides of}} a paper. Inter-point Braille document looks like having little mountains (front side embossing-recto dots) and valleys (back side embossing-verso dots). The reading finger of visually impaired will read only the bulged mountains of the Braille dots and hence only one side of the document can be read by human reading. The valleys are to be read from other side of the document. When you turn the page to read these valleys they look like mountains on that side. For human reading by visually impaired they are read separately. But when the inter-point Braille is digitized, we can recognize both sides in one scan using image processing technique. This paper presents an algorithm which analysis and recognizes both front and back embossed dots of single scanned image of an Inter-point Braille document. Algorithm uses the knowledge of Braille dot size, and dimension of the Braille cell...|$|R
25|$|A <b>braille</b> <b>embosser</b> is, simply put, {{a printer}} for braille. Instead of a {{standard}} printer adding ink onto a page, the <b>braille</b> <b>embosser</b> imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page. Some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.|$|R

50|$|Braille {{translation}} software or embedded hardware converts inkprint into braille or braille into inkprint. Usually someone has inkprint {{in a word}} processor file or at an URL and wants braille.

50|$|Contestants {{are asked}} to spell braille {{vocabulary}} words correctly. Points are earned for each correctly spelled word. Extra points are given for additionally brailling the contracted version of the word correctly.

40|$|Part 3 : Assistive Technology for Blind UsersInternational audienceUnlike sighted {{readers who}} read whole words at a glance, braille readers {{construct}} words sequentially processing them character by character as their tactual {{field of view}} is small. Using this aspect of braille reading, we conducted an experimental study to investigate whether nonsensical characters moving under the reading finger would be a hindrance in reading words. We used a prototype to display braille with a single actuator. There is a lateral presentation of text to the user using a 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>braille</b> <b>embossed</b> disc which rotates under the reading finger of the blind person. Preliminary test results indicate that users can read words even as nonsensical letters brush past the reading finger.

However, the necessary height of center of Braille is 0. 3 - 0. 5 mm. Therefore, a highly accurate bottom dead center control is needed for the press machine.
