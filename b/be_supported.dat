5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not <b>be</b> <b>supported.</b> To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease.

5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must <b>be</b> <b>supported</b> by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E

Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E
