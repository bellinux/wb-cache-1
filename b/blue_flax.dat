5|$|The {{dominant}} {{plants in}} the park include more than 100 grass species, many native to the region. Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose, mariposa lily, and <b>blue</b> <b>flax,</b> and shrubs such as sagebrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among {{the wide variety of}} grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).|$|E
60|$|He said little, {{though it}} was the last time they would gather tranquilly round his board--they were to leave for the {{railroad}} early on the morrow. A heavy melancholy oppressed him, though bright sunlight streamed into the room and an invigorating breeze swept in through the open window, outside which tall wheat and <b>blue</b> <b>flax</b> rolled away. He could not force himself to talk, though he laughed at Colston's anecdotes, and it was a relief when the meal was over. Half an hour later he overtook Muriel strolling along the edge of the wheat.|$|E
60|$|The {{days were}} {{shortening}} rapidly, {{and when the}} party reached the Grange a row of lamps were burning in the hall. The moose heads had gone, and in their place sheaves of grain adorned the walls. Between the sheaves were festoons of stiff wheat ears and feathery heads of oats, warm bronze interspersed with cadmium and silver, and garlands of dry, <b>blue</b> <b>flax.</b> All had been arranged with taste, and the new flag that draped the reading desk made a blotch of vivid crimson among the harmonies of softer color. A tall, silver lamp behind the desk threw its light on the ruddy folds, and Harding, glancing at it, felt a certain admiring thrill. That symbol was honored at Allenwood, standing {{as it did for}} great traditions, and peace and order and justice had followed it to the West, but it was not for nothing that the new country had quartered the Beaver of Industry on its crimson field.|$|E

60|$|Wal. Faith, that's true. See--as garden walls draw snails, They {{have drawn}} a hamlet round; the slopes are <b>blue,</b> Knee-deep with <b>flax,</b> the orchard boughs are {{breaking}} With strange outlandish fruits. See those young rogues Marching to school; no poachers here, Lord Landgrave,-- Too {{much to be}} done at home; there's not a village Of yours, now, thrives like this. By God's good help These men have made their ownership worth something. Here comes one of them.|$|R

50|$|Named {{after its}} protector, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the town's emblems are the native <b>blue</b> <b>flax</b> {{and the eastern}} bluebird. The <b>blue</b> <b>flax,</b> native to the countryside, is {{attributed}} many qualities both as clothing linen and for its medicinal properties. The eastern bluebird frequents the local orchards, farms, hedgerows and rock dikes {{in the area and}} is renowned for its songbird qualities.|$|E

50|$|Linum lewisii (Linum perenne var. lewisii) (Lewis flax, <b>blue</b> <b>flax</b> or prairie flax) is a {{perennial}} {{plant in the}} family Linaceae, native to western North America from Alaska south to Baja California, and from the Pacific Coast east to the Mississippi River (USDA Plant Profile: Linum lewisii). It grows on ridges and dry slopes, from sea level in the north up to 11000 ft in the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

5000|$|This plant grows {{only on the}} Elkhorn Ridge of the Blue Mountains {{in eastern}} Oregon. It occurs at {{elevations}} above 2500 meters (8200 feet). It {{can be found in}} the ecotone between the shrub-steppe habitat and subalpine woodland. Shrub-steppe is dominated by mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) and sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), and the woodlands feature white-bark pine (Pinus albicaulis) and Engelmann's spruce (Picea engelmannii). Other species in the area include Applegate's paintbrush (Castilleja applegatei), <b>blue</b> <b>flax</b> (Linum lewisii), Cusick's biscuitroot (Lomatium cusickii), goosefoot violet (Viola purpurea), mountain phlox (Phlox austromontana), and spike trisetum (Trisetum spicatum). It occurs in open areas with full sun. It does not appear to tolerate soils high in calcium.|$|E
40|$|Cyanogenic glycosides are {{substances}} {{present in}} many plants {{that can produce}} highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or prussic acid. Specific plant enzymes released when plant cells are damaged when chewed, crushed, wilted, or frozen, hydrolyze the glycosides to cyanide. At least 2000 plant species are known to contain cyanogenic glycosides {{with the potential to}} produce HCN poisoning [1 - 6]. However, relatively few of these plants are frequent causes of cyanide poisoning in humans or animals because they are infrequent food sources for humans or animals [1, 2]. Plants that have been most frequently associated with cyanide poisoning in animals are listed in Table 1 - 1. Some of these plants are grown as food sources for humans and animals, for example, sorghum (Sorghum spp.), corn (Zea mays), clovers (Trifolium spp.), and manihot or cassava (Manihot esculenta), and can be used safely provided attention is paid to the circumstances under which these plants accumulate cyanogenic glycosides. Most plant-induced cyanide poisoning in humans occurs in tropical countries where cassava is commonly used as food. The chronic consumption of poorly prepared cassava diets produces a disease syndrome in humans known as tropical ataxic neuropathy [7]. Pigs and goats have been similarly poisoned when fed cassava tubers and leaves [8]. Plants such as <b>blue</b> <b>flax</b> (Linum spp.), grown for fiber (linen) and linseed oil, will also accumulate toxic levels of HCN under the right growing conditions [9]...|$|E
