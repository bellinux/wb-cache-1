40|$|Skyrmions are topological spin textures of {{interest}} for fundamental science and applications. Previous theoretical {{studies have focused on}} systems with broken bulk inversion symmetry, where skyrmions are stabilized by easy-axis anisotropy. We investigate here systems that break surface inversion symmetry, in addition to possible broken bulk inversion. This leads to two distinct Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) terms with strengths D_, arising from Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and D_∥ from Dresselhaus SOC. We show that skyrmions become progressively more stable with increasing D_/D_∥, extending into the regime of easy-plane anisotropy. We find that the spin texture and topological charge density of skyrmions develops nontrivial spatial structure, with quantized topological charge in a unit cell given by a Chern number. Our results give a design principle for tuning Rashba SOC and magnetic anisotropy to stabilize skyrmions in thin films, surfaces, interfaces and bulk magnetic materials that <b>break</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry.

40|$|In this diploma work, two {{versions}} of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation are used to model a nonlinear layered photonic crystal system; the cubic DNLS (cDNLS) equation and the saturable DNLS (sDNLS) equation. They both have site-dependent coefficients to <b>break</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry with respect to propagation direction, as well as to describe the linear and nonlinear properties of the system. Analytical solutions taking on plane wave form are, via the backward transfer map, used to derive a transmission coefficient as well as a rectifying factor to quantify the diode effect. The effect of varying site-dependent coefficients is studied in detail. Numerical simulations of Gaussian wave packets impinging on the system, using open boundary conditions, show the breaking of parity symmetry. Evidence of a change in the wave packet dynamics occurring in the transition between the cubic and the saturable DNLS model is presented. A saturated system prevents the wave packet from getting stuck in the nonlinear lattice layers. The transmission properties were found to be very sensitive to slight changes of the system parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} two mirror images as the same picture across left-right inversions exists early on in humans and other primates. In order to learn to read, however, one must discriminate the left-right orientation of letters and distinguish, for instance, b from d. We therefore reasoned that literacy may entail a loss of mirror invariance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we asked adult literates, illiterates, and ex-illiterates to perform a speeded same- different task with letter strings, false fonts and pictures regardless of their orientation (i. e. they had to respond “same” to mirror pairs such as “iblo oldi”). Literates presented clear difficulties with mirror invariance. This “mirror cost” effect was strongest with letter strings but, crucially, it was also observed with false-fonts and even with pictures. In contrast, illiterates did not present any cost for mirror pairs. Interestingly, participants who learned to read as adults also exhibited a mirror cost, suggesting that modest reading practice, late in life, can suffice to <b>break</b> <b>mirror</b> invariance.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} observation of topologically protected edge waves in a two-dimensional elastic hexagonal lattice. The lattice is designed to feature K point Dirac cones that are well separated from the other numerous elastic wave modes characterizing this continuous structure. We exploit the arrangement of localized masses at the nodes to <b>break</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry at the unit cell level, which opens a frequency bandgap. This produces a non-trivial band structure that supports topologically protected edge states along the interface between two realizations of the lattice obtained through mirror symmetry. Detailed numerical models support the investigations of the occurrence of the edge states, while their existence is verified through full-field experimental measurements. The test results show the confinement of the topologically protected edge states along pre-defined interfaces and illustrate the lack of significant backscattering at sharp corners. Experiments conducted on a trivial waveguide in an otherwise uniformly periodic lattice reveal the inability of a perturbation to propagate and its sensitivity to backscattering, which suggests the superior waveguiding performance {{of the class of}} non-trivial interfaces investigated herein.

40|$|Classical {{turbulence}} theory {{assumes that}} energy transport in a 3 D turbulent flow proceeds through a Richardson cascade whereby larger vortices successively decay into smaller ones. By contrast, an additional inverse cascade characterized by vortex growth exists in 2 D fluids and gases, with profound implications for meteorological flows and fluid mixing. The {{possibility of a}} helicity-driven inverse cascade in 3 D fluids had been rejected in the 1970 s based on equilibrium-thermodynamic arguments. Recently, however, it was proposed that certain symmetry-breaking processes could potentially trigger a 3 D inverse cascade, but no physical system exhibiting this phenomenon has been identified to date. Here, we present analytical and numerical evidence {{for the existence of}} an inverse energy cascade in an experimentally validated 3 D active fluid model, describing microbial suspension flows that spontaneously <b>break</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry. We show analytically that self-organized scale selection, a generic feature of many biological and engineered nonequilibrium fluids, can generate parity-violating Beltrami flows. Our simulations further demonstrate how active scale selection controls mirror-symmetry breaking and the emergence of a 3 D inverse cascade.

40|$|Magnetic helix wire {{is one of}} {{the most}} simple {{magnetic}} systems which manifest properties of both curvature and torsion. There exist two equilibrium states in the helix wire with easy-tangential anisotropy: a quasi-tangential magnetization distribution in case of relatively small curvatures and torsions, and an onion state in opposite case. In the last case the magnetization is close to tangential one, deviations are caused by the torsion and curvature. Possible equilibrium magnetization states in the helix magnet with different anisotropy directions are studied theoretically. The torsion also essentially influences the spin-wave dynamics, acting as an effective magnetic field. Originated from the curvature induced effective Dzyaloshinskii interaction, this magnetic field leads to the coupling between the helix chirality and the magnetochirality, it <b>breaks</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry in spin-wave spectrum.

40|$|A pump-probe atomic parity {{violation}} (APV) experiment {{performed in}} a longitudinal electric field ⃗ El, {{has the advantage of}} providing a signal which <b>breaks</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry but preserves cylindrical symmetry of the set-up, i. e. this signal remains invariant when the pump and probe linear polarizations are simultaneously rotated about their common direction of propagation. The excited vapor acts on the probe beam as a linear dichroic amplifier, imprinting a very specific signature on the detected signal. Our differential polarimeter is oriented to yield a null result unless a chirality of some kind is acting on the excited atoms. Ideally, only the APV (⃗ El-odd) and the calibration (⃗ El-even) signals should participate in such a chiral atomic response, a situation highly favourable to sensitive detection of a tiny effect. In the present work we give a thorough analysis of possible undesirable defects such as spurious transverse fields or misalignments, which may spoil the ideal configuration and generate a chiral response leading to possible systematics.

Such structure <b>breaks</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry along the superlattice growth axis which, {{with the help}} of either a basal plane spin-orbit coupling or a spinless p+ip superconductivity, stabilizes a 3 D Dirac node. To explore this idea, we develop a 3 D generalization of Haldane model and a Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian for the two cases, respectively, and show that a tunable single or multiple Weyl nodes with linear dispersion in all spatial directions can be engineered desirably in a widespread parameter space. We also demonstrate that a single helical Weyl band can be created at the Γ-point at the Fermi level in the superconducting case via gapping out either of the orbital state by violating its particle-hole symmetry but not any other symmetries. Finally, implications of our results for the realization of anomalous Hall effect and Majorana bound state are discussed.

Recently isospin {{symmetry}} breaking {{for mass}} 60 - 70 region {{has been investigated}} based on large-scale shell-model calculations in terms of mirror energy differences (MED), Coulomb energy differences (CED) and triplet energy differences (TED). Behind these investigations, we have encountered a subtle problem in numerical calculations for odd-odd N = Z nuclei with large-scale shell-model calculations. Here we focus on how to solve this subtle problem by the Sakurai-Sugiura (SS) method, which has been recently proposed as a new diagonalization method and has been successfully applied to nuclear shell-model calculations. The isospin symmetry breaking {{is one of the}} current topics in nuclear structure physics. An asymmetry be-tween spectra of isospin analogue states with mirror pair nuclei has been extensively investigated in the upper sd− and the lower f p−shell regions [1], and in mass 60 - 70 region [2 – 6]. This asymmetry, that is, isospin symmetry breaking arises partly due to the Coulomb force and partly due to the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction.
