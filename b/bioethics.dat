5|$|In this book, Hare {{applies the}} methods of {{two-level}} utilitarianism to problems in <b>bioethics,</b> such as abortion, and the treatment of people with psychiatric disorders using behaviour control techniques.|$|E
5|$|Buildings, institutes {{and public}} spaces {{around the world}} have been named after Biko, such as the Steve Bikoplein in Amsterdam. In 2008, the Pretoria Academic Hospital was renamed the Steve Biko Hospital. The University of the Witwatersrand has a Steve Biko Centre for <b>Bioethics.</b> In Salvador, Bahia, a Steve Biko Institute was {{established}} to promote educational attainment among poor Afro-Brazilians. In 2012, the Google Cultural Institute published an online archive containing documents and photographs owned by the Steve Biko Foundation. On 18 December 2016, Google marked what would have been Biko's 70th birthday with a Google Doodle.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of his thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on <b>bioethics,</b> punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E
5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of <b>bioethics.</b> It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

The ethical dilemmas of his research are used {{as a case study}} for schoolchildren and science teachers by the Institute of Physics as a part of their formal Advanced level and GCSE studies.

25|$|In 20th and 21st centuries, Orthodox rabbis often {{engage in}} applied ethics by {{interpreting}} rabbinic law (Halakha) in responsa (formal opinions). A dominant topic has been <b>bioethics.</b>|$|E
25|$|AJOB Neuroscience, the {{official}} {{journal of the}} International Neuroethics Society, is devoted to covering critical topics in the emerging field of neuroethics. The journal is a new avenue in <b>bioethics</b> and strives to present a forum in which to: foster international discourse on topics in neuroethics, provide a platform for debating current issues in neuroethics, and enable the incubation of new emerging priorities in neuroethics. AJOB-Neuroscience launched in 2007 as {{a section of the}} American Journal of <b>Bioethics</b> and became an independent journal in 2010, publishing four issues a year.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1960s, applied ethics has {{revived the}} ideas of casuistry in {{applying}} ethical reasoning to particular cases in law, <b>bioethics,</b> and business ethics, so the reputation of casuistry is somewhat rehabilitated.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{medical ethics}} {{is one of}} the major spheres of {{contemporary}} Jewish ethics. Beginning primarily as an applied ethics based on halakhah, more recently it has broadened to <b>bioethics,</b> weaving together issues in biology, science, medicine and ethics, philosophy and theology. Jewish bioethicists are usually rabbis who have been trained in medical science and philosophy, but may also be experts in medicine and ethics who have received training in Jewish texts. The goal of Jewish medical ethics and <b>bioethics</b> is to use Jewish law and tradition and Jewish ethical thought to determine which medical treatments or technological innovations are moral, when treatments may or may not be used, etc.|$|E

25|$|Synthetic biology {{brings to}} light a number of questions, including: who will have control {{and access to the}} {{products}} of synthetic biology, and who will gain from these innovations? Placing patents on living organisms and regulations on bioengineering of human embryos are large concerns in the <b>bioethics</b> field.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{progress}} in biology urges modern societies to rethink traditional values concerning {{all aspects of}} human life. The possibility of genetic modification of human stem cells, for example, {{has led to an}} ongoing controversy on how certain biological techniques could infringe upon ethical consensus (see <b>bioethics).</b>|$|E

25|$|The United Nations International <b>Bioethics</b> Committee {{wrote that}} liberal {{eugenics}} {{should not be}} confused with the ethical problems of the 20th century eugenics movements. However that it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new ways of discrimination and stigmatization against those who do not want or cannot afford the enhancements.|$|E
25|$|The presidential apology led to {{progress}} {{in addressing the}} second goal of the Legacy Committee. The federal government contributed to establishing the National Center for <b>Bioethics</b> in Research and Health Care at Tuskegee, which officially opened in 1999 to explore issues that underlie research and medical care of African Americans and other under-served people.|$|E
25|$|Some neuroethics {{problems}} are not fundamentally different from those encountered in <b>bioethics.</b> Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of free will, moral responsibility, self-deception, and personal identity. Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article ("Key issues in neuroethics").|$|E
25|$|In <b>bioethics,</b> {{the ethics}} of cloning refers {{to a variety of}} ethical {{positions}} regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning. While many of these views are religious in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well. Human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.|$|E

25|$|Two {{intelligent}} design proponents, John H. Calvert, {{a lawyer and}} a Managing Director of Intelligent Design Network, Inc., and William S. Harris, Ph.D., co-author with Calvert of Intelligent Design: The Scientific Alternative to Evolution (National Catholic <b>Bioethics</b> Quarterly, Autumn 2003) were instrumental in pushing for the successful adoption of the new standards, including submitting a Suggested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and numerous other documents. Both are active participants in the {{intelligent design}} movement.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a debate}} within the medical and <b>bioethics</b> {{literature}} {{about whether or not}} the non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients can be regarded as euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient's circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent on the part of the patient was not considered as one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia. However, others see consent as essential.|$|E
