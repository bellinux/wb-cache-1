5|$|After Molly's father died, {{her family}} {{returned}} to Canajoharie. On September 9, 1753, Molly's mother married <b>Brant</b> Kanagaradunkwa, a Mohawk sachem of the Turtle clan. Possibly to reinforce their connection to <b>Brant</b> Kanagaradunkwa, {{who was a}} prominent leader, Molly and Joseph took their stepfather's name as a surname, which was unusual for that time.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, <b>Brant</b> had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by <b>Brant</b> and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, <b>Brant</b> prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, archaeological {{testing was}} {{conducted}} {{at the site of}} the former home of Molly <b>Brant</b> in Kingston, Ontario, in preparation for a construction project. Salvage excavations were carried out in 1989. Much of the original site of the <b>Brant</b> homestead had been disturbed by industrial activities.|$|E
5|$|Joining the Detroit {{conference was}} an Iroquois {{delegation}} headed by Joseph <b>Brant</b> (or Thayendanegea), a military {{leader of the}} Mohawks, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. <b>Brant</b> was a minor war chief when the war began, but his ability to speak English and his connections with British officials made him prominent in British eyes. When <b>Brant</b> traveled to London in 1775 to discuss Mohawk land grievances, Lord George Germain, the colonial secretary, vaguely promised him that if the Iroquois supported the Crown during the war, native land grievances would be redressed after the rebellion had been suppressed. <b>Brant</b> returned home and encouraged the Iroquois, who lived mostly in upstate New York, to enter the war as British allies. Four tribes of the Six Nations eventually did so.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, 1996 the City of Kingston proclaimed Molly <b>Brant</b> Commemoration Day. The Mohawk Nation - Bay of Quinte, the Corporation of the City of Kingston, the City of Kingston Historical Board, and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada {{had agreed}} to commemorate her life with the {{creation}} of a bust representing Molly <b>Brant,</b> along with an historic monument at the front entrance of Rideaucrest Home on Rideau Street in Kingston. John Boxtel was commissioned to make the bust. The memorial sculpture was unveiled at Rideaucrest on Molly <b>Brant</b> Commemoration Day. The commemoration began with a service at St. George's Cathedral, a traditional Mohawk tobacco burning and a wreath-laying ceremony at St. Paul's Anglican Church, and a reception at Rideaucrest. The sculpture of Molly <b>Brant</b> was unveiled in the eastern courtyard.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} during the Cherry Valley massacre or thereafter, Colonel Stacy was stripped naked and tied to a stake, {{and was about to}} be tortured and killed, as was the ritual for enemy warriors, but was spared by Joseph <b>Brant.</b> William Stacy was a Freemason; Joseph <b>Brant</b> was an educated American Indian, and had also become a Freemason. It is reported that Stacy made an appeal as one Freemason to another, thus saving his life. Colonel Stacy was subsequently taken to Fort Niagara, the Loyalist base in New York and held prisoner under Colonel Butler during the summer of 1779. At Fort Niagara, Molly <b>Brant,</b> the sister of Joseph <b>Brant,</b> was hostile toward Stacy, and wanted Colonel Butler to return custody of Stacy to the Indians. She proclaimed dreams of her and the Indians using Stacy's head in an Indian football game. Colonel Butler placated Molly <b>Brant</b> with rum and protected his prisoner. Subsequently, from late-1779 through mid-1782, Colonel Stacy was held prisoner at Fort Chambly near Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, <b>Brant</b> and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when <b>Brant</b> slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When <b>Brant</b> returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but <b>Brant</b> was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E

50|$|The bronze relief monument, {{by artist}} Carl Eldh, {{is located in}} a small park at Norra Bantorget in Stockholm, which is the {{traditional}} Social Democratic grounds of the city. Eldh started working on the monument in 1926, one year after <b>Branting</b> had died, but it was erected only in 1952. The monument shows a prominent looking <b>Branting</b> addressing a group of workers on a May Day demonstration. Several of the worker movement's pioneers are found in the otherwise anonymous crowd of workers surrounding <b>Branting,</b> including Axel Danielsson and August Palm.|$|R

5|$|A {{turning point}} came in 1777 when British forces invaded New York from Canada and laid siege to Patriots in Fort Stanwix. In August, when <b>Brant</b> {{learned that a}} large body of Patriot militia {{was on its way to}} relieve the fort, she sent Mohawk runners to alert the British {{commander}} of the danger. This information enabled a British, Mohawk, and Seneca force to ambush the Patriots and their Oneida allies in the Battle of Oriskany. The Iroquois were divided in their loyalties. The Oneida allied with the Patriots, while most bands of the other four nations allied with the British. After this battle, in which Iroquois warriors of these nations fought on both sides, the war in the Mohawk Valley became particularly brutal. The Oneida and rebel Americans retaliated against <b>Brant</b> by pillaging Canajoharie. <b>Brant</b> fled with her children to Onondaga, the central city of the Iroquois Confederacy. Her departure was so precipitate that she had to leave most of her belongings behind.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Brant's {{force was}} part of a {{combined}} British and Indian army being raised to counter Clark's offensive. <b>Brant</b> had too few men to challenge Clark, but when he intercepted messengers traveling between Clark and Lochry, he learned about Lochry's smaller group bringing up the rear. When Lochry landed to feed his men and horses, <b>Brant</b> launched his overwhelmingly successful ambush. Because Clark had been able to recruit {{only a fraction of the}} men he needed for his campaign, the loss of Lochry's men resulted in the cancellation of Clark's expedition.|$|E
5|$|When the British largely {{abandoned}} Carleton Island in 1783, <b>Brant</b> {{moved to}} Cataraqui, now Kingston, Ontario. There the British government built her {{a house and}} gave her an annual pension of £100. She was assigned Farm Lot A in Kingston Township, along the northern limit of the town. It was 116 acres, instead of the standard 200 acres, because it was encroached upon by the Clergy Reserve. In addition, <b>Brant</b> and her family received compensation from the British government for their losses in the American Revolution. Hoping {{to make use of}} her influence, the United States offered <b>Brant</b> compensation if she would return with her family to the Mohawk Valley, but she refused.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson's {{death in}} 1774, <b>Brant</b> and her {{children}} left Johnson Hall in Johnstown, New York {{and returned to her}} native village of Canajoharie, further west on the Mohawk River. A Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, she migrated to British Canada, where she served as an intermediary between British officials and the Iroquois. After the war, she settled in what is now Kingston, Ontario. In recognition of her service to the Crown, the British government gave <b>Brant</b> a pension and compensated her for her wartime losses, including a grant of land. When the British ceded their former colonial territory to the United States, most of the Iroquois nations were forced out of New York. A Six Nations Reserve was established in what is now Ontario.|$|E

5|$|Although Lochry {{knew that}} he was in hostile territory, he landed his little {{flotilla}} after two days of nonstop travel because he needed to feed his men and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh buffalo meat for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, <b>Brant</b> repositioned his men and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some of the Americans attempted to escape by boat, but <b>Brant</b> had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut off any retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for his men to surrender.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brant</b> is commemorated on April 16 in the {{calendar}} of the Anglican Church of Canada, {{as well as}} the Episcopal Church. No portraits of her are known to exist; an idealized likeness is featured on a statue in Kingston and on a Canadian stamp issued in 1986.|$|E
