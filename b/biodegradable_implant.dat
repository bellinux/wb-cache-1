40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> are {{frequently}} used for meniscus repair. Articular cartilage {{damage has been}} reported recently after meniscus repair with <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the meniscofemoral contact pressure at the posterior horn of the medial and lateral meniscus after repair of bucket-handle lacerations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were mounted in a materials testing machine (Bionix 858, MTS) which was equipped with a load cell. The quadriceps tendon was attached to a hydraulic cylinder, and knee motion was controlled via tension of the quadriceps tendon. A piezo-resistive system (Tekscan, Boston, MA, USA) measured the meniscofemoral contact pressure. Five different types of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> (Arrow, Dart, Fastener, Stinger and Meniscal Screw) and horizontal suture (no. 2 Ethibond) were tested. The knee was extended from 90 degrees of flexion to 0 degrees under a constant load of 350 N due to adjustment of the tension force of the quadriceps tendon. The femorotibial pressure and contact area were recorded at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion. RESULTS: The meniscofemoral pressure did not increase after meniscus repair with <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> or sutures. The meniscofemoral peak pressure at the posterior horn was 1. 46 +/- 1. 54 MPa in the medial compartment and 1. 08 +/- 1. 17 MPa in the lateral compartment at full knee extension. The meniscofemoral pressure increased significantly in both compartments with knee flexion from 0 degree to 90 degrees. CONCLUSION: <b>Biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> for meniscus repair do not affect the meniscofemoral pressure. However, there remains a risk of damage to the cartilage when barbed implants are used. If the implant is not entirely advanced into the meniscus, the sharp head or some of the barbs at the column of the implant may come into direct contact with the articular cartilage of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau.

Although {{they have been in}} use for four decades internationally, many surgeons in India continue to be skeptical about the mechanical strength of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants,</b> hence this study. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was done to assess the feasibility and surgeon confidence level with <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> over a 12 -month period in an Indian hospital. Fifteen fractures (intra-articular, metaphyseal or small bone fractures) were fixed with <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants.</b> The surgeries were randomly scheduled so that different surgeons with different levels of experience could use the implants for fixation. Results: Three fractures (one humeral condyle, two capitulum), were supplemented by additional K-wires fixation. Trans-articular fixator was applied in two distal radius and two pilon fractures where bio-pins alone were used. All fractures united, but in two cases the fracture displaced partially during the healing phase; one fibula due to early walking, and one radius was deemed unstable even after bio-pin and external fixator. Conclusions: Biodegradable -implants are excellent for carefully selected cases of intra-articular fractures and some small bone fractures. However, limitations for use in long bone fractures persist and no great advantage is gained if a "hybrid" composite is employed. The mechanical properties of biopins and screws in isolation are perceived to be inferior to those of conventional metal implants, leading to low confidence levels regarding the stability of reduced fractures; these implants should be used predominantly in fracture patterns in which internal fixation is subjected to minimal stress...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that laser treated magnesium-based alloys can be a {{potential}} candidate for <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants.</b> Magnesium alloys are biocompatible, lightweight and have good mechanical properties. The poor corrosion resistance of magnesium-based alloys can be advantageously used as <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants.</b> However, the key issue is that, magnesium corrosion is too high in the physiological system which deteriorates the mechanical integrity of the alloy very rapidly. This study explores the possibility of enhancing the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloy (AZ 31) through laser treatment, which has an advantage of unaltering the bulk chemical composition and thus the mechanical property is not compromised.

High pitting corrosion resistance of laser treated alloy was observed in the salt spray tests. The stress corrosion cracking resistance was also significantly higher in the laser treated alloy as compared to the untreated alloy. The higher corrosion resistance in the laser treated alloy is attributed to the fine grain size, uniform distribution of the secondary phase particles along the grain boundary and aluminium enrichment on the surface.

40|$|Interbody fusion with {{posterior}} instrumentation is {{a common}} method for treating lumbar degenerative disc diseases. However, the high rigidity of the fusion construct may produce abnormal stresses at the adjacent segment and lead to adjacent segment degeneration (ASD). As such, <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> are becoming more popular for use in orthopaedic surgery. These implants offer sufficient stability for fusion but at a reduced stiffness. Tailored to degrade over a specific timeframe, <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> could potentially mitigate the drawbacks of conventional stiff constructs and reduce the loading on adjacent segments. Six finite element models were developed in this study to simulate a spine with and without fixators. The spinal fixators used both titanium rods and biodegradable rods. The models were subjected to axial loading and pure moments. The range of motion (ROM), disc stresses, and contact forces of facet joints at adjacent segments were recorded. A 3 -point bending test {{was performed on the}} biodegradable rods and a dynamic bending test was performed on the spinal fixators according to ASTM F 1717 - 11 a. The finite element simulation showed that lumbar spinal fusion using <b>biodegradable</b> <b>implants</b> had a similar ROM at the fusion level as at adjacent levels. As the rods degraded over time, this produced a decrease in the contact force at adjacent facet joints, less stress in the adjacent disc and greater loading on the anterior bone graft region. The mechanical tests showed the initial average fatigue strength of the biodegradable rods was 145 N, but this decreased to 115 N and 55 N after 6 months and 12 months of soaking in solution. Also, both the spinal fixator with biodegradable rods and with titanium rods was strong enough to withstand 5, 000, 000 dynamic compression cycles under a 145 N axial load. The results of this study demonstrated that biodegradable rods may present more favourable clinical outcomes for lumbar fusion.
