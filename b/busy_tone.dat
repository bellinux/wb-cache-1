3000|$|The busy-signal concept [10 – 16] {{has been}} {{identified}} as an enabler for decentralised and interference aware slot assignment. Receiver feedback informs a potential transmitter about the instantaneous CCI it causes to the [...] "victim" [...] receivers, which enables the transmitter to take appropriate steps to avoid interference, such as deferring its own transmission to another chunk. Early works [10, 11] rely on dedicated frequency-multiplexed channels that carry narrowband <b>busy</b> <b>tones</b> for channel reservation. As the protocol requires the transceivers to listen to the out-of-band <b>busy</b> <b>tones</b> whilst transmitting, complex RF units are required due to additional filters and duplexers involved. This drawback is avoided in [12 – 14], where time-multiplexed busy bursts (BBs) serve as a reservation indicator for a reservation-based medium access control (MAC) protocol. By transmitting an in-band BB in an associated minislot following a successful transmission, two important goals are accomplished [13, 14]. First, the transmitter of its own link is informed whether or not the data is successfully received. Second, at the same time potential transmitters of the competing links are notified about ongoing transmissions, so that these transmitters can take appropriate steps to avoid interference. Therefore, both slot reservation and channel sensing tasks are accomplished. Furthermore, interference diversity is exploited, in the way that competing links may spatially reuse the same slot, given the interfering links are sufficiently attenuated.|$|R

An analytical framework based on stochastic geometry and higher-order statistics through the cumulants concept which captures network dynamics and channel variations is introduced. We use this framework to recover the distribution of the co-channel interference and to evaluate the system performance in terms of the outage probability and average spectral efficiency of the tagged link. Our analytical model matches well with numerical results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. When compared to the uncoordinated FDD deployment, the outage probability of the evaluation scenarios with the coordinated TDD-underlay solution is reduced by nearly 80 %, while the average spectral efficiency increases by approximately 90 % at high loads.|$|R

30|$|In this contribution, we {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} time division duplexing (TDD) mode {{as an alternative to}} underlay short-range femtocells on the uplink of legacy macrocell deployments. To mitigate the resulting co-channel interference, the underlaid femtocell tier uses a distributed mechanism which is based on regular <b>busy</b> <b>tones</b> and relies on minimal signaling exchange. Stochastic geometry is used to model practical scenarios by capturing network dynamics and channel variations. The impact of the fading correlation on the performance of the coordination mechanism is examined as well. Higher-order statistics through the cumulants concept are used to recover the distribution of the co-channel interference and evaluate the system performance in terms of the outage probability and average channel capacity. We observe that our analytical framework matches well with numerical results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the uncoordinated frequency division duplexing mode, the coordinated TDD-underlay solution shows a reduction in the outage probability of nearly 80 %, while the average spectral efficiency increases by approximately 90 % in high loads.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — On one hand, {{operation}} of wireless network protocols, such as 802. 11, relies on multiple channels, but without exploiting the multiple channels {{to increase the}} network throughput. On the other hand, the {{operation of}} previously published multi-channel MAC protocols either is based {{on more than one}} radio per node or requires node synchronization. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol that avoids these shortcomings. Our protocol uses hash functions and <b>busy</b> <b>tones.</b> The former effectively distribute the control overhead over all the channels, while the latter addresses the hidden terminal-problem and the channel rendezvous-problem in multi-channel networks. We compared our protocol with the DCA multi-channel MAC protocol and with 802. 11. Although the DCA protocol uses multiple radios per node, the performance of our protocol is comparable with DCA and outperforms the 802. 11 protocol. As a point of reference, our protocol performs three times better than the IEEE 802. 11 protocol with three channels and results in 25 % increase in throughput for a 50 -node network.

40|$|Abstract The {{application}} of directional antennas in wireless ad hoc networks offers numerous benefits, {{such as the}} extended communication range, the in-creased spatial reuse, the improved capacity and the suppressed interference. However, directional antennas can cause new location-dependent carrier sens-ing problems, such as new hidden terminal and deafness problems, which can severely degrade the network performance. Recently, a few schemes have been proposed to address these problems. However, most of these existing methods can only partially solve the hidden terminal and deafness problems. Some of them even bring significant performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol, {{in terms of the}} busy-tone based directional medium ac-cess control (BT-DMAC) protocol. In BT-DMAC, when the transmission is in progress, the sender and the receiver will turn on their omni-directional <b>busy</b> <b>tones</b> to protect the on-going transmission. Integrating with the directional network allocation vector (DNAV), the scheme can almost mitigate the hid-den terminal problem and the deafness problem completely. We then propose an analytical model to investigate the throughput performance of BT-DMAC...|$|R
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the {{incoming}} trunk circuit to control ringing and to return <b>busy</b> <b>tone.</b> 5XB uses a ringing selection switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks.

50|$|Systems {{transmitted}} {{a continuous}} tone (at 3051.9 Hz by default), called <b>Busy</b> <b>Tone.</b> A low-pass filter eliminated {{most of the}} tone from speaker audio. The tone was present through the transmission, but cut off just before the repeater dropped in order to eliminate squelch tail. There were two possible continuous tones: all radios on a single system used the same tone. These were used to distinguish between sites {{in the same way}} SAT tones were used on AMPS cellular systems. The first system in an area typically used the default tone of 3051.9 Hz, while 2918.7 Hz could be used for an additional system on the same channel(s) that might have some coverage overlap. Radios using the system had to have their continuous tone set to match the desired system and have a compatible two-tone sequence for their group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Multicast in {{wireless}} LANs (Local Area Networks) is {{very useful}} for transmitting multimedia traffic from a sender {{to a group}} of receivers. The IEEE 802. 11 WLAN MAC (Medium Access Control) layer does not support reliable multicast since, for multicast transmissions, it has no control packets such as the RTS, CTS, and ACK, which are used for unicast transmissions. Several protocols have been proposed to provide reliable multicast transmissions. However, they are not efficient for IEEE 802. 11 WLANs due to the large number of packet transmissions and the excessive control overhead caused by the use {{of a large number of}} control packets in the error recovery process. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective scheme. The proposed scheme combines FEC (Forward Error Correction) and ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) to reduce a large number of packet transmissions and to provide data reliability in the IEEE 802. 11 WLANs multicast environment. It then uses <b>busy</b> <b>tones</b> to improve efficiency by reducing the excessive control overhead. Performance evaluation is conducted using both numerical analysis and simulation. The results show that the proposed scheme has good performance in terms of normalized throughput and average delay...|$|R
30|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) are very promising techniques to exploit spatial diversity and frequency {{diversity in the}} physical layer of broadband wireless communications. However, the application of these techniques to broadband multihop ad hoc networks is subject to inefficiencies since existing medium access control (MAC) schemes are designed to allow only one node to transmit in a neighborhood. Therefore, adding more relays to increase the transmission range decreases the throughput. With MIMO-OFDM, multiple transmissions can coexist in the same neighborhood. A new transceiver architecture with MIMO-OFDM and MAC scheme is proposed in this paper. The new MAC scheme multiple-antennas receiver-initiated busy-tone medium access (MARI-BTMA) is based on receiver-initiated busy-tone medium access (RI-BTMA) and uses multiple out of band <b>busy</b> <b>tones</b> to avoid the collision of nodes on the same channel. With the proposed MAC scheme, multiple users can transmit simultaneously in the same neighborhood. Although basic MARI-BTMA shows good performance at high traffic load, to improve the performance at low traffic loads, 1 -persistent MARI-BTMA is proposed so that users can choose different MAC scheme according to the statistical traffic load in the system. In this paper, both theoretical and numerical analysis of the throughput and delay are presented. Analysis and simulation results show the improved performance of MARI-BTMA compared with RI-BTMA and carrier sensing medium access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).|$|R
