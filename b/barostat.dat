Aim: Our aims were firstly, to explore {{the relative importance of}} the amount of intestinal gas versus its distribution on symptom production, and secondly, to correlate gut motility and perception of gas loads. Subjects: Fourteen healthy subjects with no gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods: In each subject a gas mixture was infused (12 ml/min) either into the jejunum or rectum for one hour during blocked rectal gas outflow, and subsequently gas clearance was measured over one hour of free rectal evacuation. We measured abdominal perception, distension, and gut tone by duodenal and rectal <b>barostats.</b> Results: Similar magnitude of gas retention (720 ml) produced significantly more abdominal symptoms with jejunal compared with rectal infusion (perception score 4. 4 (0. 4) v 1. 5 (0. 5), respectively; p, 0. 01) whereas abdominal distension was similar (15 (2) mm and 14 (1) mm girth increment, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{portable}} flow {{board system}} {{was developed in}} the present study with the aim to facilitate lab-scale experiments of controlled atmosphere (CA) with fruits and vegetables. This sturdy flow board combines ease fabrication, low cost and gas economy. Its functionality is provided by manifolds and gas mixers. Each gaseous component is supplied by a gas cylinder through a differential valve of adjusted pressure control, generally at 6 kPa, and forced through 13 standardized restrictors coupled to each manifold output. Controlled atmospheres are then formed with one, two or three gases in 13 gas mixers affixed to the flow board base, which are further conducted through flexible tubes to storage mini-chambers that {{can also be used to}} study metabolic consumption and production of gaseous components. The restrictors used in the flow gaseous components were manufactured from microhematocrit test-type capillary glass tubes following the hot forming method under continuous air flow.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that perception of intestinal stimuli increases by spatial summation phenomena. Our {{aim was to}} determine in humans whether intestinal perception depends on (a) the length of gut stimulated, and (b) the distance between stimuli. In a first series of studies, we compared perception of isobaric intestinal distensions applied over a 3 cm segment and a 36 cm segment by means of two separate <b>barostats</b> (n = 8). In a second series of studies we compared perception of intestinal distensions applied simultaneously by two balloons sited 3, 12 or 48 cm apart (n = 6). Distension of the 36 cm segment induced significantly greater perception than distension of the 3 cm intestinal segment (discomfort perceived at 20 ± 2 mmHg and 31 ± 2 mmHg, respectively; P < 0. 05). Perception of intestinal balloon distension increased when a second stimulus was simultaneously applied, independently of {{the distance between the}} two balloons (the discomfort thresholds were 30 ± 11, 20 ± 6 and 28 ± 7 % lower with simultaneous distensions 3, 12 and 48 cm apart, respectively).

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{behavior}} of biomolecules can be sensitive to temperature, the ability to accurately calculate and control the temperature in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is important. Standard analysis of equilibrium MD simulationsseven constant-energy simulations with negligible long-term energy driftsoften yields different calculated temperatures for different motions, however, in apparent violation of the statistical mechanical principle of equipartition of energy. Although such analysis provides a valuable warning that other simulation artifacts may exist, it leaves the actual value of the temperature uncertain. We observe that Tolman’s generalized equipartition theorem should hold for long stable simulations performed using velocity-Verlet or other symplectic integrators, because the simulated trajectory is thought to sample almost exactly from a continuous trajectory generated by a shadow Hamiltonian. From this we conclude that all motions should share a single simulation temperature, and we provide a new temperature estimator that we test numerically in simulations of a diatomic fluid and of a solvated protein. Apparent temperature variations between different motions observed using standard estimators do indeed disappear when using the new estimator. We use our estimator to better understand how thermostats and <b>barostats</b> can exacerbate integration errors. In particular, we find that with large (albeit widely used) time steps, the common practice of using two thermostats to remedy so-called hot solvent-cold solute problems can have the counter-intuitive effect of causing temperature imbalances. Our results, moreover, highlight the utility of multiple-time step integrators for accurate and efficient simulation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of small organic molecules is often {{very similar to}} amino acid side chains or the bases in nucleic acids, and hence there is no a priori reason why a molecular mechanics force field could not describe both organic liquids and biomolecules with a single parameter set. Here, we devise a benchmark for force fields {{in order to test}} the ability of existing force fields to reproduce some key properties of organic liquids, namely, the density, enthalpy of vaporization, the surface tension, the heat capacity at constant volume and pressure, the isothermal compressibility, the volumetric expansion coefficient, and the static dielectric constant. Well over 1200 experimental measurements were used for comparison to the simulations of 146 organic liquids. Novel polynomial interpolations of the dielectric constant (32 molecules), heat capacity at constant pressure (three molecules), and the isothermal compressibility (53 molecules) {{as a function of the}} temperature have been made, based on experimental data, in order to be able to compare simulation results to them. To compute the heat capacities, we applied the two phase thermodynamics method (Lin et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 119, 11792), which allows one to compute thermodynamic properties on the basis of the density of states as derived from the velocity autocorrelation function. The method is implemented in a new utility within the GROMACS molecular simulation package, named g_dos, and a detailed exposé of the underlying equations is presented. The purpose of this work is to establish the state of the art of two popular force fields, OPLS/AA (all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulation) and GAFF (generalized Amber force field), to find common bottlenecks, i. e., particularly difficult molecules, and to serve as a reference point for future force field development. To make for a fair playing field, all molecules were evaluated with the same parameter settings, such as thermostats and <b>barostats,</b> treatment of electrostatic interactions, and system size (1000 molecules). The densities and enthalpy of vaporization from an independent data set based on simulations using the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) presented by Vanommeslaeghe et al. (J. Comput. Chem. 2010, 31, 671) are included for comparison. We find that, overall, the OPLS/AA force field performs somewhat better than GAFF, but there are significant issues with reproduction of the surface tension and dielectric constants for both force fields...|$|R
40|$|Proteins are dynamic {{structural}} {{entities that}} are involved in many biophysical processes through molecular interactions with their ligands. Protein-ligand interactions are of fundamental importance for computer-aided drug discovery. Due to the fast development in computer technologies and theoretical methods, computational studies are by now able to provide atomistic-level description of structures, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of protein-ligand systems, and are becoming indispensable in understanding complicated biomolecular systems. In this dissertation, I have applied molecular dynamic (MD) simulations combined with several state of the art free-energy calculation methodologies, to understand structures and binding properties of several protein-ligand systems. The dissertation consists of six chapters. In the first chapter, I present a brief introduction to classical MD simulations, to recently developed methods for binding free energy calculations, and to enhanced sampling of configuration space of biological systems. The basic features, including the Hamiltonian equations, force fields, integrators, thermostats, and <b>barostats,</b> that contribute to a complete MD simulation are described in chapter 2. In chapter 3, two classes of commonly used algorithms for estimating binding free energies are presented. I highlight enhanced sampling approaches in chapter 4, with a special focus on replica exchange MD simulations and metadynamics, as both of them have been utilized in my work presented in the chapter thereafter. In chapter 5, I outlined the work in the 5 papers included in the thesis. In paper I and II, I applied, respectively, the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and alchemical free energy calculation methods to identify the molecular determinant of the affibody protein ZAb 3 bound to an amyloid b peptide, and to investigate the binding profile of the positive allosteric modulator NS- 1738 with the α 7 acetylcholine-binding protein (α 7 -AChBP protein); in paper III and VI, unbiased MD simulations were integrated with the well-tempered metadynamics approach, with the aim to reveal the mechanism behind the higher selectivity of an antagonist towards corticotropin-releasing factor receptor- 1 (CRF 1 R) than towards CRF 2 R, and to understand how the allosteric modulation induced by a sodium ion is propagated to the intracellular side of the d-opioid receptor; in the last paper, I proved the structural heterogeneity of the intrinsically disordered AICD peptide, and then employed the bias-exchange metadynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo techniques to understand the coupled folding and binding of AICD to its receptor Fe 65 -PTB 2. I finally proposed that the interactions between AICD and Fe 65 -PTB 2 take place through an induced-fit mechanism.

The {{aim of this study}} was to validate HR-ARM against standard ARM and standard <b>barostat</b> against a novel Rapid <b>Barostat</b> Bag (RBB) measurement and elastic balloon measurements of rectal function. METHODS: Twenty-six healthy volunteers (15 female, 11 male, 19 - 52 years) were studied. Measurements of anal function and simulated defecation were compared for 12 -sensor HR-ARM and 6 -sensor standard ARM using line plots from the same recording. Rectal capacity, compliance, and sensation (volume threshold) were measured by elastic balloon, standard <b>barostat,</b> and RBB methods using stepwise inflation of a 700 -mL polyethylene bag to 40 mmHg distension by electronic <b>barostat</b> and handheld syringe monitored by sphygmo-manometer, respectively. Results are reported as mean ± SD. Bland-Altman plots and correlation coefficients (r) for measurements were calculated.

The primary and side reactions are explained along with the description and origin of the known impurities. Molecular modelling concepts are explained, covering energy calculations, geometry optimisation and molecular dynamics (MD). The Polymer Consistent Forcefield (PCFF) is used throughout this work, Section 1 includes a comparison of common forecefields, ensembles, thermostats and <b>barostats.</b> Section 2 explains the experimental methodology used for the empirical measurement of glass transition temperatures (T g) using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA). Also covered are the more technical and specific matters of this research such as how the impurities are modelled and how the molecular ratios are calculated. There are seven primary models built, based on four formulations. Epoxy A is an epoxy rich mixture of BFDGE, TGAP and DDS, Epoxy B is a stoichiometric mix of BFDGE and DDS, Epoxy C is also stoichiometric, but comprised from TGAP and DDS, Epoxy D is epoxy rich, but only uses TGAP and DDS. The Epoxy F, G and H formulations are the second generation models of Epoxy B, C and D respectively, the models differ from the originals slightly on {{a number of}} points. Molecular models were used to predict T g for comparison with empirical values. Two programs were written as part of this study, the first will process a molecular model, comprised of epoxy and amine monomer, returning a cured resin model, coded to simulate the epoxy and amine bonding reaction. The second is used to processed density vs. temperature data and determine the T g. The source codes for both programs are available as appendices in Section 6. Materials Studi~ by Accelrys" was used extensively for molecular modelling throughout this work. Section 3 contains the results and discussion from the DSC, DMTA, molecular modelling and lesser experiments. Owing to inter-model similarity, only 4 formulations were subject to thermal analysis. DSC measurements for T g yielded 215 QC for Epoxy II A, 161 QC for Epoxy Band 229 QC for Epoxy C, the DSC analysis of Epoxy D did not establish a value for Tg• The DMTA measurement ofTg gave good agreement for Epoxy A and Epoxy B, about 46 QC higher than DSC for Epoxy C and an average of 280 QC for Epoxy D.

Different <b>barostat</b> protocols are described {{with respect to the}} measurement of rectal compliance and visceral perception. The choice of protocols affects the duration, which is normally 60 - 90 min, and accuracy of the procedure. This study aimed to shorten the procedure by using the semi-random distension protocol for both compliance and visceral perception measurement and a correction based on rectal capacity (RC) instead of minimal distension pressure (MDP). METHODS: Twelve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (7 females) and 11 healthy controls (8 females) underwent a <b>barostat</b> procedure. Compliance was determined during both a staircase distension and a semi-random protocol. Visceral perception data were compared as a function of pressure or relative volume, corrected for MDP or RC, respectively. RESULTS: Compliance measurement using the semi-random protocol instead of the staircase distension protocol resulted in an overestimation in healthy volunteers, but not in IBS patients. The overall conclusion that IBS patients had a lower compliance compared to controls was not different between protocols. Data presentation of the visceral perception scores as a function of corrected volume instead of pressures corrected for MDP did not alter the conclusion that sensation scores in IBS patients were higher as compared to healthy controls.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of graded gastric <b>barostat</b> {{distension}} and meal-induced fundic relaxation on the elicitation of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation (TLOSR). In 15 healthy subjects, stepwise fundic distension and oesophageal manometry were performed simultaneously. Next, the effect of meal ingestion on proximal stomach volume and lower oesophageal sphincter function was studied. During stepwise <b>barostat</b> distension of the proximal stomach, a significant linear correlation between intragastric pressure (r = 0. 91; P < 0. 01) and the TLOSR rate during inflation and subsequent deflation (r = 0. 96; P < 0. 01) was found. A similar relationship was found for volume. In addition, after meal ingestion, the TLOSR rate increased significantly from 1. 40 +/- 3 to 5. 4 +/- 1. 5 h- 1 (P < 0. 01) and 5. 2 +/- 1. 7 h- 1 (P < 0. 01), respectively, during the first and second 30 -min postprandially. However, at similar calculated intragastric volumes, <b>barostat</b> distension led to a significantly higher TLOSR rate than the meal. Similarly, distension-induced increase in gastric wall tension, estimated from the measured bag pressure and volume using Laplace's law, was associated with significantly higher TLOSR rates (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, the rate of TLOSRs in healthy volunteers is directly related to the degree of proximal gastric distension and pressure-controlled <b>barostat</b> distension is a more potent trigger of TLOSRs than a meal. The latter finding suggests that tension receptor activation is an important stimulus for TLOSR...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{previously}} {{developed a}} technique to study the effect of inhibitory innervation in the human oesophageal body, by creating an artificial high pressure zone (artificial HPZ) using an intra-oesophageal balloon. Swallowing provokes a fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ that precedes the peristaltic contraction. We aimed {{to prove that the}} swallow-induced fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ is due to relaxation of a segmental tonic contraction of the oesophageal wall at that level. METHODS: Studies were performed in five healthy subjects. Oesophageal pressures were measured at 5, 10 and 15 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. A rubber balloon opposite the middle pressure sensor was used to induce the artificial HPZ. A <b>barostat</b> bag was glued to {{the opposite side of the}} balloon. The pressure in the <b>barostat</b> bag was pre-set at 8 mmHg below the pressure measured in the artificial HPZ. We studied deglutition-induced variations in the <b>barostat</b> bag volume after single and multiple swallows. RESULTS: Immediately after single swallows and during multiple swallows, we observed a fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ and a significant increase in the <b>barostat</b> bag volume (254 +/- 67 %) from 0. 99 (0. 37 - 1. 93) to 3. 74 (1. 91 - 4. 34) (P = 0. 005) denoting oesophageal wall relaxation. CONCLUSION: The swallow-induced fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ represents a real relaxation of a segmental tonic contraction of the oesophageal wall due to deglutitive inhibition. The oesophageal artificial HPZ is a simple method that can be used to study inhibitory phenomena in the body of the human oesophagus. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Transient lower esophageal {{sphincter}} relaxations (tLESRs) are vagally mediated {{in response}} to gastric cardiac distension. Nine volunteers, eight gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients, and eight fundoplication patients were studied. Manometry with an assembly that included a <b>barostat</b> bag was done for 1 h with and 1 h without <b>barostat</b> distension to 8 mmHg. Recordings were scored for tLESRs and <b>barostat</b> bag volume. Fundoplication patients had fewer tLESRs (0. 4 +/- 0. 3 /h) than either normal subjects (2. 4 +/- 0. 5 /h) or GERD patients (2. 0 +/- 0. 3 /h). The tLESRs rate increased significantly in normal subjects (5. 8 +/- 0. 9 /h) and GERD patients (5. 4 +/- 0. 8 /h) during distension {{but not in the}} fundoplication group. All groups exhibited similar gastric accommodation (change in volume/change in pressure) {{in response to}} distension. Fundoplication patients exhibit a lower tLESR rate at rest and a marked attenuation of the response to gastric distension compared with either controls or GERD patients. Gastric accommodation was not impaired with fundoplication. This suggests that the receptive field for triggering tLESRs is contained within a wider field for elicitation of gastric receptive relaxation and that only the first is affected by fundoplication...|$|E
40|$|The gastric {{accommodation}} {{response to}} a meal is impaired in conditions such as functional dyspepsia. At present, a <b>barostat</b> study is the gold standard to assess fundic relaxation in re-sponse to a meal. However, this method is invasive and possi-bly induces artifacts {{as a result of}} positive intraluminal balloon pressure. A noninvasive scintigraphic test has been developed to measure gastric accommodation in humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} refine this method, increasing the imaging time span and limiting the radiation dose applied without losing image quality, so that repeated measurements within 1 subject are possible without increasing radiation risk. Methods: Thir-teen healthy volunteers without gastrointestinal symptoms were recruited from a student population. Each volunteer had previ-ously undergone a <b>barostat</b> study. After an overnight fast, vol-unteers were scanned twice on separate days after intravenou...|$|E
