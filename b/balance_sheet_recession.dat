In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} role of the {{financial}} system in the amplification and propagation of business cycles. Chapter 1 studies the origin and propagation of <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions.</b> I first show that in standard models driven by TFP shocks, the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> channel disappears when agents are allowed to write contracts on the aggregate state of the economy. In contrast, I show how uncertainty shocks can drive <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions</b> with depressed asset prices and growth, and trigger a "flight to quality" event with low interest rates and high risk-premia. Uncertainty shocks create an endogenous hedging motive that induces financial intermediaries to take on a disproportionate fraction of aggregate risk, even when contracts can be written on the aggregate state of the economy. Finally, I explore some implications for financial regulation. Chapter 2 studies a tractable model of dynamic moral hazard with purely pecuniary private benefits. The agent can trade a productive asset and secretly divert funds to a private account and use them to "recontract": at any time he can offer a new continuation contract to the principal, who accepts if the new contract is attractive. The main result is that the optimal contract can be characterized as the solution to a standard portfolio problem with a simple "skin in the game" constraint. The setting places few restrictions on preferences and the distribution of shocks, distinguishes between (observable) aggregate shocks and (unobservable) idiosyncratic shocks, and takes arbitrary general equilibrium prices as given. This makes the results easily applicable to many macro and financial applications. Chapter 3 explores under what conditions the presence of moral hazard can create a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> amplification channel. If the private action of the agent exposes him to aggregate risk through his unobserved private benefit, the optimal contract will try to over-expose him to aggregate risk to deter him from misbehaving. This creates a tradeoff between aggregate and idiosyncratic risk-sharing. More productive agents naturally want to leverage more and therefore have larger incentives to distort their aggregate risk-sharing in order to reduce their exposure to idiosyncratic risk. In equilibrium, therefore, more productive agents take on a disproportionate fraction of aggregate risk, creating a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> channel. by Sebastian T. Di Tella. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|A <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> is a {{particular}} type of recession driven by the high levels of private sector debt (i.e., the credit cycle) rather than fluctuations in the business cycle. It is characterized by a change in private sector behavior towards saving (i.e., paying down debt) rather than spending, which slows the economy through a reduction in consumption by households or investment by business. The term balance sheet derives from an accounting equation that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or business is insolvent. Until it regains solvency, the entity will focus on debt repayment. It has been argued that a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> essentially is the same phenomenon that the German economist Wilhelm Röpke and Austrian School economists in the 1930's denoted as a secondary deflation.|$|E

40|$|Until {{households}} and financial institutions repair their <b>balance</b> <b>sheets,</b> recovery in many advanced economies will be halting GOING down a mountain is usually easier than going up. But finance {{seems to work}} differently from the law of gravity. Reducing debt, that is, “deleveraging, ” {{has proven to be}} a much harder slog than the climb up the debt mountain. This is why <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions,</b> like the one many advanced economies recently suffered, are much worse than <b>recessions</b> in which <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> are not overloaded with unsustainable debts (see “Tracking the Global Recovery ” in this issue of F&D). Until financial institutions, households, and governments in advanced economies return their <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> to sustainable levels of assets and debt, recovery from the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930 s will be retarded.

Origins of the crisis Most financial crises involve too much borrowing. Who does the excess borrowing, though, varies. In the past, it was often governments or corporations that borrowed too much.

50|$|A <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> {{is a type}} of {{economic}} recession that occurs when high levels of private sector debt cause individuals or companies to collectively focus on saving by paying down debt rather than spending or investing, causing economic growth to slow or decline.

50|$|High {{levels of}} {{indebtedness}} or the bursting {{of a real}} estate or financial asset price bubble can cause a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession.</b> This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. Economist Richard C.

When imbalances develop across these sectors, recession can develop within the country or create pressure for recession in another country. Policy responses are often designed to drive the economy back towards this ideal state of balance.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three essays on how macroeconomic policy {{can be an important}} determinant of risk premium and how variations in risk premium may affect macroeconomic policy. Unconventional monetary policy represents a main example of how the transmission of macroeconomic policy is mediated by movements in risk premium. In the first essay, I examine how unconventional monetary policy affects asset prices by reallocating risk in the economy. I consider an environment with heterogeneity in risk tolerance and limited asset market participation. Risk-tolerant investors take leveraged positions, exposing the economy to <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions.</b> Limited asset market participation implies the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the central bank is non-neutral. Unconventional monetary policy reduces the risk premium and endogenous volatility. During <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions,</b> asset purchases boost investment and growth. In contrast, during normal times, the expectation of future interventions reduces growth. Leveraged institutions respond to the policy by reducing risk-taking relatively more than risk-averse investors. As risk concentration falls, the probability of negative tail-events is reduced, enhancing financial stability. An important determinant of entrepreneurial activity in developing countries is the amount of risk the entrepreneur must bear. The second essay, joint with Robert M. Townsend, analyzes the risk-taking behavior of entrepreneurs. Using data from a survey conducted in villages in Thailand, we document substantial heterogeneity in entrepreneurial activity. The fraction of net worth invested by entrepreneurs in risky activities decreases over the life cycle. Consumption-to-wealth ratio is U-shaped, being high for young and old entrepreneurs. We propose a model that captures both the life cycle patterns and limited idiosyncratic insurance observed in the Thai data. An expansion in idiosyncratic insurance will reduce the idiosyncratic risk premium, increasing the proportion of wealth invested in risky activities and aggregate output. However, as the return on the project falls, entrepreneurs accumulate less wealth, reducing their welfare in the long-run. The third essay studies the optimal response of fiscal policy to a risk premium shock when a country is in a currency union. In the context of an open economy New Keynesian model, I show that the government should not deviate from the optimal provision of public goods at an attempt to stabilize the economy. A consumption tax is used to lean against the wind and reduce the real interest rate {{in the presence of a}} positive risk premium shock. A VAT tax allows the government to independently influence the terms of trade. Optimal fiscal policy has the property of being revenue-generating. Therefore, there is not necessarily a trade off between stabilization policy and fiscal consolidation. by Dejanir Henrique Silva. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation has been motivated by the Great Recession that has shown us once again how the financial system can amplify and propagate relatively mild economic shocks into larger scale recessions. In the past decade, we witnessed what many may call the worst crisis since the Great Depression {{that appears to have}} resulted from a perverse interaction between real estate markets and borrowers' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> The three chapters of this dissertation are an attempt to shed light on the mechanisms that may have allowed for such perverse effects to arise. I believe that to understand crisis episodes such as the recent one, it is imperative to study why some economic agents become overly exposed to risk, why financial markets fail to function at times, and what policy makers can do to ameliorate the incidence and repercussions of such adverse events. In Chapter 1, "A Theory of <b>Balance</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>Recessions</b> with Informational and Trading Frictions," I propose a novel theory to rationalize the limited risk-sharing that drives <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions</b> as a result of informational and trading frictions in financial markets. I show that borrowers and creditors will find it costly to share macroeconomic risk in environments where creditors value the liquidity of financial claims but where information about the future states of the economy is dispersed and the secondary markets for financial claims feature search frictions. As a result, borrowers will optimally choose to retain disproportionate exposures to macroeconomic risk on their <b>balance</b> <b>sheets,</b> and adverse shocks will be amplified through the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> channel. I show that the magnitude of this amplification becomes closely linked to the level of information dispersion and the severity of search frictions in financial markets. In this setting, I study the implications of the theory for macro-prudential regulation and find that subsidizing contingent write-downs of borrowers' liabilities can be welfare improving. In Chapter 2, "Informed Intermediation over the Cycle," a joint work with Victoria Vanasco, we construct a dynamic model of financial intermediation in which changes in the information held by financial intermediaries generate asymmetric credit cycles as the ones documented by Reinhart and Reinhart (2010). We model financial intermediaries as "expert'' agents who have a unique ability to acquire information about firm fundamentals. While the level of "expertise'' in the economy grows in tandem with information that the "experts'' possess, the gains from intermediation are hindered by informational asymmetries. We find the optimal financial contracts and show that the economy inherits not only the dynamic nature of information flow, but also the interaction of information with the contractual setting. We introduce a cyclical component to information by supposing that the fundamentals about which experts acquire information are stochastic. While persistence of fundamentals is essential for information to be valuable, their randomness acts as an opposing force and diminishes the value of expert learning. Our setting then features economic fluctuations due to waves of "confidence'' in the intermediaries' ability to allocate funds profitably. In Chapter 3, "Credit Crises, Liquidity Traps, and Demand Externalities," I extend the work of Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) to study welfare implications of households' consumption-saving decisions in New Keynesian economies with incomplete asset markets. My contribution is to show that due to aggregate demand externalities the amount of debt pre-contracted in such economies is generally excessive, and that the amount of "over-borrowing" is increasing in the Central Banker's inflation-aversion. This externality arises because an individual household does not internalize its contribution to the overall fragility as the latter is only a function of aggregate indebtedness of all borrowers. These findings suggest that macro-prudential policies geared towards limiting household leverage can indeed be welfare improving...|$|R
50|$|A July 2012 {{survey of}} <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> {{research}} reported that consumer demand and employment {{are affected by}} household leverage levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the subprime mortgage crisis. In other words, according to the accounting equation, as {{the value of their}} primary asset (homes) fell, mortgage debt initially remained fixed, so equity also fell, causing the ratio of debt to equity (a measure of leverage) to rise. This sudden increase in leverage, causing consumers to shift from spending to paying down debt, can account for a significant decline in employment levels, as employers cut back due to concerns of lower consumer demand. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.|$|E
5000|$|In Krugman's view, {{balance sheet}} recessions require private sector debt {{reduction}} strategies (e.g., mortgage refinancing) combined with higher government spending to offset declines {{from the private}} sector as it pays down its debt, writing in July 2014: [...] "Unlike a financial panic, a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> can’t be cured simply by restoring confidence: no matter how confident they may be feeling, debtors can’t spend more if their creditors insist they cut back. So offsetting the economic downdraft from a debt overhang requires concrete action, which can in general take two forms: fiscal stimulus and debt relief. That is, the government can step in to spend because the private sector can’t, and it can also reduce private debts to allow the debtors to spend again. Unfortunately, we did too little of the first and almost none of the second." ...|$|E

And suppose {{that at some point}} people more or less suddenly realize that these high debt levels are risky. At that point debtors will face strong pressures from their creditors to “deleverage,” slashing their spending in an effort to pay down debt. But when many people slash spending at the same time, the result will be a depressed economy. This can turn into a self-reinforcing spiral, as falling incomes make debt seem even less supportable, leading to deeper cuts; but in any case, the overhang of debt can keep the economy depressed for a long time." ...|$|E
40|$|Homi Kharas {{discuss the}} limited {{political}} and policy space {{available to the}} advanced countries in dealing with continued sluggishness in the global recovery. As Martin Wolf has observed, {{in many ways it}} is incorrect even to talk of a double-dip recession for the U. S. or Europe. While the mix between overstretched households, undercapitalized banks and over-indebted sovereigns differs across countries, slow growth is both a consequence and a cause of the attempts to repair <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> in each sector. The synchronization of these stresses across the major advanced countries has further retarded the global recovery, {{in a way that was}} last seen in the 1930 s. Even the crisis of the euro can be seen as a manifestation of the relentless interconnection between the overextension of bank credit (in this case to sovereigns), the bursting of a valuation bubble, and the resulting effects on economic growth and bank solvency. The only silver lining is that corporate <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> remain robust in most advanced countries, although weak prospective demand inhibits fixed investment domestically. The ensuing diversion of investment to faster-growing emerging markets by advanced country multinational corporations, while supporting global growth, has become a divisive and controversial issue in home countries, notably the United States. And if history teaches us that <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions</b> linger on for a long time, the experience of the U. S. in the late 1930 s and Japan in the 1990 s also teaches us that intense political and market pressures for fiscal consolidation build up even when demand is weak. It can be persuasively argued that premature fiscal tightening in both those cases aborted a nascent recovery. Indeed, for a given current account deficit, attempts to increase savings by households (and, as appropriate, to boost net worth by financial institutions) implies an offsetting deterioration in the net worth of the public sector. With monetary policy constrained, there are concerns today that simultaneous fiscal tightening in th...|$|R

We find that the growth of firms dependent on external financing is disproportionately positively affected by bank recapitalization policies, and that this effect is quantitatively important and robust to controlling for other financial sector support policies. We also find that fiscal policy disproportionately boosted growth of firms more dependent on external financing.

40|$|This thesis explores {{topics in}} {{financial}} intermediation and macro-finance. In the first chapter, my co-authors and I analyse {{the structure of}} the UK repo market using a novel dataset. We estimate the extent of collateral rehypothecation, and address the question of which variables determine haircuts using transaction-level data. We find that collateral rating and transaction maturity have first order of importance in setting haircuts. Banks charge higher haircuts when they transact with non-bank institutions even after controlling for measures of counterparty risk. We examine {{the structure of the}} repo market network and we find out that banks with higher centrality measures ask for more haircuts on reverse repos and pay lower haircuts on repos. In the second chapter, I study the real effects of benchmarking in fund management industry in a general equilibrium model where stocks of productive sectors are traded in a competitive equity market. Investors delegate their portfolio decisions to managers whose performance is benchmarked against an index. Managers hedge themselves by tilting their portfolio toward the index which increases the demand and price of the stocks that feature prominently in the index. In equilibrium there is an inefficient shift towards extreme states in which big sectors dominate the economy. I show that in presence of benchmarking, index inclusion is preceded by a rise in firm’s investment rate relative to its capital stock. In the third chapter, I examine <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recessions</b> in a general equilibrium model where agents have heterogeneous beliefs about future technology growth. I show a channel which describes the risk concentration through belief dispersion rather than ad-hoc constraints on aggregate risk sharing.

Nevertheless, since the sovereign debt crisis in Europe that started with the Greek episode in mid- 2010 and the continuing <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>recession</b> in the United States, the world has entered a new phase of global financial, economic and social crisis.

50|$|The U.S. Federal Reserve System held between $700 {{billion and}} $800 billion of Treasury notes on its <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> before the <b>recession.</b> In late November 2008, the Federal Reserve started buying $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities. By March 2009, it held $1.75 {{trillion}} of bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury notes; this amount reached {{a peak of}} $2.1 trillion in June 2010. Further purchases were halted as the economy started to improve, but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly. After the halt in June, holdings started falling naturally as debt matured and were projected to fall to $1.7 trillion by 2012. The Fed's revised goal became to keep holdings at $2.054 trillion. To maintain that level, the Fed bought $30 billion in two- to ten-year Treasury notes every month.|$|R

As an illustration we analyze the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the Federal Reserve System (FED) during the subprime crisis between June 2007 and December 2008. Until September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the FED did not expand strongly. However, the structure of the FED assets varied pronouncedly. Starting in September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded dramatically. The calculation of certain <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios supports the assessment of an important decrease {{of the quality of the}} currency.
