5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the <b>battalion</b> <b>commander,</b> fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|On the {{division}} left, meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> wanted to withdraw.

5|$|Around 1920, Petrov was {{transferred}} to Central Asia and fought in {{the suppression of the}} Basmachi movement, a Muslim uprising against Russian and Soviet rule. He later fought against insurgents in the Caucasus before being sent to the Tambov Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1923. While at the school, he participated in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion. He graduated from the Transcaucasian Political School in 1925. In 1932, he graduated from the armored commanders refresher courses. Petrov served as the commander of a training battalion in the 1st Mechanized Brigade, before fighting in the Spanish Civil War, serving as a <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> in Dmitry Pavlov's tank brigade from October 1936 to June 1937. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 2 January 1937. On 21 June he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his leadership. Returning to the Soviet Union, he held appointments as a <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> and then as a tank brigade commander. In 1937, he became commander of a tank division. In June of that year, he became commander of the 5th Mechanized Corps.|$|E

Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E
5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became <b>battalion</b> <b>commander.</b> If {{he or she was}} from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E

5|$|In December 1945, {{most of the}} {{battalion}} (except one platoon) was withdrawn to New Britain to rejoin the 11th Brigade. In February 1946, the platoon that had remained on Nauru arrived in Rabaul. As the demobilisation process began, the 31st/51st stayed on New Britain until May when they received orders to return to Australia. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Donald Lamb took over as <b>battalion</b> <b>commander.</b> As personnel were discharged or transferred to other units for further service, {{the battalion}}'s numbers declined until eventually, on 4 July 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|On the division's left, meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 {{came under}} heavy attack and the <b>{{battalion}}</b> <b>commander</b> wanted to withdraw.

While G Company {{was trying to}} escape from Hill 464, {{the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380, to the south. Later in the day on September 7, the battalion received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible. It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 16/17 September 1943, while the 13th SS Division was {{training}} in Villefranche-de-Rouergue in France, a group of pro-Partisan soldiers led by Muslim and Catholic junior officers staged a mutiny within the Pioneer battalion. Led by Ferid Džanić, Božo Jelinek (aka Eduard Matutinović), Nikola Vukelić and Lutfija Dizdarević, they captured most of the German personnel and executed five German officers, including <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> SS-Obersturmbannführer Oskar Kirchbaum.

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>battalion</b> <b>commander</b> at Taizhou {{ordered his}} officer Zhai Yong to escort Choe Bu's Korean {{party to the}} {{regional}} command centre at Shaoxing on March 6.

Choe Bu and his officers were carried in sedan chairs, an accommodation provided by the Taizhou Battalion, although in spots of rough terrain Choe Bu and his officers were forced to walk on foot like the others.|$|E
5|$|The next day, American M24 tanks {{attacked}} the roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion {{four times in}} an attempt to break it, but all were unsuccessful, and Lieutenant Colonel Eugene J.

By 12:00, North Korean troops were attacking the 99th and 61st Field Artillery Battalions which were supporting the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, indicating that the North Korean infiltration had been extensive by that point.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the infantry <b>battalion</b> <b>commanders</b> {{of the first}} Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. Although the command of an infantry battalion was an important and influential position within the army&# 146;s hierarchy it has been largely overlooked in Australian histories of the First World War. To redress this omission, this study evaluates the 183 men who held substantive commands between 4 August 1914 and 11 November 1918 and assesses their experiences, their competence, and their changing responsibilities. To do so, the exercising of command has been broken up into three components: tactical ability, administrative ability, and leadership. An officer was required to exercise all three competently if his battalion was to be effective. This study demonstrates that by 1918 Australian <b>battalion</b> <b>commanders</b> were largely competent in all three. Two factors were primarily responsible for this success. First, by situating Australian <b>battalion</b> <b>commanders</b> within the wider context of the British Army, they were integrated into and beneficiaries of the institutional learning process that allowed the British Expeditionary Force to develop into a successful war-winning army by 1918. Second, Australian <b>battalion</b> <b>commanders</b> achieved proficiency through ruthless removal of inefficient officers and the appointment of potentially competent replacements. This conclusion undermines the notion that Australians were natural soldiers and leaders and instead points towards a more technical understanding of warfare, which has been absent in many retellings of the Australian experience of the First World War...|$|R
