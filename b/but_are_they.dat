"Correct me if I'm wrong, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> {{hoping that}} one of these guys from the G8 is on a quick 15-minute break at Gleneagles and sees Annie Lennox singing [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] and thinks, 'Fuck me, she might have a point there, you know?' [...] And Keane doing [...] "Somewhere Only We Know" [...] and some Japanese {{businessman}} going, 'Aw, look at him. ... we should really fucking drop that debt, you know.' [...] It's not going to happen, is it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of laughed about it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I love what I do today, but there are times when I wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> stealing me from you?" [...] On June 7, 2011, Back 2 Back Hits, featuring songs off Jesus Freak and Supernatural, was released.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album’s lyrics, Kris Ex from Pitchfork said [...] "The rhymes {{here are}} at once {{conversational}} and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. The lyrics are 25 years old. <b>But</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> released today they'd seem right on time." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nothing {{is known}} of their soft part anatomy, other than what can be surmised from the fact <b>they</b> <b>are</b> cephalopods. <b>They</b> likely possessed tentacles of some sort, <b>but</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> {{numerous}} like those of modern Nautilus, limited to eight or ten as with octopus or squid, or of some other arrangement.|$|R
6000|$|Answ. The {{question}} is not, Are they blind? <b>But,</b> <b>Are</b> <b>they</b> within the reach {{and power of}} Shall-come? If so, that Christ that said, they shall come, will find them eyes, or a guide or both, {{to bring them to}} himself. [...] "Must is for the king." [...] If they shall come, they shall come. No impediment shall hinder.|$|E
60|$|The two {{individuals}} are separate again. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> {{as they were}} before? Is the air the same after a thunder-storm as before? No. The air is as it were new, fresh, tingling with newness. So is the blood of man and woman after successful coition. After a false coition, like prostitution, there is not newness but a certain disintegration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Party {{tactics are}} both {{exciting}} and amusing, no doubt. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> better than horse-racing? Jockeys and horse-breakers at least know their business; our legislators do not. Is it pleasant {{to sit on}} a bench--even though it be the treasury bench--and listen to either absolute nonsense or childish disputes about conclusions that were foregone in the minds of all sensible men a hundred years ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will not}} succeed," [...] the rajah said, positively. [...] "We gave up Deeg, {{because we did}} not want a large force shut up there. Our walls <b>are</b> strong <b>but,</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> {{levelled}} to the ground, we would still defend the place to the last." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> wise in so doing? We may {{judge of}} a man's wisdom, my friends, by his success. We English are very apt to do so. We like {{practical}} men. We say--I {{will tell you}} what a man is, by what he can do.|$|R
6000|$|As Joe {{waited for}} a chance to get away he {{wondered}} what Darry and old Benson were doing.

6000|$|It is said, in {{vindication of}} this system, which demands the {{stability}} of the Regicide power as a ground for peace with them, that, when they have obtained, as now it is said (though not by this noble author) they have, a permanent government, {{they will be able to}} preserve amity with this kingdom, and with others who have the misfortune to be in their neighborhood. Granted. They will be able to do so, without question; <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> willing to do so? Produce the act; produce the declaration. Have they made any single step towards it? Have they ever once proposed to treat? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} the pleasure, Grey, of meeting this {{afternoon}} two men who have each only one idea. Colonel von Trumpetson and the Marquis de la Tabatière are equally tiresome. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> more tiresome than any other man who always speaks on the same subject? We are more irritable, but not more wearied, {{with a man who}} is always thinking of the pattern of a button-hole, or the shape of a snuff-box, than with one who is always talking about pictures, or chemistry, or politics. The true bore is that man who thinks the world is only interested in one subject, because he himself can only comprehend one." ...|$|E
60|$|At length I woke up again, feeling much stronger, {{and saw the}} dog, Lost, {{watching}} me with its great tender eyes--oh! they talk of the eyes of women, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> ever as beautiful as those of a loving dog? It lay by my low bed-stead, a rough affair fashioned of poles and strung with rimpis or strings of raw hide, and by it, stroking its head, sat the witch-doctoress, Nombe. I remember how pleasing she looked, a perfect type of the eternal feminine with her graceful, rounded shape and her continual, mysterious smile which suggested {{so much more than}} any mortal woman has to give.|$|E
60|$|The colonists joyfully {{accepted}} the offer, {{seeing that the}} intervention of France in the struggle would completely alter its conditions.

5000|$|In 1824, Humphreys {{turned down}} a very lucrative offer from Emperor Alexander I of Russia to create a Russian navy, saying: [...] "I {{do not know that}} I possess the merits {{attributed}} to me, <b>but,</b> <b>be</b> <b>they</b> great or small, I owe them all to the flag of my country." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{watch you}} in your crystal sphere, And wonder if you see and hear Those shapes and sounds that stir the wide Conjecture of the world outside; [...] 200 In your pent lives, as we in ours, Have you surmises dim of powers, Of presences obscurely shown, Of lives a riddle to your own, Just on the senses' outer verge, Where sense-nerves into soul-nerves merge, Where we conspire our own deceit Confederate in deft Fancy's feat, And the fooled brain befools the eyes With pageants woven of its own lies? [...] 210 <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> lies? Why more than those Phantoms that startle your repose, Half seen, half heard, then flit away, And leave you your prose-bounded day? ...|$|E
60|$|Let us try {{to imagine}} what a World Government would be like. I find that when one speaks of a World State people think at once of some {{existing}} government and magnify it to world proportions. They ask, for example, where will the World Congress meet; and how will you elect your World President? Won't your World President, they say, be rather a tremendous personage? How are we to choose him? Or {{will there be a}} World King? These are very natural questions, at the first onset. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> sound questions? May they not be a little affected by false analogies? The governing of the whole of the world {{may turn out to be}} not a magnified version of governing a part of the world, but a different sort of job altogether. These analogies that people draw so readily from national states may not really work in a world state.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you men {{sometimes}} realize," [...] {{she continued}} earnestly, [...] "the many, many guises in which temptation {{may come to}} a woman, especially to the young girl so far from home? She may be very lonely, and she may care; and if she cares, it {{is so hard to}} refuse the man she loves. The very sweetness, the very generosity of a woman's nature prompts her to give, give, give all the time. There are other women, similarly circumstanced, who think only of themselves, of their own safety and happiness, and they escape the danger; <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> to be praised and respected, while she that yields is condemned and cast out? I feel that {{you are not going to}} agree with me, and I do not wish to argue with you; but what I so passionately object to is the sweeping judgment you make--the sheep on one side and the goats on the other. That is how man judges; God looks further. Every case is different. The law by which one should be judged may be poor justice for another." ...|$|E
50|$|If Good fails, {{the world}} is lost. The fate of the world rests {{in the hands of}} three very special people, who is {{believed}} to be those from a long forgotten legend of a race thought to have been destroyed long ago. <b>But</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> all destroyed or just hidden from those out to kill them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{third part}} {{begins with the}} words, [...] "Britain has priests, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fools; {{numerous}} ministers, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> shameless; clerics, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> wily plunderers." [...] Gildas continues his jeremiad against the clergy of his age, but does not explicitly mention any names in this section, and so does not cast any light {{on the history of}} the Christian church in this period.|$|R

60|$|A sad {{misinterpretation}} of our Lord's words, which {{from the}} context most evidently had {{no reference to}} any moral, that is, universal commandment as such, but to the national institutions of the Jewish state, {{as long as that}} state should be in existence; that is to say, until 'the Heaven' or the Government, and 'the Earth' or the People or the Governed, as one 'corpus politicum', or nation, had 'passed away'. Till that time,--which was fulfilled under Titus, and more thoroughly under Hadrian,--no Jew was relieved from his duties as a citizen and subject by his having become a Christian. The text, together with the command implied in the miracle of the tribute-money in the fish's mouth, might be fairly and powerfully adduced against the Quakers, in respect of their refusal to pay their tithes, or whatever tax they please to consider as having an un-Christian destination. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> excluded from the kingdom of heaven, that is, the Christian Church? No;--but they must be regarded as weak and injudicious members of it.|$|E

What can I do for the young Virginian {{that has not been}} done? He is charming. Are we even jealous of him for being so, my dear? and though we see what a fancy the Baroness de Bernstein has taken for him, do your ladyship's nephews and nieces--your real nephews and nieces--cry out? My poor children might be mortified, for indeed, in a few hours, the charming young man has made as much way as my poor things {{have been able to do}} in all their lives: <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> angry? Willy hath taken him out to ride. This morning, was not Maria playing the harpsichord whilst my Fanny taught him the minuet? 'Twas a charming young group, I assure you, and it brought tears into my eyes to look at the young creatures. Poor lad! we are as fond of him as you are, dear Baroness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say {{what they}} like,' said Herbert, 'there is a spell in {{the shores of}} the Mediterranean Sea which no others can rival. Never was such a union of natural loveliness and magical associations! On these shores have risen all that {{interests}} us in the past: Egypt and Palestine, Greece, Rome, and Carthage, Moorish Spain, and feodal Italy. These shores have yielded us our religion, our arts, our literature, and our laws. If all that we have gained from {{the shores of the}} Mediterranean was erased from the memory of man, we should be savages. Will the Atlantic ever be so memorable? Its civilisation will be more rapid, but will it be as refined? and, far more important, will it be as permanent? Will it not lack the racy vigour and the subtle spirit of aboriginal genius? Will not a colonial character cling to its society, feeble, inanimate, evanescent? What America is deficient in is creative intellect. It has no nationality. Its intelligence has been imported, like its manufactured goods. Its inhabitants are a people, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> a nation? I wish that the empire of the Incas and the kingdom of Montezuma had not been sacrificed. I wish that the republic of the Puritans had blended with the tribes of the wilderness.' ...|$|E
