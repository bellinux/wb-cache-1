50|$|When bandwings feel safe, {{they appear}} drab. When they feel threatened, they leap out to reveal bold and bright colors. Some {{predator}}s might even mistake the <b>Blue-winged</b> <b>grasshopper</b> for butterfly. But when the predator {{looks for the}} grasshopper, it is hiding in the grass. Bandwings continue this process if the predator tries to attack them.|$|E
50|$|The dry grasslands, which {{cover the}} {{limestone}} and sandstone soils, are also rich in fauna and flora. They house the snake Vipera aspis, the large blue butterfly, the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>grasshopper</b> and the bee orchid. The heathland {{in the north}} of Mayenne is populated by dwarf gorse and cross-leaved heath {{and there are plenty of}} spiders, nightjars and warblers. The old quarries are the refuge of bats, amphibians, the shining cranesbill and greater butterfly orchid. Rivers and ponds are home to eel, northern crested newt, European otter, kingfisher, grass snake, common moorhen and plants such as spearwort, yellow flag, arrowhead and Isopyrum thalictroides, a small poisonous plant.|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{programs}} increasingly {{involve the}} reintroduction of animals which otherwise would not recolonize restored habitats. We assessed the long-term {{success of a}} project in which the <b>Blue-winged</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> Oedipoda caerulescens (L., 1758), was reintroduced to a nature reserve in Northwestern Switzerland, an alluvial gravel area where the species went extinct in the 1960 s. In summer 1995, we released 110 individuals (50 females and 60 males) and 204 individuals (101 females and 103 males) into two restored gravel patches with sparse vegetation. We used a transect count technique to assess the population size of O. caerulescens in the years 1995 – 2004 and 2015 – 2016 and recorded the area occupied by the species. At both release sites, the populations persisted and increased significantly in size. Individuals that followed a newly created corridor established four new subpopulations. Seven years after reintroduction, O. caerulescens had reached a high abundance around the release sites and in the four colonized patches, indicating a successful project. At the same time, the dispersal corridor became increasingly overgrown by dense vegetation. Surveys 20 and 21 [*]yr after introduction showed that the abundance of the <b>Blue-winged</b> <b>grasshopper</b> had strongly declined in the established subpopulations and moderately in the original release sites, owing to natural succession of the habitat and lack of disturbances, which reduced the area suitable for the species by 59 %. Our study shows that reintroductions are unlikely to succeed without integration of long-term habitat management (in the present case maintenance of open ground) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} habitat use and {{mobility}} of the Grayling butterfly (Hipparchia semele) and the <b>Blue-Winged</b> <b>Grasshopper</b> (Oedipoda caerulescens), two threatened insects within spatially structured blond and grey dunes in a nature reserve along the Belgian coast. Although both species {{occur in the}} same biotope, H. semele were more abundant in open, dynamic sites with a relatively high amount of bare sand, while O. caerulescens preferred sheltered, more stable environments with a lower amount of bare sand. Unlike H. semele, substrate use varied in accordance to body colouration in O. caerulescens, especially on cold days, with light-coloured animals being more abundant on sand and dark-coloured animals more abundant on moss. During a mark-recapture-study, we marked 493 Grayling butterflies and 1289 Blue-Winged Grass-hoppers. On average, both sexes of H. semele were equally mobile (about 150 m/day; maximum recorded distance of about 1700 m) while male O. caerulescens were significantly more mobile than females (daily average 47 vs. 5 m; maximum distances observed for O. caerulescens were about 800 m). The importance of habitat heterogeneity (within and among patches) {{and the consequences of}} habitat use and mobility of both species for the conservation of typical coastal dune habitats are discussed. The complementary use of species-specific information to site-based management measures is advocated...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} and destruction due to anthropogenic land use {{are the major}} causes of the increasing extinction risk of many species and have a detrimental impact on animal populations in numerous ways. The long-term survival and stability of spatially structured populations in fragmented landscapes largely depends on the colonisation of habitat patches and the exchange of individuals and genes between patches. The degree of inter-patch dispersal, in turn, depends on the dispersal ability of a species (i. e. the combination of physiological and morphological factors that facilitate dispersal) and the landscape structure (i. e. {{the nature of the}} landscape matrix or the spatial configuration of habitat patches). As fragmentation of landscapes is increasing and the number of species is continuously declining, a thorough understanding of the causes and consequences of dispersal is essential for managing natural populations and developing effective conservation strategies. In the context of animal dispersal, movement behaviour is intensively investigated with capture-mark-recapture studies. For the analysis of such experiments, the influence of marking technique, handling and translocation of marked animals on movement pattern is of crucial importance since it may mask the effects of the main research question. Chapter 2 of this thesis presents a capture-mark-recapture study investigating the effect of translocation on the movement behaviour of the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Oedipoda caerulescens. Transferring individuals of this grasshopper species to suitable but unfamilliar sites has a significant influence on their movement behaviour. Translocated individuals moved longer distances, showed smaller daily turning angles, and thus their movements were more directed than those of resident individuals. The effect of translocation was most pronounced {{on the first day of}} the experiment, but may persist for longer. On average, daily moved distances of translocated individuals were about 50...|$|E
