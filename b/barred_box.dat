40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new design of the Focusing DIRC for the Barrel PID to be used at the {{proposed}} Super-B factory. The new imaging optics is made of a solid Fused Silica block with a double folded optics using two mirrors, one cylindrical and one flat, focusing photons on a detector plane conveniently accessible for the detector access. The design assumes that the BaBar <b>bar</b> <b>boxes</b> are re-used without any modification, including the wedges and windows. Each <b>bar</b> <b>box</b> will have its own focusing block, which will contain 40 H- 9500 (or H- 8500) MaPMTs according to present thinking. There are 12 <b>bar</b> <b>boxes</b> in the entire detector, so the entire SuperB FDIRC system would have 480 MaPMTs. The design is very compact and therefore reduces sensitivity to the background. The chosen MaPMTs are fast {{enough to be able}} both to reject the background and to perform the chromatic correction. The 3 D optics simulation is coded with the Mathematica program. The work in this paper was a basis of the LDRD proposal made to SLAC in 2009 [1]...|$|R
40|$|TORCH is a large-area {{precision}} time-of-flight detector {{based on}} the DIRC principle. The DIRC <b>bar</b> <b>boxes</b> of the BaBar experiment at SLAC could possibly be reused to form {{a part of the}} TORCH detector time-of-flight wall area, proposed to provide positive particle identification of low momentum kaons in the LHCb experiment at CERN. For a potential integration of BaBar <b>bar</b> <b>boxes</b> into TORCH, new imaging readout optics are required. From the several designs of readout optics that have been considered, two are used in this paper to study the effect of BaBar bar optical imperfections on the detector reconstruction performance. The kaon-pion separation powers obtained from analysing simulated photon hit patterns show the performance reduction for a BaBar bar of non-square geometry compared to a perfectly rectangular cross section...|$|R
40|$|The PANDA {{experiment}} at {{the facility}} for anti-proton and ion research (FAIR) will study the strong interaction by precision spectroscopy. A detector system with excellent particle identification (PID) is therefore required. Charged hadron identification in the barrel region will be performed by a compact ring imaging Cherenkov detector based on the DIRC (Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light) principle. Figure 1 : Display of a simulated event with three tracks in the barrel DIRC detector. The <b>bar</b> <b>boxes</b> are shown in cyan, the locations of Cherenkov photons on the detector plane are shown in yellow. The design of the PANDA barrel DIRC [1], shown in Fig. 1, {{is based on the}} BABAR DIRC [2] with several important improvements, such as focusing optics and fast photon timing. The radiators are long, rectangular bars made from synthetic fused silica, each bar is 2500 mm long with a cross-section of 17 mm × 33 mm. Six bars comprise one <b>bar</b> <b>box</b> and 16 <b>bar</b> <b>boxes</b> surround the beam line at a radial distance of 50 cm. Cherenkov photons, emitted by a particle traversing the radiator bar, propagate along the length of a bar. A mirror, attached to the forward end of the bar, reflects them back to the readout end where they are focused via a doublet lens and an expansion volume on a flat detector plane. An array of multi-anode MCP-PMTs is used to detect the photons and measure the arrival time with a precision of approximately 100 ps. Several key design elements still need to be optimized...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – SLAC {{does not}} have a test beam for the HEP {{detector}} development at present. We have therefore created a cosmic ray telescope (CRT) facility, which is presently being used to test the FDIRC prototype. We have used it in the past to debug this prototype with the original SLAC electronics before going to the ESA test beam. Presently, it is used to test a new waveform digitizing electronics developed by the University of Hawaii, and we are also planning to incorporate the new Orsay TDC/ADC electronics. As a next step, we plan to put in a full size DIRC <b>bar</b> <b>box</b> with a new focusing optics, and test it together with a final SuberB electronics. The CRT is located in building 121 at SLAC. We anticipate more users to join in the future. This purpose of this note is to provide an introductory manual for newcomers...|$|R
