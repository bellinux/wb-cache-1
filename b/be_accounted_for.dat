5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E
5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|Property {{losses from}} the fire can <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> with {{relative}} certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted {{from a pool of}} magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion {{can be explained by the}} presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child.

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, Worcester {{first became}} {{the capital of}} the Hwicce kingdom, and later formed part of the wider kingdom of Mercia. Worcester and its defences were reorganised by Ealdorman Æthelred and Æthelflæd and bishop Werferth in the 890s. This {{involved}} creating a burh, a fortified Anglo-Saxon town; in Worcester this took the form of a planned settlement, extending out from the old Roman defences, with the Shambles forming a street running along the wall on the east. Archaeological evidence suggests that the burh had 4,650 feet (1,417 m) of walls in total; documentary evidence from the Burghal Hidage document, written shortly after the creation of the walls, suggests they were 4,960 feet (1,512 m) long, a discrepancy that may <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by changes {{in the course of the}} river since the 10th century. The walls incorporated the old Roman fortifications on the south and south-east side of the city and appear to have included a defensive ditch, with a revetment supporting a wooden palisade.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronicle of}} John of Winterthur {{contains}} {{a reference to}} Gediminas' eight sons. The names of seven sons {{can be found in}} various written sources, while the identity of the eighth remains disputed. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that this son was the Duke of Trakai who perished in 1337 in the attack on Bayernburg. Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke himself or his second-in-command. Therefore, 18th- and 19th-century historians believed that it was Gediminas himself who died at Bayernburg. Nikžentaitis further postulates that the name of the unknown son might have been Vytautas, as records mention a young and powerful Yuri, son of Vytautas and deputy of Andrei, son of Algirdas. Yuri died in 1348. His high position in youth could easily <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by being a grandson of Gediminas. However, others dispute these theories, arguing that the note in John of Winterthur's chronicle was misinterpreted.|$|E

Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can <b>be</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, {{which are not}} specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role}} in this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E
