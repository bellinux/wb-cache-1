5|$|In 1974, {{there was}} a bomb {{explosion}} in the Mortar Room in the White Tower, leaving one person dead and 35injured. No one {{claimed responsibility for the}} blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was <b>behind</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how many {{geographical}} names were changed under the ordinance. The ultimate overarching objective <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> failed due {{to the collapse of}} the Ottoman government and trials of its leaders before Ottoman and European courts for massacres against ethnic minorities committed in 1915.|$|E

5|$|The game {{introduces}} a four-player option in Versus Mode, giving a player four characters who can fight two-on-two, three-on-one or everyone-for-themselves. There are two fighting planes, {{one in the}} foreground and the other <b>behind</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 1943 {{attempt by}} Somervell {{to abolish the}} Technical Services failed amid the furor and panic created by false rumors {{that he was being}} {{considered}} for the post of chief of staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. Somervell sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects, such as the Canol Road, which he continued long after the strategic imperative <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> had faded.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front bypassed the storm to the south, and a building ridge <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on January28, an advancing trough turned the storm to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and on January30, the MFO estimated a secondary 10minute wind peak of 85km/h (50mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on January31 well to the south-southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E
50|$|The Lycurgus Cup; no inscription, but {{the glass}} is dichroic, {{changing}} colour when lit from <b>behind.</b> <b>Its</b> origins are unknown, but it has probably always been above ground. This is significantly larger than the geometrical beakers, with a height of 158.8 mm (6.25 in).|$|R

5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story <b>behind</b> <b>it.</b> By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in Yosemite Valley {{and access}} to the park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain a swamp <b>behind</b> <b>it.</b> Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill passed}} in the Congress with {{bipartisan}} support. By 2015, criticism from right, left, and center had accumulated so much that a bipartisan Congress stripped away the national features of No Child Left <b>Behind.</b> <b>Its</b> replacement, the Every Student Succeeds Act, turned the remnants over to the states.|$|R

The eDNA stays behind in the environment, and slowly dissipates over time.|$|R
5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely <b>behind.</b> <b>It</b> was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Informant Michael Marks awakens in a {{room with}} a spike-filled mask locked to his neck. A {{videotape}} informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key, which has been surgically implanted and sealed <b>behind</b> <b>it.</b> He sets off the timer and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.|$|E

5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> Freedom Writers had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had flopped that same year.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} in Depot Town are two or three stories. At the east end, the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum building is a single story. East of Rice Street, the building facing Cross Street from the north is four stories, while the freighthouse <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> is a single tall story. Toward {{the west end of}} Depot Town, on both sides of Cross Street, there are several one-story structures, which are of more-recent construction than the taller buildings.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded {{downtown}} Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, {{was blocked}} by debris, and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed <b>behind</b> <b>it.</b> The resulting deluge destroyed 225houses and killed 36people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.|$|E
