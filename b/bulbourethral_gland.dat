5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E
25|$|Primary sex {{characteristics}} are those {{directly related to}} the sex organs. In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum, followed by growth of the penis. At the time that the penis develops, the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation. Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.|$|E

40|$|Ten sexually mature, {{clinically}} healthy male European shorthair cats aged 1 − 2 years were studied. The <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> were examined after preliminary anaesthesia and catheterisation of the urethra. A perineal sonographic approach was {{used on a}} CHISON 600 VET equipment and multifrequency microconvex C 20605 probe with a working frequency of 7 MHz. The musculoskeleal periphery of the gland was visualized as hyperechoic vs the parenchyma, uniform in both aspects (sagittal and transversal), and glands were depicted with an ovoid shape. In five studied animals, <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> were surgically removed after euthanasia and were investigated in a liquid isotonic medium with regard to compare their sonographic features with the normal topography. The analogous results obtained via both methods allowed us to propose the use of perineal ultrasonography as a sufficiently definitive and less invasive method for visualization of feline <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> in transversal and sagittal section...|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Suporn's method {{differs from}} most MTF SRS {{in that he}} does not use the penile {{inversion}} method. He instead constructs the vaginal canal with scrotal skin and uses the penile tissues for the labia, clitoris, and other external features. A full thickness inguinal (groin crease) skin graft is used for the vaginal lining in cases where inadequate scrotal skin is available. Dr. Suporn's method generally yields a deeper neovagina than the more standard penile inversion technique [...] and positions the areas of greatest sensitivity at the same locations as on cisgender women. Suporn's form of vaginoplasty has been referred to as the Suporn technique. Dr. Suporn always retains the Cowper's gland or <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland.</b> In transgender females this <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> is responsible for the thin, colourless lubricating fluid that is secreted during sexual arousal, which also adds to the natural lubrication.|$|E
50|$|During a male orgasm, sperm are {{released}} from the epididymis and travel via small tubes called the vas deferens. The sperm mix with seminal fluid in the seminal vesicles, prostate fluid from the prostate gland, and lubricants from the <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland.</b> During climax, muscles {{at the end of}} the bladder neck tighten to prevent retrograde flow of semen. In retrograde ejaculation, these bladder neck muscles are either very weak or the nerves controlling the muscles have become damaged.|$|E

50|$|During {{the process}} of ejaculation, sperm passes through the {{ejaculatory}} ducts and mixes with fluids from the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> to form the semen. The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscous fluid rich in fructose and other substances that makes up about 70% of human semen. The prostatic secretion, influenced by dihydrotestosterone, is a whitish (sometimes clear), thin fluid containing proteolytic enzymes, citric acid, acid phosphatase and lipids. The <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> secrete a clear secretion into the lumen of the urethra to lubricate it.|$|R

50|$|The Bartholin's glands (also called Bartholin glands {{or greater}} {{vestibular}} glands) are two pea sized compound racemose glands located slightly posterior {{and to the}} left and right of the opening of the vagina. They secrete mucus to lubricate the vagina and are homologous to <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> in males. However, while Bartholin's glands are located in the superficial perineal pouch in females, <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> are located in the deep perineal pouch in males. Their duct length is 1.5 to 2.0 cm and open into navicular fossa. The ducts are paired and they open {{on the surface of the}} vulva.|$|R
50|$|Ejaculation {{occurs in}} two stages, the {{emission}} {{stage and the}} expulsion stage. The emission stage involves the workings of several structures of the ejaculatory duct; contractions of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles, the <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> and the vas deferens push fluids into the prostatic urethra. The semen is stored here until ejaculation occurs. Muscles {{at the base of}} the penis contract in order to propel the seminal fluid trapped in the prostatic urethra through the penile urethra and expel it through the urinary meatus. The ejaculate is expelled in spurts, due to the movement of the muscles propelling it. These muscle contractions are related to the sensations of orgasm for the male.|$|E

For the first half of the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} {{a case of}} multicystic degeneration of the Cowper's gland in a 1. 3 -year-old purebred Large White intact boar with reduced fertility in Switzerland. Based on the case history, a general physical examination, an andrological investigation and a transrectal ultrasonography combined with a subsequent thorough pathological examination including histology a multicystic degeneration of the Cowper's gland were diagnosed. The case indicates that cystic degeneration of the <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> should be contemplated in the differential diagnoses of andrological disorders {{even though it has}} not been described in pigs so far.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the topography, biometry and light microscopy image of the vesicular and <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> in order to analyze morphologic features of the accessory sexual glands in castrated and non-castrated animals. Materials and Methods: The morphology of the accessory sexual glands was investigated in 14 adult Santa Ines breed sheep, weighing 32 kg, on average. Six of them were castrated, and eight, non-castrated. For macroscopic study, the description of these two glands was carried out, as well as dissection and biometry study. Moreover, weight, length, height and width measurements were evaluated. For histological analysis, the vesicular and <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> were sampled. Results: The topography of the reproductive glands was similar to bovine species. However, lower macroscopic measurements (p < 0, 05) in the glands of the castrated sheep were evidenced when compared with the non-castrated ones. Characteristics such as shape of the glands, composition of the layer mucosa, the lamina propria, muscular, the excretory ducts and the adventitia were determined. Conclusion: Sheep castration promoted changes in the biometric measures of the glands, which were lower in castrated animals. The morphological and biometric characteristics of the vesicular and <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>glands</b> in sheep were determined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} 17 β- 19 -nortestosterone (17 βNT) treatment of barrows on residue levels and on growth results, an animal experiment was conducted. Five barrows were treated 3 times during the fattening period with 17 βNT phenylpropionate (Nandrosol, nandrolone phenylpropionate 50 mg/ml, 1 mg/kg BW). Another 5 barrows were not treated, and 5 boars (not treated) were kept as a positive control. Boars and treated barrows showed 13 % and 9 % better growth than not-treated barrows, leading to mean final body weights of 121. 6, 117. 8 and 109. 0 kg respectively. Moreover the bulbourethral glands of the treated barrows were 3 times heavier than the not-treated barrows. The histology of the prostate and <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> of the treated barrows was comparable to the boars, whereas the control barrows showed atrophic glands.

40|$|ABSTRACT This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between echogenicity, testicular biometry, and accessory gland biometry and evaluate the echogenicity pattern of these structures in Santa Ines rams. Fifty-four healthy Santa Ines sheep were classified into three age groups: group 1 - 3 to 5 months (pre-pubertal); group 2 - 7 to 11 months (pubertal); and group 3 - 13 to 28 months (sexually mature). The averages of testicular biometry and <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> biometry were different among age groups. The testicular parenchyma was homogeneous with low echogenicity (pre-pubertal group) and medium echogenicity (pubertal and sexually mature groups), suggesting that testicular echogenicity can be a helpful tool to identify the start of puberty. The accessory glands were heterogeneous with low echogenicity in all age groups. Correlations were high between weight, biometry of testis and of <b>bulbourethral</b> <b>gland</b> and echogenicity of the accessory glands, indicating that sexually mature rams with higher body development have larger testicles and larger glands. We recommend the use of testicular biometry as a complementary evaluation of the reproductive efficiency of Santa Ines rams. The average values of echogenicity and the biometry of accessory glands are important parameters to assist the selection of breeding rams...|$|E
40|$|In an {{experiment}} using ten boars, {{the distribution of}} classical swine fever virus (CSFV) was determined in the male reproductive tract by in situ hybridization {{over a period of}} 120 days after intranasal in-oculation.
