6000|$|It {{has been}} seen, as in Chart No. XIII, that, {{considering}} the [...] {{exports and imports}} merely as merchandise, there is, in fact, no [...] actual equilibrium {{at any given time}} in accordance with the [...] equation of International Demand. Another element, the “financial [...] account” between the United States and foreign countries, must be [...] considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring [...] about the equation. If we had been borrowing largely of England, [...] Holland, and Germany, we should owe a regular annual sum as [...] interest, and our exports must, as a rule, be exactly that much [...] more (under right and normal conditions) than the imports. Or, [...] take another case, if capital is borrowed in Europe for railways [...] in the United States, this capital generally comes over in the [...] form of imports of various kinds; but, if our exports are not [...] sufficient at once to balance the increased imports, we go in debt [...] for a time—or, in other words, in order to establish the balance, [...] we send United States securities abroad instead of actual exports. [...] This shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the [...] exports; and so we find a period, like that during and after the [...] war, from 1862 to 1873, of a vast excess of imports. Since 1873 [...] the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred [...] in the former period; {{and there has been a}} vast excess of exports [...] over imports, and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium. But [...] our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to [...] us, producing a return current to balance the excessive [...] exports.(280) In brief, the use of securities and various forms of [...] indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred, [...] so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an [...] excess of exports at another, and generally a later, time. [...] Moreover, the large expenses of people traveling in Europe will [...] require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would [...] ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the [...] travelers. The financial operations, therefore, between the United [...] States and foreign countries, must be well considered in striking [...] the equation between our exports and imports. As formulated by Mr. [...] Cairnes,(281) the Equation of International Demand should be [...] stated more broadly, as follows: “The state of international [...] demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when [...] the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a [...] relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country [...] by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign [...] liabilities.” If we were a great lending instead of a great [...] <b>borrowing</b> <b>country,</b> we should have, as a rule, a permanent excess [...] of imports.|$|E

In 1850, Britain’s net overseas assets grew from 7 percent of the stock of net national wealth to 14 percent in 1870, and to around 32 percent in 1913 (Edelstein, 1994). The world had never before seen one nation committing so much of its national income and savings to {{foreign investment}}. Britain’s foreign lending practices possessed two technical aspects that gave greater credence to the prominence of sterling as a unit of storage and medium of exchange: first, British loans to foreigners were made in sterling, which allowed the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country</b> to service the debt more conveniently with its sterling reserves, and second, Britain’s use of written instructions to pay or bill exchanges were drawn in London to finance international trade ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{political}} factors that determine {{the price of}} loans offered to <b>borrowing</b> <b>countries</b> by multilateral development banks (MDBs). The reasons why MDBs set their prices at a given level and why those prices might vary from one MDB to another has received scant attention in academia, even though inexpensive loan costs are the primary reason <b>countries</b> <b>borrow</b> from MDBs. The paper explores these issues in three MDBs, each with a different composition of shareholding countries – the World Bank (controlled by wealthy non-borrowing countries), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) (more evenly balanced between non-borrowing and <b>borrowing</b> <b>countries)</b> and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) (controlled by <b>borrowing</b> <b>countries).</b> Evidence indicates that MDB shareholder composition has {{a major impact on}} loan prices, in sometimes unexpected ways. While the backing of wealthy countries allows the World Bank and IADB to raise resources on capital markets more cheaply than the CAF, the interests of those same non-borrowing countries in using MDB net income make loan costs significantly higher at those MDBs – especially the World Bank – than they would be otherwise. These results provide support to an institutionalist approach in focusing on the importance of shareholding and voting rules to better understand MDB activities...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, some proponents of {{structural}} adjustment, {{such as the}} World Bank, have spoken of [...] "poverty reduction" [...] as a goal. SAPs were often criticized for implementing generic free-market policy and for their lack of involvement from the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country.</b> To increase the borrowing country's involvement, developing countries are now encouraged to draw up Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which essentially {{take the place of}} SAPs. Some believe that the increase of the local government's participation in creating the policy will lead to greater ownership of the loan programs and thus better fiscal policy. The content of PRSPs {{has turned out to be}} similar to the original content of bank-authored SAPs. Critics argue that the similarities show that the banks and the countries that fund them are still overly involved in the policy-making process. Within the IMF, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility was succeeded by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which is in turn succeeded by the Extended Credit Facility.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} external borrowing {{from the perspective of}} the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country.</b> The first section sketches a formal framework for optimal borrowing by a developing country, as seen from the planner's point of view. The next three sections use this framework for the development of three important limits on external borrowing: the problem of solvency, the problem of liquidity and the problem created by the possibility of repudiation. The fifth section relates external borrowing to macroeconomic management of the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country,</b> and the sixth section pulls together the many factors that suggest that external debt of a country should be subject to central management or at least surveillance. Following that, we offer some guidelines for limits to the magnitude of external debt, and then discuss the character or mix of external debt. In an appendix, we present various simulation exercises for optimal debt management in a discrete-time infinite-horizon setting. ...|$|E

40|$|Why are {{international}} financial institutions important? This paper reassesses {{the role of the}} loans issued {{with the support of the}} League of Nations. These long-term loans constituted the financial basis of the League’s strategy to restore the productive basis of countries in Central and Eastern Europe in the aftermath of the war. We argue that the League's loans accomplished the task for which they were conceived because they allowed countries in financial distress to access capital markets. The League adopted an innovative system of funds management and monitoring that ensured compliance of <b>borrowing</b> <b>countries</b> with its programs. We provide empirical evidence that financial markets viewed the League’s role as an external, multilateral agent positively, solving the credibility problem of <b>borrowing</b> <b>countries</b> allowing them to engage in economic and institutional reforms. This success was achieved despite the League’s own lack of lending resources. We also demonstrate that this multilateral solution performed better than the bilateral arrangements adopted by other governments in Eastern Europe because of its lower borrowing and transaction costs...|$|R
40|$|Reform of the {{mechanisms}} and procedures through which problems of sovereign debt sustainability are resolved {{is at the}} center of the effort to make the international financial system more resilient and less crisis prone. Governments that default on their debts must embark on lengthy and difficult negotiations. Lenders and borrowers, uncertain of one another’s willingness to compromise, may engage in costly wars of attrition, delaying agreement on restructuring terms. Even if disagreements about the debtor’s willingness and ability to pay are put to rest, dissenting creditors may continue to block agreement until they are bought out on favorable terms. In the interim, the creditors receive no interest, and the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country</b> loses access to international capital markets. The exchange rate may collapse, and banks with foreign-currency-denominated liabilities may suffer runs. To avert or delay this costly and disruptive crisis, the International Monetary Fund will come under intense pressure to intervene, provoking all the controversy that IMF intervention typically entails. Officials of the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country,</b> for their part, will go to great lengths to avoid seeing the country placed in this difficult situation. They may raise interest rates, run down their reserves, and put their economy through a deflationary wringer, all at considerable cost to society.

40|$|The author {{examines}} the optimal pattern of lending {{in an environment}} in which there are two impediments to contracting. The first impediment is that lenders cannot observe whether borrowers invest or consume borrowed funds. This impediment leads to a moral hazard problem in investment.

The optimal contract is shown to specify that the <b>borrowing</b> <b>country</b> experience a capital outflow when the worst realizations of output occur.
