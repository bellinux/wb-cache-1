40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the complex vortex flow patterns within a novel active micro-rotor mixer under various Reynolds numbers and rotating speeds by employing of CFD technique. The concept of present micro-rotor mixer is inspired from the Wankel-type combustor which is widely used in the power machines. The configuration of present micro-mixer is consisted of a rotor with shape of triangle column, a <b>blending</b> <b>chamber</b> and individual inlet and outlet ports. The <b>blending</b> <b>chamber</b> is served as the mixing chamber since the separated three sub-regions will change their volumes as the rotor undergoing the rotating motion with a fixed eccentricity. The dynamic flow patterns and mixing process of two species within the mixing chamber were simulated and visualized with streak lines. The governing equations are unsteady, two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the two working fluids are pure water and alcohol. The concentration equation for species is also solved to reveal the mass transfer process in various sub-regions then being calculated on the outlet port to evaluate the mixing efficiency. The dynamic mesh technique was applied to re-distribute the computational meshes when the rotor finished a complete rotation cycle. Inspection on the flow developing stages within the mixing chamber over one complete cycle, it seems that multi-vortex flow field was generated due to th...|$|E

Weber's compositions <b>blend</b> <b>chamber</b> jazz, European classical music, minimalism and ambient music, and are regarded as characteristic examples of the ECM Records sound.|$|R

For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly <b>blend</b> into <b>chamber</b> music.|$|R
50|$|It {{eventually}} became above {{that the system}} of alternating with the Sejm in using the latter's debating chamber was {{becoming more and more}} problematic, and so, after another 18 months, during which the Senate made use of the Hall of Columns in the Sejm, work on the new Senate chamber finally began. The project revolved around a plan designed by architects Andrzej and Barbara Kaliszewski and Bohdan Napieralski, which would see three conference rooms {{on the first floor of}} what is now the Senate building combined to make one usable space, whilst not changing the external elevations of the building or significantly changing its interior style or character. Decorated in a scheme close to that of Pniewski's, which utilises a great number of soft shades of white and grey, the Senate <b>chamber</b> <b>blends</b> well with the rest of its architectural surroundings. The furniture for the chamber, much of which is upholstered in blueish-grey material was specially designed for the Senate's use and incorporates many design features characteristic of 1950s Polish modernism.|$|R
40|$|Nanocompósitos baseados em policarbonato e argila organofílica foram obtidos pelo método de intercalação por fusão em câmara de mistura sob diferentes valores de torque e temperatura. A influência desses parâmetros na qualidade da dispersão da argila na matriz polimérica foi investigada por ressonância magnética nuclear (RMN) de baixo campo, empregando o tempo de relaxação {{longitudinal}}, T 1 H, e por difração de raios X. As diferenças nos tempos de relaxação longitudinal e nos padrões de difração de raios X foram correlacionadas com a formação de domínios com mobilidades distintas. O nanomaterial formado apresentou morfologia intercalada com afastamento crescente das camadas de argila, conforme as condições de processamento se tornavam mais severas. A RMN ¹H mostrou que tanto o cisalhamento quanto a temperatura afetaram a mobilidade das cadeias poliméricas, explicitando a homogeneidade crescente da distribuição dos domínios de relaxação, de acordo com o aumento do torque e da temperatura. Polycarbonate-organofilic clay nanocomposites {{were obtained}} via the melt intercalation method in the <b>blending</b> <b>chamber</b> of a torque rheometer, under distinct values of shear and temperature. The influence of those processing parameters on the clay dispersion in the polymer matrix was probed by low-field {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR), using the T 1 H measurement technique and by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The differences in longitudinal relaxation times and in the X-ray reflection patterns were correlated {{with the formation of}} relaxation domains with particular molecular mobility, as progressively larger intercalated morphologies were found in the nanocomposites due to the increase of shear stress and temperature. ¹H NMR has shown that both shearing and temperature have played a fundamental part on the polymer chains mobility, which explains the increase in the domain´s homogeneity following the increment of those processing parameters...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This study {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of ignition by hot combustion gases which finds application in internal combustion chambers with pre-chamber ignition as well as in wave rotor engine applications. The experimental apparatus consists of two combustion chambers: a pre chamber that generates the transient hot jet of gas and a main chamber which contains the main fuel air blend under study. Variables considered are three fuel mixtures (Hydrogen, Methane, 50 % Hydrogen-Methane), initial pressure in the pre-chamber ranging from 1 to 2 atm, equivalence ratio of the fuel air mixture in the main combustion chamber ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 5, and initial temperature of the main combustion chamber mixture ranging from 297 K to 500 K. Experimental data makes use of 4 pressure sensors with a recorded sampling rate up to 300 kHz, as well as high speed Schlieren imaging with a recorded frame rate up to 20, 833 frame per seconds. Results shows an overall increase in ignition delay with increasing equivalence ratio. High temperature of the main <b>chamber</b> <b>blend</b> was found not to affect hot jet ignition delay considerably. Physical mixing effects, and density of the main chamber mixture have a greater effect on hot jet ignition delay...|$|R
