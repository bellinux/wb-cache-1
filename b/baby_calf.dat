25|$|Milk is {{extracted}} from the cow's udder by flexible rubber sheaths known as liners or inflations that are surrounded by a rigid air chamber. A pulsating flow of ambient air and vacuum {{is applied to the}} inflation's air chamber during the milking process. When ambient air is allowed to enter the chamber, the vacuum inside the inflation causes the inflation to collapse around the cow's teat, squeezing the milk out of teat in a similar fashion as a <b>baby</b> <b>calf's</b> mouth massaging the teat. When the vacuum is reapplied in the chamber the flexible rubber inflation relaxes and opens up, preparing for the next squeezing cycle.|$|R

The plural form is pygmy hippopotami (hippopotamuses is also accepted as a plural form by the OED, or pygmy hippos for short). A male {{pygmy hippopotamus}} {{is known as a}} bull, a female as a cow, and a <b>baby</b> as a <b>calf.</b> A group of hippopotami is known as a herd or a bloat.|$|R
40|$|The elucidation of {{the sources}} of n- 3 fatty acids {{available}} for the humans in the Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic is highly relevant in order to ascertain the availability of such nutrients in that time frame as well as to draw useful conclusions about healthy dietary habits for present-day humans. To this end, we have analysed fat from several frozen mammals found in the permafrost of Siberia (Russia). A total of 6 specimens were included in this study: 2 mammoths, i. e. <b>baby</b> female <b>calf</b> called "Lyuba" and a juvenile female called "Yuka", both specimens approximately from the same time, i. e. Karginian Interstadial (41, 000 and 34, 000 years BP); two adult horses from the middle Holocene (4, 600 and 4, 400 years BP); and two bison very close to the Early Holocene (8, 200 and 9, 300 years BP). All samples were analysed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) and GLC-flame ionization detector (GLC-FID). As demonstrated in this work, the fat of single-stomached mammals often consumed by Palaeolithic/Neolithic hunters contained suitable amounts of n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids, possibly in quantities sufficient to meet the today's recommended daily intake for good health. Moreover, the results also suggest that mammoths and horses at that time were hibernators...|$|R

50|$|That night, {{the animals}} throw {{a party in}} the barn. All the animals at the {{barnyard}} are there except Ben, who guards the fence line. Otis is assigned a shift along with Ben, but Otis talks himself out of work. Before Otis leaves, Ben tells him that the night he found him as a <b>baby</b> <b>calf</b> stumbling alone in the meadow, he swore he saw the stars dance, thus giving him reason to know his place was at the farm. Later, Ben takes on a pack of coyotes led by Dag, who is a serial killer turned coyote plundering the chicken coop. He manages to fight off the pack until he is bitten on the leg by the red coyote, making him fall. The Coyotes pile on Ben, but he manages to grab Dag and escapes the pile. He threatens to punch Dag but lets him go, scaring away him and the coyotes. Ben falls on the ground, exhausted. A hen named Etta runs into the barn and tells Otis and he runs outside to his father. Ben dies and is buried on his favorite hill by the old farmer Jenkins, and the other animals mourn Ben after the farmer leaves.|$|E
50|$|One day, Subbulakshmi's pet cow, Lakshmi, {{gives birth}} to a {{beautiful}} <b>baby</b> <b>calf.</b> Lakshmi's mother is given to Subbulakshmi by Naachiyar as a wedding gift. This is a very happy occasion in the family. On the same day, Ganga is tested pregnant. The whole family rejoices and {{the women in the}} family crowd into Ellaiyamman temple to make pongal for the Goddess. Suddenly, winds are blowing and the brick stoves do not catch fire as they are supposed to. The women begin to do the Kummi Adi, a folk dance done by Tamil village women in a circle, to appease the Goddess. During the dance, the idol of the Goddess falls flat on the floor. Horrified, the people at the temple try to carry the idol and put it back in place, but they feel that the idol was very light and hollow. Selvakannan and Ganga were there too, and they realize that the idol has been changed into a fake one and the real idol is somewhere else. They now understand that this was why the Goddess did not punish Vandhana when she rubbed chili paste on the Goddess. Initially they all suspect Vandhana. After some arbitration and temple ceremonies, the real idol of the Goddess is found dumped in an unused temple tank. After some investigation by the police, through Ilavanji, it is found out that Kulasekharan is guilty of changing the idol.|$|E
5000|$|... "Stan's Food Restaurant" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reception from television critics and fans alike. It currently holds an average score of 6.9/10 by users of the Internet Movie Database, based on 38 votes. On TV.com, it currently retains an average score of 8.1 out of 10 by the users, based on 57 votes. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote a review with mixed reactions. He wrote, [...] "I don't {{have a lot to}} say about tonight's American Dad, which had a lot of my favorite elements of the show, from Stan and Roger working together to Stan trying to realize some long lost childhood dream to Steve putting up with someone who's bonkers just to get laid, but never gelled as much as I wanted it too." [...] However, he went on to praise the humor of the episode, writing, [...] "There were plenty of laughs, like Stan and Roger putting their argument on hold to go witness the birth of a <b>baby</b> <b>calf</b> or the increasingly insane list of things on Stan's restaurant." [...] Concluding the review for the episode, he wrote, [...] "I think where the episode ultimately didn't work as well for me was when the dueling restaurants plotline came along, simply because that split up Roger and Stan into two separate stories in an episode that didn't have room for that sort of thing. I get why it happened, and I liked Stan realizing his dream ..., but it felt like there was more to mine here than actually got mined, and that made the episode a funny one that didn't quite have a strong story to hold it together. He went on to give the episode a B-, the third highest grade of the night, beating out The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Little Man on Campus", but scoring lower than The Simpsons episode [...] "Lisa Simpson, This Isn't Your Life" [...] and Family Guy episode [...] "Baby, You Knock Me Out". Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave a positive review for the episode, writing, [...] "It was fun seeing Stan's restaurant actually succeed, once he got out from under the yoke of Roger taking over the first dream. Maybe pancake plates and chocolate chip meatballs are things MacFarlane has actually considered. I think the MacFarlane universe is big enough now to support a restaurant chain. Maybe he could partner with a theme park on rides." ...|$|E
