Gasol uses a variety of midrange jumpers, hook shots, up-and-under moves, and shot fakes to score very efficiently. In addition, his foot speed relative to his size allows him to run the fast break and finish effectively. He is also a skilled passer for a big man, earning 3.2 assists per game over his career. Defensively, he is an above-average shot blocker with a career average of 1.7 blocks per game.

40|$|Of the six core virtues (wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence) that Peterson and Seligman (2004) used as {{the basis}} of their seminal {{classification}} system, temperance is the virtue least portrayed in movies. And even in its rare appearances on the silver screen, the portrait of this virtue is one of perversion, as in The Scarlet Letter’s self-flagellating Reverend Dimmesdale.

Temperance is the least glamorous virtue; its expression is a direct contrast with the fast-paced culture of consumerism, and one <b>is</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a film that does not depict a character who has surrendered impulse control and engages in smoking, drinking, drugging, overeating, compulsive sex, or aggressive behavior (Niemiec & Wedding, 2008).

40|$|According to {{nineteenth and}} twentieth-century playwright George Bernard Shaw, a theatergoer with an {{appetite}} for “true comedy” in the late Victorian era <b>was</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any at all. Shaw defines true comedy as 2 ̆ 2 {{the fine art of}} disillusionment 2 ̆ 2; one found, instead, in the late-Victorian comedy, a lot of 2 ̆ 2 harmless laughter, 2 ̆ 2 or frothy escapism without a lot of deeper meaning(Meisel 122 - 123). Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s work, consisting of over sixty plays, is unusual because it attained much commercial success as it shattered Victorian theatrical tradition; a prime of this type of work is found in the 2 ̆ 2 Don Juan in Hell 2 ̆ 2 episode of Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 comedy and philosophy, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Man and Superman,” a dream sequence-like fragment of the third act. In this “Don Juan in Hell,” Ann, Jack, Ramsden, and Mendoza’s alter egoes from Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” meet in Shaw’s imagined hell and discuss love, war, religion, vitalism, and most interestingly, the status of women. The seemingly irrelevant nature of “Don Juan in Hell,” in addition to its humorous yet disturbing discussion of women’s roles not only breaks from late-Victorian theatrical tradition, but anticipates a style of writing and theatrical performance largely viewed as the epitome of modern theater: Brechtian 2 ̆ 2 alienation, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 estrangement. 2 ̆ 2 While I argue that Shaw’s playwriting in a way anticipates Brecht’s writing and theory, I also maintain that Shaw does not conform, exactly, to Brecht’s standards of the modern “epic” theater; Brecht describes the component of his “alienating” epic theater in his essay “Theatre for Pleasure or Theatre for Instruction,” which derives its title from the Horation platitude that theater should both “please and instruct. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} half-century some {{scholars}} have questioned the creative freedom of Old English poets, whose formulas were often reshapings of traditional poetic content. Although formulaic studies abound, they rarely have addressed clausal negation; yet one <b>is</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a more useful formal aspect than the ne particle, the sixth most frequent entry in the poetic works, and amply available for closely-detailed analysis. ^ This inquiry proceeds after the pattern of scholars like A. B. Lord who analyzed oral formulaic poetry according to units called “formulas,” “themes,” “blocks of lines,” and “larger syntactic units, even whole sentences, as units of composition. ” As Bates and others expanded the boundaries to include larger formulaic units, by analogy one can apply the clarity of a hierarchical overview to those forms and devices embodying and related to the tiny but pivotal core feature of negation. ^ Chapter One sets out several elemental varieties and levels of poetic negation, and illustrates some of their syntactic and semantic capabilities. Chapter Two broadens the discussion to wider-ranging negational strategies, including negative-comparatives, the widely-used negative-contrastive, “verse-paragraphs,” {{and a variety of}} others. The third chapter examines negational strategies and their versatile effects in three discrete and disparate poems. ^ Due to the frequency and fundamentality of negation, this inquiry has sought to test its usefulness as an investigatory window for poetic stylistics. Negational architectures, employed strategically and variously at multiple levels, are also shown to be touchstones of translational faithfulness, and markers for syntactic variations. By providing a linguistically factual network of corpus wide details, negational architectures, while demonstrating an extensive set of orchestrative options available to the Old English scops, also offer a ubiquitous and useful analytic axis for bridging generations of readerly perspectives. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{management}} of ulcer disease {{is one of}} the great stories in the history of general surgery.

One <b>is</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a vein of surgical thought with such a rich development of understanding of how anatomic and physiological principles can be used to create a myriad of mechanical solutions to functional as well as mechanical problems. For the beginning student of surgery, this history offers an excellent framework for one of the best examples of surgical investigation turned into practice. For the more senior student of surgery, these disorders provide a seemingly endless opportunity to learn and relearn lessons in management of the surgically ill patient. As with any worthy problem, patients who have these disorders give us an opportunity for great reward, and an equally great chance to be humbled. As is discussed in the article by Drs. Eswaran and Roy elsewhere in this issue, the nonoperative management of ulcer disease, both acid-mediated and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) -mediated, has made tremendous strides in the last 40 years. The net effect of this progress on surgeons is to have shifted the types of operations that we perform from a combination of emergent operations on ill people and an array of nearly elective operations on not-as-ill people, to ones of a more emergent nature upon generally even more ill patients [1, 2]. Also, the relative decrease in the need for these types of operations has left our ranks with a declining number of surgeons who have more than a passing familiarity with the practice of Surg Clin N Am 85 (2005) 907 – 929 these operations.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{definition}} of the information society lays emphasis upon spectacular technological innovation and the transformative effects of new information and communication technologies. The key idea is that breakthroughs in information processing, storage, and transmission {{have led to the}} application of information technology in virtually all, public and private, sectors of society (Webster, 1995). By the 1990 s, to admire and indeed enthuse over new ICTs had become highly fashionable and popular. Such technological enthusiasm has become so pervasive that it has seeped not only into political and policy discourses, but also into the whole spectrum of the media and fora of public communication (Preston, 2001). In addition, discourses of the information society are often dominated and shaped by male commentators (e. g., Castells, 2000; Gates, 1995; Kelly, 1999; Negroponte, 1995). For example, when compiling a collection of the dominant players of international information-society discourse, Cawley and Trench (2004) <b>were</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> female commentators, succeeding only in finding 3 {{out of a total of}} 18 critics. 1 We argue that the focus on the artefact, and thus technological celebration, takes precedence over the largely ignored field of technological uses and consumption issues. Hence, we present a study that analyses the individual user experiences to challenge the stereotypical user traditions represented by the information-society discourse. We wish to present a counternarrative that shifts the emphasis from technical expertise, and technological and transformative benefits of artefacts to more individual-user-focused narratives. As a result, this brought about a dual-narrative process through which the respondents described their experiences. We found that when people described their uses, consumption patterns, and domestication 2 experiences of ICTs, they tended to do so by employing contrasting frames of reference. These frames of reference we have termed the objective lens (or narratives) and subjective lens (or narratives). Through what we term objective narratives, we found that some respondents would describe their use through official and technical frames of reference. For example, they employed primarily dominant information-society jargon to frame how they made sense of technologies and their use experiences. Through subjective narratives, we found that respondents would describe their use and experiences from primarily a personal perspective to explain how the technology fitted their lives, the role it played in their everyday routines and habits, and the associated meaning and significance of the artefact. While these contrasting narratives are not mutually exclusive or contradictory, it became clear from the interviews that a pattern of use narratives was emerging. We found that such narratives slightly reinforced traditional gender roles in which men tend to talk about technologies in highly technical terms of reference, while women portray themselves as technologically helpless or ignorant (Gill & Grint, 1995; Gray, 1992; Lie, 1995). Although we did not look for or find stable gender categories, the emergent gender narratives seem to renew the existing gender roles that link masculinity and technology (Vehviläinen, 2002). With the development of computer technologies, we have witnessed a shift from IT to ICTs. This has resulted in a re{{definition of the}} computer as an artefact: from a mere computational device to the newly emergent multimedia-enhanced computers, or what Paul Mayer (1999, p. 1) calls a “meta-medium. ” Today, the conceptualisation of the computer is more problematic. It may be thought of as the Web or Internet, computer games, CD-ROMs (compact disc read-only memory), reference works, e-mail, and a diverse range of applications for displaying and manipulating text, images, graphics, music, databases, and the like.

Therefore, it is possible for wider audiences and previously excluded groups (such as the elderly and women) to translate the computer into something meaningful in their everyday lives.
