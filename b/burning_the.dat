40|$|The paper {{presents}} a physical-mathematical model for metallized solid propellant combustion under acceleration directed along the normal to <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> surface. <b>The</b> model {{takes into account}} the thermal effect of decomposition of the condensed phase, convection, diffusion, the exothermic chemical reaction in the gas phase, heating and combustion of Al particles in the gas flow, the flow of combustion products, the particle velocity lag relative to the gas and the field effect of acceleration on the motion of Al particles. The effect of the Al particle size and mass fraction, emitted from <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> surface, on <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> rate is also taken into consideration. The impact of the Al particle size, emitted from <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> surface, on <b>the</b> linear <b>burning</b> rate has been investigated under acceleration. The study results showed that with increasing acceleration <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> rate increased. It was also revealed that the larger was the size of aluminum particles emitted from <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> surface, <b>the</b> higher was the response of <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> rate to acceleration. The results showed that increasing the mass fraction of aluminum in the propellant composition led to an increase in the response of <b>the</b> relative <b>burning</b> rate. It was also found that <b>the</b> relative <b>burning</b> rate sensitivity increased with pressure above <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> surface. <b>The</b> results obtained are in a qualitative agreement with those described in the scientific literature...|$|R
5|$|By 1614, {{the ditch}} outside the walls {{appears to have}} been {{partially}} filled in and the reclaimed land rented out. During the English Civil War, Canterbury was initially held by Parliamentary forces. In 1647, however, riots broke out in protest over the actions of the city's Puritan mayor and Canterbury declared its loyalty for Charles I. Parliamentary forces intervened and reoccupied the city, <b>burning</b> <b>the</b> wooden city gates and deliberately damaging, or slighting, the walls near Canterbury Castle. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, new wooden doors were installed at the West Gate.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman {{launched}} a major campaign against Milutin, his Serbian neighbour to the west. Thanks {{to the support}} of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into Serbian territory and reached Hvosno in Kosovo.

Milutin's response to Shishman's act of aggression was much more successful. His counter-attack resulted in Serbian forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege.

The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E

5|$|From 1960, {{apparently}} {{in response to}} the book <b>burning,</b> <b>the</b> New York publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux began republishing his major works.

According to Sharaf, contributors to the Journal of Orgonomy who worked in academia often used pseudonyms. The Orgone Biophysical Research Laboratory was founded in 1978 by James DeMeo and the Institute for Orgonomic Science in 1982 by Morton Herskowitz.|$|E
