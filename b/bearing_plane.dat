40|$|Bolted joints {{involving}} composite plates used to {{be almost}} entirely dedicated to aerospace applications. As the need for energy conservation has increased, the field of composite bolted joints has found new applications in ground armoured vehicles. Thick panels able to withstand large in-plane and impact loads are critical. The present investigation evaluates the interior strain field, through the thickness, of a composite plate connected to an aluminium panel with a single-lap bolted joint. The area of interest is the <b>bearing</b> <b>plane</b> region close to the hole {{because of the presence}} of stress concentrations that heavily modify the stress field. Experimental data for the bolted joint were recorded by fibre-optic strain gauges that were embedded in the <b>bearing</b> <b>plane</b> of the composite plate. Numerical analyses were performed using ANSYS as a pre-processor and LS-DYNA as a solver. The overall goal was to evaluate the magnitude of contact strains around the hole and through the thickness of the composite. These values were analysed and compared with the finite-element method results: the finite-element analysis correlated reasonably well with the experiments. An investigation of error causes was also carried out, in particular to evaluate the influence of incorrect gauge positioning and the effect of friction coefficients. General design considerations were finally provided, based on the complete three-dimensional finite-element analysis...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{and a computer}} program for determining the steady-state response of a general rotor-bearing system, based {{on the concept of}} a dynamic stiffness matrix, are presented in this thesis. The rotor is idealized as an axial assemblage of beam elements that have continuous mass and isotropic, elastic properties. These properties are developed by using the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory equations to form the dynamic stiffness matrix. Transverse shear effects are neglected. Gyroscopic coupling effects, asymmetric linearized bearing properties, and unbalanced loading are represented as optional end effects on the beam elements. The development necessitated the use of complex variables to account for the coupling of motion in the two coordinate <b>bearing</b> <b>planes.</b> From the above development, a computer program was written and was applied to four test cases in order to identify the advantages and limitations of this technique.

The effects of clamping torque and friction on the contact stress and interlaminar normal stress are considered. From the analysis results, contact stress is bared mainly by the 0 ° layer. The distribution and magnitude of contact stress are conducted by friction. The effect of clamping torque on interlaminar normal stress is very strong.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers as {{a device}} for {{providing}} external damping in high speed machinery {{in general and}} aircraft gas turbines in particular have become an inevitable integral part of such rotating machines. The effective performance of such external damping devices depends {{on the behavior of}} support coefficients and the capacity for dissipating the unwanted energy generated from residual unbalance near or while crossing over the critical speeds. In this paper, the details of the experimental evaluation of the static stiffness of typical cantilevered type of damper rings through static loading and dynamic excitation technique, and some aspects regarding the study of the effects of a few important dimensionless geometric and operating parameters related to squeeze film dampers on dimensionless energy dissipative capacity of such damping devices are discussed. It is also observed that the ring behaves more like one with a fixed-constrained end condition rather than a fixed-free one. The energy dissipative capacity of the squeeze film damper can be enhanced by increasing the dimensionless load which can easily be altered by monitoring the external oil supply pressure which also incidentally controls the damper to operate in a 'no cavitation zone', thus implying that an increase in dimensionless load would result in higher damping compared to the increase in <b>bearing</b> <b>plane</b> stiffness...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{advantages}} of adhesive bonding, bolted joints are still used to fasten composite aircraft structures {{because of the}} ease of assembly/disassembly, minimal surface preparations, use of common tools between metal and composite structures and airworthiness certification. Joining or repairing external aircraft structures inevitably {{involves the use of}} countersunk fasteners, which can induce complex three-dimensional stress fields near the bolt hole. Since bolted joints incur significant penalty of low strength compared to pristine composite laminates, {{it is important to understand}} the damage mechanisms and develop design tools to enable better design and optimisation of composite joints so as to take full advantage of composite structures. This investigation focuses on single lap joints using countersunk fasteners, using both experimental testing and computational simulation techniques. Joints were tested in shear to failure at a range of bolt torques, hole clearances and countersunk depths to thickness ratio levels. To assist the development of predictive tools, straight-shank bearing tests were carried out to calibrate model parameters. Detailed microscopy analysis of failed specimens was conducted to characterise the through-thickness failure profile of countersunk bolted joints. Detailed finite element analyses using Abaqus/Explicit were conducted to gain insight into the behaviour of the single lap joints. The models accounted for in-plane and through-thickness composite damage, frictional contact, bolt torque and secondary bending effects in bolted joints under shear. The experimental investigation and finite element analyses showed that the through-thickness damage contained mainly interlaminar and intralaminar shear cracks and delamination. The variations in selected parameters had marginal effects on ultimate failure load of the joints; however the bearing load was significantly affected. The variation in bolt-hole clearance and countersunk depth to thickness ratio can produce significant variation in the through-thickness damage profile. As the countersunk depth to thickness ratio increased, the damage to the <b>bearing</b> <b>plane</b> of the joint increased. Catastrophic bending failure occurred for the highest ratio of countersunk depth to thickness. The finite element investigation showed that stress concentration factor at the hole edge increases with hole clearance. A detailed analysis of initiation and progression of damage, in the plane and through the thickness of the laminate has been performed. A review of the literature indicates that the detailed investigation of damage mechanisms and joint parameters presented in this thesis appears to be the first for joints involving countersunk fasteners. The present research also highlights a new method for determining the fracture energy associated with composite compression failure. The issues associated with the use of literature in determining material properties, friction coefficient and other modelling parameters are identified and discussed. The implications of capturing the overall effect of damage modes without a true mechanistic representation are also discussed. These new findings demonstrate that whilst capturing the overall behaviour and effect of joint parameters is possible, reliable predictive capability such as that required for aerospace design purposes remains a critical aspect for ongoing research...|$|E
