25|$|Actual bias is the {{influence}} of partiality and prejudice in decision-making, and actual prejudice against or in favour of a party. It must be proved on a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities.</b> However, it is understandably difficult to obtain evidence of actual bias. In any case, the common law protects litigants who can discharge the lesser burden of showing a real danger of bias without requiring them to show that such bias actually exists.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, the {{government}} appointed Ian Callinan, a retired {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, to conduct a second review of Bain's compensation claim. Callinan's report, in which he concluded that Bain was not innocent on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities,</b> was delivered to the Minister of Justice on 26 January 2016. The Minister announced that no compensation would be paid, but that Bain would be given an ex gratia payment of $925,000 if he agreed to stop all further legal action.|$|E

25|$|The Province of Saskatchewan {{chose not}} to present an affirmative case {{supporting}} {{the findings of the}} Chief Coroner. Accordingly, the lawyer representing the crown did not carry out in depth examinations of witnesses. Further, judicial inquests in Saskatchewan apply a much lower standard for determining cause of death (<b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> or 51%) than do determinations by the Chief Coroner (reasonable doubt or 95%). On 1 November 2007, following three days of testimony and examination of photographs of Carnegie's body and the site of the incident, a six-member jury concluded that wolves were responsible for Carnegie's death.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{recognized}} that the approach adopted towards fair criticism has a practical implication on the evidential burden. If fair criticism goes towards liability, the burden {{would be on the}} party alleging the contempt to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement is not fair criticism and poses a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. Conversely, if fair criticism is a defence to an allegation of contempt, the burden would be on the alleged contemnor to show on a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> that the statement amounts to fair criticism.|$|E
25|$|Although Levine {{ruled in}} Marsden's favour on the {{allegations}} of child sexual abuse, his findings were deeply critical of Marsden in other regards. He found that Marsden had lied about several issues in the trial, notably his role in drafting a statutory declaration {{by one of the}} witnesses. He also found that on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities,</b> Marsden had used convicted rapist and murderer Les Murphy to persuade a witness to change his position, and had probably persuaded two other witnesses to influence another. According to then Sydney Star Observer editor Marcus O'Donnell, Marsden asked the Observer to publish the names of one of the prosecution witnesses, when there was a suppression order given {{on the grounds that the}} witness's life would be in danger if the name were published.|$|E

25|$|In United States law, {{epidemiology}} alone cannot {{prove that}} a causal association {{does not exist}} in general.

25|$|Dunduzu Chisiza {{had died}} in September 1962, {{apparently}} in a car crash, although many people in Malawi continue {{to believe he was}} murdered on Banda's instructions. Although the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> is that Chisiza's death was accidental, it is clear that before his death, he saw the possibility of a dictatorship as a major threat. His preference was for a strong central government uniting all sectional interests and allowing dissenting views to be expressed. In a pamphlet written shortly before his death, he argued that, whereas it was necessary for the strong leadership of one individual and acceptance of his decisions during an independence struggle, once independence had been achieved, the former subordinates should cease to be submissive. He considered that a leader surrounded only by willing subordinates would soon become dictatorial; a prescient claim in view of Banda's later actions. Chisiza agreed with Banda on many issues, however on others he dissented more, and more publicly, than any other minister.|$|E
25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and {{the burden of}} proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities,</b> that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence {{will be more likely to}} raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|E
500|$|Gairdner {{based his}} {{conclusion}} on a 1452/3 {{entry in the}} chronicle, in which the author namechecks Gregory as mayor, and the colophon {{at the end of}} the paragraph saying that [...] "Gregory Skinner, Mayor of London Anno xxx." [...] Thus, it has been suggested, he drew attention to himself. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the very mention of Gregory's mayoralty, which gave this chronicle its name, has also been of specific interest to other contemporary writers. Only part of Gregory's Chronicle could actually have been written by Gregory, as it continues to 1470, three years after Gregory's own death. Kingsford recognised this dilemma himself, in 1876, but a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> [...] "tended to confirm" [...] him in his original diognosis.|$|E
50|$|Under English {{defamation}} law, {{the burden}} <b>of</b> proving (on <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability)</b> the literal truth of every disparaging statement {{is on the}} defendant. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Three of the charged individuals (Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell) chose to apologise as requested by McDonald's. Steel and Morris, however, chose to defend the case.|$|R

If I had been called upon to decide the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> between the {{narrative}} related by Ambrose in his defense and the narrative related by Silas in his confession, I must have owned, no matter how unwillingly, that the confession was, to my mind, the least incredible story of the two.|$|R
500|$|The {{applicant}} has {{the initial}} burden of showing {{that he or}} she has a prima facie case that should be considered by the Court. Once this has been done, it is for the executive to justify the legality of the detention. One commentator has said that the applicant's task is to discharge his or her evidential burden, following which the public authority detaining the applicant has a legal burden of showing that the detention is lawful. The standard of proof required to be achieved by the authority is the civil standard of a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities,</b> but [...] "flexibly applied" [...] {{in the sense that the}} degree of probability must be appropriate to what is at stake. Thus, in Khawaja Lord Bridge of Harwich said that given the seriousness of the allegations against a detainee and the consequences of the detention, [...] "the court should not be satisfied with anything less than probability of a high degree".|$|E
500|$|Although fair {{criticism}} {{has been treated}} as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that [...] "the precise characterisation {{of the concept of}} fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, to that extent, to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The legal burden, on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 {{stipulates}} that where a defendant relies on some [...] "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" [...] in his defence, the legal {{burden of proof}} as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities.</b> For example, a person charged with being drunk {{in charge of a}} motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk. The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> that he was not likely to drive.|$|E

2500|$|Preponderance of the evidence, {{also known}} as <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities,</b> is the {{standard}} required in most civil cases and in family court determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act.

2500|$|Barnacles are {{displaced}} by limpets and mussels, which compete for space. They also have numerous predators.

In the swamping strategy, {{vast numbers of}} barnacles settle {{in the same place}} at once, covering a large patch of substrate, allowing at least some to survive in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probabilities.</b> Fast growth allows the suspension feeders to access higher levels of the water column than their competitors, and to be large enough to resist displacement; species employing this response, such as the aptly named Megabalanus, can reach [...] in length; other species may grow larger still (Austromegabalanus psittacus).|$|E
