5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not <b>boiling,</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not <b>boiling,</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E

Some {{prefer to}} quickly rinse pu-erh {{for several seconds}} with boiling water to remove tea dust which accumulates from the ageing process, then infuse it at the boiling point (100°C or 212°F), {{and allow it to}} steep from 30 seconds to five minutes.|$|E

Regions such as North Africa or Central Asia prefer a bitter tea, and hotter water is used. In Morocco, green tea is steeped in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} EastEnders {{popularity}} {{is that after}} episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> tea, a phenomenon known as TV pickup. Over five minutes, power demand rises by three GW, the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.75 million teakettles. National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge, asking for additional power from France if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, {{eviscerated}} {{and rinsed}} thoroughly with water. Air is pumped {{under the skin}} through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat. The duck is then soaked in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> a short while before it is hung up to dry. While it is hung, the duck is glazed {{with a layer of}} maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water. Having been left to stand for 24 hours, the duck is roasted in an oven until it turns shiny brown.|$|E

25|$|Lontong, {{popular in}} Indonesia and {{also can be}} found in Malaysia, is made of {{compressed}} rice that is then cut into small cakes. It is traditionally made by boiling the rice until it is partially cooked and packing it tightly into a rolled-up banana leaf. The leaf is secured and cooked in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> about 90minutes. Once the compacted rice has cooled, it can be cut up into bite-sized pieces. The dish is usually served cold or at room temperature with sauce-based dishes such as gado-gado and salads, although it can be eaten as an accompaniment to other dishes such as Satay and curries.|$|E
25|$|Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most {{commonly}} manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded {{together in a}} hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured {{to a number of}} specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.|$|E
25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E

50|$|Some larger {{installations}} utilize {{combined cycle}} generation. Usually {{this consists of}} a gas turbine whose exhaust <b>boils</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> a steam turbine in a Rankine cycle. The condenser of the steam cycle provides the heat for space heating or an absorptive chiller. Combined cycle plants with cogeneration have the highest known thermal efficiencies, often exceeding 85%.|$|R
500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> {{as long as it takes}} for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

2500|$|Boiling: Bringing {{it to its}} {{boiling point}} at , is {{the oldest and most}} {{effective}} way since it eliminates most microbes causing intestine related diseases, but it cannot remove chemical toxins or impurities. For human health, complete sterilization of water is not required, since the heat resistant microbes are not intestine affecting. The traditional advice of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than [...] Though the boiling point decreases with increasing altitude, {{it is not enough to}} affect the disinfecting process. In areas where the water is [...] "hard" [...] (that is, containing significant dissolved calcium salts), boiling decomposes the bicarbonate ions, resulting in partial precipitation as calcium carbonate. This is the [...] "fur" [...] that builds up on kettle elements, etc., in hard water areas. With the exception of calcium, boiling does not remove solutes of higher boiling point than water and in fact increases their concentration (due to some water being lost as vapour). Boiling does not leave a residual disinfectant in the water. Therefore, water that is boiled and then stored for any length of time may acquire new pathogens.|$|E
