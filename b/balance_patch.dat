40|$|The {{fruit fly}} Drosophila melanogaster {{has emerged as}} a model {{organism}} for research on social interactions. Although recent studies have described how individuals interact on foods for nutrition and reproduction, the complex dynamics by which groups initially develop and disperse have received little attention. Here we investigated the dynamics of collective foraging decisions by D. melanogaster and their variation with group size and composition. Groups of adults and larvae facing a choice between two identical, nutritionally <b>balanced</b> food <b>patches</b> distributed themselves asymmetrically, thereby exploiting one patch more than the other. The speed of the collective decisions increased with group size, as a result of flies joining foods faster. However, smaller groups exhibited more pronounced distribution asymmetries than larger ones. Using computer simulations, we show how these non-linear phenomena can emerge from social attraction towards occupied food patches, whose effects add up or compete depending on group size. Our results open new opportunities for exploring complex dynamics of nutrient selection in simple and genetically tractable groups. Mathieu Lihoreau, Ireni M. Clarke, Jerome Buhl, David J. T.

5000|$|Notwithstanding {{shifts in}} the {{critical}} appraisal of Raphael's work, the painting has enjoyed consistent admiration from other artists. Titian was strongly influenced by this portrait, and may have first viewed it in Castiglione's home in Mantua. The Venetian master's Portrait of a Man (Tommaso Mosti?) is generally seen as owing a strong compositional debt to Raphael's painting, and also reflects Castiglione's influential advice regarding the restrained elegance of attire recommended for courtiers. In 1639 Rembrandt drew a sketch of the painting while it was being auctioned in Amsterdam, and subsequently referenced the composition in several self-portraits. A copy of the painting, now in the Courtauld Institute of Art, was painted by Peter Paul Rubens. Both Rembrandt's and Rubens's versions display Baroque flourish, {{quite different from the}} original painting's sober restraint. In the 19th century Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres chose a frame for his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin much like that which adorned Raphael's painting, perhaps indicating Ingres's ambitions, while also underscoring the paintings' similarities of coloration and extraordinary illusionism. At the turn of the 20th century Henri Matisse copied the painting, and Paul Cézanne exclaimed of Raphael's portrait: [...] "How well rounded the forehead is, with all the distinct planes.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} in predicting whole catchment water balance from observations at patch scales motivate {{a search for}} theories that can account for the complexity of interactions in catchments. In this paper we suggest that the spatial patterns of vegetation may offer a lens through which to investigate scale dependence of hydrology within catchments. Vegetation patterns are attractive because they are observable drivers of evapotranspiration, often a dominant component in catchment water balance, and because the spatial distribution of vegetation is often driven by patterns of water availability. We propose that nontrivial, scale‐dependent spatial patterns in both vegetation distribution and catchment water balance are generated {{by the presence of}} a convergent network of flow paths and a two‐way feedback between vegetation as a driver of evapotranspiration and vegetation distribution as a signature of water availability. Implementing this hypothesis via a simple network model demonstrated that such organization was controlled by catchment properties related to aridity, the network topology, the sensitivity of the vegetation response to water availability, and the point‐scale controls on partitioning between evapotranspiration and lateral drainage. The resulting self‐organization generated spatial dependence in areally averaged hydrologic variables, water balance, and parameters describing hydrological partitioning. This spatial scale dependence provides a theoretical approach to connect water <b>balance</b> at <b>patch</b> and catchment scales. Theoretical and empirical studies for understanding the controls of vegetation spatial distribution, point‐scale hydrological partitioning, and the implications of complex flow network topologies on the spatial scale dependence of catchment water balance are proposed as a research agenda for catchment ecohydrology...|$|R
5000|$|Size {{of habitat}} patches can also {{influence}} Karner blue butterfly abundance (see section [...] "Wild lupine"). At the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by Karner blue butterflies were larger than unoccupied patches. This {{was also the}} case at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. In addition {{to the effect of}} amount of wild lupine, a review suggests that it is easier to maintain Karner blue butterfly habitat in larger patches. Lane notes the need to find a <b>balance</b> between having <b>patches</b> of different required habitats within the activity range of Karner blue butterflies and having open areas large enough that they do not become shaded too quickly. Canopy openings with diameters of at least 82 feet (25 m) were recommended based on research at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and research in Wisconsin and Minnesota led to a recommended opening size of 1.5 times the height of adjacent trees. According to a review, subpopulations in habitat patches of less than 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) are vulnerable to extirpation.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the mass balance of two ice patches, Kringsollfonna and Evighetsfonna, {{in the area of}} Oppdal where archeological finds have been made. Archeological {{artifacts}} preserved within the ice patches and dating back as far as 3500 years BP have led to an interest among glaciologists, as these discoveries indicate that the ice patches have existed for a similar amount of time. The fact that the ice patches are found in periglacial areas, well below regional ELA, raises questions about processes related to their stable mass balance over time. In this study, the mass balance is measured through field studies, probing, snow density measurements and differential-GPS measurements over one mass balance season. The winter and summer balance is also modeled by the HBV-model, which is used as a basis of comparison for mass balance measurements and to analyze differences between mass balance seasons. The year 2012 was a positive mass balance season due to high levels of snowfall and the redistribution of snow. By analyzing the modeled and measured winter balance, the importance of the wind effect on snow accumulation is found, and shows a higher local accumulation on the ice patches than the estimated regional snowfall itself. In this sense, local terrain parameters and wind are crucial for accumulation on the ice patches, and the accumulation occurring over winter seems {{to be the most important}} factor for positive and stable mass <b>balance.</b> The ice <b>patches</b> differ in accumulation and the ablation patterns; the Kringsollfonna patch has qualities which are more closely related to the definition of an ice patch, whereas the Evighetsfonna patch is more characteristic of a small glacier. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emission}} from grassland-based {{agriculture is}} {{an important source of}} atmospheric N 2 O. It is hence crucial to explore various solutions including farm nitrogen (N) management to mitigate N 2 O emissions without sacrificing farm profitability and food supply. This paper reviews major N management practices to lower N 2 O emission from grassland-based agriculture. Restricted grazing by reducing grazing time is an effective way to decrease N 2 O emissions from excreta <b>patches.</b> <b>Balancing</b> the protein-to-energy ratios in the diets of ruminants can also decrease N 2 O emissions from excreta patches. Among the managements of synthetic fertilizer N application, only adjusting fertilizer N rate and slow-released fertilizers are proven to be effective in lowering N 2 O emissions. Use of bedding materials may increase N 2 O emissions from animal houses. Manure storage as slurry, manipulating slurry pH to values lower than 6 and storage as solid manure under anaerobic conditions help to reduce N 2 O emissions during manure storage stage. For manure land application, N 2 O emissions can be mitigated by reducing manure N inputs to levels that satisfy grass needs. Use of nitrification inhibitors can substantially lower N 2 O emissions associated with applications of fertilizers and manures and from urine patches. N 2 O emissions from legume based grasslands are generally lower than fertilizer-based systems. In conclusion, effective measures should be taken at each step during N flow or combined options should be used in order to mitigate N 2 O emission at the farm level. peer-reviewedDepartment of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ireland, Research Stimulus Fund (RSF 07 516, RSF 07 511...|$|R
40|$|In Sierra Nevada forests, shrubs are {{considered}} strong soil moisture competitors with regenerating trees, reducing seedling establishment, and slowing growth. Recent studies, however, {{suggest that in}} some circumstances shrubs can facilitate tree establishment and growth by modifying harsh microclimate conditions; increasing acquisition of water, carbon, and/or nutrients via shared mycorrhizal connections; or enhancing soil fertility, particularly under nitrogen-fixing shrubs such as Ceanothus spp. We examined the establishment dates and growth rates and patterns of white fir saplings growing in greenleaf manzanita, whitethorn ceanothus, and bare patches to examine whether establishment was correlated with past wet years, whether saplings growing in ceanothus had nitrogen-enriched foliage or faster growth rates than {{in the other two}} patches, and whether saplings in shrub patches experienced competition for light. Sapling establishment was not correlated with high precipitation or heavy snowpack years, suggesting shade-tolerant saplings do not need wet years to become established. Soils under ceanothus were nitrogen enriched, but white fir sapling foliage did not have higher nitrogen concentrations and saplings did not grow faster in ceanothus than in the other two patches. Because growth rates of saplings were comparable in all patch types examined despite significantly different edaphic and abiotic conditions, we inferred that the various competitive and facilitative interactions affecting tree growth are in net <b>balance</b> across the <b>patch</b> types examined. However, competition for light is important—a significant percentage of growth release events occurred after saplings emerged above their host shrubs. Where shrubs are present, shade-tolerant species (i. e., white fir) are favored over drought-tolerant (pine) species. Our results may help interpret changes in understory conditions that are contributing to mixed conifer’s compositional shift toward more shade-tolerant species after a century of fire-suppression...|$|R
