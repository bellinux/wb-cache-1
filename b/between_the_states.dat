Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights.

5|$|Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the {{authority}} to create a federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790. The Act established the District of Columbia {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of Maryland and Virginia to serve as the new federal capital. However, Robert Morris, a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Political Studies)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 This thesis {{examines}} <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{and civil}} society in Zimbabwe. <b>The</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{and civil society}} is discussed under the categories of the concepts democratisation, good governance and sustainable development. The nature of <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and civil society in Africa is examined to set out parameters for state-civil society debate in Zimbabwe. The discussion of <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and civil society in Zimbabwe is synthesised into three parts, the post-independence era, the post- 1990 s and the post- 2000. From these discussions {{it is argued that}} <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and civil society was peaceful {{in the first decade of}} independence and this was because <b>the</b> <b>state</b> maintained dominance and control over all sectors of civil society. However, the 1990 s saw a collapse of peaceful relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and civil society in Zimbabwe. The collapse of <b>the</b> peaceful relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and civil society came as a result of the country’s economic decline and the authoritarian practices in Zimbabwe, which saw the emergence of a confrontational civil society towards <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> In <b>the</b> early 2000 s, it is observed that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> became repressive towards civil society through the introduction of repressive laws which include Access to Information and Privacy Act (AIIPA) and the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). For peaceful relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and civil society to exist in a sustainable manner, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> must continuously promote and practice democracy and good governance. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should play a pivotal role of enhancing sustainable development in a manner that meets the socio-economic realities of its population. Master...|$|R

5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall Plan as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).|$|E
5|$|In 1800, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte {{advanced}} into Italy, achieving victories {{against the}} Austrian Empire {{at the battle}} of Marengo. After a year of warfare, the French and Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, which divided Northern Italy <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> and awarded the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to the French. Included in this division was the island of Elba in the Ligurian Sea off the Western Italian coast, which at that time was shared between Tuscany and the Kingdom of Naples. On 28 March 1801, the Treaty of Florence was signed between Naples and France, officially turning the entirety of Elba over to French control, although it had not yet been surrendered by its Neapolitan and Tuscan commanders.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E

5|$|Morehead {{moved to}} Louisville in 1859 {{and formed a}} law {{partnership}} with his nephew, Charles M. Briggs. In February 1861, he attended the Peace Conference of 1861 that tried to resolve the sectional differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> In May 1861, he was chosen as a delegate to the Border State Convention, an ultimately futile attempt to avert the Civil War. Morehead refused to sign the final document produced by the convention {{because he did not}} agree with all the statements it contained. He was an advocate of Kentucky's position of neutrality, but was personally sympathetic to the South and was an outspoken critic of the Lincoln administration. He condemned Secretary of State William H. Seward for cutting off trade with the South.|$|E
40|$|Interactions <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and Non-governmental Organisations {{have been}} {{heightened}} globally.

This dissertation seeks to examine relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and NGOs in Botswana. Botswana is a democratic country, which has been hailed as stable and a strong state, however, civil society in Botswana remains weak.

In doing so he lifts up a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the passions of political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E

5|$|The {{month of}} June 1950 began 44 years of {{constant}} activity at Limestone. On the 10th, the 7 officers and 78 airmen of the Limestone Detachment arrived, as the tenant unit during construction. Two days later, an aircraft from Oklahoma arrived. On the 15th, limited operations began at Limestone, as Cold War tensions began to heat up. The next day, a B-36 Peacemaker arrived and later departed. 1 July brought the re-designation of the Limestone Detachment as the 4215th Base Service Squadron. After the Korean War broke out, {{the decision was}} made to increase the squadron's size to 28 officers, 340 airmen, and 20 civilians. August brought the first permanently assigned aircraft, a C-47 Skytrain, and more aircraft using the base as a stopover <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> and Europe.|$|E
5|$|By 1854, {{when it was}} incorporated, Crescent City had a {{population}} of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, {{where there was a}} toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing back and forth <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.|$|E
5|$|The Presidency of the Council is not {{a single}} post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months the {{presidency}} rotates <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example, the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and Slovenia with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested. The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the High Representative since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E
