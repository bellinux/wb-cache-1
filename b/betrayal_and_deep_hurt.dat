But when they {{love each other}} better than life it cuts so <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> <b>hurts</b> so much that {{nine times out of}} ten they won't ever forgive each other.

It is not given us to know how some animals know laughter, and know when they are being laughed at; but it was this same way that White Fang knew it. And he felt shame that the man-animals should be laughing at him. He turned and fled away, not from the hurt of the fire, but from the laughter that sank even <b>deeper,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hurt</b> in the spirit of him. And he fled to Kiche, raging {{at the end of her}} stick like an animal gone mad--to Kiche, the one creature in the world who was not laughing at him.|$|R
