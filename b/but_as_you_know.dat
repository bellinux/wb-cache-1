Megan McArdle explains that she didn't cover it because it made her ill, but also how being pro-choice influenced writers saying [...] "most of us {{tend to be less}} interested in sick-making stories if the sick-making was done by 'our side,'" [...] saying, [...] "this story should have been covered much more than it was — covered as a national policy issue, not a 'local crime story.'" [...] Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, claims he wasn’t aware of the story until Thursday, 11 April, when readers began emailing him about it, saying “I wish I could be conscious of all stories everywhere, but I can’t be". [...] They ultimately decided that, in fact, the story warranted attention because of [...] "the seriousness and scope of the alleged crimes and because this was a case that resonated in policy arguments and national politics", adding “In retrospect, we regret not having staffed the trial sooner. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we don’t have unlimited resources, and [...] {{there is a lot of}} competition for our staff’s attention". He insisted that “we never decide what to cover for ideological reasons, no matter what critics might claim. [...] Accusations of ideological motives are easy to make, even if they’re not supported by the facts". The New York Times also acknowledged the lack of coverage and reported on the online campaign and subsequent increase in coverage of the case. While Powers' piece clearly sparked debate among journalists, Katherine Bindley also highlights contrasting views, as does Paul Farhi. [...] A column on Salon.com questioned whether the Gosnell case was an example of liberal media bias, saying that conservative media and politicians had also given little attention to the story until April 2013.|$|E

This also referred to the launch slogan of the A-league: [...] "It's football, <b>but</b> not <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it" [...] — part of the work Football Australia is doing to rebrand and relaunch the game.
