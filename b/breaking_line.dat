This paper proposes using a novel histogram analysis of LiDAR elevation data and LiDAR intensity data to automatically detect water bodies. Detection of water bodies using elevation information was verified by checking against LiDAR intensity data since the spectral reflectance of water bodies is very small compared with that of land and vegetation in near infra-red wavelength range. Detection of water bodies using LiDAR intensity data was also verified by checking against LiDAR elevation data. False detections were removed using morphological operations and 3 D <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> were generated. Finally, a comparison of automatically generated <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> with their semi-automated/manual counterparts was performed to assess the accuracy of the proposed method and the results were discussed...|$|R

Moreover, the pollutant transported more quickly as the emission location was closer to wave <b>breaking</b> <b>line,</b> and the pollutant near wave <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> transported more quickly with the increase of the incident wave height and offshore plane steepness.

40|$|Due {{to world}} wide flood events hydrodynamic-numerical (HN) water flow {{simulation}} became {{a topic of}} highest interest. Next to the consideration of physical properties, a high quality geometric model of the run-off surface is essential for these simulations. In the last years airborne laser scanning (ALS) became the prime data acquisition technique for the modelling of inundation areas. When fully exploiting this technique detailed and accurate surface models that fulfil the HN simulation requirements can be determined. For that aim an adequate georeferencing of the ALS data and advanced modelling strategies are necessary. This paper presents a fully automated procedure for the extraction of <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> from ALS data. These lines should support the generation of accurate digital terrain models. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the importance of relative georefencing of ALS data {{in order to allow}} an accurate <b>break</b> <b>line</b> modelling. Both issues are practically demonstrated by a project along the river Main. Next to documenting the geometric quality of the originally delivered ALS data, the paper presents the results after improving the georeferencing by means of strip adjustment, which for this project had to be realised without trajectory information. Furthermore, the results of the automatic <b>break</b> <b>line</b> determination process are presented. Finally, the paper provides a discussion of the results and an outlook into future work for automated <b>break</b> <b>line</b> determination. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} between topographic irregularities and wave-driven {{mean water}} {{motion in the}} surf zone is examined. This coupling occurs because the topographic perturbations produce excess gradients in the wave radiation stress that cause a steady circulation. This circulation, in turn, creates a sediment transport pattern that can reinforce the bottom disturbance and may thereby lead {{to the growth of}} large-scale bed forms. To investigate this coupling mechanism, the linearized stability problem with an originally plane sloping beach and normal wave incidence is solved in two different cases. First, the <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> is considered to be fixed, and second, the perturbations in water depth that produce a displacement of the breaker line are accounted for. The first case shows that the basic topography can be unstable with respect to two different modes: a giant cusp pattern with shore-attached transverse bars that extend across the whole surf zone and a crescentic pattern with alternate shoals and pools at both sides of the <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> showing a mirroring effect. In the second case, the varying breaker line may have a strong influence on the circulation. This is clear for the giant cusp topography whose growth is totally inhibited. In contrast, the morphology and the growth of the crescentic pattern remains almost unchanged. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|A {{high quality}} surface {{representation}} is indispensable for a hydrodynamic numerical model, which {{is related to}} nature. This relationship is defined by two-dimensional parameters (like bathymetry, bottom roughness and friction). Standard algorithms for meshing {{are not able to}} guarantee these requirements.

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} {{with its}} ability to penetrate vegetation and its extremely high point density allows for a completely new approach to semi-automatically delineate man-made features (“objects”) in forested areas {{as a basis for}} the management of such data in a GIS. In this paper, emphasis is laid on the detection of roads and buildings from laser scanning data. The basis of our analysis is the generation of a DTM actually representing the earth surface (no tree tops, no building roofs). From a slope model of the terrain, <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> can be detected by applying standard edge extraction techniques. However, the slope model is still too noisy to deliver “good ” (long, continuous) <b>break</b> <b>lines.</b> Thus, a pre-processing step making use of an edge-enhancing filter becomes necessary. From the results of <b>break</b> <b>line</b> detection, a new, geomorphologically revised terrain model can be derived. The <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> contain the road edges which can be interactively selected by the user. With respect to roads, the line extraction results can be improved using a snake algorithm. Building candidate regions can be detected from the differences of surface models derived from the original “last-pulse ” and “first-pulse ” laser data and the rectified ground model. The algorithm is based on a classification of elevation difference models followed by the improvement of classification results by a despeckle filter, the main problem being the distinction of tree tops from buildings. In this paper the algorithms involved for the solution of the above tasks are described and first test results are presented. KURZFASSUN...|$|R

The potential traffic noise reduction arising from use of acoustically-soft surfaces and artificial roughness (0. 3 m high or less) is explored through laboratory experiments, outdoor measurements at short and medium ranges and predictions. Although the applicability of ground treatments depends on the space usable for the noise abatement and the receiver position, replacing acoustically hard ground by acoustically-soft ground without or with crops and introducing artificial roughness configurations could achieve noise reduction along surface transport corridors without <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> of sight between source and receiver, thereby proving useful alternatives to noise barriers.

40|$|In {{previous}} work, we {{have developed}} a simple method to study {{the behavior of the}} Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean field spin glass model for high temperatures, or equivalently for high external fields. The basic idea was to couple two different replicas with a quadratic term, trying to push out the two replica overlap from its replica symmetric value. In the case of zero external field, our results reproduced the well known validity of the annealed approximation, up to the known critical value for the temperature. In the case of nontrivial external field, our method could prove the validity of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick replica symmetric solution up to a line, which fell short of the Almeida-Thouless line, associated to the onset of the spontaneous replica symmetry breaking, in the Parisi Ansatz. Here, we make a strategic improvement of the method, by modifying the flow equations, with respect to the parameters of the model. We exploit also previous results on the overlap fluctuations in the replica symmetric region. As a result, we give a simple proof that replica symmetry holds up to the critical Almeida-Thouless line, as expected on physical grounds. Our results are compared with the characterization of the replica symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> previously given by Talagrand. We outline also a possible extension of our methods to the broken replica symmetry region. Comment: 20 page...|$|E

Zn supplementation did not significantly increase body weight. <b>Breaking</b> <b>line</b> model analyses indicated that {{the weight of the}} pancreas, the organ most sensitive to excess Zn, significantly decreased with increasing Zn intake beyond 15 · 2  mg/d. Excess Zn has been suggested to accumulate in the liver, kidney and bone {{in order to protect the}} pancreas.

40|$|Measured {{insertion}} losses due to {{the ground}} effects associated with low configurations of loosely stacked household bricks on a car park are reported. A particularly successful design has {{the form of a}} two brick high square lattice which is found to offer a similar insertion loss to regularly-spaced parallel wall arrays of the same height but twice the total width. Part of the insertion loss {{due to the}} roughness configurations is the result of transfer of incident sound energy to surface waves which can be reduced by introducing wall absorption or material absorption in the form, for example, of shallow gravel layer. Predicted finite length effects have been explored using a Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain Method, which models the complete 3 D roughness profile. It is concluded from measurements and predictions that the lattice design has less dependence on azimuthal source-receiver angle than parallel wall configurations. These predictions are supported by measurements of level difference spectra as a function of azimuthal angle. A 2 D Boundary Element Method gives predictions that agree well with data for parallel wall arrays up to 16 m long and it is used to investigate the potential insertion loss of longer configurations up to 0. 3 m high. It has been found possible also to make predictions of the insertion loss due to infinitely long 3 D lattices using the 2 D BEM with the lattice represented by the surface impedance derived from fitting short range data with a slit-pore impedance model. The insertion losses of recessed configurations are predicted to be approximately 3 dB less than those of embossed configurations of the same size. Outdoor experiments also show that pathways can be made through such roughness configurations without significantly affecting their insertion loss. It is concluded that artificial roughness configurations could achieve substantial noise reduction along surface transport corridors without <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> of sight between source and receiver, thereby proving useful alternatives to noise barriers...|$|E
40|$|During the {{transformation}} of the low tide to the high tide, an exactly inverse phenomenon is occurred and the high tidal delta is formed at the mouth upstream. Increasing the tidal range does not affect the nature of this phenomenon and just change its intensity. In this situation, the inlet will be balance over time. A new relationship between equilibrium cross section and tidal prism for different tidal levels as well as sediment grading has been provided which its results are corresponded with results of numerical modeling. In the combination state, the wave height significantly affects the current and sedimentary pattern such that the wave height dimensionless index (Hw/Ht) determines the dominant parameter (the short period wave or tide) in the inlet. It is notable that in this state, the inlet will be balanced over the time. In order to calculate sedimentary phenomena, each of which are individually determined under solely wave and only tide conditions and then they are added. Estimated values are similar to numerical modeling results of the combination state considering nonlinear terms. Also, {{it is clear that the}} wave and tide performance is of meaning in the direct relationship with the water level. The water level change causes variations of the position of the <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> and sedimentary active area. It changes the current and sedimentary pattern coastward while does not change anything seaward. Based on modeling results of sediment transport due to the wave, tide and their combination, it could be said that the erosion at the mouth due to the wave is less than that due to the wave and tide combination. In these situations, tide and wave-tide combination increase the low tidal and high tidal delta volume, respectively. Hence, tide plays an effective role in changing sedimentary phenomena at the channel and mouth downstream. Whereas, short period and combined waves have a crucial role in varying the morphology and sediment transport coast ward...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} that the periodic features observed in the nearshore region {{are the result of}} self-organisational processes is investigated in this work. The behaviour of two numerical models, based on different techniques, has been analysed in order to describe the formation of periodic features in the surf and swash zone respectively. The appearance of periodic patterns in the nearshore region has been traditionally linked to the presence of standing edge waves with the topographic changes passively driven by the flow patterns. A more recent approach indicates the {{possibility that}} periodic patterns appear because of feedback processes between beach morphology and flow. In the first model, the coupling between topographic irregularities and wave driven mean water motion in the surf zone is examined. This coupling occurs {{due to the fact that}} the topographic perturbations produce excess gradients in the wave radiation stress that cause a steady circulation. To investigate this mechanism, the linearised stability problem in the case of an originally plane sloping beach and normal wave incidence is solved. It is shown that the basic topography can be unstable with respect to two different modes: a giant cusp pattern with shore attached transverse bars that extend across the whole surf zone and a crescentic pattern with alternate shoals and pools at both sides of the <b>breaking</b> <b>line</b> showing a mirroring effect. For the swash zone, the formation of beach cusps has been investigated. The several theories proposed in the past have been analysed and all the field and laboratory measurements available in the literature collected in order to test such theories. It is suggested that, with the available measurements it is not possible to distinguish between the standing edge wave model and the self-organisation approach. A numerical model based on self-organisation has been here developed and tested in order to understand the processes occurring during beach cusp formation and development, to evaluate the sensitivity towards the parameters used and to look at how the model might relate to field observations. Results obtained confirm the validity of the self-organisation approach and its capacity to predict beach cusp spacing with values in fair agreement with the available field measurements and with most of the input parameters primarily affecting the rate of the process rather than the final spacing. However, changes in the random seed and runs for large numbers of swash cycles reveal a dynamical system with significant unpredictable behaviour. A qualitative comparison between the model results and field measurements collected by Masselink et al. (1997) during beach cusp formation and development has also been performed on the basis of a non-linear fractal technique. Results indicate beach locations and time-scales where non-linearities are more important and self-organisation can play a fundamental role...|$|E
