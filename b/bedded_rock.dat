The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt is studied using constant strain rate biaxial tests performed on 24 <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt samples from Mount Sedom diapir. Careful measurements of elastic parameters in unload-reload loops {{indicate that they}} are influenced by confining pressure but are not sensitive to anisotropy. The yield stress is also influenced by confining pressure but not by anisotropy. The stress-strain curve therefore indicates isotropy up to the yield stress. Initiation of dilation marks the onset of dependence of volumetric strain on anisotropy. Major principal compressive stress at dilation (CT 1,d) is at maximum when compression is normal to bedding planes ({ 3 = 0 °), the stress decreases with increasing values of { 3, and minimum values are measured when compression is parallel to bedding planes ({ 3 = 90 °). Beyond onset of dilation point the relative dilation with respect to stress difference (V = l~ej~(CT 1 - CT 3) 1; CT 1 > CT 1,d; Mpa- 1) increases with decreasing confining pressure and with increasing { 3; namely, dilation is intensified with decreasing confining pressure and as the major principal compressive stress direction becomes parallel with bedding plane orientation.

For the relatively thin nature of <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt {{and the local}} presence of other sedimentary rock formations, the design and safety evaluation of well completion casing take greater challenges to the engineers than that of casing in other type formations, i. e., limestone and carbonatite. The 2 D and 3 D geomechanical models of casing-cement sheath-rock salt are established in the paper based on the field data to obtain the creep loads in casing and find the main reasons causing casing failure. In addition, the effects of non-salt layer dip angle, friction factor between salt and non-salt layers and non-salt layer thickness, etc., on the stresses and deformations of casing are studied. The comprehensive results show hoop creep loads are the main reasons causing casing failure rather than radial creep loads. The cement sheath can improve the safety and optimize force state of casing even in perfect wellbore, which disagrees with Willson’s view that the cement sheath can be neglected in a salt formation wellbore with high quality. The non-uniform factor of radial creep loads in cement sheath is slightly smaller than that of original in-situ stresses, while that of radial creep loads in casing is greatly smaller than it. The stresses and deformations of casing increase with increasing thickness of non-salt layer and decrease {{with the increase of}} friction factor.

In this study, the shrinkage of a specific clayey rock, Boom Clay, under drying conditions is experimentally investigated. This rock is a deep geological formation which is under study for high-level and long-life radioactive waste storage in Belgium. Two experimental campaigns are here presented. The first one, based on vapour equilibrium drying technique and completed by sample size manual measurement, aims to characterize the material shrinkage in balanced states.

40|$|An {{array of}} high {{resolution}} strainmeters covering {{an area of}} 1 km" 2 has been installed in a 60 years old mining system in <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt being similar to recently used disposal sites for chemical and toxical waste. The measured data contain numerous strain components and thus a superposition of different geomechanical events in space and time. A new procedure has been developed which is appropriate to identify and quantify all strain components affecting predictions of convergence rates and to validate numerical models for long term predictions. The identified prediction-relevant components (a local blasting, approach of the working front, convergence of chambers below the strainmeter array, thermoelastic response of long term thermal change) contribute to the measured convergence rate by 8 - 33 %. Substracting these components from the total annual rate, a mean convergence rate of 94 #mu#m/a is obtained. The influence of a local geomechanical event (a blasting close to the strainmeter array removing 150 m" 3 salt) was studied in detail by comparing the time series before the event, i. e. after 30 years of recovery, and the 2. 5 years time series after the event. The event-related additional convergence rates were determined to be 12 - 47 #mu#m/a at the time 600 days after the event. The result shows that new excavations for the preparation of underground disposal sites should not be made until the convergence rates of the undisturbed system has been measured {{in order to avoid}} major errors inconvergence predictions.

40|$|Multiple {{seam mining}} {{interactions}} caused by full extraction mining, whether due to undermining or overmining, frequently involve tensile {{failure of the}} affected mine roof. The adverse ground control conditions may prevent mining for both safety and economic reasons. Prior researchers have identified the geometric, geologic and mining factors controlling multiple seam mining interactions. This numerical study examines the mechanics of these interactions using a modeling procedure that 1) incorporates the essential constitutive behavior of the rock such as strain-softening of the intact rock and shear and tensile failure along bedding planes and 2) captures the geologic variability of the rock especially the layering of weak and strong rocks and weak bedding planes. Specifically, the numerical study considered the effect of vertical stress, interburden thickness, and the immediate roof quality of the affected seam in both undermining and overmining situations. The models show that for overburden-to-interburden thickness (OB/IB) ratios of less than 5, interactions do not occur, and that for OB/IB more than 50, extreme interaction is a certainty. In between, {{the possibility of an}} interaction was found to depend on gob width-to-interburden thickness ratio, site specific geology and horizontal stress to rock strength ratio in addition to the OB/IB ratio. The models also showed that horizontal stress was profoundly altered well above or below a full extraction area and that these changes are likely to influence {{the success or failure of}} multiple seam mining. The role of horizontal stress in multiple seam mining interactions has received little attention in prior investigations. Four factors control the mechanics of multiple seam mining interactions: 1. vertical stress concentration 2. horizontal stress concentration 3. stress re-direction 4. bedding plane slip bands A combination of vertical and horizontal stress increase and high stress gradients in the vicinity of full extraction areas re-orients principal stresses into a very unfavorable direction.

40|$|This thesis has {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} strength and stiffness properties of bedding planes and discontinuities in the immediate roof layers overlying Herrin No. 6 coal seam in Illinois. Rock joints and bedding planes are typical discontinuities in <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> mass and they control failure initiation and propagation of failure through the rock mass. Strength as well as deformation properties of bedding planes, joints and discontinuities are influenced by their surface roughness, inclination, intact rock properties, and pre-mining stress values and their orientation. The strength and deformation properties (stiffness values) are characterized by peak and residual strength values. Since support loads in excavations are due to deformations of the rock mass, their analysis should consider their strength and stiffness values. The overall goal {{of this research is}} to determine the shear strength and associated stiffness properties of bedding planes and joints of the immediate roof strata rocks within 25 - 30 ft. (7. 5 - 9 m) overlying Herrin no. 6 coal seam (within the pressure arch zone) using direct shear tests. A shear test loading device was designed and integrated into the 150 t (1, 334 kN) [*]Forney compression loading machine in the department.

The damage criterion of the dolomite based on the peak load {{was determined to be}} J{sub 2 }{sup 0. 5 } (psi) = 3113 + 0. 34 I{sub 1 } (psi) where I{sub 1 } and J{sub 2 } are first and second invariants respectively. Using the dilation limit as a threshold level for damage, the damage criterion was conservatively estimated as J{sub 2 }{sup 0. 5 } (psi) = 2614 + 0. 30 I{sub 1 } (psi). The Young's modulus of the rock salt, which will host the storage cavern, was determined to be 2. 4 ({+-} 0. 65) x 10 {sup 6 } psi, with a Poisson's ratio of 0. 24 ({+-} 0. 07). The elastic Young's modulus was determined to be 5. 0 ({+-} 0. 46) x 10 {sup 6 } psi. Unlike the dolomite specimens under triaxial compression, rock salt specimens did not show shear failure with peak axial load.

The effect of mean ductility, interlayer thickness, and magnitude of shortening on fracture development in <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> was investigated by shortening multilayer cylinders (5 cm dia.) 4 to 14 % normal to layering in a triaxial apparatus. Multilayers were constructed by stacking two 1. 4 -cm thick layers of Berea Sandstone (relatively strong and brittle) with interlayers of Indiana Limestone (relatively weak and ductile). Thickness of the interlayer between the sandstone was 30 %, 100 %, or 150 % of the thickness of the sandstone layer. Mean ductility was varied by shortening at confining pressures (Pc) of 5, 25, 50, and 100 MPa. Sandstone layers fracture at all conditions. Fractures have preferred orientation symmetric to the cylinder axis, and display systematic spacing. At the lowest Pc and mean ductility, fractures in the sandstone are dominantly opening mode (joints) and mixed mode fractures oriented at high angles to layer boundaries. At greater Pc and mean ductility, fractures are dominantly shear mode (faults) and display conjugate geometry. Average dihedral angle of the conjugates increases from 16 to 67 degrees with increase in mean ductility. Maximum fracture density in the sandstone occurs at intermediate mean ductility and maximum interlayer thickness. Fractures propagate from the sandstone into the limestone and may link across the limestone interlayer as shortening is increased. Linkage is enhanced with decreasing mean ductility and interlayer thickness, and increasing shortening. At high mean ductility, fractures are confined to the sandstone layers. Limestone deforms by faulting and compactive cataclastic flow at low and high mean ductility, respectively. Faults in limestone are more variable in orientation and display larger dihedral angles than in the sandstone. Fracture mode and orientation are consistent with Mohr-Coulomb failure, and a spatially heterogeneous stress state where the most tensile stress occurs in the sandstone. Types of fracture networks in multilayer sequences with moderate ductility contrast vary from joints and faults, refracted faults, to faults and flow with increasing mean ductility. Fracture spacing depends on layer and interlayer thickness, mean ductility and ductility contrast, and magnitude of shortening...|$|E
