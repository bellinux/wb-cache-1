25|$|Although tektites are superficially {{similar to}} some {{terrestrial}} volcanic glasses (obsidians), they have unusual distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from such glasses. First, {{they are completely}} glassy and lack any microlites or phenocrysts, unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in silica (>65 wt%), the <b>bulk</b> <b>chemical</b> and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of shales and similar sedimentary rocks and {{quite different from the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>chemical</b> and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, tektites contain virtually no water (<0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Fourth, the flow-banding within tektites often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial volcanic glasses. Finally, a few tektites contain partly melted inclusions of shocked and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. quartz, apatite, and zircon, as well as coesite.|$|E
500|$|Uranus is {{the seventh}} planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest {{planetary}} radius and fourth-largest planetary {{mass in the}} Solar System.

Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more [...] "ices" [...] such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.

2500|$|An {{important}} goal of environmental chemistry is tracing {{the source and}} degradation of pollutants. [...] Various methods have been employed for fingerprinting pools of environmental pollutants such as the <b>bulk</b> <b>chemical</b> composition of a spill, isotope ratios of the <b>bulk</b> <b>chemical</b> mixture, or isotope ratios of individual constituent compounds. [...] Stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen {{can be used as}} complimentary fingerprinting techniques for natural gas. [...] Recently, the D/H ratio of hydrocarbons from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was used to verify that their origin was likely from the Macondo well. [...] Hydrogen isotope ratios have also been used as a measure of the relative amount of biodegradation that has occurred in oil reservoirs in China, and studies on pure cultures of n-alkane degrading organisms have shown a chain-length dependence on the amount of hydrogen isotope fractionation during degradation. [...] Additional studies have also shown hydrogen isotope effects in the degradation of Methyl tert-butyl ether and Toluene that have been suggested to be useful in the evaluation of the level of degradation of these polluting compounds in the environment. [...] In both cases the residual unreacted compounds became enriched in deuterium to a few tens of per mil, with variations exhibited between different organisms and degree of reaction completeness. [...] These observations of heavy residual compounds have been applied to field observations of biodegradation reactions such as the removal of benzene and ethylbenzene, which imparted a D/H fractionation of 27 and 50 per mil, respectively. [...] Additionally analysis of o-xylene in a polluted site showed high residual D/H ratios after biodegradation, consistent with activation of C-H bonds being a rate limiting step in this process ...|$|E

40|$|Given {{the current}} robust forces driving {{sustainable}} production, and available biomass conversion technologies, biomass-based routes {{are expected to}} make {{a significant impact on the}} production of <b>bulk</b> <b>chemicals</b> within 10 years, and a huge impact within 20 - 30 years. In the Port of Rotterdam there is a clear short-term (0 - 10 year) substitution potential of 10 - 15 % of fossil oil-based <b>bulk</b> <b>chemicals</b> by bio-based <b>bulk</b> <b>chemicals,</b> especially for oxygenated <b>bulk</b> <b>chemicals,</b> such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, iso-propanol and acetone, butylene and methylethylketone and for the replacement of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) by ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE). Glycerin, as a byproduct of biodiesel production, is a very favorable short-term option for the production of ethylene and propy-lene glycols in the Port of Rotterdam. In the mid-term (10 - 20 years) there is clear potential for a bio-based production of ethylene, acrylic acid and N-containing <b>bulk</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as acrylonitrile, acrylamide and -caprolactam. Technologies involving direct isolation of aromatic building blocks from biomass, or the conversion of sugars or lignin to aromatics are still in their infancy. Biorefineries that are being started up today will form the stepping stones toward the chemicals mentioned above if we learn to upgrade their side streams. For main ports like the Port of Rotterdam, these developments imply that it has to consider in much closer detail those facilities it has to offer for a more bio-based chemistry and economy. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|R
