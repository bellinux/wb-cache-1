So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

Up to 65 Palestinians were reportedly killed that day, of whom 10 were women and 13 children, and more bodies were later found under the rubble. The author of the report, Robert Perkins, said [...] "Errors occur with this type of shell, it is fundamental to the way it works, but there is no margin for error in Gaza <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> hit markets, houses, and civilians, and that is what happened".|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
