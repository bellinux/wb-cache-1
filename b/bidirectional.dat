5|$|On October 8, 2007, reverse-peak {{and more}} midday service were introduced, which {{officials}} {{hailed as the}} beginning of Shore Line East as a true <b>bidirectional</b> system. Several existing express trains also began to stop at Guilford.|$|E
5|$|HDMI Ethernet Channel {{technology}} consolidates video, audio, {{and data}} streams {{into a single}} HDMI cable, and the HEC feature enables IP-based applications over HDMI and provides a <b>bidirectional</b> Ethernet communication at 100Mbit/s. The physical layer of the Ethernet implementation uses a hybrid to simultaneously send and receive attenuated 100BASE-TX type signals through a single twisted pair.|$|E
5|$|Parabronchi {{in which}} the air flow is {{unidirectional}} are called paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. Some birds, however, have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is <b>bidirectional.</b> These are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.|$|E
5|$|The Power Delivery Specification defines six fixed power {{profiles}} for {{the power}} sources. PD-aware devices implement a flexible power management scheme by interfacing with the power source through a <b>bidirectional</b> data channel and requesting {{a certain level of}} electrical power, variable up to 5A and 20V depending on supported profile. The power configuration protocol uses a 24MHz BFSK-coded transmission channel on the VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} <b>bidirectional</b> in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service <b>bidirectional</b> regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that have already been put into place. One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} <b>bidirectional</b> data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
5|$|It is a one-wire <b>bidirectional</b> {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC {{standard}} AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is <b>bidirectional</b> and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E
5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's <b>bidirectional</b> center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E
5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are <b>bidirectional</b> across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E
5|$|The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the older}} SL79. The SL95s {{are the only}} <b>bidirectional</b> trams, and {{therefore}} {{the only ones that}} can operate on the Ullevål Hageby Line, that is served by lines 17 and 18. Since line 13 is a continuation of line 17 at Sinsen, the SL95s also operate on that line. Due to a too-small curve radius on the Briskeby Line, the SL95s do not operate on any of the lines to Majorstuen. They run on the Ullevål Hageby-, Ekeberg-, Sinsen-, Grünerløkka–Torshov-, Lilleaker- and Skøyen lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
5|$|The trams are <b>bidirectional,</b> with a driver's cab at each end. These cabs {{are built}} so the {{motorman}} can also sell tickets. The cab's have {{a door to}} close them off, so the riders cannot access rear cab. There are four doors on both sides; the front door is single while the three back doors are double. In addition to the front door, there is one door in each section. To operate the doors on the left side, the motorman must engage a security switch. It is also possible to open each individual door {{on the right side}} from the driver's cab. Half the length is low-floor, with an entry height at , including three of the four doors. There are 88 seats, of which 64 are on the high-floor section, giving a total capacity of 212 riders.|$|E
5|$|USB {{mice and}} {{keyboards}} {{can usually be}} used with older computers that have PS/2 connectors {{with the aid of}} a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform <b>bidirectional</b> data translation between the two standards.|$|E
25|$|Also, <b>bidirectional</b> cytoplasmic {{incompatibility}} {{occurs when}} an infected male carrying one strain of Wolbachia reproduces with an infected female carrying a different strain of Wolbachia. This also results in failed reproduction. <b>Bidirectional</b> cytoplasmic incompatibility also has evolutionary implications for populations of Ae. albopictus and other vectors of the infection. This is because <b>bidirectional</b> cytoplasmic incompatibility in Wolbachia creates unviable offspring, reducing gene flow between two populations, which can {{eventually lead to}} speciation.|$|E
25|$|Most nerve fibres {{within the}} {{hypothalamus}} run {{in two ways}} (<b>bidirectional).</b>|$|E
25|$|Terminal D, {{built for}} {{international}} flights, and DFW Skylink, a modern <b>bidirectional</b> people mover system, opened in 2005.|$|E
25|$|A* {{can also}} be adapted to a <b>bidirectional</b> search algorithm. Special care {{needs to be taken}} for the {{stopping}} criterion.|$|E
25|$|Platforms 3, 4 and 5 are <b>bidirectional</b> through {{platforms}} {{used for}} services on all routes. All three through platforms {{are used as}} most operationally advantageous.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathways}} linking arginine, glutamine, and proline are <b>bidirectional.</b> Thus, the net utilization or {{production of}} these amino acids is {{highly dependent on}} cell type and developmental stage.|$|E
25|$|Cutoff of an {{extended}} negative leader from its origin which creates a new <b>bidirectional</b> leader in which the positive end strikes the ground, commonly seen in anvil-crawler spider flashes.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{shortened}} routes {{are organized}} frequently when mass {{activities such as}} Gentse Feesten {{take place in the}} center of the city. <b>Bidirectional</b> rolling stock makes it easier to organize shortened routes.|$|E
25|$|Octave {{is one of}} {{the major}} free {{alternatives}} to Matlab, others being Scilab and FreeMat. Scilab, however, puts less emphasis on (<b>bidirectional)</b> syntactic compatibility with Matlab than Octave does.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no support}} for editing {{right to left}} and <b>bidirectional</b> {{languages}} (such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) in Office 2004. This issue has not been fixed in Office 2008 or 2011 either.|$|E
25|$|Most RDP 7.0 {{features}} like Aero glass remote use, <b>bidirectional</b> audio, Windows Media Player redirection, multiple monitor support and Remote Desktop Easy Print are only available in Windows 7 Enterprise or Ultimate editions.|$|E
25|$|A {{sequence}} {{is a function}} whose domain is a countable, totally ordered set, usually taken to be the natural numbers or whole numbers. Occasionally, it is also convenient to consider <b>bidirectional</b> sequences indexed by the set of all integers, including negative indices.|$|E
25|$|There is a <b>bidirectional</b> {{relationship}} between homelessness and poor health. Health {{conditions such as}} {{substance abuse and mental}} illness, can increase people's susceptibility to homelessness. Conversely, homelessness can further cause health issues as it involves constant exposure to environmental threats.|$|E
25|$|PR-22 is {{maintained}} {{by a system}} of tolls managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works. All of its toll plazas have express lanes. After June 17, 2017, the seven tolls plaza of the PR-22 will become <b>bidirectional.</b>|$|E
25|$|Relationships between dinosaurs show {{abundant}} {{evidence of}} dispersal from one {{region of the}} globe to another. Tetanuran theropods travelled widely through western North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Antarctica. Pachycephalosaurs and ceratopsians show clear evidence of multiple <b>bidirectional</b> dispersion events across Beringa.|$|E
25|$|In fiber-optic communications, wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) is {{a technology}} which multiplexes {{a number of}} optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths (i.e., colors) of laser light. This technique enables <b>bidirectional</b> communications over one strand of fiber, as well as multiplication of capacity.|$|E
25|$|ISO 9141-2. This {{protocol}} has an asynchronous {{serial data}} rate of 10.4kbit/s. It is somewhat similar to RS-232; however, the signal levels are different, and communications happens on a single, <b>bidirectional</b> line without additional handshake signals. ISO 9141-2 is primarily used in Chrysler, European, and Asian vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In {{cell lines}} derived from human choriocarcinomas, Kopf et al. found that {{transcription}} of H19 {{was under the}} simultaneous control of both a 5’ upstream and a 3’ downstream region. Kopf et al. have suggested that this simultaneous and <b>bidirectional</b> regulation of H19 may involve {{a member of the}} AP2 transcription factor family.|$|E
25|$|This {{procedure}} depends {{mainly on}} the receiver’s connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between unidirectional networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and <b>bidirectional</b> networks, where {{there is also a}} return channel through which the receiver can communicate with the outside (typically an Internet access).|$|E
25|$|Swarm {{behaviour}} occurs also {{in traffic}} flow dynamics, {{such as the}} traffic wave. <b>Bidirectional</b> traffic {{can be observed in}} ant trails. In recent years this behaviour has been researched for insight into pedestrian and traffic models. Simulations based on pedestrian models have also been applied to crowds which stampede because of panic.|$|E
25|$|Between Newport and Brooklyn {{the line}} was {{provided}} with <b>bidirectional</b> double track lines. By the 1930s a number of private sidings were opened off the line to serve adjacent industries. Today {{the majority of them}} have closed. In 1995 the east line was converted to dual gauge as part of the standardisation of the railway between Melbourne and Adelaide.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{replication}} is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA <b>bidirectional</b> replication model. DNA templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by , and budding.|$|E
