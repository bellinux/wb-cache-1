5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> right.|$|E

500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really make sure that we weren’t doing things, like, just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

It's much more terrifying." [...] At the same time, Yorke felt [...] "there's very little anger in In Rainbows. It's in no way political, or, at least, doesn't feel that way to me. It very much explores the ideas of transience. It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different." [...] In another interview, Yorke said the album was [...] "about the fucking panic of realising you're going to die! And that any time soon [...] possibly [...] a heart attack when I next go for a run." ...|$|E

He has even been on the receiving end from his All Black teammates when playing for the Crusaders, with Neemia Tialata, Jerry Collins and Ali Williams becoming frustrated with his play. According to McCaw [...] "what happens on the field stays on the field" [...] and if he gets extra attention it is because he [...] "must <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> right".|$|E

The final song was {{streamed}} live on the band's Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. Iommi {{has said that he}} does not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, [...] "I wouldn't write that off, if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't know if that would happen." [...] In an April 2017 interview, Butler revealed that Black Sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to 13, but added that, [...] "the tour got in the way." ...|$|E

[...] Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and [...] "he will be sorry he ever made it." [...] Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: [...] " [...] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh." [...] On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: [...] "So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking The Simpsons. We must <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> right. I must point out The Simpsons is a cartoon show—not 60 Minutes. Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E

500|$|One reader was Sam Simon, a {{producer}} of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded {{the development of the}} series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the [...] "guru" [...] of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would [...] "involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: [...] "It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every once in a while I get romantic notions that I should <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking." [...] He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, which he later had mixed feelings about: [...] "We worked so hard, and people liked it, but it still feels slapdash to me.” ...|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E
500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted {{something}} that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy" [...] adding that it was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor’s face is going to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty".|$|E

[...] "We wanted to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> at least that was a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit," [...] Tempest said, [...] "So we felt like we didn't want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really."
