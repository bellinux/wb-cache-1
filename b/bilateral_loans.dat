The limited ability of the government in the provision of funding for the {{road infrastructure}} requires the handling on the organizers of the roads, it also needs efforts to look for funding resources outside the APBN as a resource of funds for foreign loans.

The research was using the qualitative descriptive methods focusing on thorough depiction of form, function, and meaning of prohibition; data collection was done by collecting the entire loan process from the preparation phase to the implementation phase through interviewing and documentation literature. The document consists of the loan agreement document, documents monthly reports and annual reports, lender regulations, legal regulations of the Republic of Indonesia, photo documentation and archives. The result showed that the scoring of performance, multilateral loan is better than <b>bilateral</b> <b>loan.</b> This is evidenced by higher score for multilateral loan than bilateral loan.

The East Africa Kidney Institute will operate as part of the University of Nairobi and its teaching hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital. The other centres of excellence will be established at the University of Rwanda’s College of Medicine and Health Sciences, the Uganda Cancer Institute and, in Tanzania, at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences. Some 140 master’s and 10 PhD students will benefit from the programme, as well as 300 interns.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} choice between different sources of debt finance based on a sample of UK non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange FTSE 350 between 2001 and 2008. New evidence is provided on (i) the importance of differentiating between syndicated and bilateral bank loans, and (ii) the impact that bankers sitting {{on the board of}} directors have on the borrowing firms' choice of debt source. The evidence presented in this thesis contributes to the large body of US research concerning a firm's choice of debt source. Initially, the study investigates what type of firm chooses to issue particular sources of debt, and why. The findings show that the primary determinant of a firm's choice of debt source is its ability to provide collateral to secure against its debt. Although there is no evidence of bank affiliation playing a significant role in driving access to the public capital markets or to syndicated loans in the UK, issuers of <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans</b> are found to be more likely to have an affiliation to a bank than issuers of public, syndicated bank or non-bank private debt. Secondly, the study examines the stock market response to announcements of public, bank (both syndicated and bilateral), and non-bank private debt. The results provide no evidence of any abnormal stock market response following announcements of either public bonds or non-bank private debt. There is strong evidence of a positive market response to announcements of bank loans, driven by the positive market response to syndicated loans. There is little evidence of any market response to announcements of <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans.</b> The market appears to view announcements of syndicated loans made by companies which have a banker on their board in a positive manner, but no such response is observed for announcements of <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Crony {{capitalism}} and international creditors'self-fulfilling expectations are often suggested as rival explanations for currency crises. A possible {{link between the}} two has not been explored. The author shows one channel through which crony capitalism can increase {{the chance of a}} currency/financial crisis by altering the composition of capital inflows. Using data on bilateral foreign direct investment and <b>bilateral</b> bank <b>loans,</b> the author finds clear evidence that in corrupt countries the composition of capital inflows is relatively light in foreign direct investment. Earlier studies indicated that a country with a capital inflow structure is more likely to run into a currency crisis down the road (partly through international creditors'self-fulfilling expectations). Therefore, crony capitalism, through its effect on the composition of a country's capital inflows, makes the country more vulnerable to currency crises brought about by self-fulfilling expectations. Corruption may also weaken domestic financial supervision, with a subsequent deterioration in the quality in banks'and firms'balance sheets.

The ouster of Yanukovych plunged Ukraine into the 2014 Crimean crisis and the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. In March 2014 the EU condemned the Annexation of Crimea by Russia and Russia's [...] "clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces". The EU also froze (and tried to recover) [...] "misappropriated Ukrainian state funds" [...] and froze assets and blocked entry into the EU of Russians and Ukrainians deemed responsible for the unrest in Ukraine. The political part of the Association Agreement was signed on 21 March 2014 by new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Customs duties for Ukrainian exports to the EU were temporarily removed in April 2014. Financial help was also promised to Ukraine. Ukraine was granted a macro-financial aid <b>bilateral</b> <b>loan</b> of one billion Euro in May 2014. The European Union and Ukraine signed the economic part of the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement on 27 June 2014. President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy described the signing as a [...] "great day for Europe". Signatory (then new) President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko called it [...] "Ukraine is underlining its sovereign choice in favour of membership of the EU", and also described it as Ukraine's [...] "first but most decisive step" [...] towards EU membership. Poroshenko also set 2020 as a target for an EU membership application. As the Voice of America reported on 27 June, [...] "Terms of the EU agreements require Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine not enter into similar free trade agreements with the Kremlin." [...] On 16 September 2014 the Verkhovna Rada approved the draft law on ratification of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, which was signed the same day by President Petro Poroshenko. The 17th EU-Ukraine summit took place on April 27, 2015 in Kiev. During an Eastern Partnership summit in Riga in May 2015, EU agreed on a €1.8bn loan to Ukraine. On January 1, 2016, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between Ukraine and the EU entered into force. By April 2016, the Association Agreement had been ratified by Ukraine and all EU member states except the Netherlands, which held a referendum on approval of the treaty. Following {{the rejection of the}} agreement in the referendum, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte said that ratification would be put on hold during negotiations with the other parties to the treaty to find a compromise.|$|R
40|$|Global {{environmental}} health efforts {{are motivated by}} a sense of common responsibility. These programs take forms small and large, from community churches to the World Bank. The methods likewise take varying, and sometimes competing forms, from watershed restoration to road building to community engagement, with funding provided by charities, <b>bilateral</b> aid, <b>loans,</b> microfinance and big business. Once these projects are installed, typically the implementers are their own evaluators. Under the best of circumstances, sometimes funding is available to run a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate if the projects are improving the intended environmental, economic, health or other metrics. But, usually sooner rather than later, the funding runs out for that particular project, and everyone moves on. This has resulted in sad statistics.
