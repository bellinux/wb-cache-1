40|$|In Finland, 9 % of the {{families}} with children are <b>blended</b> <b>families.</b> Though both the absolute number {{and the proportion of}} <b>blended</b> <b>families</b> is increasing throughout Europe, there is still little research information available on how they manage their finances. <b>Blended</b> <b>families</b> are an interesting group to study because their money management is clearly more complex than that of traditional nuclear families. In this paper I examine the extent of the differences between <b>blended</b> and nuclear <b>families</b> in money management, with special reference to bank accounts and the conducting of payments. I also seek to identify factors explaining the differences discovered. The research data comes from an Internet survey conducted in November 2006, which yielded answers from 469 Finnish families with children. The results, confirming earlier findings, suggested that money management is more separated in <b>blended</b> <b>families</b> than in nuclear ones. In nuclear families, both the bank accounts and the paying of expenditures are consistently managed jointly, whereas the spouses in <b>blended</b> <b>families</b> prefer separate bank accounts and display several different practices in the paying of common expenditures. In nuclear families the adults pay the expenditures together, but in blended ones they are responsible for the expenditures of their own biological children. Consumer research Family Money...|$|R

500|$|Phineas {{is part of}} a <b>blended</b> <b>family,</b> a {{decision}} creator Marsh made to reflect his own experiences growing up. His stepbrother, Ferb, is his best friend. Phineas's birth father is never present or discussed in the series, something Marsh and Povenmire have stated that they fully intend to keep that way. It is established that his mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher married Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher, after dating him for a while in the 1990s.

Marsh considers explaining the family background [...] "not important to the kids' lives. They are a great <b>blended</b> <b>family</b> and that's {{all we need to}} know." [...] Ferb and his family live in the fictional town of Danville, in a large, suburban neighborhood. Throughout their summer vacation, Ferb and Phineas conceive outrageous schemes to defeat boredom while sitting lazily beneath a tree in their backyard. Phineas mainly conceives each project while Ferb spearheads its construction. Their activities are usually beyond the capability of a typical child and have included toy design (in [...] "Toy to the World"); treasure-hunting (in [...] "The Ballad of Badbeard"); engineering (in [...] "It's About Time!"); and restaurant management (in [...] "Chez Platypus"). Ferb's stepsister, Candace, is always trying to get the two in trouble with their mother for their schemes, but is never able to.

The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner <b>blended</b> <b>family,</b> focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé.

The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E

500|$|Roxana Hadadi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for The Washington Post, was extremely negative towards the reality series {{due to its}} absurdity, and commented that the show: [...] "firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut [...] from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable." [...] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: [...] "Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 42 - 44) The {{purpose of}} this study is three-fold. The first intent is to investigate the psychological, emotional, and relational experience of families experiencing divorce and custody battles. The second aim is to conduct research into the affects that divorce has on the relationships between parents, children, grandparents, as well as <b>blended</b> <b>families.</b> The third objective is to compile a helpful guidebook that would be informative to parents going through the process of divorce and approaching custody and visitation court dates. The guidebook would also provide information on <b>blended</b> <b>families</b> and the unique challenges that are faced. Projected outcomes of providing information and an experience to relate to would extend a comfort and peace of mind through offering a resource that explicitly details what can be expected from divorce, custody and mediation, and possible custody battles, as well as tips on how to communicate effectively in order to avoid further battles. Information is provided regarding <b>blended</b> <b>families</b> and the importance of communication and negotiating roles in order to establish better family relations. This information can help to normalize the unique experiences and challenges faced by <b>blended</b> <b>families.</b> Recommendations for future investigative research is suggested in areas encompassing the needs of the children who are required to attend mediation at six years of age and older. Future research is warranted pertaining to the effects it has on these children in order to adequately consider their psychological and emotional health. Further exploration is needed regarding the best way to involve families, mental health professionals and our court systems to maximize the stability and security (safety) for these children within the context of the situation of custody and visitation...|$|R
