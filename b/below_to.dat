Each psychiatrist gives one of possibly five diagnoses to each patient. These are compiled into a matrix, and Fleiss' kappa can be computed from this matrix (see example <b>below)</b> <b>to</b> show the degree of agreement between the psychiatrists above the level of agreement expected by chance.|$|E
5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins <b>below</b> <b>to</b> collect the pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and <b>below,</b> <b>to</b> camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of guanosine. Upon oxidation with I2 /water, this side product, possibly via O6-N7 migration, undergoes depurination. The apurinic sites thus formed are readily cleaved {{in the course of}} the final deprotection of the oligonucleotide under the basic conditions (see <b>below)</b> <b>to</b> give two shorter oligonucleotides thus reducing the yield of the full-length product. The O6 modifications are rapidly removed by treatment with the capping reagent as long as the capping step is performed prior to oxidation with I2/water.|$|E

5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet within minutes of the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg, shattering the bone.

At 02:30, Astrée pulled away from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée and found herself assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position {{that she was able}} to rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E

5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from <b>below</b> <b>to</b> match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before its}} {{departure}} from India the 5th Light Infantry suffered from weak senior leadership and discord among its British officers (see details of Court of Inquiry report <b>below).</b> <b>To</b> compound the problem, the sepoys themselves {{were divided into}} two major cliques. One led by the Subedar Major Khan Mohamed Khan and Subedar Wahid Ali and the other consisting of Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedars Chisti Khan and Abdul Ali Khan. According to the Court of Inquiry, {{as a result of these}} two factions, discipline was compromised and any side for any particular policy or measure in the regiment was at once the signal for its rejection by the other.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see <b>below)</b> <b>to</b> show that 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent {{studies showed that}} {{there are more than a}} thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E

His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people <b>below</b> <b>to</b> still not want to celebrate his birthday.

5|$|Pilgrim {{numbers have}} greatly {{increased}} in recent years, {{which has led}} to numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding. The first major accident during Hajj in modern times occurred in 1990, when a tunnel stampede led to the death of 1,462 people. Afterwards, various crowd-control techniques were adopted to ensure safety. Because of large crowds, some of the rituals have become more symbolic. For example, it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone. Instead, pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Also, the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed into long walls in 2004 with basins <b>below</b> <b>to</b> catch the stones. Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done at slaughterhouses appointed by the Saudi authorities, without the pilgrims being present there.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from <b>below</b> <b>to</b> replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E

5|$|During Stalin's Great Purge in the late-1930s, {{which had}} not ended {{by the time of}} the German {{invasion}} on 22 June 1941, much of the officer corps of the Red Army was decimated and their replacements, appointed by Stalin for political reasons, often lacked military competence. Of the five Marshals of the Soviet Union appointed in 1935, only Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny survived Stalin's purge. Tukachevsky was killed in 1937. Fifteen of 16 army commanders, 50 of the 57 corps commanders, 154 of the 186 divisional commanders, and 401 of 456 colonels were killed, and many other officers were dismissed. In total, about 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed. Stalin further underscored his control by reasserting the role of political commissars at the divisional level and <b>below</b> <b>to</b> oversee the political loyalty of the army to the regime. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander of the unit they were overseeing. But in spite of efforts to ensure the political subservience of the armed forces, in the wake of Red Army's poor performance in Poland and in the Winter War, about 80 percent of the officers dismissed during the Great Purge were reinstated by 1941. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75 percent of all the officers had been in their position for less than one year at the start of the German invasion of 1941, many of the short tenures can be attributed not only to the purge, but also to the rapid increase in creation of military units.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour the}} {{officers}} drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning {{detailed information about}} the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to greet the French arrivals. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite, Rear-Admiral Don Ignacio María de Álava, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted <b>below</b> <b>to</b> join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm's cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing. Climbing into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby Pasig River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well-armed, one with a 32-pounder long gun and two with 24-pounder long guns, each supplemented by four swivel guns.|$|E
