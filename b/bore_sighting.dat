40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the study of coupling-dynamics in the mesosphere. Interesting airglow phenomena [...] primarily internal bores occurring mid-latitude at mesospheric altitudes [...] have been observed and studied in a multifaceted approach, combining the analysis of experimental data with modelling and theory. After the initial mesospheric <b>bore</b> <b>sighting</b> by the scientific community in 1993, the next recorded events were observed by Cornell University. To gain additional insight, this investigation effectively pursued more data by installing imaging equipment as part of a collaborative, multi-instrument campaign involving lidar. While coincident lidar data eluded us, we did expand our database allowing us to develop the first classification system to categorize mesospheric bore observations. We also verify {{for the first time that}} a mesospheric inversion layer would support bore formation as proposed. Some of the bore data exhibits features unexpected and new. Most intriguing is that the brightness relationship between airglow layers is reversed and accompanied by a lateral shift! This was the first such "inverse" event reported in the scientific community, and its seemingly contradictory nature fails to support the existing basic theory. Working with researchers at the Air Force Research Laboratory, we propose a new theory extending the original numerical model. We also compare the data to another non-linear theory and find both that: (1) neither theory explains all the observable features, and (2) each theory succeeds in explaining some characteristics not addressed by the competing theory. This theory development suggests that mesospheric bores likely are nonlinear structures propagating within upper atmospheric waveguides such as thermal-inversion layers or wind-shear ducts. Well into this thesis, we realized the critical and complicated role calibration plays in ensuring the condition of our data. Calibration reduces the discrepancies between the raw error-prone data and a true portrayal of the phenomena, facilitating the generation of congruent, accurate data for analysis. To address some of the calibration challenges and to alleviate some of the confusion for future graduate students, a portion of this dissertation is devoted to providing the first, comprehensive presentation of calibration [...] detailing topics, techniques, methodologies, and results, as they pertain to airglow imagers...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{normally}} desirable {{to keep the}} sights of a firearm {{as close to the}} bore as possible, since a firearm with a large <b>bore</b> to <b>sight</b> distance will require more sight adjustment when shifting between shooting at different targets at close ranges. On the other hand, a firearm with a short <b>bore</b> to <b>sight</b> distance will need less sight adjustment when changing between targets at close ranges. At longer ranges the <b>bore</b> to <b>sight</b> distance will be of less importance, since gravity has affected the projectile so much that the height difference between the <b>bore</b> and the <b>sight</b> has less to say in total, compared to the bullet drop.|$|R

Besides, the method enables us to use various acceleration schemes used in computer graphics readily.

50|$|During mid-February 1943 the Department of Public Works {{received}} a requisition from the US Army {{for construction of}} a gun firing range, or <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> range, platform at Charters Towers airfield to test the accuracy of aircraft fixed armament.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 16). To transport humans into space routinely and safely a spacecraft must be capable of proximity operations (maneuvers close to other spacecraft), and on-orbit maintenance. These operations require an intelligent system that identifies and informs neighboring spacecraft of their relative positions and orientations. VISNAV[[?][?][?]] is a VISion-based sensing and NAVigation system that is able to determine the position and orientation of objects in 3 -D space. The non-contact nature and quick update rate of this system make it an attractive option for spacecraft autonomous on-orbit maintenance, proximity operations, rendezvous and docking, and many other motion-tracking applications. The VISNAV system has been explored as an option for autonomous spacecraft rendezvous and docking applications. In these tests the VISNAV system loses some accuracy as the beacons move away from the <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> of the sensor. Also, the system can become singular for certain vehicle and target light configurations. If the VISNAV system is to be used on real spacecraft it must be robust and failsafe, which means the model cannot become singular. The focus of this student project is to characterize the system accuracy as a function of distance and angle from <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> of the sensor. The use of two sensors to create a "stereo" version of the VISNAV system will also be explored to increase the reliability and operating range of the system...|$|R
