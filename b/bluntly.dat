5|$|Glenn Close as Carrie Johnson, Troy's devastated mother. She {{tries to}} mask her grief with a cheerful persona, and {{continually}} guilts her neighbors {{by telling them}} <b>bluntly</b> {{that she does not}} blame them for Troy's death.|$|E
5|$|Mr Awasthi <b>bluntly</b> categorizes it as mental retardation, but Nikumbh criticizes him. Nikumbh {{argues that}} Ishaan is an above average child and {{processes}} information differently. He further states that Mr Awasthi {{failed to understand}} Ishaan {{and as a result}} the latter is facing low self-esteem and no longer paints, and Mr Awasthi regrets everything he did to Ishaan.|$|E
5|$|The nasal bones end <b>bluntly</b> {{close to}} the hindmost extent of the premaxillary bones. The narrow interorbital region, located between the eyes, converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads. The interparietal bone, located in {{the roof of the}} skull on the braincase, is nearly as wide as the frontals, but does not reach the squamosals.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, {{and at times}} sinister, atmosphere, and contained material that was <b>bluntly</b> political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, resembled a traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies.|$|E
5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote <b>bluntly</b> and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E
5|$|If these {{conditions}} are in place, multinational corporations will transfer via their offshore subsidiaries or to their offshore suppliers, the specific production technologies and market linkages necessary {{to participate in}} the global economy. By themselves, developing countries, even if well-educated, cannot produce at the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added industries such as textiles or shoes. Put <b>bluntly,</b> multinational companies possess a variety of factors that developing countries must have if they are {{to participate in the}} global economy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King <b>bluntly</b> told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{meets with}} each of his {{employees}} to discuss their job performance. He plunders the employee suggestion box for ideas to impress his own boss, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), but the ruse backfires and he embarrasses himself. Michael relentlessly pesters Jan about their previous romantic connection but she <b>bluntly</b> rejects him, especially when, during the office's suggestion box meeting, she discovers {{that everyone in the}} Scranton branch is aware of the incident. As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is not ready for a relationship. Meanwhile, the stunned staff listens in.|$|E
5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M.galericulata typically has a <b>bluntly</b> conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E
5|$|Valérie is repulsed by her ugly {{husband and}} has gone five years without kissing him. She {{explains}} <b>bluntly</b> that her {{position as a}} married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness– not to mention her gruesome demise– has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, <b>bluntly</b> serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite <b>bluntly,</b> making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E
5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and <b>bluntly</b> tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne <b>bluntly</b> refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassed by {{the events}} at the press conference, Đính {{returned}} to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters. His colleagues, led by General Trần Văn Đôn, were plotting a coup against Diệm because of the Buddhist crisis, and attempted to play on Đính's ego to convince him to join them. They knew that without Đính's assistance, a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured Đính {{that he was a}} national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. Đính's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Diệm's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised Đính to ask Diệm to promote him to interior minister, Dương Văn Minh to defence minister, and Trần Văn Minh to education minister. The other generals hoped that would reject Đính and wound his pride. As a result, Đính and his fellow generals met Diệm at the palace, where Đính asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister. Diệm <b>bluntly</b> chastised Đính in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of Đà Lạt to rest. Đính felt humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his colleagues that he would be successful. The Ngô brothers had been alarmed by Đính's request, and put him under surveillance. Đính found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. Đính agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides.|$|E

25|$|The plea of P.K Deo that Kalahandi Assembly {{has already}} {{unanimously}} passed {{resolution of the}} merger with the Eastern States Union rather than with Orissa was <b>bluntly</b> ignored at Cuttack Darbar in December 1947 which was attended by Sardar Patel and V.P Menon {{at the behest of}} H.K Mahatab, the then Orissa Premier.|$|E
25|$|Repnin's Sejm marked {{one of the}} {{important}} milestones in increasing Polish dependence on the Russian Empire, and its devolution into a protectorate.

25|$|Transaxillary: an {{incision}} {{made to the}} axilla (armpit), {{from which}} the dissection tunnels medially, to emplace the implants, either <b>bluntly</b> or with an endoscope (illuminated video microcamera), without producing visible scars on the breast proper; yet, it is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} years {{led to an}} estrangement between Barbarossa and Henry. Henry ceased to support the Emperor's Italy campaigns, which were all proven unsuccessful, as massively as he used to, and instead focused on his own possessions.

Records of this event were not written until several years later, and sources are contradictory, depending on whom the author favoured. Nevertheless, lacking the support of the Saxons the following Battle of Legnano was a complete failure for the Emperor.|$|E
