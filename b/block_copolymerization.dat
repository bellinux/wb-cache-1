After polymerization the protective groups were removed by different methods. Various initiators for the NMP of the monomers were synthesized and the reaction conditions were optimized. The results showed that NMP was not a suitable method for multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives to achieve well-defined homopolymers, although it was successful for control of polymerization of styrene and <b>block</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives with alkoxyamine terminated polystyrene. The ATRP of multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates has been successfully performed, as well as the <b>block</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates. Relatively low polydispersities of the corresponding polymers (PD= 1. 18 - 1. 36) and reasonably high rates of polymerization could be achieved when Me 6 TREN and PMDETA were used as ligands. However, the ATRP of multifunctional acrylamides and methacrylamides failed. The RAFT-polymerization of styrene, acrylamide and acrylate using BDTB as a CTA and AIBN as an initiator afforded polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution (PD= 1. 13 - 1. 26). A kinetic investigation and the further synthesis of block copolymers using dithioester-terminated homopolymers as macroCTAs showed that the RAFT polymerization of acrylamide M 9 b proceeded in a living manner. However, BDTB does not control the reaction of methacrylic monomers, such as methacrylates and methacrylamides. The bulk phase behavior of the block copolymers were examined by means of DSC and the surface behaviors of block copolymers as thin layers were examined with AFM. Two-phase transitions in the block copolymers were observed clearly by DSC, indicative of the appearance of phase separations, which were seen in an AFM image. In conclusion, multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives failed to achieve well-defined homopolymers by NMP.

The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation was concerned with the living radical polymerization (LRP) of an amphiphilic, water-soluble, bi-substituted and biologically compatible acrylamide derivative, namely n-acryloylmorpholine (NAM). The primary objective {{of this research was}} the synthesis of novel block copolymers containing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and various chain lengths of poly(acryloylmorpholine) (polyNAM) using a LRP technique, namely reversibleaddition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is the first report on the synthesis of these block copolymers using RAFT polymerization. These novel siloxane block copolymers were synthesized using a monohydroxyterminated PDMS material which had to first be modified into a thiocarbonylthiocontaining moiety in order for it to be used as macromolecular chain transfer agent (macroCTA) in the RAFT copolymerization with NAM. Suitable reaction conditions for the synthesis of these novel block copolymers had to, firstly, be determined, and secondly, optimized. In order to determine suitable reaction conditions, a series of homopolymerizations with NAM were first performed in order to compare which chain transfer agent (CTA), solvent, temperature etc. could possibly be best suited for the <b>block</b> <b>copolymerizations</b> of PDMS-b-polyNAM.

Polymerization of MA, EGA, and PEGA in [C 6 mim][BF 4], [C 6 mim][PF 6], and [C 8 mim][PF 6] proceeded in a controlled manner, as evidenced by kinetic studies, narrow molecular weight distributions (Đ ≈ 1. 1), and quantitative conversions (> 99 %) within 30 min. MALDI-ToF-MS and 1 H NMR confirmed very high end-group fidelity, which was further exemplified by in situ chain extensions and <b>block</b> <b>copolymerizations,</b> yielding well-defined <b>block</b> copolymers in a quantitative manner. While polymerization of n-BA in [C 6 mim][BF 4] and [C 6 mim][PF 6] yielded polymers with bimodal molecular weight distribution (potentially due to poor solubility), polymerization of the same monomer in [C 8 mim][PF 6] was well-controlled yielding materials with a monomodal polymer peak distribution and low dispersity.

The number average molecular weights of the polymers increased linearly with monomer conversion, and the molecular weight distributions were between 1. 15 and 1. 20. Efficiencies of initiation were between 80 and 100 %, and evidence was found to suggest that backbiting to the initiator had occurred, resulting in the formation of cyclic oligomers during the early stages of polymerization. The kinetics of polymerization can be explained in terms of active species in. equilibrium with dormant species. The effects of temperature. and dielectric constant on this equilibrium were studied and a model based upon the Fuoss equation was developed. Pyridine was found to behave as proton trap in the system, and when it was used in excess the rate of polymerization was retarded. By assuming that the catalyst and pyridine formed a one to one complex, it was possible to show that the reaction was second order with respect to the catalyst. The synthesis of low molecular weight polyisobutenes was studied. When the concentration of initiator was increased relative to that of the isobutene, such that the theoretical degree of polymerization was 20 or less, the rate of initiation was slow compared to propagation.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades it has become {{increasingly}} clear that the use of renewable energy sources is indispensable {{in order to reduce the}} excessive use of fossil fuels. One of the focus points of recent investigations has been in the field of organic photovoltaic devices, which converts light directly into a current. Due to their ease of processing and mechanical flexibility these solar cells would be cheap and applicable on almost any substrate. An organic solar cell consists of an active layer sandwiched between two dissimilar electrodes. Upon the illumination of such a device, a so-called exciton (a bound hole-electron pair) is created and in the presence of an electron acceptor this exciton is separated into positive and negative charges. When using electrodes with different work-functions, the charges are then transported towards the electrodes, which causes the flow of a current. The short exciton lifetime and therefore its short diffusion length make organic solar cells extremely sensitive to the active layer morphology. The interface between donor and acceptor moieties needs to be as large as possible and at the same time continuous pathways for both positive and negative charges towards the electrodes have to be assured. To get a better understanding of the processes involved in such organic or polymer solar cells and eventually optimize the performance of devices, it is vital to control the active layer material both on a molecular and on a macroscopic scale. In this thesis the use of block copolymers as self-organizing materials for solar cells was investigated. Block copolymer self-assemble due to the incompatibility of the two blocks, which are chemically linked to each other. The type of nanostructuring, taking place at the lengthscale of the two blocks, depends on this incompatibility (χ), the total length of the polymer (N) and on the volume fraction of the two blocks. A material that is suitable for application in a photovoltaic device, should contain a block with electron donating (D) and another block with electron accepting (A) moieties. For a good phase separation, it is important to control the molecular structure in order to ensure the presence of only well-defined block copolymer. This in itself is not evident, since the synthesis of such block copolymers requires many steps, each of which should give a well controlled structure. The synthesis strategy employed in this thesis can be essentially divided in three steps: (1) the synthesis of a conjugated polymer that acts as light absorbing and electron donating material, (2) the chain extension of this rigid rod-like polymer to give a rod-coil block copolymer and (3) the functionalization of the second block with electron accepting functionalities (e. g. C 60). In this thesis it is attempted to control the first two steps in terms of polymer length and polydispersity (PD), which should be low in order to enhance the self-organizational properties and the last step to avoid crosslinking and to ensure a known amount of electron acceptors that are actually covalently bonded to the polymer chain. The synthesis of a PPV (poly(p-phenylene vinylene)) derivative with branched solubilizing side-chains, poly[(2, 5 -di(2 ’-ethyl) hexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene] (DEH-PPV), was performed via a Siegrist polycondensation. This polymerization is based on the self-condensation between an aldehyde (activated with aniline) and a methyl group. The influence of several reaction parameters on the degree of polymerization (DPn) and the polydispersity was investigated. An increase in reaction temperature or reaction time gives a slight increase of the molecular weight, which ranges from 4 - 8 kg∙mol- 1. Due to a decrease in reactivity with growing polymer chain length, the PD is already quite low, but it can be reduced even further (to ~ 1. 1) by using low monomer concentration or column chromatography as a method of purification. The Siegrist polycondensation of a PTV (poly(2, 5 -thienylene vinylene)) derivative, which has a better overlap with respect to the solar spectrum, was unsuccessful and only very short oligomers could be obtained. A new method for the synthesis of a PTV derivative with a single functional aldehyde end-group was therefore designed. Good results were obtained when using a Wittig-Horner-Emmons polycondensation, the self-condensation between a phosphonate and aldehyde group. By varying the amount of monofunctional end-capper employed, the polymer length could be controlled perfectly and polymer lengths ranged from 2 to > 20 monomer units. The relatively high polydispersities could be reduced (to ~ 1. 5) by precipitating the polymer. An adaptation of literature procedures permitted the transformation of these polymers into a macroinitiator for nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP). NMRP is a controlled radical polymerization technique that should allow for the direct chain extension of the conjugated polymer with a second polymer, such as polystyrene or polyacrylate. The length of the second block can thus be controlled by adapting the polymerization time or the amount of monomer employed. This controlled/”living” polymerization technique also leads to rather low polydispersities. Since only very few copolymerizations using this technique are described in literature, a full investigation of the “living” character of both homo-, co- and <b>block</b> <b>copolymerizations</b> was performed. In this way very well-defined block copolymers with low polydispersity could be obtained for copolymerizations of styrene and methylacrylate. After purification, the final block copolymers showed a monomodal size-exclusion chromatogram, indicating the absence of homopolymers, with low polydispersity (PD = 1. 3). The (co) polymerization of n-butylacrylate gave somewhat less controlled polymerizations and the use of functional acrylic comonomers lead to complete loss of control. As a functional comonomer 4 -chloromethylstyrene (CMS) was used. The covalent incorporation of fullerene[60] (or C 60) in the second block poses some problems, due to the presence of multiple functional groups on the polymer chain and the fact that C 60 can react multiple times, leading to crosslinking. Three grafting methods were investigated and the most promising results were obtained when the chlorine is exchanged for an azide and a condensation reaction with C 60 is performed at relatively low temperatures (60 ºC). The formed triazoline compound is converted into a stable azafulleroid by extrusion of N 2 at high temperature. In this way around 100 % functionalization could be obtained, which is necessary in order to prevent crosslinking and the presence of pristine C 60 in the sample, which is almost impossible to remove. The final products were characterized in many different ways to correlate the physical properties and the self-organization in solution and in thin films to the device performances. PPV-PS based block copolymers show some kind of phase separation on the nanometric scale, although no highly ordered structures could be detected. The large window between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the liquid-crystalline-to-isotropic transition temperature (TLC-I) for PPV-PBA and PPV-PMA based block copolymers allows for a much better phase separation. This phase separation into elongated structures is enhanced even further upon annealing and features as long as a micron can be obtained for relatively long coil blocks. These structures are most likely lamellae oriented perpendicular to the bottom support surface. This self-organization leads to relatively high hole mobilities, but a correlation study between the conductivity of a thin polystyrene film with varying amounts of C 60 it contained, showed that in all cases the surrounding polystyrene prevents the formation of a good percolation path and therefore electron mobilities were quite low. Device functions are therefore also very poor and an optimization of both the active layer morphology, through annealing or adaptation of the block copolymer, and the electron mobility in the acceptor layer are necessary. A major drawback of organic solar cells is their relative instability towards oxidation by (singlet) oxygen. The presence of singlet oxygen (created by energy transfer from the polymer in the triplet excited state) induces bond-breaking of the vinyl bond in the conjugated polymer. Earlier reports on mixtures of electron donating and accepting compounds in thin films, showed a reduction of the degradation in the presence of a derivative of C 60. It was implied that the presence of C 60 reduces the amount of singlet oxygen through competition of the energy transfer to triplet oxygen with charge transfer from the conjugated polymer to the C 60. Investigation of these processes in solution can only be done when both functionalities are combined in one molecule or polymer, since decay processes are to fast to investigate the energy transfer in dilute solutions of non-covalently bonded compounds. The influence of the presence of C 60 covalently bonded to the conjugated polymer on the creation of singlet oxygen was investigated by laser flash photolysis. In this thesis it was demonstrated that charge transfer to C 60 indeed takes place even in solution, but that, contrary to the previous report, this charge transfer increases the amount of singlet oxygen produced rather than to decreases it. A likely explanation for the beneficial effect of C 60 on the degradation of PPV in thin films, has more likely to do with the slow diffusion of oxygen into films containing many fullerene crystallites. In conclusion, the synthesis of very well-defined block copolymers containing an electron donating and accepting part was fully elaborated and all steps were well controlled. Some (preliminary) morphology and device results were obtained, indicating that the active layer morphology, together with its physical and electronic properties, should be fine-tuned. This new well-defined block copolymer allowed for the investigation of the singlet oxygen formation in solution. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{is one of}} {{the main}} gases which cause the {{greenhouse}} effect. As a way to attenuate this damage, CO 2 could be used as a building <b>block</b> for <b>copolymerization</b> reactions; precisely as C 1 feedstock (monomer of the reaction) and as the pressurizing gas in these copolymerization reactions. The required monomer which is involved in the reactions is propylene oxide (PO) which possesses a high reactivity, enabling the CO 2 bonding. Through the mechanism of ring opening polymerization (ROP), the incorporation of CO 2 in the polymer chain can be possible. During this research, two different heterogeneous catalysts were used for the copolymerization reactions. Zinc glutarate (ZnGA) and double metal cyanide (DMC) were selected as plausible catalysts to perform the reactions. The goal of this doctoral thesis is to study these heterogeneous catalysts in copolymerization reactions between PO and CO 2 to understand how the catalyst and the process can be improved for a possible future industrial application. To characterize the catalysts, several techniques were used such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR and FTIR with pyridine), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP), light scattering (with air and distilled water), nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy and energy–dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The goal of these copolymerization reactions was to obtain a liquid CO 2 /propylene oxide copolymer, understanding the formation of carbonate bonds (polypropylene carbonate, PPC) and trying to minimize the cyclic propylene carbonate production (by-product, PC). Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) techniques were used to analyse the copolymers obtained from these reactions. The first catalyst used for the study was zinc glutarate (ZnGA), as it is shown in Chapter 1. An exhaustive characterization of this heterogeneous catalyst was carried out with a complete study of its behaviour in copolymerization reactions. This catalyst was synthesized by mixing zinc oxide, glutaric acid and toluene. ZnGA proved to be a catalyst without any porosity and without Brønsted and/or Lewis acid sites. The active area was the outer surface area of the catalyst, where the Zn 2 + active sites exist. In this catalyst, the average amount of Zn 2 + amount was around 353 mg Zn / g catalyst. The sample was very disperse on particle sizes, showing also a rectangular plate shape morphology with an average size of 321. 6 nm. Several different reaction conditions were screened for the formation of the copolymers from propylene oxide (PO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and polypropylene glycol (as initiator, PPG of 425 g/mol). The study included changes in the amount of ZnGA (0. 3, 0. 6, 1. 0, 1. 5 g), reaction temperature (60, 80 ºC), reaction pressure (6, 25 barg), final expected molecular weight of the copolymer (725, 3000 g/mol) and the reaction time (20, 40 h). Finally, it was possible to conclude that the best conditions corresponded to 1. 5 g of catalyst, 25 barg, 80 ºC, 40 h and 3000 Da of initial PO estimation. TON (Turnover number) and TOF (Turnover frequency) values are really low which demonstrated the low activity of this catalyst. A completely different behavior was observed when a double metal cyanide catalyst (DMC) was used. In Chapters 2 and 3 several DMC catalysts were synthesized and characterized in order to determine which one is the most active. Chapter 2 showed the effect of varying the initial amounts of zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) on the catalytic activity, in order to determine the influence of the catalyst preparation method. Five different DMC catalysts were synthesized from zinc chloride (ZnCl 2), potassium hexacyanocobaltate (III) (K 3 [Co(CN) 6] 2), tert-butanol (tBuOH, as complexing agent (CA)) and polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG 1000, as co-complexing agent (co-CA)). The Zn/Co ratio was changed during the synthesis, having one reagent always in excess to reveal its impact on the catalytic activity, crystallinity and other properties. The presence of K+ caused a dramatic decrease on the catalyst activity, while an increase of Zn 2 + produced more agglomerations of spherical particles in the catalyst (DMC E). Only two of the catalysts prepared were successfully activated (D and E catalysts, according the nomenclature used in this thesis). Their morphologies were lamellar with spherical particle agglomerations. After the copolymerization reactions, all the copolymers were analysed revealing that the most active catalyst was DMC E. With DMC E it was possible to achieve a high catalytic activity (2. 5 kg polymer / g catalyst) with an increased CO 2 incorporation (6. 7 %) and a lower production of the cyclic propylene carbonate, PC (0. 3 %). The implementation of mechanical stirrer instead of the initial magnetic one, decreased the polydispersity index (PDI) values from 5. 97 and 13. 09 to values around 1 to 1. 1. The results showed that it is possible to obtain shorter dispersed copolymer chains in the bulk reaction medium. Chapter 3 was focused on the catalyst activation stage previous to the copolymerization reaction process. This catalyst was named as DMC A and it was exactly the same as the DMC E discussed in Chapter 2. This catalyst had only 0. 0002 mol/ g cat of K+ while the amount of Zn was 0. 0036 mol/ g catalyst. 12 experiments were carried out for this DMC catalyst activation study, modifying the amount of catalyst using 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg of DMC and 4, 8 and 18 g of propylene oxide in total. This kind of catalyst is not a selective one and, after the reaction, high concentrations of the by-product were obtained. As the amount of DMC was increased, the PC amount also increased with the same CO 2 incorporation in the final copolymer. Using only 20 mg of catalyst per batch, the reaction produced more polypropylene carbonate (PPC) and cyclic propylene carbonate (PC) with the highest values of TON and TOF and the lowest PDI value. These results were confirmed by the FTIR spectrum for 20 mg of DMC A catalyst. Apart from these chapters, the current PhD thesis has also an appendix. The appendix shows the solubility of CO 2 in different polycarbonates. Several experiments at different temperatures, trying to charge the same initial pressure, were conducted to determine how the solubility is influenced by temperature and pressure...|$|R
