25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, <b>Butorphanol,</b> Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} of medical management {{is dependent on}} the severity of the colic, its cause, and the financial capabilities of the owner. At the most basic level, analgesia and sedation is administered to the horse. The most commonly used analgesics for colic pain in horses are NSAIDs, such as flunixin meglumine, although opioids such as <b>butorphanol</b> may be used if the pain is more severe. Butrophanol is often given with alpha-2 agonists such as xylazine and detomidine to prolong the analgesic effects of the opioid. Early colic signs may be masked with the use of NSAIDs, so some practitioners prefer to examine the horse before they are given by the owner.|$|E
2500|$|Schmidt et al. (1985) reviews nalbuphine’s pre-clinical {{pharmacology}} and report comparative data {{relative to other}} types of opioid compounds. [...] The authors {{point out that the}} nalbuphine moiety is approximately ten times more pharmacologically potent than the mixed opioid agonist-antagonist <b>butorphanol</b> on an “antagonist index” scale which quantitates the drug’s ability to act both as an analgesic (via opioid κ-receptor agonism) as well as an μ-receptor antagonist. [...] The opioid antagonist activity of Nalbuphine is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of pentazocine.|$|E
2500|$|For {{standing}} castration, {{the colt}} or stallion is sedated, typically with detomidine {{with or without}} <b>butorphanol,</b> and often physically restrained. [...] Local anaesthetic is injected into the parenchyma of both testes. An incision is made through the scrotum and the testes are removed, then the spermatic cord is crushed, most commonly with either ligatures or emasculators, or both. The emasculators are applied {{for two to three}} minutes, then removed, and a careful check is made for signs of haemorrhage. Assuming that bleeding is at a minimum, the other side is castrated in the same manner. Most veterinarians remove the testis held most [...] "tightly" [...] (or close to the body) by the cremaster muscle first, so as to minimize the risk of the horse withdrawing it {{to the point where it}} is inaccessible. The horse, now a gelding, is allowed to recover.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{anesthetic}} agents used {{in human}} medicine {{are used in}} veterinary medicine. [...] Alpha-2 receptor agonist drugs such as xylazine, romifidine, detomidine, and medetomidine, are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people. [...] Guaifenesin {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals. [...] Propofol is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than propofol whilst essentially having the same properties. [...] <b>Butorphanol</b> is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species. [...] Ketamine, used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation. [...] Expensive agents, such as etomidate and desflurane are rarely used outside of university hospitals. [...] Different species have different responses to drugs. [...] For example, horses may experience mania with morphine whereas dogs typically become sedated. [...] Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with midazolam, which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.|$|E

50|$|<b>Butorphanol</b> {{exhibits}} partial agonist and antagonist {{activity at}} the μ-opioid receptor, as well as partial agonist {{activity at the}} κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2.5 nM; EC50 = 57 nM; Emax = 57%). Stimulation of these receptors on central nervous system neurons causes an intracellular inhibition of adenylate cyclase, closing of influx membrane calcium channels, and opening of membrane potassium channels. This leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane potential and suppression of action potential transmission of ascending pain pathways.Because of its κ-agonist activity, at analgesic doses <b>butorphanol</b> increases pulmonary arterial pressure and cardiac work. Additionally, κ-agonism can cause dysphoria at therapeutic or supertherapeutic doses; this gives <b>butorphanol</b> a lower potential for abuse than other opioid drugs.|$|E

50|$|Thebaine (paramorphine), {{also known}} as codeine methyl enol ether, is an opiate alkaloid, its name coming from the Greek Θῆβαι, Thēbai (Thebes), an ancient city in Upper Egypt. A minor {{constituent}} of opium, thebaine is chemically similar to both morphine and codeine, but has stimulatory rather than depressant effects. At high doses, it causes convulsions similar to strychnine poisoning. The synthetic enantiomer (+)-thebaine does show analgesic effects apparently mediated through opioid receptors, unlike the inactive natural enantiomer (−)-thebaine. While thebaine is not used therapeutically, it is the main alkaloid extracted from Papaver bracteatum (Iranian poppy) and can be converted industrially {{into a variety of}} compounds, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, nalbuphine, naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine and etorphine. <b>Butorphanol</b> can also be derived from thebaine and is scheduled separately from <b>butorphanol</b> derived by other processes.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} used {{in combination with}} <b>butorphanol</b> and ketamine (given IM) to produce general anasthesia for short periods in healthy but fractious felines that will not allow an intravenous induction agent to be given.

50|$|<b>Butorphanol</b> is a {{commonly}} used narcotic for pain relief in horses. It is administered either IM or IV, with its analgesic properties {{beginning to take}} effect about 15 minutes after injection and lasting 4 hours. It is also commonly paired with sedatives, such as xylazine and detomidine, to make the horse easier to handle during veterinary procedures.|$|E
50|$|Side effects {{specific}} to horses include sedation, CNS excitement (displayed by head pressing or tossing). Overdosing {{may result in}} seizures, falling, salivation, constipation, and muscle twitching. If an overdose occurs, a narcotic antagonist, such as naloxone, may be given. Caution should be used if <b>butorphanol</b> is administered {{in addition to other}} narcotics, sedatives, depressants, or antihistamines as it will cause an additive effect.|$|E
