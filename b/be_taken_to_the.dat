5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill.

5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe {{the methods used for}} drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian was {{a former}} two-decked 44-gun frigate, but had been armed en flûte and loaded with stores to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British colony at Botany Bay. In {{addition}} to these stores, consisting of seeds, plants, farm machinery and livestock with a total value of some £70,000, the Guardian was also to transport a number of convicts and their overseers. Aboard the Guardian was a young midshipman named Thomas Pitt, the son of politician Thomas Pitt, and nephew of Prime Minister William Pitt.|$|E

5|$|In March 1787, he {{continued}} his attack against his enemies from Riobamba {{with a series of}} eight satirical letters which he called Cartas riobambenses. In response, his enemies denounced Espejo before the President of the Royal Audiencia, Juan José De Villalengua. On August 24, 1787, Villalengua requested that Espejo either to go to Lima or return to Quito to occupy a post in the government, and subsequently arrested him. Espejo was accused of writing El Retrato de Golilla, a satire against King Charles III and the Marquis de la Sonora, colonial minister of the Indies. He was taken to Quito, and from prison he sent three petitions to the Court in Madrid, which decreed, on Charles III's behalf, that the case was to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Viceroy of Bogotá. President Villalengua feigned ignorance of the matter and sent Espejo to Bogotá to defend his own cause.|$|E
5|$|José de San Martín died on 17 August 1850, in {{his house}} at Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Between 1850 and 1861, his corpse {{was buried in the}} crypt of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne. He {{requested}} in his will to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cemetery without any funeral, and to be moved to Buenos Aires thereafter. Balcarce informed Rosas and the foreign minister Felipe Arana of San Martín's death. Balcarce oversaw the embalming of his remains and their temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent San Martin's saber to Rosas.|$|E

5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} {{faced by the}} keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in a}} dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after {{for two and a half}} days before they could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland.

5|$|The {{majority}} of the first part takes place in flashbacks while a team of ill-equipped soldiers and scientists arrive at the Destiny. Eli Wallace (David Blue) solves a mathematical equation in an online computer game, planted there by Stargate Command. For his achievement, Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) recruit Wallace to the Icarus program, which is attempting to dial a nine-chevron address with the Stargate. Wallace's solution {{is the key to}} controlling the power levels for the Gate. He is taken aboard the Hammond, an Earth Daedalus-class starship, to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planet where Icarus is set up.

5|$|In {{order to}} be issued an {{identity}} card, one needs to fill in a form, which should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations. When applying the name, gender, date and place of birth, digital image, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and an electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format are taken. First-time appliers must also provide a valid birth certificate. It is possible {{for a person to}} apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken.|$|E
5|$|In {{the prime}} universe, Nina Sharp helps {{to set up}} Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is the only option. Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news.

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E
5|$|Scots law {{provides}} for {{three types of}} courts responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and heraldic. The supreme civil court is the Court of Session, although civil appeals can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (or before 1 October 2009, the House of Lords). The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at Parliament House, in Edinburgh, which was {{the home of the}} pre-Union Parliament of Scotland with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the Lawnmarket. The sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country. District courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by Justice of the Peace Courts from 2008 to 2010. The Court of the Lord Lyon regulates heraldry.|$|E

5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton {{spent most of the}} 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did {{not come}} back into session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, {{which led to the}} negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they had imagined. At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house. One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained in the house with the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall near the house. Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E
