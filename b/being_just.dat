5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for <b>being</b> <b>just</b> the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun <b>being</b> <b>just</b> one star among all the others. Later, he presents the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
5|$|Option C is {{a concept}} in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the {{championship}} {{in exchange for a}} World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. It began in June 2012 when then-champion Austin Aries said that he was not satisfied with <b>being</b> <b>just</b> the X Division Champion, which led to then-General Manager Hulk Hogan offering him a match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but only if he first vacated the X Division Championship. Aries agreed to Hogan's terms, on the condition that the X Division Champion be given the same opportunity in future years. Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E

5|$|The Ole Miss Rebels, led by {{head coach}} John Vaught, earned a regular-season record of 631 {{prior to the}} Liberty Bowl. Vaught remains the all-time leader in wins at Ole Miss, {{and at the time}} of Mississippi's {{selection}} for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, he had already led the Rebels to three national championships and six Southeastern Conference championships, the most recent of each coming in 1962. On the field, Ole Miss featured star quarterback Archie Manning, who despite <b>being</b> <b>just</b> a sophomore, was already making a name for himself and would later go on to set records for passing yardage and passing touchdowns for Ole Miss, en route to becoming one of the greatest quarterbacks in Mississippi history.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up <b>being</b> <b>just</b> like Poison.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that morality is the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), objective rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus {{believed that}} a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly rational (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori, existing externally from rational <b>being.</b> <b>Just</b> as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (morality) exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E

5|$|The record {{football}} {{attendance at}} the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008. As is customary for such games, the then 47,715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However, neither limit {{would have been able}} to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club, estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game, despite the club's official ticket allocation <b>being</b> <b>just</b> 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets to stay home. This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite <b>being</b> <b>just</b> 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E
