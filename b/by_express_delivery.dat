Each photo of a product is accompanied by the name and model number of each item, a description of each product's features and the price. The sophistication of online music stores varies. Some online music stores have a single photo of the item, the product name and price, and a few bullets about the features.

Patrons pay electronically at online music stores using a credit card, PayPal or other electronic payment systems. The goods are shipped through the mail or <b>by</b> <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> companies such as FedEx. Some music stores sell their products solely online.

The framework {{presented in this}} paper identifies relevant contextual factors that affect <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> adoption rates in European cross-border e-commerce. This framework leads to a set of hypotheses, both on the effects of <b>express</b> <b>deliveries</b> on financial performance indicators (order incidence, order size, and repurchase rate) and on the factors that drive demand for <b>express</b> <b>deliveries</b> (consumer income, logistic costs, and lead-time benefits). A case study provides empirical tests of the hypotheses, using data on about forty thousand sales transactions from a consumer electronics manufacturer’s cross-border online shop. The findings are that <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> has positive effects on financial performance, as it leads to higher order incidence, larger order size, and higher repurchase rates in cross-border transactions. Demand for <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> services increases with higher income, larger lead-time benefits, and lower logistic costs.

When the price discounts are provided by both traditional and online sellers, we find that the derived Nash price equilibrium of both channels includes five possible combinations of prices.

40|$|The <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> {{industry}} in China has seen {{rapid growth in}} recent years. The majority of the <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> companies can still be classified as medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). They are not just limited in terms of size, but {{also in terms of}} funds available for investment and in area of service coverage. Many such SMEs have chosen to collaborate so as to enhance their competitiveness. The current approach is to collaborate with another company located in a different city, and so effectively extend operations to inter-city delivery. However, this twosome type of collaboration has created problems in delivery efficiency and security. The main reason for such problems seems to be lack reliability in collaboration. The problem is compounded by a lack of affordable software tools to support such collaborations. A new approach to supporting collaboration among SME <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> companies is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach involves an “m ” to “n ” collaboration relationship, with each city served by a mult...|$|R

40|$|The <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> {{system has}} been growing {{steadily}} within {{the last two decades}} and it represents a major part of today's less-than-truckload (LTL) transports in Europe. The typical <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> network consists of a hub and spoke system which is linked by truck operations on shorter distances. In this work the potential for shifting a part of these operations towards passenger air transport is analysed. Further on, it is examined what effects this shift on the amount of emitted air pollutants would have. In a first step, all air passenger services within Europe were looked at with regard to their frequencies, their hour of the day and their aircraft types. The according payload capacities for the transport of <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> goods were generated with a capacity model on the base of real airline data. Secondly, the European <b>express</b> <b>delivery</b> markets were analysed with the help of existing market reports and own market research studies in the three biggest markets Germany, France and United Kingdom. The fuel consumption and the related CO_ 2 and NO_X emissions for truck and air transport were computed on seven inner German and four international routes with the help of two simulation tools. The work ends with a general comparison of specific air pollutant emissions of both transportation modes in regard to short distance freight transportation. (orig.)
