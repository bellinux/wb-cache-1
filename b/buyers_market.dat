5000|$|The American Made Show, (formerly {{known as}} the <b>Buyers</b> <b>Market</b> of American Craft) is the nation’s largest {{wholesale}} trade show, providing professional studio artists a venue to build relationships with qualified retailers and wholesale craft buyers. Approximately 1,000 artists exhibit to more than 5,000 buyers from 3,000 companies from across the United States and Canada. Held biannually, <b>Buyers</b> <b>Market</b> exhibitors realize more than $42 million in sales each year.

30|$|Using {{their own}} language, lime bosses {{identified}} an economic principle—failures and frauds in transaction {{were due to}} a <b>buyer’s</b> <b>market</b> in an economic sense; the later emergence of a stable market order {{was the result of}} the development of a seller’s market. In fact, the ultimate cause of these phenomena cannot be attributed to the existence of a <b>buyer’s</b> <b>market</b> before the mid- 1990 s. Even when a <b>buyer’s</b> <b>market</b> has appeared since the 21 st century due to an abundance of supply in the lime market, the phenomena described have seldom occurred. From my observations and analysis, these phenomena have their roots in the prevailing business ethics of “zhongliqingyi (valuing interests above justice)”, in which people are oriented towards material interests with little regard for moral principles.|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world, green public {{procurement}} (GPP) has become an established environmental policy instrument. Advocates of this purchasing policy argue that the public sector can use its buyer power to incentivize industries into becoming less environmentally damaging. I study how GPP is organized in Sweden and the potential supplier’s response to varying <b>buyer</b> <b>market</b> shares. The level of GPP stringency is found to vary systematically with authority type, <b>buyer</b> <b>market</b> share, and political coalition in the relevant council or the Swedish Parliament. The results indicate quite substantial dispersion in GPP stringency and suggest a low degree of coordination when implementing the policy. After controlling for GPP stringency and other covariates, <b>buyer</b> <b>market</b> share is positively associated with the probability of potential suppliers submitting a bid.   Manuskriptet tidigare publicerat i serien: Umeå Economic Studies; Nr 913, Tuesday, August 25, 2015. </p...|$|R

50|$|Though the {{performance}} of APGenCo thermal power stations in terms of reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM analysis) {{is one of the}} best in India, its hydro power stations performance is not satisfactory as they break down frequently or not in working condition when required to perform at full capacity during the short period (four months) monsoon season. The thermal efficiency (heat rate) of thermal power stations is not satisfactory to attain close to the rated / design values which is deciding parameter in the competitive electricity market (<b>buyers</b> <b>market)</b> whereas the fuel (coal) is costly in sellers market. Operating the thermal power stations in the range of 75 to 100% capacity in 'frequency follow mode' with good part load efficiency is the needful strategy in surplus electricity grid except during peak demand hours. Also Hydro power stations should perform well meeting all the functions such as power factor correction, peaking power generation, pumping water in pump mode and secondary power generation during monsoon season utilising total available water. This can be achieved by maintaining hydro power stations at availability more than 95%.|$|E
50|$|When the {{inflation}} adjusted gold value is examined, gold {{is not an}} inflation hedge but crisis hedge. Some times, gold price apparently looks lower in US$ value but its price compared to corresponding crude oil price can be exceeding 25 times far higher than long term average of 15 times. Thus during the lower oil prices period, gold acts as crisis hedge to overcome the loss of revenue from oil exports to the oil exporting countries. When oil prices are higher, it acts as crisis hedge to the oil importing countries to dispose oil stocks at profit and purchase gold with the accrued cash for replenishing oil stocks later during the lower oil price with respect to gold price. With the advent of shale oil production boom in USA, crude oil {{for the first time}} is being realistically priced in US$ irrespective of quantitative easing in USA and the agreement of USA with OPEC to transact their international crude oil exports in US$. However international gold price is fixed by the major gold importing countries like India as gold market is fully <b>buyers</b> <b>market</b> with global gold stocks amounting to 300 times of its annual consumption or 53 times of its annual production.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{experiment}} designed to evaluate interrelationships between strategic <b>buyers,</b> <b>market</b> power and merger-induced synergies. The experiment consists of 40 posted-offer quadropolies. Treatments {{include the use}} of simulated or human buyers, seller consolidations and merger-induced fixed cost and unit cost synergies. In the simulated-buyer markets we observe behavior generally consistent with comparative static predictions: prices rise post-merger, and unit (but not fixed) cost synergies may exert some price-moderating effect. The addition of powerful buyers changes results markedly. Although prices are lower in the human buyer markets, outcomes are more variable and predicted comparative static effects are no longer observed. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>buyer</b> <b>market</b> {{power in}} farm product procurement markets. We argue that buyer power concerns are often overstated because traditional models of <b>buyer</b> <b>market</b> power {{are incapable of}} depicting the economic interactions that are fundamental to modern agricultural markets, where exchange is governed by stable contractual relationships among buyers and farmers. The exercise of short-run oligopsony power is inimical to the long-run interests of buyers in these settings because below-competitive returns {{will lead to the}} exodus of resources from producing the product. Policy proposals grounded in the presumed linkage between concentration, competition, and market power may well be misguided and detrimental to the objectives proponents seek to advance...|$|R

40|$|Market based {{contracting}} introduces {{increased competition}} in the power industry, and creates a need for optimized bids and bidding strategies. To maximize the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of a bid, generation companies (GENCOs) must use good models. Such models should account for factors such as <b>buyers,</b> <b>market</b> mechanisms, and other companies using mathematical models. This paper explores probability density functions for describing a competitor’s bids. This probabilistic information is used to formulate a basic competitive bidding profit maximization problem that results in a simple yet informed bidding strategy. Under the defined circumstances, we conclude that the dependency relationship between the density functions describing a competitor’s two bids may have no impact whatever on the optimal bid of a company trying to under-bid that competitor...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{changing}} demand patters by the customers are increasing {{the pressure on}} the manufacturers.

The software based mechatronics approach is used to construct the virtual machinery instead of physical machinery for the experimentations.

40|$|We {{present a}} Cournot model with {{symmetric}} 8 ̆ 5 rms selling (homogeneous) products {{in a high}} demand and a low demand market region. Buyers are mobile but restricted by travel costs, so that imperfect arbitrage occurs when prices di¤er in both market regions. With mobile <b>buyers</b> <b>market</b> equilibria are distorted away from Cournot out-comes, and a merger reduces this distortion by widening the price di¤erential between both market regions. Moreover, a merger {{can lead to a}} high-price equilibrium outcome in which only the high-demand market region is served.

First, the “industrial chain” of human trafficking is analyzed. Second, the analysis indicates that the “buyers market” exhibits a strong demand for trafficking in women. The scale of trafficking is escalating: originally the crime was mainly committed in a few provinces, but has now spread to nearly every province in China. Furthermore, human trafficking groups are now displaying the characteristics of collectivization and specialization. Although the Chinese government has launched a series of rescue actions, the effort has run into tremendous difficulties due to dilemmas encountered by buyers, local citizens, grass-roots organizations and the trafficked women themselves. To completely eradicate trafficking in women, the Chinese government has to make long-term efforts {{to crack down on}} the <b>buyers</b> <b>market</b> and to redress the sex imbalance.

Crucial task of the changing process in a transitional country is to enable efficient functioning of the economic system and to achieve competitiveness in the world market. Process of free market development resulted in large number of small suppliers, relatively cost-inefficient, primarily because of their failure to exploit economies of scale. In Republic of Croatia trade is facing major challenges, such as stronger competition, concentration in the local market and take-overs, introduction of new technology, new forms of retail trade, e-commerce and globalization. Total share of large enterprises in retail trade is increasing, and as a result we have reduction in the total number of small retail companies which is leading to the growth of concentration.
