[...] The first actor {{to be assigned}} to The Lion King, Broderick learned of the role {{while he was on}} vacation in Ireland, where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba. At the time, Broderick was well known for portraying the title character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). [...] The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role; according to producer Don Hahn, Broderick's voice resembled [...] "the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> felt that he could come back in a very heroic way." [...] Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time, was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba. [...] His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn.|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Konami {{video game}} {{developer}} Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating [...] "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka {{did not have}} shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that {{turned him into a}} sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't 'evil for evil's sake.' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> knew there wasn't any good in there." [...] That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him. In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance, IGN stated [...] "it's the game's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out. The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Kefka's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed." [...] IGN also noted his ability to [...] "tap into primal, instinctive fears", including fears of clowns. CNet in their own review described him as [...] "the unrivaled star of the show...he's the kind of villain that you will love to hate", comparing him to Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game. Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater. GameSpy compared Kefka's final form as a representation of Lucifer, highlighted by his powerful [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] attack. Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka {{stems from the fact that}} he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy, or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which you said that the evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with your point of view, we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight it out to the end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E

Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.
