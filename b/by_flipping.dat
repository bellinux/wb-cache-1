5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> them on their backs and kicking them away. The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, this statement is inference as their diet isn't described. All that is known is that it sticks to the ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E

5|$|The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items {{located at}} or near ground level {{including}} invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions {{as well as a}} wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E
25|$|Of {{these seven}} pieces, the {{parallelogram}} {{is unique in}} {{that it has no}} reflection symmetry but only rotational symmetry, and so its mirror image can be obtained only <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> it over.

25|$|Virginia Theatre – this 1,275 seat theatre was {{designed}} by Crane, Franzheim & Bettis {{as the home of}} the Theatre Guild in 1925. President Calvin Coolidge officially inaugurated the theatre <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> a switch for electricity in Washington, D.C. The theatre was leased in 1943 as a radio station. The American National Theater and Academy (ANTA) purchased the theatre in 1950 and renamed it the ANTA Theatre. Previously called the ANTA Theatre, in 1981 the theatre was renamed the Virginia in honour of Virginia Binger. It was renamed by new owner Rocco Landesman in October 2005, in honor of playwright August Wilson.|$|E
25|$|The best {{possible}} prediction method would yield {{a point in}} the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E
25|$|Chigurh kills without {{compassion}} or remorse, {{but always}} with deliberation. He {{is described as}} having his own set of morals, however twisted they may be. While he does not kill at random or without purpose, his reasons are at times abstract. He {{sees himself as a}} hand of fate; an instrument who exacts what is supposed to happen upon those he sees accountable. He gives many of his victims he faces a chance to survive by making deals either personally, or <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> coins in making decisions. In the novel, he is depicted as having a great deal of endurance, such as being capable of withstanding pain from multiple shotgun blasts or from a fractured arm.|$|E

25|$|In shogi, {{all but two}} of {{the eight}} piece types can promote, but only to a {{particular}} piece (indicated <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> the piece to show the character on its reverse); two of these pieces are available only by promotion. Promotion may occur when a piece makes a move wholly or partially within the three furthest ranks of the board, but whether or not to promote the piece is at the discretion of the player (unless it is a forward-moving piece that has advanced too far forward {{to be able to move}} again, in which case promotion is mandatory). When a promoted piece is captured and dropped, it returns to its unpromoted state.|$|E
25|$|Autoeroticism also occurs widely among animals, {{both male}} and female. A variety of {{creative}} techniques are used, including genital stimulation using the hand or front paw (primates, Lions), foot (Vampire Bats, primates), flipper (Walruses), or tail (Savanna Baboons), sometimes accompanied by stimulation of the nipples (Rhesus Macaques, Bonobos); auto-fellating or licking, sucking and/or nuzzling by a male of his own penis (Common Chimpanzees, Savanna Bonobos, Vervet Monkeys, Squirrel Monkeys, Thinhorn Sheep, Bharal, Aovdad, Dwarf Cavies); stimulation of the penis <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> or rubbing it against the belly or in its own sheath (White-tailed and Mule Deer, Zebras and Takhi); spontaneous ejaculations (Mountain Sheep, Warthogs, Spotted Hyenas); and stimulation of the genitals using inanimate objects (found in several primates and cetaceans).|$|E
25|$|It {{is popular}} with school {{children}} in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, specially the Backbenchers occupying {{the last few}} rows, who most often play it sneakily during the ongoing class, a favorite childhood nostalgia of adults to reminisce about. It has several variants and is mostly played by two players. The runs are scored <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> the book open at random and the last digit of the right-side (even-numbered) page is counted {{as the number of}} runs scored. 0 (and sometimes 8) are assigned to special rules, typically a wicket is lost when a person scores 0 and scoring 8 would be substituted for a No ball run and an additional chance. To give an example, if the batting side opened the book at page 26, then 6 runs would be scored. For the toss, what is generally done is that both the players open a page and the one whose last digit is greater wins.|$|E

In a high-speed vehicle chase a player {{can use the}} grappling hook to attach the pursuit vehicle to the ground, forcing it to stop and often damaging it <b>by</b> <b>flipping.</b> Players can also tether two enemies together. The grappling hook allows a player to pull himself, hold onto objects such as walls or helicopters and pull enemies towards Rico. The player has a parachute, which is always ready to be deployed {{even if it was}} already deployed moments earlier. This can be combined with the grappling hook as quick transport, with players [...] "slingshooting" [...] themselves into the air.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Spacewar involves two monochrome spaceships called [...] "the needle" [...] and [...] "the wedge", each {{controlled by}} a player, attempting to shoot one another while maneuvering on a two-dimensional plane in the gravity well of a star, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. The ships fire torpedoes which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star. The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires his thrusters. Torpedoes are fired one at a time <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> a toggle switch on the computer or pressing a button on the control pad, and there is a cooldown period between launches. [...] The ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{conserve}} {{heat with}} their large and compact body size, insulating blubber and fur, and high metabolism. In addition, {{the blood vessels}} in their flippers are adapted for countercurrent exchange. Veins containing cool blood from the body extremities surround arteries, which contain warm blood received from {{the core of the}} body. Heat from the arterial blood is transferred to the blood vessels, which then recirculate blood back to the core. The same adaptations that conserve heat while in water tend to inhibit heat loss when out of water. To counteract overheating, many species cool off <b>by</b> <b>flipping</b> sand onto their backs, adding a layer of cool, damp sand that enhances heat loss. The northern fur seal [...] to help stay cool, while monk seals often dig holes in the sand to expose cooler layers to rest in.|$|E
