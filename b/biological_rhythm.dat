5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different <b>biological</b> <b>rhythm</b> from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcap}} feeds {{mainly on}} insects during the breeding season, then switches to fruit in late summer, the change being triggered by an internal <b>biological</b> <b>rhythm.</b> When migrants arrive on their territories they initially take berries, pollen and nectar {{if there are}} insufficient insects available, then soon switch to their preferred diet. They mainly pick prey off foliage and twigs, but may occasionally hover, flycatch or feed on the ground. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} invertebrate prey, although aphids are particularly important early in the season, and flies, beetles and caterpillars are also taken in large numbers. Small snails are swallowed whole, since the shell is a source of calcium for the bird's eggs. Chicks are mainly fed soft-bodied insects, fruit only being provided if invertebrates are scarce.|$|E

50|$|Journal of <b>Biological</b> <b>Rhythms</b> is a peer-reviewed {{academic}} {{journal that}} publishes papers focused on chronobiology, or {{any aspect of}} <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms</b> with a special emphasis on seasonal and circadian rhythms. However, papers on various other rhythms are also published in the Journal of <b>Biological</b> <b>Rhythms.</b> These publications can be primary reports of new discoveries, reviews, commentaries, or letters. As such, {{the authors of the}} publications have a diverse set of backgrounds and base their findings in areas like ecology, neurobiology and behavior, psychology and psychiatry, endocrinology, developmental biology, pharmacology, cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and mathematical modeling. The Journal of <b>Biological</b> <b>Rhythms</b> has been in publication since 1986 and is currently published by SAGE Publications. The Journal of <b>Biological</b> <b>Rhythms</b> is the official publication of the Society for Research on <b>Biological</b> <b>Rhythms.</b> The journal's Chief Editor is William J Schwartz.|$|R

500|$|The <b>biological</b> <b>rhythm</b> {{can vary}} from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs. Diurnality is not seen in any other living strepsirrhine. Cathemerality, where an animal is active {{sporadically}} both day and night, occurs {{among some of the}} larger lemurs. Few if any other primates exhibit this sort of activity cycle, either regularly or irregularly under changing environmental conditions. The most heavily studied cathemeral lemurs are the true lemurs. Although the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz) is the best-documented example, every species in the genus studied has shown some degree of cathemeral behavior, although night activity is often restricted by light availability and moon periodicity. This type of behavior was first documented in the 1960s in true lemur species as well as other Lemuridae species, such as ruffed lemurs and bamboo lemurs. Initially described as [...] "crepuscular" [...] (active at dawn and dusk), anthropologist Ian Tattersall stimulated additional research and coined the new term [...] "cathemeral", although many non-anthropologists prefer the terms [...] "circadian" [...] or [...] "diel".|$|E

This review outlines what is known about the neurobiology of <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms</b> in mammals and describes the hierarchical order in which ultradian, circadian and infradian rhythms are related to each other. The article does not attempt to catalogue every physiological variable showing rhythmical fluctuations in laboratory mammals.

30|$|As {{disturbances}} in sleep and <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms</b> are prominent features of BD, {{a better understanding}} of how these symptoms relate to overall sense of well-being and QOL is required. To the best of our knowledge, the interplay of depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms</b> on QOL has not been studied in euthymic and depressed BD subjects. In addition, many psychotropic drugs used in the treatment of BD can affect sleep, but it is still unclear how these drugs may moderate the impact of sleep and <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms</b> on QOL. The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep, <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms,</b> sleep medication use, and severity of depression on QOL in a well-characterized sample of euthymic and depressed BD subjects. The impact of these factors was measured on overall and specific domains of QOL such as physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment. We hypothesized that abnormalities in <b>biological</b> <b>rhythms</b> would be independently associated with poor QOL in individuals with BD.|$|R

For these bacteria, regulation of kaiA expression is critical for circadian rhythm, which determines the twenty-four-hour <b>biological</b> <b>rhythm.</b> In addition, KaiA functions with a negative feedback loop in relation with kaiB and KaiC. The kaiA gene makes KaiA protein that enhances phosphorylation of KaiC while KaiB inhibits activity of KaiA.|$|E
50|$|A {{key part}} of CPG's is half-center oscillators. In its {{simplest}} form, this refers to two neurons capable of rhythmogenesis when firing together. The generation of a <b>biological</b> <b>rhythm,</b> or rhythmogenesis, is done {{by a series of}} inhibition and activation. For example, a first neuron inhibits a second one while it fires, however, it also induces slow depolarization in the second neuron. This is followed by the release of an action potential from the second neuron as a result of depolarization, which acts on the first in a similar fashion. This allows for self-sustaining patterns of oscillation. Furthermore, new motor patterns, such as athletic skills or the ability to play an instrument, also use half-center oscillators and are simply learned perturbations to CPG's already in place.|$|E

Current research is focused on developing bright light exposure and melatonin administration as treatment modalities for these disorders. Treatment must be precisely scheduled. Morning light exposure and evening melatonin administration cause circadian phase-advance shifts; evening light exposure and morning melatonin administration cause circadian phase-delay shifts. Totally blind individuals have 25-hour circadian rhythms, drifting an hour later each day, unless they take a melatonin capsule {{at a certain time}} every day." ...|$|E
