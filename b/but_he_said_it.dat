A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The doctors tried {{to tell him that}} the increased radiation dose would kill him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't, and that anyway he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E

Alexei Malashenko, an expert on the Caucasus at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said it was possible that this faction had ordered the firing of a dummy missile in a bid to fuel the crisis. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was more likely that the missile attack could have been carried out by local Russian army units without the knowledge of the Russian government.|$|E
500|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Mulkern praised Corden and Smith, {{but said}} it did not [...] "quite tick [...] boxes". He was not engaged by the upstairs villain, wished for more [...] "laugh-out-loud moments than good-humoured banter" [...] and disliked that the Doctor seemed [...] "diminished" [...] when thrown into the everyday atmosphere. In a review for IGN, Matt Wales rated it 7 out of 10 and {{referred to it as}} [...] "one of the fluffier episodes" [...] in terms of plot, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was an [...] "enjoyable little duck-out-of-water adventure". He called Smith [...] "an absolute joy to watch" [...] and said that Corden and Haggard [...] " [...] themselves admirably". However, he criticised the [...] "more traditional Who elements", such as the alien threat that the directing left [...] "devoid of almost all tension", Amy's occasional appearances that did not seem to gel {{with the rest of the}} story, and the short resolution, where [...] "the whole thing collapsed into an incomprehensible muddle".|$|E
500|$|... "Sister City" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by series co-creator Michael Schur. The episode featured comedian Fred Armisen in a guest appearance as Raul, the vice director of a Venezuelan parks department. Armisen was a cast member of NBC's sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, where he previously worked with performer Poehler and writer Schur. Armisen has played Venezuelan characters before, and previously imitated President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Saturday Night Live. Armisen said he got into character by thinking about his uncle, who is from Venezuela. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was not a difficult performance because [...] "most of the joke is the uniform", which included a tan military-style jacket with medals, a red beret and a sash with {{the colors of the}} Venezuela flag. The uniform also included a fictional seal designed by Schur, which included an image of Chavez, machine guns, an oil tower, a lion and a parrot.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said {{he wished he}} could [...] "get rid of them all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, who were trying to [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded".

500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. GameSpot writer Jeff Sengstack said the {{expensive}} budget and long production history [...] "do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming". He complimented the graphics and music, but considered [...] " [...] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame". Mike Hall of the Albuquerque Journal compared Phantasmagoria to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like Cleopatra and Waterworld. He said the graphics were beautiful, {{but the game}} ended too quickly, the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve. The Escapist writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were [...] "ordinary, pixilated fare" [...] was [...] "odd and unflattering". A one-star review in The Video Games Guide, published in 2013, [...] "now seems {{little more than a}} flawed, though ambitious, white elephant". In a 2014 review, IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that Phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content {{for the end of the}} game. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was ultimately [...] "less a bad game than a bad horror film" [...] and said the execution, [...] "although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices".|$|E

500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> had come out too raucous. He asked me if I could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E

In 2002, it was reported that GM spent about $100 million a year in research and development of fuel cell vehicle. In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet willing to say exactly when hydrogen vehicles would be mass-produced, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted.
