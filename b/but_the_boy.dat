5|$|In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the {{daughter}} of a Toorak stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909. His first child was born on 29 June 1910, and named Charles Middleton after a friend of Blamey's who had died in a shooting accident; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was always called Dolf by his family. A second child, a boy named Thomas, was born four years later.|$|E
5|$|The first {{death on}} Giant Dipper {{occurred}} {{four months after}} it debuted, on September 21. A 15-year-old boy fell from the ride while standing up {{near the end of}} the ride. The emergency brake was applied, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> fell head first onto the track and was crushed by the roller coaster train. Other fatalities also occurred in 1940 and 1970. Several modifications have been made to the trains as a result.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

5|$|At age six, Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he was old enough to make his own way in the world. Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E
25|$|Segregated {{public schools}} were {{declared}} unconstitutional in 1954 by a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts of America included racially segregated units {{as late as}} 1974.|$|E

25|$|A {{man named}} Rawlins, a {{reporter}} with a newspaper at Benalla, was shot and wounded. A boy and girl, the children of Mrs Jones, were shot. The young girl survived, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> later died in hospital the following day. Reardon's son was shot accidentally by Sgt. Steele when they were attempting to escape the hotel. An Aboriginal tracker also had a narrow escape with a ball grazing his forehead.|$|E
25|$|As {{the team}} has breakfast the {{following}} morning, a figure of a 13-year-old human boy appears on the base. Popov ignores it assuming that it is another one of his hallucinations. However, the other people see the boy too. They try to follow him <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> quickly leaves the premises and the explorers lose his track. The team sends a report back to the orbital base. They receive a reply from Leonid Gorbovsky. The mission of ER-2 is changed to establish contact with a possible alien race.|$|E

25|$|After Lord Shiva {{had come}} out of his meditation,he wanted to go and see Parvati but found himself being stopped by this strange boy. Shiva tried to reason with the boy saying that he was Parvati's husband <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> did not listen and was {{determined}} to not let Shiva enter till his mother Goddess Parvati finished her bath. The boy's behaviour surprised Shiva. Sensing that this was no ordinary boy, the usually peaceful Shiva decided he would have to fight the boy and in his divine fury severed the boy's head with his Trishul thereby killing him instantly.|$|E
25|$|After an era {{of lesser}} {{importance}} under the Salian and Saxon emperors, a single event once again brought Frankfurt to the fore: {{it was in the}} local church in 1147 that Bernard of Clairvaux called, amongst others, the Hohenstaufen king Conrad III to the Second Crusade. Before leaving for Jerusalem, Conrad selected his ten-year-old son as heir, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> died before his father. Due to this, an election was held in Frankfurt five years later, and after the emperor Frederick Barbarossa was elected, Frankfurt became the customary place for the election of the German kings.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was gone forever.|$|E

25|$|Mr and Mrs Boffin {{attempt to}} adopt a young orphan, {{previously}} {{in the care of}} his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> dies before the adoption can proceed. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. She has a terror of the workhouse. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer. In the meantime Eugene Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie's whereabouts from Jenny's father and has tracked the object of his affections. Bradley Headstone attempts to enlist the help of Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, to find Lizzie. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Lizzie finds him in the river and rescues him. Wrayburn, thinking he will die anyway, marries Lizzie to save her reputation. When he survives, he is glad that this has brought him into a loving marriage, albeit with a social inferior. He had not cared about the social gulf between them but Lizzie had and would not otherwise have married him.|$|E
500|$|Braille {{was helped}} by the Haüy books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of {{information}} kept in such books was necessarily small. Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to [...] "write" [...] by themselves. So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather. It was a slow and cumbersome process, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> could at least trace the letters' outlines and write his first sentences.|$|E
500|$|Legend {{also has}} it that Marko {{acquired}} his strength after he was suckled by a vila. King Vukašin threw him into a river {{because he did not}} resemble him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was saved by a cowherd (who adopted him, and a vila suckled him). In other accounts, Marko was a shepherd (or cowherd) who found a vilas children lost in a mountain and shaded them against the sun (or gave them water). As a reward the vila suckled him three times, and he could lift and throw a large boulder. An Istrian [...] version has Marko making a shade for two snakes, instead of the children. In a Bulgarian version, each of the three draughts of milk he suckled from the vilas breast became a snake.|$|E
50|$|On April 2, 2016 and on April 20, 2016, Lucy DeCoutere and Jonathan Torrens {{announced}} {{they were leaving}} <b>the</b> show, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> have assured that the show is not ending.|$|R

500|$|The {{legend of}} the green {{children}} of Woolpit concerns two children of unusual skin colour who reportedly appeared {{in the village of}} Woolpit in Suffolk, England, some time in the 12th century, perhaps during the reign of King Stephen. The children, brother and sister, were of generally normal appearance except for the green colour of their skin. They spoke in an unknown language, and would only eat raw broad beans. Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was sickly and died soon after he and his sister were baptised. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be [...] "rather loose and wanton in her conduct". After she learned to speak English, the girl explained that she and her brother had come from Saint Martin's Land, a subterranean world inhabited by green people.|$|E
500|$|Pistrucci's obvious talent {{made his}} fellow {{apprentices}} envious, and one provoked {{a fight with}} him, stabbing him in the abdomen before Pistrucci fended off the attack. Recovering at home, he taught himself to model with wax. Federico Pistrucci decided his son {{would be better off}} with a new master, and secured a position for him with Giuseppe Cerbara, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> refused, believing {{that he would have to}} work in poor conditions. A place with gem-carver Nicolo Morelli was secured, and Pistrucci also attended the scuola del nudo art academy at the Campidoglio, where in 1800 he took the first prize for sculpture. Pistrucci felt Morelli was seeking to profit from his ability while giving him little training, and left his position at the age of 15, working from the family home. [...] He was able to pay rent, as from the beginning he had ample commissions for cameos.|$|E
500|$|At the far right, a {{black man}} fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her {{pie-dish}} [...] "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status of this man is not clear. The black man, the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars, Venus and Cupid which would {{have appeared in the}} pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women (now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.|$|E
