5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around and explore their {{surroundings}} within {{one to three}} days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{possessed a}} {{numerical}} superiority {{of two to}} one, and their advanced post, commanded by Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, overlooked all parts of Frederick's camp. The French and Habsburg Imperial (Reichsarmee) troops consisted of 62 battalions (31,000 infantry), 84 squadrons (10,000) of cavalry, and 109 artillery, totaling some 4142,000 men, under Soubise's and Saxe-Hildburghausen's command. The Allies had {{taken the lead in}} the maneuvers of the previous days, and Hildburghausen decided to take the offensive. He had some difficulty inducing Soubise to risk a battle, so the Allies did not <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from their campground until after eleven a.m. on 5 November. Soubise probably intended to engage as late in the day as possible, with the idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action before nightfall. Their plan called for the Allied army to march by Zeuchfeld, around Frederick's left, which no serious natural obstacle covered, and to deploy in battle array facing north, between Reichardtswerben on the right and Pettstädt on the left. Saxe-Hildburghausen's proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise appeared equally likely to succeed by taking this position, which threatened to cut Frederick off from a retreat to the towns on the Saale. The Allies could only attain this position by marching around the Prussian flank, which could put them in the tenuous position of marching across their enemies' front. Consequently, the Allies posted a sizable guard against the obvious risk of interference on their exposed flank.|$|E

25|$|What {{this means}} is that even if we have {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E

25|$|The Alpha Centauri {{system will}} then <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{away from the}} Solar System, showing a {{positive}} radial velocity. Because of visual perspective, about 100,000years from now, these stars will reach a final vanishing point and slowly disappear among the countless stars of the Milky Way. Here this once bright yellow star will fall below naked-eye visibility somewhere in the faint present day southern constellation of Telescopium. This unusual location results {{from the fact that}} Alpha Centauri's orbit around the galactic centre is highly tilted with respect to the plane of the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg glass transition temperature to form an amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.|$|E

25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that fully melting Antarctica would contribute over 60 metres of sea level rise, and Greenland would contribute more than 7 metres. Small glaciers and ice caps {{on the margins of}} Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula might contribute about 0.5 metres. The latter figure is much smaller than for Antarctica or Greenland, but it could occur relatively quickly (within the coming century), whereas full melting of Greenland would be slow (perhaps 1,500 years to fully deglaciate at the fastest likely rate) and Antarctica even slower. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of accelerate melting as meltwater flows under and lubricates the larger ice sheets, which would <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> much more rapidly towards the sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{motion of}} a body can only be {{described}} relative to something elseother bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called frames of reference. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> at the next instant, even though there are no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given as: In an inertial reference frame, the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.|$|E

500|$|About {{four days}} in advance of a typical {{tropical}} cyclone, an ocean [...] of [...] in height will roll in about every 10 seconds, moving towards the coast {{from the direction of}} the tropical cyclone's location. [...] The ocean swell will slowly increase in height and frequency the closer a tropical cyclone gets to land. [...] Two days in advance of the center's passage, winds go calm as the tropical cyclone interrupts the environmental wind flow. [...] Within 36 hours of the center passage, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. [...] Within 24 hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. [...] Within 18 hours of the center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. [...] Winds increase within 12 hours of the center's approach, occasionally reaching hurricane force. [...] The ocean's surface becomes whipped with foam. [...] Small items begin flying in the wind. [...] Within 6 hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous and the storm surge begins to come inland. [...] Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. [...] When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. [...] At this point, the pressure ceases to drop as the lowest pressure within the storm's center is reached. [...] This is also when the peak depth of the storm surge occurs. [...] Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. [...] The storm surge retreats as the pressure suddenly rises in the wake of its center. [...] One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. [...] By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.|$|E
