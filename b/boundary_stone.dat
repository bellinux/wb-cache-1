25|$|The name Brixton {{is thought}} to {{originate}} from Brixistane, meaning the stone of Brixi, a Saxon lord. Brixi {{is thought to}} have erected a <b>boundary</b> <b>stone</b> to mark the meeting place of the ancient hundred court of Surrey. The location is unknown but is thought to {{be at the top of}} Brixton Hill, at a road known at the time as Bristow or Brixton Causeway, long before any settlement in the area. Brixton marks the rise from the marshes of North Lambeth up to the hills of Upper Norwood and Streatham. At the time the River Effra flowed from its source in Upper Norwood through Herne Hill to Brixton. At Brixton the river was crossed by low bridges for Roman roads to the south coast of Britain, now Brixton Road and Clapham Road. The main roads were connected through a network of medieval country lanes, such as Acre Lane, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton Water Lane and Lyham Road, formerly Black Lane. It was only at the end of the 18th century that villages and settlements formed around Brixton, as the original woodland was gradually reduced until the area was covered in farmland and market gardens known for game and strawberries.|$|E
500|$|In Roman religion, Terminus was the god who {{protected}} boundary markers; {{his name}} was the Latin word for such a marker.

500|$|The River Mersey forms Didsbury's {{southern}} and southwestern boundaries and certain {{stretches of the}} river also demarcate {{the boundaries of the}} City of Manchester. The area is generally considered to be roughly enclosed by Princess Parkway to the west, Kingsway to the east and the Ball Brook, just north of Lapwing Lane/Fog Lane to the north. This northern boundary is marked by a <b>boundary</b> <b>stone</b> in the front garden wall of a house {{on the west side of}} Wilmslow Road. A [...] "country trail" [...] passes from West Didsbury to East, named the Trans Pennine Trail (National Cycle Route 62).

500|$|The {{bridge at}} St Thomas-a-Watering over the River Neckinger {{was at the}} {{junction}} with what is now Old Kent Road and Shorncliffe Road (previously Thomas Street), and marked the boundary of the Archbishop of Canterbury's authority over the manors of Southwark and Walworth. It was the limit of the City of London's authority in 1550, having been ratified in several charters and marked by a <b>boundary</b> <b>stone</b> set into {{the wall of the}} old fire station that marked the first resting place for pilgrims while travelling to Canterbury. The nearby public house, the Thomas a Becket, at the corner of Albany Road is named after this. Henry V met soldiers returning from Agincourt at this location in 1415. Charles II's journey along the road on his way to reclaim the throne in May 1660 was described by contemporary writer and diarist John Evelyn as [...] "a triumph of about 20,000 horse and foote, brandishing their swords and shouting with inexpressible joy".|$|E
500|$|The {{name of the}} god Terminus was the Latin {{word for}} a <b>boundary</b> <b>stone,</b> and his worship as {{recorded}} in the late Republic and Empire centred on this stone, with which the god could be identified. Siculus Flaccus, a writer on land surveying, records the ritual by which the stone was sanctified: the bones, ashes, and blood of a sacrificial victim, along with crops, honeycombs, and wine, were placed into a hole {{at a point where}} estates converged, and the stone was driven in on top. On February 23 annually, a festival called the Terminalia was celebrated in Terminus' honor, involving practices which can be regarded as a reflection or [...] "yearly renewal" [...] of this foundational ritual. Neighboring families would garland their respective sides of the marker and make offerings to Terminus at an altarOvid identifies these, again, as crops, honeycombs, and wine. The marker itself would be drenched in the blood of a sacrificed lamb or pig. There followed a communal feast and hymns in praise of Terminus.|$|E
2500|$|Biographers {{have stated}} that Banneker's duties on the survey {{consisted}} primarily of making astronomical observations at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia, to ascertain {{the location of the}} starting point for the survey.

[...] However, some have noted that Banneker's actual role in the survey is uncertain, as his involvement in the effort [...] "rests on extremely meager documentation". An April 21, 1791, news report of the dedication ceremony for the first <b>boundary</b> <b>stone</b> (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who ″ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed".

2500|$|The Mongol Empire {{made some}} efforts to subjugate the native people of Sakhalin {{starting}} in about 1264 CE. According to Yuanshi, the official {{history of the}} Yuan dynasty, the Mongols militarily subdued the Guwei (骨嵬, Gǔwéi), and by 1308, all inhabitants of Sakhalin had submitted to the Yuan. The Nivkhs and the Oroks were subjugated earlier, whereas the Ainu people submitted to the Mongols later. Following their subjugation, Gǔwéi elders made tributary visits to Yuan posts located at Wuleihe, Nanghar, and Boluohe {{until the end of}} the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China (1368). In the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the tributary relationship was re-established. By the middle of the 15th century, following the introduction of Chinese political and commercial institutions in the Amur region, the Sakhalin Ainu were making frequent tributary visits to Chinese-controlled outposts. Chinese of the Ming dynasty knew the island as Kuyi (苦夷 Kǔyí) or Kuwu (...) , and later as Kuye (...) , as it is known today. There is some evidence that the Ming eunuch Admiral Yishiha reached Sakhalin in 1413 during one of his expeditions to the lower Amur, and granted Ming titles to a local chieftain. Under the Ming dynasty, commerce in Northeast Asia and Sakhalin was placed under the [...] "system for subjugated peoples", or ximin tizhi. This suggests that the island was at least nominally under the administration of the Nurgan Regional Military Commission, which was established by Yishiha near today's village of Tyr on the Siberian mainland in 1411, and continued operating until the mid-1430s. A Ming <b>boundary</b> <b>stone</b> still exists on the island.|$|E
