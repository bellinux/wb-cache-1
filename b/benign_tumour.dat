500|$|Despite the {{operations}} on {{his throat and}} having taken the sea air at Cowes, Frederick remained hoarse, and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the Italian Riviera. In August, following reports {{that his father was}} gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to Toblach in South Tyrol with his family, where Victoria had rented a house. He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse. Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg consulted the distinguished laryngologist Max Joseph Oertel, who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a <b>benign</b> <b>tumour</b> which could soon become malignant. By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a [...] "momentary chill." [...] However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for Venice, to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: We {{examined}} the relationship between the size and nature of renal masses in term of malignant potential, histological grading, pathological staging and presence of necrosis and sarcomatoid changes. Materials and Methods: Retrospectively, we reviewed 323 consecutive nephrectomies between 2000 and 2010. Final pathology was correlated with tumour size. The renal tumours were stratified into three groups according to the largest diameter, defined as 4 cm or smaller, greater than 4 cm to 7 cm, and greater than 7 cm. We recorded the proportion of <b>benign</b> <b>tumours,</b> tumour grade and stage, presence of necrosis and sarcomatoid change. Results: Small renal masses ≤ 4 cm (SRMs) {{were more likely to be}} localised to the kidney (90 %) and of lower histological grade (75 %). The proportion of <b>benign</b> <b>tumours</b> in SRMs (15 %) was higher than other two groups with the majority of <b>benign</b> <b>tumours</b> being oncocytomas. There was a statistically significant trend with greater necrosis and sarcomatoid change for the large size group. Conclusions: SRMs are likely to be low grade and organ confined with little or no adverse pathological features. There is increased likelihood of benignity in SRTs with the majority of <b>benign</b> <b>tumours</b> being oncocytomas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Benign</b> <b>tumours</b> of {{the bone}} are not {{cancerous}} and would not metastasise to {{other regions of the}} body. However, they can occur in any part of the skeleton, and can still be dangerous as they may grow and compress healthy bone tissue. There are several types of <b>benign</b> <b>tumours</b> that can be classified by the type of matrix that the tumour cells produce; such as bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, fat or blood vessel. Overall, 8 different types can be distinguished: osteochondroma, osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, giant cell tumour, aneurysmal bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia and enchondroma. The incidence of <b>benign</b> bone <b>tumours</b> varies depending on the type. However, they most commonly arise in people less than 30 years old, often triggered by the hormones that stimulate normal growth. The most common type is osteochondroma.
