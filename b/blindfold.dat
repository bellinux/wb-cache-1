5|$|Between 1873 and 1882 Steinitz {{played no}} tournaments {{and only one}} match (a 7–0 win against Blackburne in 1876). His other games during this period were in {{simultaneous}} and <b>blindfold</b> exhibitions, which contributed {{an important part of}} a professional chess-player's income in those days (for example in 1887 Blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two simultaneous exhibitions and a <b>blindfold</b> exhibition hosted by the Teesside Chess Association; this was equivalent to about £4,800 at 2007 values).|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{played for}} the first time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament in Monte Carlo in March. In the 11 rounds, he {{achieved}} eight draws and three losses in the <b>blindfold</b> games, as well as three wins, seven draws and one loss in the rapid games. This resulted in a shared ninth place in the <b>blindfold,</b> shared second place in the rapid (behind Anand), and a shared eighth place overall.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen shared {{first place}} {{alongside}} Ivanchuk in the Amber <b>blindfold</b> and rapid tournament. Scoring 6½/11 in the <b>blindfold</b> and 8/11 in the rapid, Carlsen accumulated 14½ from a possible 22 points. In May {{it was revealed}} that Carlsen had helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championship 2010 against challenger Veselin Topalov, which Anand won 6½–5½ to retain the title. Carlsen had also helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championships in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
40|$|Thirty two ewes (14 Barki and 18 Rahmani ewes) {{and their}} lambs {{were used to}} examine the effect of <b>blindfolding</b> of ewes at the second week after lambing on {{maternal}} and neonatal behaviour. Half number of each breed was used as a control group (non-blindfold), while the others were <b>blindfolded</b> (treated groups). Each <b>blindfolded</b> ewe was tested once with <b>blindfolded</b> own and alien lambs and the other with non-blindfolded own and alien ones. Before test period (10 min), tested ewe and lamb were separated (50 m away from each other) for 4 hours. <b>Blindfolding</b> had a significant influence on number of acceptance at the udder in Barki (P< 0. 01) and Rahmani (P< 0. 05) ewes. Some <b>blindfolded</b> Barki and Rahmani ewes accepted alien lambs at their udders. The effect of <b>blindfolding</b> on distance covered by dam towards the lamb and distance paced by lamb towards the dam was highly significant (P< 0. 01) in the two breeds studied. Non-blindfolded Barki and Rahmani lambs whether own or alien paced significantly longer distance towards <b>blindfolded</b> ewes than <b>blindfolded</b> own and alien ones. Meanwhile, number of baaings emitted by lambs was significantly (P< 0. 01) affected by <b>blindfolding.</b> <b>Blindfolded</b> lambs emitted more frequencies of baaings to seek care from ewes instead of vision. The obtained results support previous contention that visual clues are of major importance in ewe-lamb bond during the early stages of life. In the meantime, it may be recommended to adopt the <b>blindfolding</b> of ewes in grafting of alien lambs of the two Egyptian breeds tested...|$|R

5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to <b>blindfold</b> Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to <b>blindfold</b> Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

Thirteen months later, it is Father's Day and Adam tends to their son Jack (played variously by Joel Little and Dexter Little) in the night. Christine hears the Stranger's voice, but eventually finds Jack with Adam. Christine celebrates her birthday thirteen months later. Ernie no longer recognises Christine, while Adam {{is more interested}} in his colleague Zara (Ellerby). Marion blindfolds Christine for a game of blind man's buff. Christine hears noises from behind a door and removes her <b>blindfold</b> to step through. Thirteen months later, Adam is packing a case for a family holiday. Ernie has died, and Christine's relationship with Adam is strained.|$|E

40|$|In the {{research}} reported here, we investigated whether 18 -month-olds would {{use their own}} past experience of visual access to attribute perception and consequent beliefs to other people. Infants in this study wore either opaque <b>blindfolds</b> (opaque condition) or trick <b>blindfolds</b> that looked opaque but were actually transparent (trick condition). Then both groups of infants observed an actor wearing one of the same <b>blindfolds</b> that they themselves had experienced, while a puppet removed an object from its location. Anticipatory eye movements revealed that infants who had experienced opaque <b>blindfolds</b> expected the actor to behave in accordance with a false belief about the object's location, but that infants who had experienced trick <b>blindfolds</b> did not exhibit that expectation. Our results suggest that 18 -month-olds used self-experience with the <b>blindfolds</b> to assess the actor's visual access and to update her belief state accordingly. These data constitute compelling evidence that 18 -month-olds infer perceptual access and appreciate its causal role in altering the epistemic states of other people...|$|R

5|$|Dustin Rhodes fought Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore and A-1, in what was billed as a Prince of Darkness match next. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 20 seconds. In this contest, there would be three falls, but the third fall would be contested under <b>blindfold</b> match rules, in which both wrestlers wore hoods over their heads. Roode earned the first fall with a roll-up pin, and Dustin earned the second one when he forced Roode face-first into the mat from the top rope. During the third fall, both wrestlers wore black hoods that impaired their vision, causing Dustin to accidentally knock the referee unconscious in storyline terms. Due to this, D'Amore opened the cage door and passed Roode a steel folding chair. Roode then attempted to bash Dustin with it but instead mistakenly struck D'Amore. Dustin then grabbed the chair and struck Roode with it, which gave him the pinfall as the referee came to.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's <b>Blindfold,</b> the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to feel at home there.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; <b>blindfold</b> chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the ability of a}} bottlenose dolphin to adapt a previously learned "do-as-I-do"procedure to copy behaviors of another dolphin while <b>blindfolded</b> (i. e., wearing eyecups). In Experiment 1, the dolphin was able to copy both vocal and motor behaviors, whether <b>blindfolded</b> or sighted. Hydrophone recordings showed that he echolocated during many of the motor behaviors while <b>blindfolded.</b> In Experiment 2, <b>blindfolded</b> human trainers were able to identify the same model behaviors {{on the basis of their}} characteristic sounds. While it thus remains unclear whether the dolphin recognized the motor behaviors via echolocation or via their characteristic sounds, this is the first demonstration of such flexibility in using a new perceptual route to motor imitation in a nonhuman animal...|$|R
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a <b>blindfold</b> as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E
