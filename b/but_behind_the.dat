25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1990–91 season, {{and ending with}} the 1995–96 season, the 76ers had the dubious {{distinction}} of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995–96 season, when they finished with an 18–64 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies <b>but</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season {{would turn out to}} be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995–96 season. Snider had been the Sixers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.|$|E

25|$|The Testarossa is a two-door coupé that premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show. All {{versions}} of the Testarossa had the power fed through the wheels from a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (engine between the axles <b>but</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> cabin) keeps the centre of gravity {{in the middle of}} the car, which increases stability and improves the car's cornering ability, and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40% front: 60% rear. The original Testarossa was re-engineered for 1992 and released as the 512 TR, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, effectively as a completely new car, and an improved weight distribution of 41% front: 59% rear. The F512 M was introduced at the 1994 Paris Auto Show. The car dropped the TR initials and added the M which in Italian stood for modificata, or translated to modified, and was the final version of the Testarossa, and continued its predecessor's weight distribution improvement of 42% front: 58% rear. The F512 M was Ferrari's last mid-engine 12-cylinder car, apart from the limited edition F50, Enzo and LaFerrari, featuring the company's last flat engine. The Testarossa was replaced in 1996 by the front-engined 550 Maranello coupé.|$|E

On the whole, the actor enjoyed his time in Hamlet <b>but</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes, relations between him and Burton were strained. Hordern noted his colleague's [...] "likeability, charm and charisma" [...] but thought that Burton {{had a tendency to}} get easily [...] "ratty" [...] with him in social situations. Hordern described their working relationship as [...] "love-hate" [...] and admitted that they were envious of each other's success; Burton of Hordern because of the latter's good reviews, and Hordern of Burton who received more attention from fans. When Burton left for Hollywood years later, he recommended Hordern to various casting directors; Hordern was subsequently engaged in six of Burton's films.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. <b>But</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E

Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I want something, I go for it. I am not afraid. I am confident in my training and am careful not to get hurt.

[...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) <b>but</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds). Overall Chouhal finished 58th out of 75 athletes, but did not progress to the first round because he was 0.21 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his meat who advanced to the later stages.|$|E

[...] An area around the torso of Lycurgus is a rather different colour {{from the rest of the}} glass; perhaps an accident of manufacture, but one exploited by the glass-cutter [...] "so that he could make Lycurgus's rage glow even more strongly". [...] After the very lengthy cutting stage the fine polished appearance was achieved by a process called [...] "flame polishing" [...] that risked the complete loss of the object.

2500|$|Bieber was GM Department Director {{for just}} {{two and a}} half years, but {{negotiated}} a historic contract with General Motors (GM) in 1982. The early 1980s recession and competition from Japanese automakers had cut very deeply into GM's market share, and the company had laid off more than 140,000 of its 330,000 production workers (roughly half its workforce). UAW membership had fallen to 1.2 million from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979. In March 1981, nine months after Bieber became GM Department head, GM asked the union to reopen its contract and negotiation concessions but the union refused. In November 1981, however, GM began using its worker participation program to convince its unionized employees to reopen their contract. Bieber strongly criticized the company for generating [...] "distrust of the U.A.W. leadership", [...] "spoonfeed" [...] a [...] "captive audience", and perverting the worker participation program into a means to [...] "propagandize or parrot the current views of {{the chairman of the board}} of G.M. as to how to save G.M. through worker sacrifice." [...] <b>But</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes, UAW President Douglas Fraser, Bieber, and others were secretly already talking with GM about reopening the contract. The union agreed to enter into talks in January 1982, hoping to win job security commitments for its members in exchange for wage and benefit concessions. The decision was a historic one, as it was only the second time in UAW history that the union had agreed to reopen a contract. It was historic as well as it was the first concessionary contract the union had negotiated.|$|E
2500|$|From behind, the {{vertebral}} column presents in the median line the spinous processes. In the cervical region (with {{the exception of}} the second and seventh vertebrae) these are short, horizontal and bifid. In {{the upper part of the}} thoracic region they are directed obliquely downward; in the middle they are almost vertical, and in the lower part they are nearly horizontal. In the lumbar region they are nearly horizontal. The spinous processes are separated by considerable intervals in the lumbar region, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the thoracic region. Occasionally one of these processes deviates a little from the median line [...] which can sometimes be indicative of a fracture or a displacement of the spine. On either side of the spinous processes is the vertebral groove formed by the laminae in the cervical and lumbar regions, where it is shallow, and by the laminae and transverse processes in the thoracic region, where it is deep and broad; these grooves lodge the deep muscles of the back. Lateral to the spinous processes are the articular processes, and still more laterally the transverse processes. In the thoracic region, the transverse processes stand backward, on a plane considerably behind that of the same processes in the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are placed in front of the articular processes, lateral to the pedicles and between the intervertebral foramina. In the thoracic region they are posterior to the pedicles, intervertebral foramina, and articular processes. In the lumbar region they are in front of the articular processes, <b>but</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> intervertebral foramina.|$|E
