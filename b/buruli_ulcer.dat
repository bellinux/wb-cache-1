25|$|<b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer</b> is {{currently}} endemic in Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. In Ghana, 1999 {{data indicated that}} the prevalence rate of the disease in the Ga West District was 87.7 per 100,000, higher than the estimated national prevalence rate at 20.7 per 100,000 generally, and 150.8 per 100,000 in the most disease-endemic districts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer</b> is an {{infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The {{early stage of}} the infection is characterised by a painless nodule or area of swelling. This nodule can turn into an ulcer. The ulcer may be larger inside than at {{the surface of the}} skin, and can be surrounded by swelling. As the disease worsens, bone can be infected. Buruli ulcers most commonly affect the arms or legs; fever is uncommon.|$|E

25|$|<b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer</b> {{commonly}} affects {{poor people}} in remote rural areas with limited access to health care. The disease can affect all age groups, although {{children under the age}} of 15 years (range 2–14 years) are predominantly affected. There are no sex differences in the distribution of cases among children. Among adults, some studies have reported higher rates among women than males (Debacker et al. accepted for publication). No racial or socio-economic group is exempt from the disease. Most ulcers occur on the extremities; lesions on the lower extremities are almost twice as common as those on the upper extremities. Ulcers on the head and trunk accounted for less than 8% of cases in one large series.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{found in}} {{temperate}} countries like France or tropical ones like Ivory Coast, aquatic bugs exhibit {{the same way}} of life, preying, according to their size, on mollusks, snails, young fish, and the adults and larvae of other insects that they capture with their raptorial front legs and bite with their rostrum. These insects can inflict painful bites on humans as well. In the Ivory Coast, where <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer</b> is endemic, the water bugs are present in swamps and rivers, where human activities such as farming, fishing, and bathing take place. Present findings describing the experimental transmission of M. ulcerans from water bugs to mice are in good agreement {{with the possibility of}} this mode of transmission to humans by bites.|$|E
25|$|Suspicion {{of modern}} {{medicine}} due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic healthcare consequences. HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus disease are two examples of often-lethal infectious disease epidemics whose medical care and containment has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft. Other severe medical conditions whose treatment is hampered in this way include tuberculosis, leprosy, epilepsy and the common severe bacterial <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Public healthcare often requires considerable education work related to epidemology and modern health knowledge {{in many parts of}} the world where belief in witchcraft prevails, to encourage effective preventive health measures and treatments, to reduce victim blaming, shunning and stigmatization, and to prevent the killing of people and endangering of animal species for body parts believed to convey magical abilities.|$|E

25|$|James Augustus Grant, in {{his book}} A Walk across Africa (1864), {{describes}} how his leg became grossly swollen and stiff with later a copious discharge. This was almost certainly the severe edematous form of the disease, and is the first known description of the infection. <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease was identified in 1897 by Sir Albert Cook, a British physician, at Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. A {{detailed description of the}} disease was written in 1948 by Professor Peter MacCallum and his colleagues, who were treating patients from the Bairnsdale district, near Melbourne, Australia. They were the first to identify Mycobacterium ulcerans as the pathogen causing it. The disease was so named after Buruli County in Uganda (now called Nakasongola District), because of the many cases that occurred there in the 1960s. The incidence of the disease has recently been rising in tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The mode of transmission of <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcer</b> is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from surface contamination. The initial trauma can be a mild skin wound such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of bacilli from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou could perhaps have been exposed to a common source of infection, and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E

40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus is an {{opportunistic}} {{commensal bacterium}} that mostly colonizes {{the skin and}} soft tissues. The pathogenicity of S. aureus is due to both its ability to resist antibiotics, {{and the production of}} toxins. Here, we characterize a group of genes responsible for toxin production and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus strains isolated from skin, soft tissue, and bone related infections. Results: A total of 136 S. aureus strains were collected from five different types of infection: furuncles, pyomyositis, abscesses, <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcers,</b> and osteomyelitis, from hospital admissions and out-patients in Benin. All strains were resistant to benzyl penicillin, while 25 % were resistant to methicillin, and all showed sensitivity to vancomycin. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was the most commonly produced virulence factor (70 %), followed by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (44 %). Exfoliative toxin B was produced by 1. 3 % of the strains, and was only found in isolates from <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcers.</b> The tsst- 1, sec, and seh genes were rarely detected (Conclusions: This study provides new insight into the prevalence of toxin and antibiotic resistance genes in S. aureus strains responsible for skin, soft tissue, and bone infections.

40|$|Mycobacterium ulcerans is a slow-growing, {{acid-fast}} bacillus that causes chronic necrotizing skin <b>ulcers</b> known as <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Previously reported information on immunity to this mycobacterium is limited. We examined immune responses to M. ulcerans and M. bovis BCG {{in patients with}} M. ulcerans disease and in 20 healthy control subjects (10 tuberculin test positive and 10 tuberculin test negative). Cell-mediated immunity was assessed by stimulating {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) with whole mycobacteria and then measuring PBMC proliferation and the production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ). Humoral immunity was assessed by immunoblotting. PBMC from all subjects showed significantly greater proliferation and IFN-γ production in response to stimulation with living mycobacteria compared with killed cells. However, PBMC from subjects with past or current M. ulcerans disease showed significantly reduced proliferation and production of IFN-γ in response to stimulation with live M. ulcerans or M. bovis than PBMC from healthy, tuberculin test-positive subjects (P 0. 2). Serum from 9 of 11 patients with M. ulcerans disease, but no control subject, contained antibodies to M. ulcerans. The results indicate that patients with M. ulcerans infection mount an immune response to M. ulcerans as evidenced by antibody production, but they demonstrate profound systemic T-cell anergy to mycobacterial antigens. These findings may explain some of the distinct clinical and pathological features of M. ulcerans-induced disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) advises {{treatment}} of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease, also called "Buruli ulcer" (BU), {{with a combination}} of the antibiotics rifampicin and streptomycin (R+S), whether followed by surgery or not. In endemic areas, a clinical case definition is recommended. We evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy in a series of patients with large ulcers of > or = 10 cm in longest diameter in a rural health zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: A cohort of 92 patients with large ulcerated lesions suspected to be BU was enrolled between October 2006 and September 2007 and treated according to WHO recommendations. The following microbiologic data were obtained: Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained smear, culture and PCR. Histopathology was performed on a sub-sample. Directly observed treatment with R+S was administered daily for 12 weeks and surgery was performed after 4 weeks. Patients were followed up for two years after treatment. FINDINGS: Out of 92 treated patients, 61 tested positive for M. ulcerans by PCR. PCR negative patients had better clinical improvement than PCR positive patients after 4 weeks of antibiotics (54. 8 % versus 14. 8 %). For PCR positive patients, the outcome after 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment was related to the ZN positivity at the start. Deterioration of the ulcers was observed in 87. 8 % (36 / 41) of the ZN positive and in 12. 2 % (5 / 41) of the ZN negative patients. Deterioration due to paradoxical reaction seemed unlikely. After surgery and an additional 8 weeks of antibiotics, 98. 4 % of PCR positive patients and 83. 3 % of PCR negative patients were considered cured. The overall recurrence rate was very low (1. 1 %). INTERPRETATION: Positive predictive value of the WHO clinical case definition was low. Low relapse rate confirms the efficacy of antibiotics. However, the need for and the best time for surgery for large <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcers</b> requires clarification. We recommend confirmation by ZN stain at the rural health centers, since surgical intervention without delay may be necessary on the ZN positive cases to avoid progression of the disease. PCR negative patients were most likely not BU cases. Correct diagnosis and specific management of these non-BU ulcers cases are urgently neede...|$|R
40|$|Skin ulcers are a {{commonly}} encountered problem at departments of tropical dermatology in the Western world. Furthermore, the general dermatologist {{is likely to}} be consulted more often for imported chronic skin ulcers because of the ever-increasing travel to and from tropical countries. The most common cause of chronic ulceration throughout the world is probably pyoderma. However, {{in some parts of the}} world, cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the most prevalent causes. Mycobacterium ulcerans is an important cause of chronic ulcers in West Africa. Bacterial infections include pyoderma, mycobacterial infections, diphtheria, and anthrax. Pyoderma is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta-hemolytic streptococci group A. This condition is a common cause of ulcerative skin lesions in tropical countries and is often encountered as a secondary infection in travelers. The diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds. Antibacterial treatment for pyoderma should preferably be based on culture outcome. Floxacillin is generally active against S. aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci. Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, M. marinum, and M. tuberculosis may cause <b>ulcers.</b> <b>Buruli</b> <b>ulcers,</b> which are caused by M. ulcerans, are endemic in foci in West Africa and have been reported as an imported disease in the Western world. Treatment is generally surgical, although a combination of rifampin (rifampicin) and streptomycin may be effective in the early stage. M. marinum causes occasional ulcerating lesions in humans. Treatment regimens consist of combinations containing clarithromycin, rifampin, or ethambutol. Cutaneous tuberculosis is rare in travelers but may be encountered in immigrants from developing countries. Treatment is with multiple drug regimens consisting of isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. Cutaneous diphtheria is still endemic in many tropical countries. Cutaneous diphtheria ulcers are nonspecific and erythromycin and penicillin are both effective antibacterials. Antitoxin should be administered intramuscularly in suspected cases. Anthrax is caused by spore-forming Bacillus anthracis. This infection is still endemic in many tropical countries. Eschar formation, which sloughs and leaves behind a shallow ulcer at the site of inoculation, characterizes cutaneous anthrax. Penicillin and doxycycline are effective antibacterials. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by different species belonging to the genus Leishmania. The disorder is one of the ten most frequent causes of skin diseases in travelers returning from (sub) tropical countries. The clinical picture is diverse, ranging from a painless papule or nodule to an ulcer with or without a scab. Treatment depends on the clinical manifestations and the species involved. Sporotrichosis, chromo(blasto) mycosis, and mycetoma are the most common mycoses that may be accompanied by ulceration. Infections are restricted to certain regions and often result from direct penetration of the fungus into the skin. Anti-mycotic treatment depends on the microorganism involved. The most common causes of infectious skin ulceration encountered in patients from tropical countries who present at a department of tropical dermatology are reviewed in this articl...|$|R

DESIGN: Observational, non-randomised study with data collected prospectively or through medical record review. PATIENTS AND SETTING: All 40 patients with BU managed by staff of Barwon Health's Geelong Hospital (a public, secondary-level hospital) between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There were 59 treatment episodes; 29 involved surgery alone, 26 surgery plus antibiotics, and four antibiotics alone. Of 55 episodes where surgery was performed, minor surgery was required in 22, and major surgery in 33. Failure rates were 28 % for surgery alone, and 19 % for surgery plus antibiotics. Adjunctive antibiotic therapy was associated with increased treatment success for lesions with positive histological margins (P < 0. 01), and lesions requiring major surgery for treatment of a first episode (P < 0. 01). The combination of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin resulted in treatment success in eight of eight episodes, and no patients ceased therapy because of side effects with this regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive antibiotic therapy may increase the effectiveness of BU surgical treatment, and this should be further assessed by larger randomised controlled trials. The combination of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin appears the most promising...|$|R
