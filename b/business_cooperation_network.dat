Besides, the <b>Business</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Network</b> has appeared as a dynamic configuration of resources and capabilities between firms. It is argued that cooperative relationships and trust are fundamental ways to compete in turbulent environments. The literature of networks, cooperation and innovation is then revisited and, throughout the paper, some practical examples are provided. Finally, {{the limitations of the}} current work are discussed and propositions for future research on the networks, cooperation and innovation are identified...|$|E

It {{is based on the}} case study of a <b>cooperation</b> <b>network,</b> named “House of the Future”, carried out in the framework of a project where the University of Aveiro has an important role. It suggests success factors in the development of co-operation networks between firms from various sectors and a university. The aim of the “House of the Future ” initiative is to promote an innovative approach to inter-organizational cooperation joining together firms from a number of different industrial activities related with the habitat meta-sector. This collaborative effort can function as an experiment for the design of regional innovation policies...|$|R

Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} be developed so the milk production meets the people needs of milk. The causing factors why milk production cannot fulfill demand for milk are small scale ownership of dairy cattle, low milk production ability, unprofitable milk price and high production cost. Dairy cattle business cannot be separated from cooperation existence. To improve the development of dairy cattle production needs the cooperation empowerment to increase business scale, improve milk production ability and reduce production cost. The cooperation empowerment are done by providing female dairy cows, quality feed and concentrate at affordable price, and <b>cooperation</b> <b>business</b> <b>network</b> development...|$|R

Such {{is the case of}} Sinaloa’s municipalities of Esquinapa and El Rosario, specializing in the cultivation and commercialization of mango. However, among the investigated farmers of that localities, still prevail <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> that depend of family and neighborhood relationships, which are of low intensity, limited geographical scope and poorly diversified. Moreover, most of them reach a weak level of insertion into networks, which partly explains their low business competitiveness.

Interference of economic crises, natural disasters and other emergencies may cause the node fails in social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks.</b> To further study the influences of node failure on the total fitness degree and the cooperative ratio in social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> the update rules of individual strategy and networks self-repair are constructed {{on the basis of the}} social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> and evolutionary game theory. For different types of social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> the dynamic evolution in the <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> with node failure is respectively analyzed by the agent-based simulation experiments. Simulation results show that the node failure not only reduces the total fitness degree of various social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> but also reduces the cooperative ratio in two-group and multi-group <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks.</b> However, in the single-group <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> the cooperative ratio is improved by node failure. In addition, by introducing the self-repair rules, the emergence of a few of new cooperative nodes can break the stable state and promote the total fitness degree and the cooperative ratio of <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe <b>business</b> <b>networks,</b> {{including}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> are a {{topic of}} current interest, since they indicate some development solutions for organizations founded in collective action that traditional models of isolated competition cannot encompass. However, these models of competition are dominant among researchers and entrepreneurs, so there is little knowledge and interest about the formation, development and management of business networks in Brazil. The network studies follow three basic paradigms: one about economic factors, another about social factors and the third about a new organization. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present and analyze examples for the third paradigm, whose main argument is that all organizations are in nets, using or not their connections. The oriented proposition is that it is possible to find and to design the networks from the structuring factors of a net and initiating the investigation with any company of the selected business. Through the use of secondary and primary collection data techniques, four housing cooperative nets of the State of São Paulo were analyzed. The results show that it is possible to find and design the relation networks of cooperatives from the interdependence, asymmetry, structure, governance, forms and flux and result dominants factors on one side, and, on the other, as a secondary contribution, to point some management directives for these nets. Modestly, the work indicates a promising research field, using a group of factors that can be enhanced and used in a research instrument...|$|R
40|$|The Medieval Islamic Mediterranean {{trade was}} based mainly on {{two types of}} <b>business</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The first one was formal partnership, and the second {{informal}} <b>business</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Formal Partnership refers to institutions whose structures and rules are defined more or less precisely by law or custom with clearly defined limits, expectations, prescribed ways and procedures of achieving goals, asserting rights, or redressing grievances. On the other hand informal <b>business</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{is a set of}} informally defined institutions that do not possess the properties just mentioned above. They are unstructured, seemingly formless, very flexible, and above all very personal in nature.

The {{results show that the}} nodes failure not only reduces the total fitness degree, but also reduces the cooperative ratio in the <b>cooperation</b> <b>network.</b> However, by introducing the self-repair rules, the emergence of a few new cooperative nodes can soon make up the loss and improve the total fitness degree and cooperative ratio gradually. The further analysis show that, the number of new nodes which to make the fitness degree return to the previous level are less than 20 % of the failure nodes...|$|R
