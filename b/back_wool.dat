50|$|Textiles {{and other}} factory {{products}} {{were the main}} exports to Tibet while they brought <b>back</b> <b>wool,</b> musk pods, hides and yak tails. This traditional business {{came to an end}} in the mid-1960s after the route through Sikkim was shut down following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and all the Tuladhar traders returned home. In the course of conducting trade, they have been a cultural bridge between South and Central Asia. Today, while they are still primarily merchants, many pursue varied professions.|$|E
50|$|Michelle Grattan has co-authored several books, {{including}} Can Ministers Cope?, <b>Back</b> on the <b>Wool</b> Track and Reformers, and has edited collections such as Australian Prime Ministers and Reconciliation.|$|R
50|$|Settlers began {{arriving}} {{in the area in}} 1928 shortly after the area was surveyed and land was released. The town struggled through the depression but thrived in the postwar years on the <b>back</b> of high <b>wool</b> and wheat prices.|$|R
25|$|Newar traders {{exported}} {{finished products}} from Nepal and India to Tibet {{and brought back}} goods from Tibet {{and other parts of}} Central Asia. Metal utensils, sacred statues and rice from Nepal, and textiles and other factory products from India were the main exports to Tibet. The Lhasa Newars brought <b>back</b> gold dust, <b>wool,</b> musk pods, pelts and yak tails which were forwarded to Kolkata.|$|R
50|$|The Merchant's House {{was built}} by Edward Strode (ca. 1629—1703) a wealthy {{landowner}} to be tenented. (Edward was a son of Colonel William Strode, a Parliamentarian officer and Member of Parliament.) Shepton Mallet was then a wealthy town on the <b>back</b> of the <b>wool</b> trade so the south range {{of the house was}} almost certainly built for a wool merchant. The north was two tenements with two shop units.|$|R
6000|$|... "All you lambs get in line. You're {{going to}} get your <b>wool</b> <b>back.</b> Don't shove so. Get in a line--a line--not in a pile. Lady, will you please stop bleating? Your money's waiting for you. Here, sonny, don't climb over that railing; your dimes are safe. Don't cry, sis; you ain't out a cent. Get in line, I say. Here, Pick, come and {{straighten}} 'em out and let 'em through and out by the other door." ...|$|R
50|$|The Luftwaffe style black Panzer {{jacket was}} {{identical}} in style {{to that of}} the Army and was drawn from Army stocks. It was manufactured with black wool and was double-breasted, short waisted and with a large collar with pointed lapels. The wrap of the double-breasted front was nearly all the way across and then angled back down to the waist. The insignia consisted of the Luftwaffe national emblem, first on the blue-gray <b>wool</b> <b>backing</b> and later in a matching black backing. These were machine-woven or embroidered in white thread.|$|R
50|$|This {{project was}} in {{reaction}} to research into man-made constructions that are conquered by nature and destroyed by humans; it’s based {{on the effects of}} natural disasters on built structures. The series is a reversal of what qualities are normally associated with certain man-made and natural materials. The concrete is cast onto a <b>wool</b> <b>backing</b> and subsequently broken up. This design process harnesses the effects of deterioration and the wool holds the concrete together. The resulting series is a range of unique pieces based on a single mold.|$|R
5000|$|... {{unless the}} lanolin {{is to be}} left in the cloth as a water repellent. When washing a skein it works well to let the wool soak in soapy water overnight, and rinse the soap out in the morning. Dishwashing {{detergents}} are commonly used, and a special laundry detergent designed for washing wool is not required. The dishwashing detergent works and does not harm the wool. After washing, let the wool dry (air drying works best). Once it is dry, or just a bit damp, one can stretch it out a bit on a niddy-noddy. Putting the <b>wool</b> <b>back</b> on the niddy-noddy makes for a nicer looking finished skein. Before taking a skein and washing it, the skein must be tied up loosely in about six places. If the skein is not tied up, it will be very hard to unravel when done washing.|$|R
50|$|Bromley {{had reached}} {{the peak of his}} power and {{influence}} and reaped both prestige and wealth, not all of it from judicial sources. In 1580 he was licensed to import 200 packs of wool annually from Ireland, an opportunity that reinforced his natural inclination to side with the Shropshire towns against the monopolistic claims of Chester. The following year, Drake made him a present of captured Spanish gold plate on his return from circumnavigating the earth. In 1582 he was able to use his influence with the queen to thwart attempts to shift production of cloth from Welsh <b>wool</b> <b>back</b> into Wales and to move the staple to Chester, winning the approbation of the merchants and municipalities of Shrewsbury and Oswestry, who had most to lose from the proposed changes. Shrewsbury's council voted 20 marks for a piece of plate in gratitude for his political support. In 1585 he obtained the right to grant licences for alnage, or supervision of the quality of woollen cloth - a position of mutual advantage for himself and his regional allies.|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} this story is that Dragobete marries a girl against Baba Dochia's will. Angry with her son's decision, she sends her {{daughter}} in law to wash some black wool in the river and tells her not to come <b>back</b> until the <b>wool</b> has turned white. The girl tries to wash it, but the wool would not change color. In despair and with her hands frozen from the cold water of the river, the girl starts crying, thinking {{that she would never}} be able to see her loved husband again. Then Jesus sees her from the sky and feels sorry for her, so he gives her a red flower telling her to wash the wool with that. As soon as she washes the wool as told by Jesus, it turns white so the girl happily returns home. When Baba Dochia hears about her story, she gets angry and thinks spring has come, since the man (who the girls had not recognized as being Jesus) was able to offer her a flower. She leaves for the mountains dressed in nine coats. As the weather changes fast on the mountain, she starts throwing away her coats, one by one, until she is left with no coats. But as soon as she drops her last coat, the weather changes again and Baba Dochia is frozen on the mountain.|$|R
6000|$|One {{of these}} gypsy paths {{comes from the}} place where the sheep get their hair cut. When David shed his curls at the hair-dresser's, I am told, he said good-bye to them without a tremor, though Mary has never been quite the same bright {{creature}} since, so he despises the sheep as they run from their shearer and calls out tauntingly, [...] "Cowardy, cowardy custard!" [...] But when the man grips them between his legs David shakes a fist at him for using such big scissors. Another startling moment is when the man turns <b>back</b> the grimy <b>wool</b> from the sheeps' shoulders and they look suddenly like ladies in the stalls of a theatre. The sheep are so frightened by the shearing that it makes them quite white and thin, and as soon as they are set free they begin to nibble the grass at once, quite anxiously, as if they feared that they would never be worth eating. David wonders whether they know each other, now that they are so different, and if it makes them fight with the wrong ones. They are great fighters, and thus so unlike country sheep that every year they give Porthos a shock. He can make a field of country sheep fly by merely announcing his approach, but these town sheep come toward him with no promise of gentle entertainment, and then a light from last year breaks upon Porthos. He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me {{from the corner of his}} eye.|$|R
60|$|The abbot and the friars {{came to him}} in the morning, and bade him {{get ready}} to be crucified, and led him out of the guest-house. And while he still stood upon the step a flock of great grass-barnacles passed high above him with clanking cries. He lifted his arms to them and said, 'O great grass-barnacles, tarry a little, and mayhap my soul will travel with you to the waste places of the shore and to the ungovernable sea!' At the gate a crowd of beggars {{gathered}} about them, being come there to beg from any traveller or pilgrim who might have spent the night in the guest-house. The abbot and the friars led the gleeman to a place in the woods at some distance, where many straight young trees were growing, and they made him cut one down and fashion it to the right length, while the beggars stood round them in a ring, talking and gesticulating. The abbot then bade him cut off another and shorter piece of wood, and nail it upon the first. So there was his cross for him; and they put it upon his shoulder, for his crucifixion was to be {{on the top of the}} hill where the others were. A half-mile on the way he asked them to stop and see him juggle for them; for he knew, he said, all the tricks of Aengus the Subtle- hearted. The old friars were for pressing on, but the young friars would see him: so he did many wonders for them, even to the drawing of live frogs out of his ears. But after a while they turned on him, and said his tricks were dull and a shade unholy, and set the cross on his shoulders again. Another half-mile on the way, and he asked them to stop and hear him jest for them, for he knew, he said, all the jests of Conan the Bald, upon whose <b>back</b> a sheep's <b>wool</b> grew. And the young friars, when they had heard his merry tales, again bade him take up his cross, for it ill became them to listen to such follies. Another half-mile on the way, he asked them to stop and hear him sing the story of White-breasted Deirdre, and how she endured many sorrows, and how the sons of Usna died to serve her. And the young friars were mad to hear him, but when he had ended they grew angry, and beat him for waking forgotten longings in their hearts. So they set the cross upon his back and hurried him to the hill.|$|R
