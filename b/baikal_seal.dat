5|$|As a whole, {{pinnipeds}} can {{be found}} in a variety of aquatic habitats, including coastal water, open ocean, brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands. The <b>Baikal</b> <b>seal</b> is the only freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the Baltic sea. In addition, harbor seals may visit estuaries, lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long as a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul-out on to both fast ice and drift ice.|$|E
5|$|Phocids {{are known}} to have existed for at least 15 million years, and {{molecular}} evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages 22mya. The fossil monachine Monotherium and phocine Leptophoca were found in southeastern North America. The deep split between the lineages of Erignathus and Cystophora 17mya suggests that the phocines migrated eastward and northward from the North Atlantic. The genera Phoca and Pusa could have arisen when a phocine lineage traveled from the Paratethys Sea to the Arctic Basin and subsequently went eastward. The ancestor of the <b>Baikal</b> <b>seal</b> migrated into Lake Baikal from the Arctic (via the Siberian ice sheet) and became isolated there. The Caspian seal's ancestor became isolated as the Paratethys shrank, leaving the animal in a small remnant sea, the Caspian Sea. The monochines diversified southward. Monachus emerged in the Mediterranean and migrated to the Caribbean and then the central North Pacific. The two extant elephant seal species diverged close to 4mya after the Panamanian isthmus was formed. The lobodontine lineage emerged around 9mya and colonized the southern ocean in response to glaciation.|$|E
50|$|The {{areas of}} the lake in which the <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> reside change {{depending}} on the season, {{as well as other}} environmental factors. They are solitary animals {{for the majority of the}} year, sometimes living kilometers away from other <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals.</b> In general, a higher concentration of <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> is found in the northern parts of the lake, because the longer winter keeps the ice frozen longer, which is preferable for pupping. However, in recent years, migrations to the southern half of the lake have occurred, possibly to evade hunters. In winter, when the lake is frozen over, seals maintain a few breathing holes over a given area and tend to remain nearby, not interfering with the food supplies of nearby seals. When the ice begins to melt, <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> tend to keep to the shoreline.|$|R

Concentrations of OH–PCBs were in the range of 0. 71 – 4. 6 ng/g wet wt. and the levels were one to two orders of magnitude lower than PCBs (6. 4 – 130 ng/g wet wt.). Concentrations of high-chlorinated OH–PCBs (OH–H 6 to O 8 CBs) were 80 % of total OH–PCBs, suggesting risk by high-chlorinated OH–PCBs in <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals.</b> When OH–PCB/PCB homologue ratios were calculated, OH– O 8 CB/O 8 CB ratios were higher than the values of T 4 - and H 7 -chlorinated homologues, suggesting preferential accumulation of OH–O 8 CBs in the blood of <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals.</b> When concentration ratios of OH–PCB to PCB (OH–PCB/PCB ratios) were examined, relatively low values in <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> (OH–PCB/PCB ratios = 0. 047) were observed when compared with other species, suggesting poor metabolic capacity for PCBs in <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals.</b> OH–PCB/PCB ratios of terrestrial mammals were the highest, followed by avian species, pinnipe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) {{including}} polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) were determined in <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> (Pusa sibirica) collected from Lake Baikal {{to reveal their}} contamination status, accumulation features and temporal trends. Organohalogen compounds analyzed were detected in all the blubber samples of <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals.</b> DDTs were the most abundant contaminants followed by PCBs, CHLs, HCHs, PBDEs, HBCDs, and HCB. BFR levels found in <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> were lower than those in other marine mammals from European or American coastal waters, implying that seals in this region were less exposed to BFRs.

Concentrations of PBDEs and HBCDs in the blubber of <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> collected in 2005 were significantly higher in males than in females. This gender dependent difference could be due to transfer of these contaminants from mother to pup during gestation and lactation. In addition, temporal trends of organohalogen contamination in <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> were investigated using the blubber of male juvenile seals collected in 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2005.

500|$|Pinnipeds {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] <b>Baikal</b> <b>seal</b> to the [...] and [...] {{southern}} elephant seal. Overall, they tend to be larger than other carnivorans; the southern elephant seal is the largest carnivoran. Several species have male-biased sexual dimorphism that correlates with the degree of polygyny in a species: highly polygynous species like elephant seals are extremely sexually dimorphic, while less polygynous species have males and females that are closer in size. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly larger than males. Males of sexually dimorphic species also tend to have secondary sex characteristics, such as the prominent proboscis of elephant seals, the inflatable red nasal membrane of hooded seals and the thick necks and manes of otariids. Despite a correlation between size dimorphism and the degree of polygyny, some evidence suggests that size differences between the sexes originated due to ecological differences and prior to the development of polygyny.|$|E
500|$|Seals {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] <b>Baikal</b> <b>seal</b> to the [...] and [...] {{southern}} elephant seal, which is also the largest carnivoran. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their whiskers or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dioxins {{and related}} {{compounds}} (DRCs) including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls are highly accumulated {{in the liver}} of <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> (Pusa sibirica). The hepatic DRC levels were positively correlated with expression levels of CYP 1 A 1, 1 A 2 and 1 B 1 in the wild population, indicating chronic induction of these CYP isozymes by DRCs. To screen DRC-responsive genes other than CYP 1 isozymes, we constructed an oligo array of targeting genes expressed in the liver of wild <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals,</b> and examined {{the relationships between the}} hepatic DRC levels and gene expression levels. The result indicated that dioxins may affect the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative stress, Fe ion homeostasis and immune response in the liver of <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals.</b> The mRNA expression levels of CYP 1 isozymes were positively correlated with genes related to oxidative stress (thioredoxin and selenoprotein P precursor) and Fe ion homeostasis (ferritin and hepcidin). In addition, CYP 1 A 2 mRNA expression levels positively correlated with the levels of malondialdehyde, a biomarker of oxidative stress. From these results, we propose that <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> may suffer from effects initiated by dioxin-induced CYP 1 isozymes, including production of reactive oxygen species, release of free Fe ion from heme degradation and induction of inflammatory response...|$|R
50|$|Female <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3-6 years of age, whereas males achieve it around 4-7 years. The {{males and females}} are not strongly sexually dimorphic; this fact, compounded by their poor vision and the further optical distortions produced by cold water, occasionally leads males to mistakenly attempt to copulate with other males, a behavior formerly erroneously interpreted by ethologists as homosexual. <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> mate in the water {{towards the end of}} the pupping season. With a combination of delayed implantation and a nine-month gestation period, the Baikal seals' overall pregnancy is around 11 months. Pregnant females are the only <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> to haul out during the winter. The males tend to stay in the water, under the ice, all winter. Females usually give birth to one pup, but they are one of only two species of true seals with the ability to give birth to twins. Very rarely, triplets or quadruplets have been recorded. The twins often stick together for some time after being weaned. The females, after giving birth to their pups on the ice in late winter, become immediately impregnated again, and often are lactating while pregnant.|$|R

50|$|In {{the last}} century, the kill quota for hunting <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> was raised several times, most notably after the fur {{industry}} boomed {{in the late}} 1970s and when official counts began indicating more <b>Baikal</b> <b>seals</b> were present than previously known. The quota in 1999, 6,000, was lowered in 2000 to 3,500, which was still nearly 5% of the population if the Greenpeace count is correct. In 2013-2014, the hunting quota was set at 2,500. In addition, new techniques, such as netting breathing holes and seal dens to catch pups, have been introduced. In 2001, a prime seal pelt would bring 1,000 rubles at market. In 2004-2006, about 2,000 seals were killed per year according to official Russian statistics, {{but in the same}} period another 1,500-4,000 are thought to have died annually due to drowning in fishing gear, poaching, and the like.

The chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the Baikal seal's immune system, making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague, which was the cause of a serious <b>Baikal</b> <b>seal</b> epidemic that resulted in the deaths of thousands of animals in 1997 and 1999. <b>Baikal</b> <b>seal</b> pups have higher levels of DDT and PCB than known in any other population of European or Arctic earless seal.|$|E
