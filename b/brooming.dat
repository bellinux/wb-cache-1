5000|$|Good {{cultural}} practices to prevent pine-pine gall rust include removal of dense patches of grasses, weeds, and brush near susceptible trees, {{as they may}} prevent good spray coverage of the lower whorl (spiraling pattern) of branches. Severely infected trees should be rogued and burned to prevent further spread of inoculum. It {{is often difficult to}} detect infection in trees before symptoms such as stunting, chlorosis, and witches <b>brooming</b> are evident. Until all diseased trees in the area are diagnosed and destroyed it is suggested that a protectant fungicide be applied to all susceptible trees in the stand. Using a registered systemic fungicide such as Bayleton (50% Dry Flowable Fungicide, EPA Reg. No. 2135-320 [...] ) registered in California can help control western gall rust, although it is not used on seeds or seedlings and may kill mycorrhizal fungi if advised application concentration is exceeded.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of pine-pine gall rust can {{be quite}} {{conspicuous}} and are useful for diagnostic identification. The most prominent symptoms are hip cankers and swollen, spherical to oblong growths (galls) on the branches, stems, or main trunk of the host. The galls on small twigs of 1-2 years of age are often pear-shaped. Gall formation results from the overproduction of xylem tissue stimulated by the fungus. Witches <b>brooming</b> occasionally occurs along with galling. The bark on large galls will slough off over time, exposing the smooth wood beneath. Signs of pine-pine gall rust include the pale yellow aecia (1-8mm in diameter) formed on galls in spring {{as well as the}} yellow-orange aeciospores contained within. Immature galls are spindle-shaped. Infections usually occur on more succulent (thick) branches. When mature, galls can grow as large as a softball (30.5 cm circumference), but most are the size of a golf ball (4.2 cm). Before the production of spores, the needles on highly infected branches become chlorotic or red, eventually turning brown when the branch dies. Western gall rust can cause dwarfing to occur if leader stem of younger pines are infected. Early identification of the disease is important for treatment, but is often hard to diagnose due to the inconspicuous initial symptoms and a lack of galls until the second year. A red pigmentation may develop on the epidermal galls of P. contorta seedlings 14-28 days after infection, but this is not always a reliable indicator.|$|E

In the transverse direction, the composite showed increasing flow stress (at 5 % strain) and maximum stress within the studied strain rates, 10 − 3 − 3 × 103 s− 1. In the longitudinal direction, the maximum stress of the composite increased similarly with increasing strain rates within the range 10 − 5 − 7 × 102 s− 1.

Also, two sections were planed to a uniform cross-section, two pavement thicknesses were placed, and two different concrete mix proportions were used. Bond strength was perceived to be the key to determining an appropriate design procedure for whitetopping. If adequate bond is achieved, a bonded PCC overlay technique can be used for design. Otherwise, an unbonded overlay procedure may be more appropriate. Conclusions are as follows: (1) Bond Strength Differences - Milling increased bond strength versus no milling. Tack coat showed increased bond strength versus no tack coat. Planing, Air Blast and Grouting did not provide noticeable improvements in bond strength; nor did different PCC types or thicknesses affect bond strength significantly. (2) Structure - Structural measurements correlated strongly with the wide variation in pavement thicknesses. They did not provide enough information to determine the strength of bonding or the level of support being provided by the ACC layer. Longitudinal cracking correlated with PCC thicknesses and with planing. (3) Bond Over Time - The bond between PCC and ACC layers is degrading over time in the outside wheel path in all of the sections except tack coat (section 12). The bond strength in the section with tack coat was lower than the others, but remained relatively steady...|$|E

40|$|For many {{composite}} laminated structures, {{the design}} is driven by data obtained from Compression after Impact (CAI) testing. There currently is no standard for CAI testing of sandwich structures although there is one for solid laminates of a certain thickness and lay-up configuration. Most sandwich CAI testing has followed the basic technique of this standard where the loaded ends are precision machined and placed between two platens and compressed until failure. If little or no damage is present during the compression tests, the loaded ends {{may need to be}} potted to prevent end <b>brooming.</b> By putting a sandwich beam in a four point bend configuration, the region between the inner supports is put under a compressive load and a sandwich laminate with damage can be tested in this manner without the need for precision machining.

Data is presented that demonstrates the four point bend CAI test and is compared with end loaded compression tests of the same sandwich structure...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.)

The tests were performed at frequency of 5 Hz, R = 10 at different stress levels and the results plotted on S-N plot clearly show a reduction in fatigue life with the run-out cycle for specimen with sensor tube reduced to almost 70 % of the static compression strength compared to 80 % for the specimens without sensor tube.
