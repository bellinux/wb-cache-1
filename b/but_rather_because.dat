5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> {{they did not believe}} they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E
5000|$|Geographic {{mechanisms}} {{refer to}} aspects of spaces {{that may affect}} residents’ life courses yet do not arise within the neighborhood <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> purely <b>because</b> of the neighborhood’s location relative to larger-scale political and economic forces such as: ...|$|R
5|$|This {{class of}} {{objections}} is more radical than the above, claiming {{that a major}} aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> impossible, <b>because</b> it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained {{in such a way}} that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.|$|R
50|$|Peel, {{also known}} as rind or skin, is the outer {{protective}} layer of a fruit or vegetable which can be peeled off. The rind is usually the botanical exocarp, but the term exocarp also includes the hard cases of nuts, which are not named peels since they are not peeled off by hand or peeler, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> shells <b>because</b> of their hardness.|$|R
5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, his {{condemnation}} of the Mexican–American War did not stem from pacifism, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> he considered Mexico “unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army” {{as a means to}} expand the slave territory.|$|E
25|$|In the Lazair {{application}} the 185 {{was used}} to drive two propellers stacked together in biplane configuration. This was not done for aerodynamic reasons <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> the Lazair manufacturer had ample quantities of the nylon propellers on hand for its earlier engines and stacking them was more cost efficient than scrapping them and buying new propellers.|$|E
50|$|In {{contexts}} {{where one}} is confined, spatially or otherwise, boredom may {{be met with}} various religious activities, not because religion would want to associate itself with tedium, <b>but</b> <b>rather,</b> partly <b>because</b> boredom may be taken as the essential human condition, to which God, wisdom, or morality are the ultimate answers. It is taken in this sense by virtually all existentialist philosophers {{as well as by}} Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|R
5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, <b>but</b> is <b>rather</b> expensive <b>because</b> of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure.

60|$|He did {{not care}} about his little sons, and left them to the nurses and then the tutors, as they grew up from babies to pretty boys, so sweet and wise and good that people said the spirit of their dead mother must watch over them; and perhaps it did. They were always together, always busy, always kind and gentle, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> sad, <b>because</b> their father did not love them; and all the affection of the many friends they made could not {{make up for the}} loss of father and mother love.|$|R
25|$|He {{was soon}} proclaimed Romania's {{national}} poet, {{not because he}} wrote {{in an age of}} national revival, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> he was received as an author of paramount significance by Romanians in all provinces. Even today, he is considered the national poet of Romania, Moldova, and of the Romanians who live in the Ukrainian occupied part of Bucovina.|$|E
25|$|An early {{example of}} haibutsu kishaku is the Mononobe clan's anti-Buddhist {{policies}} {{during the time}} of Buddhism's early introduction to Japan in the Kofun period. The Mononobe were opposed to the spread of Buddhism not on religious grounds, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> of nationalism and xenophobia. The Nakatomi clan, ancestors of the Fujiwara, were allies of the Mononobe in their opposition to Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Making the {{abortion}} particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, {{not because of}} her jeopardized health, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> {{she did not want}} to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having {{the abortion}}, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case.|$|E
60|$|William of Normandy, on the contrary, was {{absolutely}} merciless in warfare. He was not cruel {{for the sake}} of cruelty, but where he deemed that the policy demanded it, he was ruthless, and spared neither age nor sex.

50|$|The Stokes vector {{spans the}} space of unpolarized, {{partially}} polarized, and fully polarized light. For comparison, the Jones vector only spans {{the space of}} fully polarized light, but is more useful for problems involving coherent light. The four Stokes parameters are not a preferred coordinate system of the space, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> were chosen <b>because</b> they can be easily measured or calculated.|$|R

25|$|The {{subclass}} Apterygota (wingless insects) is {{now considered}} artificial as the silverfish (order Thysanura) are {{more closely related to}} Pterygota (winged insects) than to bristletails (order Archaeognatha). For instance, just like flying insects, Thysanura have so-called dicondylic mandibles, while Archaeognatha have monocondylic mandibles. The reason for their resemblance is not due to a particularly close relationship, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> they both have kept a primitive and original anatomy in a much higher degree than the winged insects. The most primitive order of flying insects, the mayflies (Ephemeroptera), are also those who are most morphologically and physiologically similar to these wingless insects. Some mayfly nymphs resemble aquatic thysanurans.|$|E
25|$|Neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine {{held that}} the hatred for the West and United States in {{particular}} does not exist because of actions perpetrated by the United States, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of United States are using terrorism as a war of ideology against the United States. The responsibility of the United States is to protect itself and its friends by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbinic Talmud compares Ezekiel and Isaiah's {{visions of}} God's Chariot-Throne, noticing that Ezekiel gives a lengthy account of details, while Isaiah is very brief. It gives an exoteric {{explanation}} for this; Isaiah prophesised {{in the era}} of Solomon's Temple, Ezekiel's vision took place in the exile of Babylonian captivity. Rava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God, this is not because he had seen more than Isaiah, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar. Ezekiel, like all prophets except Moses, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.|$|E

One night she creates a fire to get help, but is the robbers stop her in time. One evening, while tracking DC, Zeke and the neighbours hear a gunshot. Patti confronts Greg, who she suspects trying to kill DC, but he explains that he was not trying to shoot DC, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> fired <b>because</b> he saw a man on his property.|$|R

25|$|At {{one time}} {{it was said that}} {{appearing}} as a Bond girl would damage an actress's career. Lois Chiles is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of Holly Goodhead, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because,</b> after she lost her younger brother to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in Casino Royale (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers. At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green agreed {{to play the role of}} Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won BAFTA's Rising Star Award for her performance. Rosamund Pike, who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in Die Another Day (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for Gone Girl.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the quake, the Metro stopped {{service and}} {{completely}} shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people {{to get out of the}} tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to get where they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Taxqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.|$|E
25|$|The Tribune {{confirmed}} that {{the judge in the}} Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> Malone did not respond to the suit. However, the paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One of the items listed was a laboratory blood test which concluded with over 99 percent certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying that same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone. According to the Tribune, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case regarding the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.|$|E

50|$|In February 2012, two NGOs, Navdanya and No Patent on Seeds, filed {{documents}} opposing an EU patent {{awarded to}} Monsanto covering virus resistant traits of melons. They {{were joined by}} Bayer Cropscience. Monsanto had acquired DeRuiter, a seed company, in 2008, which originally filed the patent application. The activists' claim {{it was not an}} invention of Monsanto <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> bio-piracy, <b>because</b> the virus-resistant plants originated in India and were registered in international seed banks; they further claimed that conventional breeding methods were used to transfer the virus resistance genes from an Indian melon to other melons and that European law prohibits patents on conventional breeding. The European Patent Office created a page on its website to explain the case.|$|R
50|$|Capturing {{elephants}} {{from the}} wild remained a difficult task, but a necessary one given the difficulties of breeding in captivity and the long time required for an elephant to reach sufficient maturity to engage in battle. It is commonly thought that all war elephants were male because of males' greater aggression, <b>but</b> it is <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> a female elephant in battle will run from a male; therefore only males {{could be used in}} war, whereas female elephants were more commonly used for logistics.|$|R
25|$|Data {{should not}} be removed {{on the basis of}} misfitting the model, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> a {{construct}} relevant reason for the misfit has been diagnosed, such as a non-native speaker of English taking a science test written in English. Such a candidate can be argued to not belong to the same population of persons depending on the dimensionality of the test, and, although one parameter IRT measures are argued to be sample-independent, they are not population independent, so misfit such as this is construct relevant and does not invalidate the test or the model. Such an approach is an essential tool in instrument validation. In two and three-parameter models, where the psychometric model is adjusted to fit the data, future administrations of the test must be checked for fit to the same model used in the initial validation in order to confirm the hypothesis that scores from each administration generalize to other administrations. If a different model is specified for each administration in order to achieve data-model fit, then a different latent trait is being measured and test scores cannot be argued to be comparable between administrations.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{the most}} {{significant}} flaw in the constitution left by Augustus concerned the matter of succession. This deadly flaw was violently exposed in the year 69. Augustus had established a standing army, where individual soldiers served under the same military governors in the same provinces {{over an extended period}} of time. The consequence was that the soldiers in the provinces developed a degree of loyalty to their commanders, which they did not have for the emperor. Thus the empire was, in a sense, a union of inchoate principalities, which could have disintegrated at any time. The first indication of a nationalist movement appeared in Gaul (modern France) in 68, but this movement ended when its leader, C. Julius Vindex, was defeated by an army under L. Verginius Rufus. Rufus was the governor of Upper Germany, and while he was declared imperator by his soldiers, he decided not to use his support to march on Rome and make himself emperor. He did not decline this opportunity because he was loyal to the emperor Nero, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>because</b> of his own low birth, and his belief that his low birth might make it difficult for him to accomplish anything as emperor. Shortly after Rufus had been declared imperator, Ser. Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was proclaimed emperor by his troops. In Rome, the emperor Nero quickly lost his supporters and committed suicide. Galba, however, did not prove to be a wise leader. He chose to punish Rufus' troops, and to antagonize the Praetorian Guard by not fulfilling promises which had been made to them.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, courts weary {{from years}} of arguing about the scope of {{patentable}} subject matter for software patents seem ready to throw in the towel. Rather than continue efforts to craft a test for determining when a software invention graduates from an “abstract idea” or mere algorithm into a patentable invention, several recent Federal Circuit opinions dismissinely reject section 101 challenges as attacks that should have be made instead under sections 102, 103, and 112. This short essay criticizes this recent trend in patentable subject matter jurisprudence. Accused infringers look to section 101 for relief not because doing so is a convenient shortcut around more traditional checks on patentability, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> precisely <b>because</b> traditional checks on patentability {{have proven to be}} woefully ineffective weapons against overbroad software patents...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss Künne’s Modest Theory of truth, {{and develop a}} {{variation}} on a worry that Field expresses with respect to Horwich’s related view. The worry is not that deflationary accounts are false, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> that, <b>because</b> they take propositions as truth-bearers, they are not philosophically interesting. Compatibly with the intuitions of ordinary speakers, we can understand proposition so that the proposals do account for a property that such truth-bearers have. Nevertheless, we saliently apply the truth-concept also to entities such as utterances or assertions, and the deflationary accounts do not provide a similarly deflationary account for those applications. In fact, {{there are good reasons}} to suspect that no such account would be forthcoming; we need something more substantive or inflationary there. 1...|$|R
