2500|$|Huichol art broadly groups {{the most}} {{traditional}} and most recent innovations in the folk art and handcrafts {{produced by the}} Huichol people, {{who live in the}} states of Jalisco, Durango, Zacatecas and Nayarit in Mexico. [...] The unifying factor of the work is the colorful decoration using symbols and designs which date back centuries. The most common and commercially successful products are “yarn paintings” and objects decorated with small commercially produced <b>beads.</b> <b>Yarn</b> paintings consist of commercial yarn pressed into boards coated with wax and resin and are derived from a ceremonial tablet called a neirika. The Huichol {{have a long history of}} beading, making the beads from clay, shells, corals, seeds and more and using them to make jewelry and to decorate bowls and other items. The “modern” beadwork usually consists of masks and wood sculptures covered in small, brightly colored commercial beads fastened with wax and resin.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} costume for khaleegy {{is composed}} of 2 pieces or dresses. The bottom or shift dress is molded to the figure and is made of a sturdier fabric than the top dress. It is usually not adorned or embroidered and when it is, the ornaments are very simple. The colors often contrast with the ones of the top dress to create nice color combinations. The top dress is a long, wide, rectangular tunic-like dress called a thobe. It is traditionally made of sheer silk to create a translucent effect and let {{a hint of the}} shift dress be seen, it is heavily embroidered from the center and the extreme wide shoulder parts with <b>beads,</b> <b>yarn</b> embroidery or anything shiny. The neckline is also beautifully ornamented. The Thobe can be any color, but very bright solid tones are the most used. Additional accessories for the costume include necklaces, bracelets, big shiny earrings and the most important one: the woman´s long and well cared hair. It is danced barefoot.|$|R
50|$|The classic {{approach}} is to thread <b>beads</b> on the <b>yarn</b> in advance. There {{are several ways to}} go about knitting the beads in though: slipping the stitch, putting the bead between stitches, and putting the bead on the stitch.|$|R
50|$|Putting {{the bead}} {{between the two}} {{stitches}} is done by positioning the <b>bead</b> on the <b>yarn</b> connecting two stitches, i.e., between two bights. This results in the bead being visible {{from both sides of}} the work when beads are slipped on both sides. The bead has a tendency to not lie straight when placed with this method. The axis of the bead is horizontal with respect to the work. This is the method shown in the picture.|$|R
5000|$|Kruger's {{earliest}} works {{date back}} to 1969. These works were large wall hangings made out of different materials such as <b>yarn,</b> <b>beads,</b> sequins, feathers and ribbons. These pieces were large wall hangings, and represented the feminist recuperation of craft during this period. Kruger crocheted, sewed and painted bright-hued and erotically suggestive objects, {{some of which were}} included by curator Marcia Tucker in the 1973 Whitney Biennial. They were inspired by Magdalena Abakanowicz’s show at the Museum of Modern Art. Although some of these works were included in the Whitney Biennial, Kruger became detached and unsatisfied with her working output. In 1976 she took a break from making what had become more abstract works, feeling that the work had become meaningless and mindless. She then moved to Berkeley, California where she taught at the University of California and became inspired by the writings of Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes. In 1977 she returned to artmaking, working with her own architectural photographs and publishing an artist's book, Picture/Readings, in 1979. She was inspired to photograph architecture from her family [...] "looking at family homes they could never afford." ...|$|R
40|$|Dealing {{with various}} weather {{conditions}} {{is a serious}} matter in Alaska. Coastal Native Alaskans have been surviving in severe environments for millennia. Between {{the heat of the}} summer and the freezing cold of the winter is that transitional season when it rains. Raincoats were fashioned out of bird skins and fish skins but it is the gut skin parka that became the universally adopted garment along the coast of Alaska. Differing preparation, stitching and styling methods distinguish the many coastal villages and are expressed in embellishments and details that define the region, the culture and the function of these beautiful outer garments. Gut parkas are made of the intestines from sea mammals and bear, and are worn during kayak hunting expeditions, tide pool collecting, dancing and celebration rituals. Embellishment and detailing of these garments are achieved using the wealth of hair, fur, leather, yarn, cloth, feathers, beaks and claws that are either salvaged from hunting and gathering practiced in each region or acquired through trade. This paper will look at parka construction, embellishment and detailing from several island cultures in Alaska. To the north we will examine “winter-prepared” ugruk gut parkas produced by the Siberian Yupik people from St. Lawrence Island that incorporate feathers, beaks and skin tabs. Traveling south to the Pribilof Islands, home of the Aleut, we will see their wonderful parka constructed of sea lion intestine and embellished with hair, fur, and highly evolved embroidery using the finest fibers of caribou hair on dyed esophagus. Another Island, also in the Bering Sea, is Nunivak Island where the Yupik people developed a style of gut parka made with “summer-prepared” seal gut stitched with sinew and grass and embellished with <b>yarn,</b> <b>beads</b> and fur. A study of the Alutiiq people of Kodiak Island completes this overview of island peoples’ parka construction. All the parkas were made for either practical or spiritual purposes. All used the same basic materials, but in distinctively different ways with embellishment and detailing unique to their culture. These distinctive people have lived on the water and survived many generations of life in severe climate conditions, full of abundance and wealth to those who treated it with respect and care...|$|R
