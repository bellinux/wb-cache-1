30|$|Due to the {{relatively}} slow communication speed with tags, several simple tasks, such as <b>batch</b> <b>deletion,</b> which {{are involved in the}} aforementioned functions are implemented by McRAIT on the tag side. These tasks help the McRAIT controller in reducing transaction load. Nevertheless, McRAIT can increase the speed of communication, memory capacity, and fault-tolerance by simply adding tags and using more frequencies.|$|E
30|$|A McRAIT {{controller}} has {{two major}} functions: multiplexing/demultiplexing (MUX/DEMUX) and {{communication with the}} markers and the sender/receiver main program. Additional functions can also be embedded in the McRAIT controller. For example, the McRAIT controller can have authentication, data encryption, and special operation commands such as <b>batch</b> <b>deletion.</b> A McRAIT controller should {{also be able to}} perform all functions autonomously. Each read and write operation in the RFID tags has to be atomic in the controller so that it can provide, later, multiple physical storages as one logical mapping without requiring preprocessing for the main program. The McRAIT controller is also capable of reporting communication failure(s) to the main program when it reissues the commands over certain number of times.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} (non-standard) {{probabilistic}} analysis of dynamic data structures whose sizes are considered dynamic random walks. The basic operations (insertion, deletion, {{positive and negative}} queries, <b>batched</b> insertion, lazy <b>deletion,</b> etc.) are time-dependent random variables. This model is a (small) step toward the analysis of these structures when {{the distribution of the}} set of histories is not uniform. As an illustration, we focus on list structures (linear lists, priority queues, and dictionaries) but the technique is applicable as well to more advanced data structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the course}} of {{developing}} a system for fitting smooth curves to camera input we have developed several direct (i. e. noniterative) methods for fitting a shape (line, circle, conic, cubic, plane, sphere, quadric, etc.) {{to a set of}} points, namely exact fit, simple fit, spherical fit, and blend fit. These methods are all dimension-independent, being just as suitable for 3 D surfaces as for the 2 D curves they were originally developed for. Exact fit generalizes to arbitrary shapes (in the sense of the term defined in this paper) the well-known determinant method for planar exact fit. Simple fit is a naive reduction of the general overconstrained case to the exact case. Spherical fit takes advantage of a special property of circles and spheres that permits robust fitting; no prior direct circle fitters have been as robust, and there have been no previous sphere fitters. Blend fit finds the best fit to a set of points of a useful generalization of Middleditch-Sears blending curves and surfaces, via a nonpolynomial generalization of planar fit. These methods all require (am + bn) n 2 operations for fitting a surface of order n to m points, with a = 2 and b = 1 / 3 typically, except for spherical fit where b is larger due to the need to extract eigenvectors. All these methods save simple fit achieve a robustness previously attained by direct algorithms only for fitting planes. All admit incremental <b>batched</b> addition and <b>deletion</b> of points at cost an 2 per point and bn 3 per batch. 1...|$|R
