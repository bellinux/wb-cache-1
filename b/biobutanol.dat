25|$|DuPont and BP {{plan to make}} <b>biobutanol</b> {{the first}} product of their joint effort to develop, produce, and market {{next-generation}} biofuels. In Europe the Swiss company Butalco is developing genetically modified yeasts {{for the production of}} <b>biobutanol</b> from cellulosic materials. Gourmet Butanol, a United States-based company, is developing a process that utilizes fungi to convert organic waste into <b>biobutanol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Biobutanol,</b> a {{gasoline}} replacement.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, BP {{formed with}} AB Sugar and DuPont {{a joint venture}} Vivergo Fuels which opened a {{bioethanol}} plant in Saltend near Hull, United Kingdom in December 2012. Together with DuPont, BP formed a <b>biobutanol</b> joint venture Butamax by acquiring biobutan technology company <b>Biobutanol</b> LLC in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Butanol from biomass {{is called}} <b>biobutanol.</b> It {{can be used}} in unmodified {{gasoline}} engines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biobutanol</b> {{can also}} be made using Ralstonia eutropha H16. This process {{requires}} the use of an electro-bioreactor and the input of carbon dioxide and electricity.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 Petit Le Mans race, the No. 16 Lola B09/86 - Mazda MZR-R of Dyson Racing ran on {{a mixture}} of <b>biobutanol</b> and ethanol {{developed}} by team technology partner BP.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{produced}} alcohols, {{most commonly}} ethanol, and less commonly propanol and butanol, {{are produced by}} the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). <b>Biobutanol</b> (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} from ethanol production is {{primarily in the}} fermentation of the feedstock and minor changes in distillation. The feedstocks {{are the same as}} for ethanol: energy crops such as sugar beets, sugar cane, corn grain, wheat and cassava, prospective non-food energy crops such as switchgrass and even guayule in North America, as well as agricultural byproducts such as bagasse, straw and corn stalks. According to DuPont, existing bioethanol plants can cost-effectively be retrofitted to <b>biobutanol</b> production.|$|E
25|$|Oxygenate {{blending}} adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as MTBE, ETBE, ethanol, and <b>biobutanol.</b> The {{presence of}} these oxygenates reduces {{the amount of carbon}} monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. In many areas throughout the US, oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, {{or in the case of}} California, California reformulated gasoline. The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC-controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen.|$|E
25|$|As {{mandated}} by law, {{and in order}} to establish the fuel category for each biofuel, EPA included in its modeling direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as emissions from land use changes related to the full lifecycle. EPA's modeling of specific fuel pathways incorporated comments received through the third-party peer review process, and data and information from new studies and public comments. EPA's analysis determined that both ethanol produced from corn starch and <b>biobutanol</b> from corn starch comply with the 20% GHG emission reduction threshold required to classify as a renewable fuel. EISA grandfathered existing U.S. corn ethanol plants, and only requires the 20% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions for any renewable fuel produced at new facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007.|$|E
500|$|EPA's {{analysis}} accepted both ethanol {{produced from}} corn starch and <b>biobutanol</b> from corn starch as [...] "renewable fuels". Ethanol produced from sugarcane became an [...] "advanced fuel". Both diesel produced from algal oils and biodiesel from soy oil and diesel from waste oils, fats, and greases {{fell in the}} [...] "biomass-based diesel" [...] category. Cellulosic ethanol and cellulosic diesel met the [...] "cellulosic biofuel" [...] standard.|$|E
500|$|Sugar, starch, cotton, linen, hemp, {{some types}} of rope, wood and {{particle}} boards, papyrus and paper, vegetable oils, wax, and natural rubber are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products. Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood, {{has a long history}} as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material {{and is one of the}} three ingredients of gunpowder. Cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer, can be converted into energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. Products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper paste, <b>biobutanol</b> and gun cotton. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel. [...] Sweetgrass was used by NativeAmericanse to ward of bugs like mosquitoes. These bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the American Chemical Society in the molecules phytol and coumarin.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Biobutanol</b> {{can be made}} {{entirely with}} solar energy and nutrients, from algae (called Solalgal Fuel) or diatoms. [...] Current yield is low.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{methanol}} {{is produced}} from natural gas, {{although it can}} be produced from biomass using very similar chemical processes. Ethanol is commonly produced from biological material through fermentation processes. However, ethanol that is derived from petroleum {{should not be considered}} safe for consumption as the mixture contains about 5% methanol and may cause blindness or death. <b>Biobutanol</b> has the advantage in combustion engines in that its energy density is closer to gasoline than the simpler alcohols (while still retaining over 25% higher octane rating); however, <b>biobutanol</b> is currently more difficult to produce than ethanol or methanol. When obtained from biological materials and/or biological processes, they are known as bioalcohols (e.g. [...] "bioethanol"). There is no chemical difference between biologically produced and chemically produced alcohols.|$|E
2500|$|... n-Butanol {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a substitute for}} diesel fuel and gasoline. [...] It is produced in small quantities in nearly all fermentations (see fusel oil), but species of Clostridium produce much higher yields of butanol, and research is currently underway to increase the ultimate yield of <b>biobutanol</b> from biomass.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011–2013, BP {{cut down}} its {{alternative}} energy business. The company announced its {{departure from the}} solar energy market in December 2011 by closing its solar power business, BP Solar. In 2012, BP shut down the BP Biofuels Highlands project which was developed since 2008 to make cellulosic ethanol from emerging energy crops like switchgrass and from biomass. [...] In 2015, BP decided to exit from other lignocellulosic ethanol businesses. [...] It sold its stake in Vivergo to Associated British Foods. [...] BP and DuPont also mothballed their joint <b>biobutanol</b> pilot plant in Saltend.|$|E
2500|$|One {{promising}} {{development in}} <b>biobutanol</b> production technology {{was discovered in}} the late summer of 2011—Tulane University's alternative fuel research scientists discovered a strain of Clostridium, called [...] "TU-103", that can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol, and is the only known strain of Clostridium-genus bacteria that can do so in the presence of oxygen. The university's researchers have stated that the source of the [...] "TU-103" [...] Clostridium bacteria strain was most likely from the solid waste from one of the plains zebra at New Orleans' Audubon Zoo.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Biobutanol</b> can be {{produced}} by fermentation of biomass by the A.B.E. process. The process uses the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{also known as the}} Weizmann organism, or [...] Clostridium beijerinckii. [...] It was Chaim Weizmann who first used C. acetobutylicum for the production of acetone from starch (with the main use of acetone being the making of Cordite) in 1916. The butanol was a by-product of this fermentation (twice as much butanol was produced). The process also creates a recoverable amount of H2 {{and a number of other}} by-products: acetic, lactic and propionic acids, isopropanol and ethanol.|$|E
