40|$|An agar plate assay was {{developed}} to detect <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> hydrolase activity in lactobacilli. On Lactobacillus-selective MRS or Rogosa SL medium supplemented with taurodeoxycholic, taurocholic, or taurochenodeoxycholic acids, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> hydrolysis was manifested at two intensities: (i) the formation of precipitate halos around colonies or (ii) the formation of opaque granular white colonies. Sixty-six lactobacilli were tested for <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> hydrolase activity by both the plate assay and a sensitive radiochemical assay. No false-positive or false-negative results were detected by the plate assay. Based on results of experiments with Eubacterium lentum and Bacteroides species, the plate assay was dependent on two factors: (i) the presence of <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> hydrolytic activity and (ii) {{the ability of the}} organism to sufficiently acidify the medium to protonate free bile acids. The availability of a differential medium for determination of <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> hydrolase activity will provide a rapid method for determining shifts in a specific functional activity of intestinal Lactobacillus species and provide a rapid screening capability for identifying <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> hydrolase-deficient mutants.

The use of <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> derivatives as the surfactants for the formation of a microemulsion enabled significantly higher loading of the drug in both the microemulsion and nanoparticles, compared with the native <b>bile</b> <b>salt.</b> In addition, superior stability of the particles was achieved with the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> derivatives, and drug crystallization was inhibited. Interestingly, differences in particle stability and crystallization inhibition were observed between two <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> derivatives differing only by one hydroxyl group on the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> backbone, indicating the delicate balance of interactions in the system.

25|$|When food {{containing}} fat {{enters the}} digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I {{cells of the}} duodenum and jejunum. In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually draining into the duodenum. The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and <b>bile</b> <b>salts,</b> and also acts {{as a means of}} eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism, from the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{contents}} of these micelles (but not the <b>bile</b> <b>salts)</b> enter the enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) {{where they are}} resynthesized into triglycerides, and packaged into chylomicrons which are released into the lacteals (the capillaries of the lymph system of the intestines). These lacteals drain into the thoracic duct which empties into the venous blood at the junction of the left jugular and left subclavian veins on the lower left hand side of the neck. This means that the fat soluble products of digestion are discharged directly into the general circulation, without first passing through the liver, as all other digestion products do. The reason for this peculiarity is unknown.|$|E

40|$|Background. The <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump mediates uphill canalicular {{bile acid}} secretion. Inherited {{dysfunction}} of the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump causes a progressive and a benign form of familial intrahepatic cholestasis. Mutations within the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump gene are reported. Presently, prediction of protein nanostructure and function {{is a great}} challenge in the proteomics and structural genomics era. Identification of the point vulnerable to mutation is a new trend to expand knowledge on disorders at the genomic and proteomic level of diseases. Materials and methods. A bioinformatic analysis was performed to study the positions that determine peptide motifs in the amino acid sequence of the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump. To identify the weak linkage in <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump, a new bioinformatic tool named GlobPlot was used. Results.

Based on this study, the weak linkages in the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump can be identified and can provide good information for expectation of possible new mutations {{that can lead to}} cross species jumping. In addition, the results from this study provide useful information for further research on the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> export pump...|$|R
25|$|Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile {{contains}} {{too much}} cholesterol {{and not enough}} <b>bile</b> <b>salts.</b> Besides {{a high concentration of}} cholesterol, two other factors are important in causing gallstones. The first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. This can be caused by high resistance to the flow of bile out of the gallbladder due to the complicated internal geometry of the cystic duct. The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. In addition, increased levels of the hormone estrogen, as a result of pregnancy or hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement, resulting in gallstone formation.|$|E
2500|$|Absorption of {{lycopene}} {{requires that}} it be combined with <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> and fat to form micelles.

40|$|Gastroduodenal {{toxicity}} of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is partly independent from cyclooxygenase inhibition, possibly related to increased intermixed micellar-vesicular (nonphospholipid-associated) <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations {{thought to be}} responsible for <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> cytotoxicity. We evaluated the effects of indomethacin on <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> cytotoxicity with complementary in vitro and ex vivo systems. In the erythrocyte model, indomethacin alone did not induce hemolysis. In contrast, indomethacin enhanced and phospholipids decreased hemolysis induced by hydrophobic taurodeoxycholate (TDC).

Indomethacin did not affect intermixed micellar-vesicular <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations or compositions. Indomethacin also increased TDC-induced lactate dehydrogenase release in CaCo- 2 cells and bile salt-induced rat colonic mucosal injury, and prevented potential protective effects of TUDC in these systems. Our data show that indomethacin enhances bile salt-induced cytotoxicity without affecting intermixed micellar-vesicular <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations or compositions.

40|$|To {{identify}} the sinusoidal bile acid uptake system(s) of skate liver, photoaffinity labeling and kinetic transport studies were performed in isolated plasma membranes {{as well as}} intact hepatocytes. In both preparations photoaffinity labeling with the photolabile <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> derivative (7, 7 -azo- 3 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy- 5 beta-[3 beta- 3 H]cholan- 24 -oyl) - 2 -aminoethanesulfonate revealed {{the presence of a}} predominant <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> binding polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 54, 000. The labeling of this polypeptide was inhibited by taurocholate and cholate in a concentration-dependent manner and was virtually abolished by 1 mM of the anion transport inhibitor 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid. Kinetic studies of hepatic uptake with taurocholate, cholate, and the photoreactive <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> derivative indicated the involvement of a single transport system, and all three substrates mutually competed with the uptake of each other. Finally, irreversible inhibition of the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> uptake system by photoaffinity labeling of hepatocytes with high concentrations (250 microM) of photolabile derivative reduced the Vmax but not the Km of taurocholate uptake. These findings strongly indicate that a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 54, 000 is involved in sinusoidal <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> uptake into skate hepatocytes. These findings contrast with similar studies in rat liver that implicate both a 54, 000 - and 48, 000 -K polypeptide in <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> uptake and are consistent with a single Na+-independent transport mechanism for hepatic <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> uptake in this primitive vertebrate...|$|R

2500|$|The {{major source}} of retinoids from the diet are plant {{pigments}} such as carotenes and retinyl esters derived from animal sources.

[...] Retinyl ester hydrolysis requires the presence of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> that serve to solubilize the retinyl esters in mixed micelles and to activate the hydrolyzing enzymes ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{enzymes that}} {{are present in}} the {{intestinal}} lumen may be involved in the hydrolysis of dietary retinyl esters.

[...] The different hydrolyzing enzymes are activated by different types of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> and have distinct substrate specificities. [...] For example, whereas the pancreatic estrase is selective for short-chain retinyl esters, the brush-border membrane enzyme preferentially hydrolyzes retinyl esters containing a long-chain fatty acid such as palmitate or stearate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the correlation between bile secretion and the liver regeneration in the partially hepatectomized rat. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Significant alteration in bile formation and secretion is expected in the liver after hepatectomy. There is scant literature, however, about the effects of liver regeneration in bile secretion. METHODS: The work was done in rats with 50 % hepatectomy, 75 % hepatectomy, and sham operation as the control. A chronic common bile duct fistula and a duodenal cannula were established for bile collection and the sample analysis on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. RESULTS: With size reduced in the liver after 50 % and 75 % hepatectomy, the total bile volume decreased 45. 9 % and 51. 5 %, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> independent flow decreased 59. 3 % and 64. 9 %, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> secretion rate decreased 36. 1 % and 43. 4 %, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> basal synthesis rate decreased 52. 3 % and 56. 4 %, phospholipid secretion rate decreased 52. 6 % and 68. 0 %, and cholesterol secretion rate decreased 54. 3 % and 72. 4 % from control on day 1, respectively. All changes returned to the control level in 3 to 9 days with accompanying increasing liver size during regeneration. CONCLUSION: Alterations of total <b>bile</b> flow, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> independent flow, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> secretion rate, <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> basal synthesis rate, and biliary lipid secretion after partial hepatectomy correlate with the liver regeneration rate in rats. Partial hepatectomy reduces the <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> independent fraction calculated as per 100 g body weight rather than the dependent fraction.

2500|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA [...] needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to mitochondrion as malate (and then back into oxaloacetate to transfer more acetyl-CoA out of the mitochondrion). The cytosolic acetyl-CoA can be carboxylated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step [...] in the [...] synthesis of fatty acids, or it can be combined with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) which is the rate limiting step controlling the synthesis of cholesterol.

60|$|Section 26. It meets {{now with}} the bile, a greenish fluid {{secreted}} by that large and conspicuous gland the liver. The bile {{is not simply a}} digestive secretion, like the saliva or the gastric juice; it contains matters destined to mix in, and after a certain amount of change to be passed out of the body with, the faeces; among these substances, of which some portion is doubtless excretory, are compounds containing sulphur-- the <b>bile</b> <b>salts.</b> There is also a colouring matter, bili verdin, which may possibly also be excretory. If the student will compare Sections 10 and 11, he will notice that in those paragraphs no account is taken of the sulphur among the katastases, the account does not balance, and he will at once see that here probably is the missing item on the outgoing side. The bile, through the presence of these salts, is strongly alkaline, and so stops the action of the gastric juice, and prepares for that of the pancreas, which can act only in an alkaline medium. The fermentive action of the bile is trifling; it dissolves fats, to a certain extent, and is antiseptic, that is, it prevents putrefaction to which the chyme might be liable; it also seems to act as a natural purgative.|$|E

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Depression of bile secretion in the three main components and bile cholesterol supersaturation with {{a high incidence of}} cholesterol stone formation have been documented in patients with end stage liver diseases after transplantation. However, physiologic changes of <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> and lipid secretion in recipients remain unclear. METHODS: The study was done using a rat liver transplant model with 1 and 6 hours of donor liver cold preservation in saline. A chronic common bile duct fistula and a duodenal cannula were established for bile collection and the sample biochemical study for 6 days. RESULTS: Altered <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> kinetics in liver grafted rats included depressed bile flow for 1 - 3 hours after the revascularization, decreased <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> concentration and outputs, reduced <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> basal synthesis rate, and reduced <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> pool size during the early postoperative period. Phospholipid concentration and secretion rate depressed for 1 - 3 days without altered cholesterol level. The uncoupling change of the cholesterol and the other bile components resulted in an increased lithogenic indices in bile on days 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: Alterations of bile composition and <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> kinetics occur in liver transplanted rats. The changes may result from injuries of the liver microcirculation and parenchymal cells caused by cold preservation. The study of bile secretion is helpful for evaluation of the initial graft function.

We determined the effect of prebiotic oligosaccharides on <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> metabolism in rats. Rats were fed a control diet or an isocaloric diet containing a mixture of galactooligosaccharides (GOS), long-chain fructooligosaccharides (lcFOS), and acidified oligosaccharides (AOS) for 3 wk.

We quantified bile flow and biliary <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> secretion rates through bile cannulation. Prebiotic intervention resulted in significant changes in fecal and colonic flora: the proportion of lactobacilli increased 344 % (P < 0. 01) in colon content and 139 % (P < 0. 01) in feces compared with the control group.
