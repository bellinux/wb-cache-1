By late 2003, {{all but one of}} her charges against Patton had been dismissed; the {{remaining}} charge alleged [...] "outrageous" [...] conduct. In March 2003, the state's Executive Branch Ethics Commission investigated Conner's claims and accused Patton of four ethics violations, charging that he [...] "used or attempted to use his official position" [...] to provide favors for Conner. The favors included contacting the state transportation secretary with regard to Conner's disadvantaged <b>business</b> <b>application,</b> recommending a promotion for an officer who allegedly helped Conner avoid paying a traffic ticket, appointing Conner {{to the board of directors}} for the Kentucky Lottery, and appointing Conner's then-husband to the Agricultural Development Board. Patton claimed that the favors he requested for Conner were the same kind of favors that he had requested for dozens of influential constituents. He also claimed he had not profited financially from any of the requested favors. He maintained that his attitude toward constituent services was [...] "If you can do so legally and ethically, help them." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{business}} process contains {{a set of}} logically related tasks executed to fulfill <b>business</b> goals. <b>Business</b> <b>applications</b> enable organizations to automatically perform their daily operations. Business processes and <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> keep on changing independently due to dynamic business environments. Therefore, {{business process}} definitions are rarely up-to-dated to reflect the processes deployed in <b>business</b> <b>applications.</b> This inconsistency creates difficulties for the communications between business analysts and software developers. We present a business process explorer tool which automatically recovers business processes from <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> and refines the process definitions by detecting business task clones which have similar functionality across processes. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} concepts for a middleware that enables communication between smart items networks and <b>business</b> <b>applications.</b> Smart items networks consist of RFID systems, wireless sensor networks, and embedded systems. The integration of such devices into <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> is challenging, since each device type {{has its own}} protocols and programming interfaces. Existing middleware simplifies development of software which runs on smart items but not integration with back-end systems. We propose middleware concepts that abstract from the smart items network on a serviceoriented level to ease integration into <b>business</b> <b>applications.</b> Our middleware allows the development of <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> which are able to deploy, run and query services from the network without any knowledge of the underlying smart items network. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{application}} landscapes {{consist of}} a multitude of inter-connected <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> exchanging data in manifold ways. These <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> are used by employees who take on several organizational roles. However, when broadening the scope to an enterprise-wide perspective, lack of clarity and uncertainty prevail regarding the questions which roles have access on which <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> {{as well as the}} business objects managed by them. In contrast to alternative approaches, e. g. single sign on, this paper focuses on the enterprise-wide availability of business objects. Motivated by a case study from the car manufacturing industry, this article describes a method to analyze and justify an enterprise-wide access matrix. Respective viewpoints are presented facilitating a business object access management on enterprise level. The method and concepts are further substantiated by means of the case study. 1 Introduction and motivating example Nowadays, an enterprise’s typical application landscape is characterized by a plethora of <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> which are interlinked via interfaces used for data exchange. In the course of time, the amount of data stored in these <b>business</b> <b>applications</b> continuousl...|$|R
