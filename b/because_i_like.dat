5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
500|$|... 20th Century Fox {{announced}} on April 1, 2006 {{that the film}} would be released worldwide on July 27, 2007. The film was released a day earlier in Australia and the United Kingdom. Little information about the plot was released in the weeks building up to the film's release. Groening {{did not feel that}} [...] "people look in the TV section of the newspaper and think, 'I'll watch this week's Simpsons <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the plot.' You just tune in and see what happens." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Dowey giggles. There {{is little}} doubt that in her youth she was an {{accomplished}} flirt. 'Maybe, mister, it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> you best.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{was staying}} there. It was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the place so much, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was so much}} happier here than in London, that I came back." ...|$|R
500|$|Steven Paul Smith {{was born}} at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, {{the only child of}} Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an {{elementary}} school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: [...] "I didn't get it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there." ...|$|E
500|$|According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is [...] "a perfectionist workaholic". He is {{also known}} for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
5000|$|Band leader Bill Leeb {{said about}} {{choosing}} the label Dossier: [...] "We {{just did it}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> {{a lot of the}} other artists on the label." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} is there to frighten you in his being a priest? You told me at the Loring's ball that you took an {{interest}} in Penrose <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because James's papa was gouty, {{and wanted}} {{somebody}} {{to take care}} of him, <b>I</b> suppose; not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> him a bit," [...] answers the lady: and so with much easy talk and kindness the evening passed away.|$|R
500|$|A {{writer for}} Rap-Up {{considered}} the video realistic, as [...] "art imitates life". Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic {{called it an}} inaccurate portrayal of domestic violence due to insufficient violence, {{as evidenced by the}} lack of injuries after punching through a wall. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard suggested the video was inspired by the lyric, [...] "Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, but that's alright <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the way it hurts." [...] Rihanna's appearance was criticized. Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Daniel Kreps called it [...] "especially striking" [...] and noted her relationship with Brown. An editor from The Boston Globe commented that although the video is realistic, it hinders Rihanna's ability to set an example for women in abusive relationships. Billy Johnson Jr. from Yahoo! Music wrote that Fox's character alternated between vulnerable and confrontational personalities, while Monaghan's character is similar to Eminem. Kahn, who understood why viewers thought Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships influenced the video, asked that they realize this is untrue. He said the team had been conscious of such personal matters and Fox's and Monaghan's characters are only significant to each other.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Tango del Pecado", is {{addressed}} {{to the parents of}} Residente's then-girlfriend, former Miss Universe Denise Quiñones, who did not approve of the couple's relationship. [...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to be more frank still," [...] he promised her. [...] "Then another reason, of course, was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> him, and a third, which I am not sure wasn't the chief of all, because he was your brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they would}} think the truth," [...] said he. [...] "Perhaps they would imagine that I called you so <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> you. But perhaps they might think also that you let me do so because you liked me. People do make such mistakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean," [...] he retorted, with courage {{astonishing}} to him. [...] "It was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> you so much." [...] He {{could not say}} loved; it seemed too bold. [...] "There's nothing else can excuse it, and I don't know as that can." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I don't {{look back}} on the past <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to live in the present. I know this makes some people think I {{probably}} never cared, but I need my freedom and I like to keep moving." [...] - Juliette Binoche ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Entertainment Weekly, Lawrence {{said she}} didn't have {{a handle on}} Tiffany at first, which was what excited her about the role. [...] "She was just a {{character}} I one-hundred percent did not understand at all... She's like, 'I'm messed up, I'm not like everybody else, I've got issues. Take {{it or leave it}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> myself.|$|E
2500|$|Fator says {{he found}} he {{had the ability to}} {{impersonate}} singers by practicing ventriloquism while driving his car. [...] "One of the reasons I learned how to sing as a ventriloquist was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> singing in the car," [...] Fator says. [...] "I’d see other people singing in the car, and they looked goofy, so I’d do it without moving my lips." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1942, he {{left for}} Philadelphia to study to become an {{electronic}} engineer. “My parents sent me to the United States to study. They were Spanish republicans who believed in progress. I {{would have preferred to}} make literary studies. I began studies to become electronic engineer <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> mathematics.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He knocked us about,' said Paul, {{drawing his}} {{shoulders}} {{together with an}} unpleasant recollection; 'he wasn't so bad to me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> getting my tasks, {{and when he was}} in a good humour, he'd say I was a credit to him, and order me in to read to him in the evening.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On the May 5, 2017, {{episode of}} The Bill Simmons Podcast, hosted by Bill Simmons, {{a long time}} friend of Le Batard, Rapaport once again brought up the beef {{between him and the}} show. He {{repeatedly}} insulted Le Batard, Stugotz, and the show's producers saying they were only there to get his coffee. Simmons was uncomfortable for the entirety of Rapaport's rant against the show saying, “I still feel awkward <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> all those guys. I wish this would work out.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I {{have no desire to}} simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's hard for me to stay serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E
2500|$|Sirtis {{was delighted}} to {{get the chance to}} do some comedy in Star Trek: First Contact and said, [...] "I loved it because it opened the door to a {{different}} side of Troi we'd never seen before. That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I {{was going to have a}} good part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character. So I knew that he would do her some justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't help you—George, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> to feel {{my fingers}} so sticky, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{love to see}} you so domesticated." ...|$|R
500|$|Redding added, [...] "I had {{borrowed}} a terrible old hollow-body electric guitar from {{someone at the}} studio... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> to play along on rhythm to familiarise myself with a sequence, not being quite {{at home on the}} bass yet". [...] The guitar was tuned down one-half step, with the tone controls set to resemble a bass guitar.|$|R
5000|$|... "I never {{intended}} to turn the army into a career, but <b>I</b> remained <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it. <b>I</b> loved the Negev, the desert, the fields. I loved speeding in jeeps. Later I {{got used to the}} army, and it became a part of me. And maybe also, I was afraid to make a new start in life." ...|$|R
2500|$|Burr's weight, {{always an}} issue for him in getting roles, became a public {{relations}} problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told Us Weekly years later: [...] "I have been asked {{a number of times}} to do his show and I won't do it. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC." [...] In later life, his distinctive physique and manner {{could be used as a}} reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer's opinion that [...] "asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs … is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault." [...] A character in a 1989 short story refers to Burr as [...] "grossly overweight" [...] in Ironside.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Wozniak {{developed}} the computer that eventually made him famous. He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating {{system for the}} Apple I. Wozniak originally offered the design to HP while working there, but was denied by the company on five different occasions. Jobs instead had the idea to sell the Apple I with Wozniak as a fully assembled printed circuit board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs {{that even if they}} were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of their possessions (such as Wozniak's HP scientific calculator and Jobs' Volkswagen van), raised $1,300, and assembled the first boards in Jobs' bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs' garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. (Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and [...] "I came up with [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> repeating digits.") Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 50 system boards to Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop, called the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California.|$|E

2500|$|Cornwell {{has spoken}} {{negatively}} {{of the presidency}} of George W. Bush, saying, [...] "I was supportive of young George W. Bush <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> his family. <b>I</b> {{thought he was going}} to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It's not a democracy so much as a theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on." ...|$|R
