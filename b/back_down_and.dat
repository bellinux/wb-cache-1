5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> <b>And</b> that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> I admire that.|$|E

Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E
5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Jardine {{was born}} on 23 October 1900 in Bombay, British India, to Scottish parents, Malcolm Jardine—a former {{first-class}} cricketer who became a barrister—and Alison Moir. At the age of nine, {{he was sent to}} St Andrews in Scotland to stay with his mother's sister. He attended Horris Hill School, near Newbury, Berkshire, from May 1910. There, Jardine was moderately successful academically, and from 1912, he played cricket for the school first eleven, enjoying success as a bowler and as a batsman. He led the team in his final year, and the team were unbeaten under his captaincy. As a schoolboy, Jardine was influenced by the writing of former England captain C. B. Fry on batting technique, which contradicted the advice of his coach at Horris Hill. The coach disapproved of Jardine's batting methods, but Jardine did not <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> quoted a book by Fry to support his viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and,</b> in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> make concessions, {{and he ended}} up in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E

5|$|The Tanzimat proved unpopular {{with large}} {{segments}} of the population and a Bedouin revolt broke out, with Transjordanian tribes launching raids against Tiberias and its countryside in the summer of 1863. Aqil was unable to stop the raids, and may {{have played a role in}} the revolt. In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha would <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, {{casualties}} were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from {{a crew of}} 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began within minutes of the French surrender: Mends took possession of Niémen and sent a note to Seymour informing {{him that he had}} seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusas surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst to assist with the wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave without notice. Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' late arrival, which meant that Arethusa was entitled to half the prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Niémen limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.|$|E

5|$|In {{yet another}} {{alternate}} timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house, and learns {{that she is}} {{still in love with}} her boyfriend, Stefano. Nemo does not <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the story line, Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her ashes, having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before they can say much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression. She has attacks of hysteria and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.|$|E
5|$|Neither party showed any {{inclination}} to <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> the nation {{seemed on the}} brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Negotiators propose extreme measures, often bluffs, {{to force}} the other party to chicken out and {{give them what they}} want. This tactic can be {{dangerous}} when parties are unwilling to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> go through with the extreme measure.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{above the}} {{downstream}} {{side of the}} dam is the Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station, a hydroelectric power plant using pumped storage to accommodate peak electrical load by storing potential energy in water pumped into an upper reservoir.

25|$|In ancient Greek mythology, King Sisyphus {{was sentenced}} to roll an enchanted boulder up a hill, only to stand just before the peak and watch it roll itself <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> to repeat this action forever. This {{consigned}} Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration, and thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as Sisyphean.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the crisis}} was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no {{indication}} that they would <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> had made several comments to the contrary.

25|$|President Andrew Jackson {{successfully}} {{forced the}} nullifiers to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> allowed a gradual reduction of tariff rates. Calhoun and Senator Henry Clay agreed upon the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which would lower rates over 10 years. Calhoun later supported national protection for {{slavery in the}} form of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and federal protection of slavery in the territories conquered from Mexico, in contradiction to his previous support for nullification and states' rights.|$|E
25|$|Hartley {{has been}} an {{advocate}} for the adult film industry's right to exist, and, before the rise to stardom of Jenna Jameson, she had often been called on when television news programs and talk shows required an articulate, leading adult film actress to support the pro side. The two came under hard scrutiny from the mostly female audience, but they refused to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> were outspoken in their support of the industry. She and Ona Zee spoke out strongly against illegal drugs in the industry.|$|E
