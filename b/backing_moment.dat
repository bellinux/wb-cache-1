Ten healthy subjects participated in a protocol comprising 12 lifting conditions. Low <b>back</b> <b>moments</b> were assessed using two variants of a video analysis method and a lab-based reference method. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed no overall differences in peak moments between the {{two versions of the}} video analysis method and the reference method. However, two conditions showed a minor overestimation of one of the video analysis method moments. Standard deviations were considerable suggesting that errors in the video analysis were random. Furthermore, there was a small underestimation of dynamic components and overestimation of the static components of the moments. Intraclass correlations coefficients for peak moments showed high correspondence (> 0. 85) of the video analyses with the reference method. It is concluded that, when a sufficient number of measurements can be taken, the video analysis method for assessment of low back loads during lifting tasks provides valid estimates of low <b>back</b> <b>moments</b> in ergonomic practice and epidemiological studies for lifts up to a moderate level of asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{wearable}} lifting aids support {{workers by}} applying gravity force compensation at the arms. In {{this study we}} investigated the feasibility of a compensatory lower <b>back</b> <b>moment,</b> generated by a practically constant spring force (38. 5 Nm), extending the lower back by pushing on the upper leg. This design is proposed as a light-weight solution to generate lower <b>back</b> <b>moments.</b> The method is compared to using counterweights at a different distances. We recorded EMG activity of the erector spinae longissimus (ES) muscle, the perceived workload (NASA TLX) and the preference of 12 subjects. Results showed {{no significant difference in}} ES peak EMG activity during the task, and no significant difference between perceived workload between conditions, as we expected. However, 10 out of 12 subjects indicated preferring the spring mechanism over both counterweights. The main reason of preference was the reduction of weight and inertia of the system. Therefore, the proposed constant spring force mechanism is a feasible alternative to counterweights...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of ergonomic interventions involving a reduction of the mass (from 16 to 11 and 6 kg) {{and an increase in}} the initial lifting height (from pallet height to 90 cm above the ground) of building blocks in a mock-up of an industrial depalletizing task, investigating lifting behaviour as well as low <b>back</b> <b>moments</b> (calculated using a 3 -D linked segment model). Nine experienced construction workers participated in the experiment, in which they removed building blocks from a pallet in the way they normally did during their work. Most of the changes in lifting behaviour that were found would attenuate the effect of the investigated interventions on low <b>back</b> <b>moments.</b> When block mass was reduced from 16 to 6 kg, subjects chose to lift the building block from a 10 (SD 10) cm greater distance from the front edge of the pallet and with a 100 (SD 66) degrees/...|$|R
40|$|Manual {{materials}} handling on a moving platform, like a ship, {{might be a}} risk factor for the development of low back pain due to the influence of accelerations on low back loading. In the current simulation study, 3 -D accelerations, measured on a frigate were applied to the kinematics of symmetrical and asymmetrical lifting movements and to a pulling task that had been performed under stable conditions. The aim was to find out to what extent low back loading is increased when the task execution is not adapted to the ship accelerations. Unfavorable timing, analyzed using the 99 th percentile of predicted low <b>back</b> <b>moments,</b> resulted in only a moderate (up to 15 %) increase of extending and total low <b>back</b> <b>moments,</b> and in a substantial increase of the twisting moment (up to 67 %) during asymmetrical lifting. Moments in the pulling task were low and were relatively unaffected by ship accelerations, but adaptation of the movement pattern to prevent falling would be needed more often than during lifting. It furthermore appeared that a substantial reduction of low back loading by favorable timing is not a realistic option. Designing tasks {{in such a way that}} they are located midship would reduce the 99 th percentile of predicted low <b>back</b> <b>moments.</b> During lifting, orienting the task in such a way that the feet are pointing sideward relative to the ship reduces the predicted peak twisting moment at the low back compared to pointing the feet forward or backward. Relevance to industry: Accelerations on a ship may influence safety and loading of workers during manual {{materials handling}}. This study investigates potential effects of moderate accelerations on low back loading during lifting and pulling tasks. It is shown that working midship reduces the risk of low back overloading, compared to working at the front deck...|$|R

40|$|Much {{research}} has been performed on associations of physical exposures (e. g. lifting, trunk flexion or body vibrations) with low back pain (LBP). However, information {{on the effect of}} doses (e. g. spinal force or low <b>back</b> <b>moments)</b> on LBP is lacking. Cumulative low back load is significantly associated with the occurrence of LBP. Cumulative low back load is more consistently associated with LBP than the earlier found risk factors lifting and working in a flexed position. The {{results of the present study}} may have implications for prevention programs for LBP. Interventions aimed at changes in posture and lifting forces, but also reduction of duration of exposure to adverse postures should, according to these findings be considered...|$|R

50|$|The {{beginning}} of qualifying {{was marked by}} controversy following Vettel's wing failure. Red Bull had brought a new aerodynamic package to the race that included a new front wing, and team principal Christian Horner {{made the decision to}} remove the new front wing from Webber's car and give it to Vettel. This prompted an angry outburst from the Australian, with public perception being that Red Bull had robbed Webber for the sake of favouring Vettel, particularly following the aftermath of their collision in Istanbul. Otherwise, the first session saw the elimination of Jaime Alguersuari and the Lotuses, Virgins and Hispanias. Timo Glock edged out Kovalainen in the dying moments to qualify as the best of the newcomers, only to have Kovalainen take the place <b>back</b> <b>moments</b> later.|$|R
