50|$|Counter-flashing (or cover flashing, cap flashing) is a {{term used}} when there are two {{parallel}} pieces of flashing employed together such as on a chimney, where the counter-flashing {{is built into the}} chimney and overlaps a replaceable piece of base flashing. Strips of lead used for flashing an edge were sometimes called an apron, and the term is still used for the piece of flashing below a chimney. The up-hill side of a chimney may have a small gable-like assembly called a cricket with cricket flashing or on narrow chimneys with no cricket a back flashing or <b>back</b> <b>pan</b> flashing. Flashing may be let into a groove in a wall or chimney called a reglet.|$|E

60|$|We traced our way up {{the creek}} as far as Discovery and <b>back,</b> <b>panning</b> dirt at various places with {{resulting}} colors in some cases. The trail was full of men racking to and fro with heavy loads on their backs. They moved in little trains {{of four or five}} or six men, some going out of the country, others coming in--about an equal number each way. Everything along the creek was staked, and our test work resulted in nothing more than gaining information with regard to what was going on.|$|R

5000|$|As Neal tracks Emma {{through the}} woods with a {{sleeping}} Henry, he is found by Pan and The Lost Boys, who recapture Henry and take him away. As Pan laughs about the [...] "game," [...] Neal says he made it off the island once when he was Baelfire, but Pan questions how he {{left in the first}} place without permission and Neal is taken prisoner by Pan. Hours later, Henry awakes at the fire, and Pan tells him he fell asleep. Henry seems to remember that he dreamed about seeing his father (Neal), but he continues to believe that he is still dead. Pan says Neverland used to be a place where dreams came to life, and Henry can bring that magic <b>back.</b> <b>Pan</b> plays his pipe, and Henry starts to dance under Pan's spell.|$|E
50|$|As the {{individuals}} prepare their plan of attack, Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) arrives at Skull Rock, where Pan tells Henry (who is unaware that Pan is actually his great grandfather) {{that he can}} save magic, and Henry believed him. As they enter the caves, Pan cast a protection spell to keep anyone with a shadow out. The individuals then reach the island, where Gold eventually penetrated the spell because he has no shadow. The other members finally believe {{that he wants to}} save Henry and Neal gives the box back to him, followed by Regina and Emma casting an eclipse spell so they can enter. Henry and Pan finally enter a large chamber that contains a large hourglass on top of a pedestal of golden skulls that shows the magic slowly fading, indicating how much time is left for magic in Neverland. After looking at this, Pan tells Henry it is time to save magic, but he now wants to use Henry's heart rather than believing in it, then lies to Henry that he'll live forever in Neverland if he does this. He then is interrupted by a presence, as Gold shows up to confront his father and to stop him from going through with this and takes out the box. Pan says they are really alike because both abandoned their sons, but Gold says he regretted leaving his son the moment he let him go and spent {{the rest of his life}} trying to get him <b>back.</b> <b>Pan</b> then responds “Why do you think I call myself Peter Pan?” and asks Gold to put the box down so they can make a fresh start. After Gold refuses, he waves his hand over the box but nothing happens, as Gold discovers Pan switched boxes, and Pan waves his hand over the real one and places Gold inside it. Pan then returns to finish his scheme to take Henry's heart by giving him magic to allow him to remove it. As Henry succeeds in doing so, Emma, Regina and Neal arrive to stop Henry from giving it to Pan, but Pan tells Henry that they are lying to him because they are adults even as they tell Henry they believe in him because they love him. Unfortunately, Henry, believing that he can save magic, gives his heart to Pan, who has now emerged victorious in his plot to become immortal. Henry dies as a result.|$|E

500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Pedro Romhanyi, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} band in an all white room playing along to the track. A station identification logo for [...] "SFA television" [...] is seen in the top left and a green graphic appears, showing the volume level being turned up. The camera <b>pans</b> <b>back</b> to reveal a TV which switches channel from [...] "SFA" [...] to a station showing golf. The rest of the video continues this pattern, continually flicking between the band {{and a variety of other}} stations, which generally feature similar logos to real life channels but with slightly different names e.g. [...] "Cartoon Animals" [...] (Cartoon Network), [...] "CVQ" [...] (QVC), [...] "Animal Channel" [...] (Discovery Channel) Actors, news presenters, puppets, a golfer, an astronaut and weatherman sing along with the track as the television stops on the channel each appears on. At one point, the band are shown in silhouette in homage to the cover of Hot Rocks 1964-1971 by The Rolling Stones. As the video ends, the camera <b>pans</b> <b>back</b> to show a television in a room with a man having a telephone conversation. The camera continues to <b>pan</b> <b>back</b> showing this image on a television on a shelf in a small room. The camera <b>pans</b> <b>back</b> through three more televisions, each showing an image of the last shot, ending with a TV in a wallpapered room next to an electric fire. A few seconds before the video ends the screen turns to static. The Pedro Romhanyi video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] single.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{on the development}} of cross-linked PAN based thin film composite (TFC) membranes for non-aqueous application is presented in this work. Polypropylene <b>backed</b> neat <b>PAN</b> membranes fabricated by phase inversion process were cross-linked with hydrazine to get excellent solvent stability toward dimethylformamide (DMF). By interfacial polymerization a selective polyamide active layer was coated over the cross-linked PAN using N,N′-diamino piperazine (DAP) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) as monomers. Permeation and molecular weight cut off (MWCO) experiments using various dyes were done to evaluate the performance of the membranes. Membranes developed by such method show excellent solvent stability toward DMF with a permeance of 1. 7 L/m 2 h bar and a molecular weight cut-off of less than 600 Da...|$|R

In it his thoughts arrange themselves into a strange order, and he reads in the stone what Tring believes to be the formula for the chrysopoeia, but what is in actuality the formula for a niter-based explosive. When Tring mixes the ingredients together, the loft explodes into flames and Tring flees for cover. Kreutz grabs the stone and, still crazed, heads off into the streets of Kraków. After that, he is dragged to the tower by Jan Kanty and the Great Tarnov Crystal is given <b>back</b> to <b>Pan</b> Andrew.|$|R
