At {{the end of the}} Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.|$|E

50|$|Smart locks use {{bluetooth}} {{technology to}} allow a lock to be unlocked with a smartphone, and can send a notification if they are breached. Several smart <b>bicycle</b> <b>locks</b> have been produced through crowdfunding and sold as consumer products. Some bicycle-sharing systems also use them. Smart locks introduce added security risks through the possibility of hacking.|$|E
50|$|This was {{originally}} done with chains and handcuffs, but other devices have been introduced, including tripods and tubes or pipes with handholds built in to link {{a person to}} an object or to create chains of people.Other common hardware includes padlocks, U-locks and other <b>bicycle</b> <b>locks,</b> lockboxes and tripods and platforms and other rigging in tree sitting.|$|E

50|$|Bicycle parking {{typically}} {{requires a}} degree of security to prevent theft. The context for bike parking requires proper infrastructure and equipment (bike racks, <b>bicycle</b> <b>locks</b> etc.) for secure and convenient storage. Parking facilities include lockers, racks, manned or unmanned bicycle parking stations including automated facilities, covered areas, and legal arrangements for ad hoc parking alongside railings and other street furniture.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{simplest}} types of combination lock, often seen in low-security <b>bicycle</b> <b>locks</b> and in briefcases, uses several rotating discs with notches cut into them. The lock is secured by a pin with several teeth on it which hook into the rotating discs. When the notches in the discs align with the teeth on the pin, the lock can be opened.|$|E

50|$|Students barricaded {{the campus}} gates using {{heavy-duty}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>locks</b> and hot-wired buses, moving {{them in front}} of the gates and letting the air out of the tires. The locked gates kept people from coming onto campus grounds while forcing the Board of Trustees to come and receive the protesters' demands. The Board ignored the demands, and following an unsuccessful student/Board discussion, the supporters of DPN took their first march to the Capitol Building. The protest was led for the most part by four students, Bridgetta Bourne, Jerry Covell, Greg Hlibok, and Tim Rarus.|$|E

40|$|Cykelstölder är ett stort {{problem i}} dagens samhälle. I Sverige polisanmäldes 65 700 cykelstölder under 2011. De cykellås som finns på marknaden kan på ett eller annat sätt brytas upp och efter det är cykeln fullt brukbar. Examensarbetets uppdragsgivare hade idéer om ett nytt cykellås som förhindrade cykelns brukbarhet efter uppbrytning av låset. Idén ledde till ett samarbete med uppdragsgivaren, mig och teknikkonsultföretaget, Cross Design. Samarbetet vidareutvecklade idén och resulterade i detta examensarbete. Syftet med examensarbetet har varit att ta fram en primärkonstruktion till ett nytt cykellås som inte finns på dagens marknad. Arbetets metod har utgått från Fredy Olssons konstruktionsprocess som avgränsats till princip- och primärkonstruktion.    Arbetet har innefattat en grundlig produktundersökning, framtagning av kriterier utifrån uppdragsgivarens och standarderna EN 14764 : 2005, City and {{trekking}} bicycles - Safety requirements and test methods och EN 15496 : 2008, Cycles – Requirements and test methods for cycle locks, krav. Kriterieuppställningen följdes av idégenerering för att slutligen resultera i en primärlösning som konstruerades och beräknades i Catia V 5. Resultatet blev ett innovativt cykellås som förhindrar cykelns brukbarhet efter uppbrytandet av låset. Primärkonstruktionen har gett uppdragsgivaren underlag för vidareutveckling tillprototyp och tillverkningskonstruktion. I denna version undanhålls delar på grund av sekretesskäl. Bicycle thefts {{are a common}} problem in today’s society. In Sweden, 65   700 bicycle thefts were reported to the police during 2011. The market’s <b>bicycle</b> <b>locks</b> are in one or another way possible to break up. As soon as the lock is broken the bicycle is as useful as before. The client of the bachelor thesis had ideas about a new bicycle lock which prevents {{the usefulness of the}} bicycle after the lock has been broken. The idea resulted in cooperation between the client, me and the technical consulting company, Cross Design. The collaboration developed the idea and resulted in this bachelor thesis. The thesis purpose has been to create a primary construction of a new bicycle lock which does not exist on today’s market. A construction process has been followed and delimited to principle and primary construction. The study includes a product research, development of criteria from the client and the European standards EN 14764 : 2005, City and trekking bicycles - Safety requirements and test methods and EN 15496 : 2008, Cycles – Requirements and test methods for cycle locks, requirements. The criteria development was followed by creating ideas and result in a primary solution which was constructed and calculated in Catia V 5.    An innovative bicycle lock which prevents the bicycle’s usefulness after the lock is broken was the thesis result. The primary construction has given the client a base for further development of a prototype and manufacturing construction.

5000|$|A {{bicycle parking}} rack, usually {{shortened}} to bike rack and also called a bicycle stand, is {{a device to}} which bicycles can be securely attached for parking purposes. A bike rack may be free standing {{or it may be}} securely attached to the ground or some stationary object such as a building. Indoor bike racks are commonly used for private bicycle parking, while outdoor bike racks are often used in commercial areas. General styles of racks include the Inverted U, Serpentine, Bollard, Grid, and Decorative. [...] The most effective and secure bike racks are those that can secure both wheels and the frame of the bicycle, using a <b>bicycle</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1996, Madison, Wisconsin, instituted its Red Bikes Project, {{a public}} bike sharing program. These red-painted {{bicycles}} {{were available for}} the use of the general public, primarily in the student areas of State Street between the University of Wisconsin campus and the Wisconsin State Capitol. Initially, the only rule regarding the use of a Red Bikes Project bicycle was that it was required to remain outside and unlocked, and thus available for any passerby. After a surge in bicycle thefts and vandalism, the program was modified to require a valid credit card and $80 in security deposits for both the bicycle and the now-mandatory <b>bicycle</b> <b>lock.</b> The program is now only available seasonally, from spring (when all snow has melted) to 30 November.|$|R

50|$|He, once again, {{makes the}} point that you can compare these beings with a key, which they {{represent}} themselves, whereas nature is the lock. Professor Richard Dawkins then explains that a key has to fit a lock exactly, and demonstrates this with a model of a lock. He mentions that a key is something very improbable. However it is hard to measure the probability of such a key, therefore Dawkins takes a <b>bicycle</b> <b>lock</b> for illustration, where you can calculate how likely it is to open the lock, because there is a fixed number of dials with a fixed number of positions. In Dawkin's case we have 3 dials, with 6 positions each, so the probability that you open the lock by sheer luck is one to two hundred and sixteen.|$|R
