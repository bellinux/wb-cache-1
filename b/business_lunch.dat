500|$|Billingsley's {{original}} {{plan for the}} Cub Room was {{for it to be}} a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a [...] "lopsided oval". The room was lit with pink tones. [...] On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room. After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs, and a pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to have a <b>business</b> <b>lunch</b> at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The sanctum sanctorum, the Cub Room ("the snub room"), was guarded by a captain called [...] "Saint Peter" [...] (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).|$|E
