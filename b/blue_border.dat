5|$|Several ancient English towns {{displayed}} the Royal Arms of England upon their seals and, when {{it occurred to}} them to adopt insignia of their own, used the Royal Arms, albeit with modification, as their inspiration.

Hereford changes the lions from gold to silver, and in the 17th century was granted a <b>blue</b> <b>border</b> charged with silver saltires in allusion to its siege by a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The town council of Faversham changes only the hindquarters of the three lions to silver. Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions in reference to its royal patronage and the Norman kings' influence upon the early history of Berkshire.|$|E
