60|$|He rose quickly, but silently, alert, self-contained, and menacing. For this dreamer, this {{bereaved}} man, this scornful philosopher {{of riches}} had disappeared with that midnight trespass upon the sacred treasure. The {{movement of the}} blanket ceased; the soft, swishing sound recommenced. He drew a glittering bowie-knife from his <b>boot-leg,</b> and in three noiseless strides was beside the pile. There he saw what he fully expected to see,--a narrow, horizontal gap between the log walls of the cabin and the adobe floor, slowly widening and deepening by the burrowing of unseen hands from without. The cold outer air which he had felt before was now plainly flowing into the heated cabin through the opening. The swishing sound recommenced, and stopped. Then the four fingers of a hand, palm downwards, were cautiously introduced between the bottom log and the denuded floor. Upon that intruding hand the bowie-knife of Demorest descended like a flash of lightning. There was no outcry. Even in that supreme moment Demorest felt a pang of admiration for the stoicism of the unseen trespasser. But the maimed hand was quickly withdrawn, and as quickly Demorest rushed {{to the door and}} dashed into the outer darkness.|$|E
5000|$|The George Washington Hotel in New York City's Gramercy Park District {{was opened}} in 1928. At {{different}} times {{it has been}} used both as a brothel and as a <b>boot-legging</b> house during Prohibition. In 1939 the poet W. H. Auden stayed at the hotel, calling it [...] "the nicest hotel in town", another famous resident was writer Christopher Isherwood. In the 1980s, the hotel was raided by the police. For a period of time the building was in receivership; its demolition was prevented by support from a local historical society. The hotel was later purchased at auction, and space was leased to not-for-profit Educational Housing Serviceshttp://studenthousing.org in the mid-90s during the city's rebirth. Much of the space was under sublease to the School of Visual Arts except for apartments still occupied by original (non-student) tenants who pay stabilized rent, and who are still protected under NYC rent laws. SVA broke sublease and built a new dorm on 24th street in mid 2016.|$|R
50|$|Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) and Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) are two New Yorkers in 1932 {{from two}} {{different}} worlds. Ray is a small-time hustler and petty thief, and Claude, an honest, yet often selfish minded man, has just been accepted for {{a job as a}} bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. They are both at a club called Spanky's when Ray picks Claude as his mark to pick-pocket. They both end up in the bad graces of the club's owner Spanky (Rick James), and Ray arranges for himself and Claude to do some <b>boot-legging</b> to pay off their debt, heading down south in order to buy a carload of Mississippi 'hooch'. Before they can get back to New York, a man named Winston Hancock (Clarence Williams III), who swindled Ray in a card game, is murdered outside of a juke joint by the town's sheriff, Warren Pike (Ned Vaughn), who frames Ray and Claude for the murder.

I haven't no ideas of cultivation and intrigue. I'm a plain citizen and I need the job. I've killed seven men,' says Bill; 'I've got nine children; I've been a good Republican ever since the first of May; I can't read nor write, and I see no reason why I ain't illegible for the office. And I think your partner, Mr. Tucker,' goes on Bill, 'is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment. I will give you preliminary,' says Bill, '$1,000 for drinks, bribes and carfare in Washington. If you land the job I will pay you $1,000 more, cash down, and guarantee you impunity in <b>boot-legging</b> whiskey for twelve months. Are you patriotic to the West enough to help me put this thing through the Whitewashed Wigwam of the Great Father of the most eastern flag station of the Pennsylvania Railroad?' says Bill.|$|R
5000|$|George Anderson {{also known}} as George [...] "Dutch" [...] Anderson was an early Prohibition-era gang {{criminal}} in the mid-1920s. Anderson was born Ivan Dahl von Teler to a wealthy Danish family circa 1880, graduated from the universities of Heidelberg and Uppsala, and emigrated to the United States around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Anderson, along with Gerald Chapman (Americaâ€™s first Public Enemy Number One), operated a Prohibition-era gang during the late 1910s until the mid-1920s. After settling in New York City, he and his associates successfully robbed a U.S. Mail truck of $2.4 million in cash, stocks, bonds, and jewelry, an act that was at the time the largest robbery in U.S. history and became known as the [...] "Great Post Office Robbery of 1921." [...] After even more robberies, Anderson and Chapman were finally captured, tried, and sentenced to 25 years in prison, to be served at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. However, after serving a mere seven months Anderson and Chapman both escaped. Chapman was captured shortly after his escape and while a fugitive Anderson swore revenge. In Indiana he killed a key prosecution witness from Chapman's trial and drew further attention by passing poor-quality counterfeit currency in Michigan. Ultimately, Anderson was arrested, made a short-lived escape, and was killed in a police shootout while trying to flee on October 31, 1925. Anderson's remarkable criminal infamy included burglary, armed robbery, <b>boot-legging,</b> prison escape, counterfeiting, and murder.|$|R

40|$|The Bahamas were annexed by the Crown in 1629 but, for a century, {{there was}} no {{progressive}} settlement, Early {{in the eighteenth century}} the island s were abandoned to the nefarious activities of pirates. Government reverted t o the Crown in 1718 and ordered development began. Education of the children of the colonists was begun in 1734 by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel but State aid was given as early as 1746. Little progress was made for a century but the advent of loyalists from the American Colonies in 1784 had a beneficial influence. With the need f o r educating the liberated slaves a Board of Education was appointed in 1836. There ensued a denominational struggle for control which was resolved by removing the schools from the control of all the churches. At the same time an Inspector was appointed but progress was hindered by lack of teachers and money and by the geographical nature of the colony. Blockade-running during the American Civil war made more money available and a series of inspectors and teachers was appointed from England. Slow but steady progress was effected, the " British Schools" being adopted as a model, Compulsory attendance became universal in 1886 but the number of schools remained totally in sufficient until 1920. Income from <b>boot-legging</b> during American prohibition resulted in rapid expansion both in the number of primary schools and in the provision of secondary education for negroes. The last twenty years have witnessed improvement in teachers' qualifications and the provision of scholarships for higher education. The out islands are far behind Nassau in educational facilities which are uncoordinated in the colony as a whole. Introductory chapters furnish a background of general history and of conditions in the colony at present. Final chapter applies the lessons of history to educational policy for the future...|$|R
