Two minutes silence is followed by The Last Post and a reading. Representatives {{of the student body}} (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head <b>Boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>Girl)</b> and of the Old Malvernian Society then place wreaths at the foot of St. George. A memorial service follows in the chapel for the more than 400 Malvernians who lost their lives in the Great War.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{bullying}} is [...] "any bullying behaviour, whether {{physical or}} non-physical, {{that is based}} on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by <b>boys</b> <b>or</b> <b>girls</b> towards other <b>boys</b> <b>or</b> <b>girls</b> – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{confusion}} arises {{here because}} the bather is not asked if the puppy he is holding is a male, but rather if either is a male. If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is not male, B must be male, and vice versa. This restriction is introduced {{by the way the}} question is structured and is easily overlookedmisleading people to the erroneous answer of 50%. See <b>Boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>Girl</b> paradox for solution details.|$|E
25|$|Epaulettes : epaulettes are {{compulsory}} for {{all students}} of RUMC. The epaulettes of School section (grades 6-10) and College section (grades 11-12) are red and green respectively. Students of grade 6 start their academic career in RUMC with single golden stripe and end their grade 10 with five golden stripes in their red epaulettes while eleventh graders start with a golden stripe and end grade 12 with two golden stripes in their green epaulettes. Eppaulettes marked with stars and stripes are provided to the College Captain (Head <b>Boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>Girl</b> equivalent), prefects and other appointment holders.|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a <b>boy</b> (<b>or</b> <b>girl)</b> with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E

25|$|H. B. Tennison {{was born}} February 12, 1930. He was 6feet, 3inches tall and weighed 130pounds. He was {{extremely}} shy and was said by his sister, Mrs. Alys Jo Daniel, {{that he had}} a sunny disposition and that she does not remember him being a moody person. Tennison did not have many <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> companions. He played the trombone in the Arkansas High School band with Booker, but they were not friends. He was very fond of comic books and loved listening to radio plays, especially quiz programs. He used to work as a part-time usher at the Paramount theater (now the Perot) in downtown Texarkana. Though he was an average student and was not interested in school work, he graduated in June 1948. After high school, he traveled for his father's Memphis firm, Tennison Bros. Inc., which manufactured sheet metal products. Tennison swallowed poison and died on November 4, 1948. A private funeral consisting of family and close friends was held at his family's home on Hickory street Saturday, November 6 at 4 p.m. He is buried in Hillcrest Cemetery on US Highway 67 West.|$|E
25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see <b>Boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> paradox.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{was raised}} as a Christian and {{identified}} herself as such during her childhood and early adult life. Some recent quotes such as [...] "You are all stardust. You couldn’t {{be here if}} stars hadn’t exploded... So forget Jesus. Stars died so you can live", and social media content have led to questions surrounding her religious beliefs. Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of [...] "Milky Milky Milk" [...] (2015). Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother when she was 14, and has said: [...] "I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open." [...] In June 2015, Time reported that she also identifies as gender fluid. She was quoted as stating she [...] " [...] relate to being <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>girl,</b> and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl." [...] Cyrus is {{a supporter of the}} LGBT community, and is often vocal about her beliefs on the topic. Her song [...] "My Heart Beats For Love" [...] (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends, while she has since claimed that London is her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene. Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage. She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to [...] "fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations". Cyrus is open about her recreational use of cannabis. She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was [...] "the best drug on earth" [...] and called it, along with MDMA, a [...] "happy drug". While accepting the Best Video award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked {{what appeared to be a}} joint on stage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the program in the United States. In a 2014 interview with W, Cyrus stated [...] "I love weed" [...] and [...] "I just love getting stoned." ...|$|E

[...] He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait. [...] He would wait here, not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days. [...] While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him. [...] If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law.|$|E
2500|$|Iyers are {{initiated}} into rituals at {{the time}} of birth. In ancient times, rituals used to be performed when the baby was being separated from mother's umbilical cord. This ceremony is known as Jātakarma. However, this practice is no longer observed. At birth, a horoscope is made for the child based on the position of the stars. The child is then given a ritual name. On the child's birthday, a ritual is performed to ensure longevity. This ritual is known as Ayushya Homam. [...] This ceremony is held on the child's birthday reckoned as per the Tamil calendar based on the position of the [...] nakshatras or stars and not the Gregorian calendar. The child's first birthday is the most important and is the time when the baby is formally initiated by piercing the ears of the <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>girl.</b> From that day onwards a girl is expected to wear earrings.|$|E
