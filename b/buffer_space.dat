However, it creates differential delay whereby each path that is created, represented by a VT has a different propagational delay across the network. The difference in these delays is called [...] "differential delay" [...] (D). The major problem with differential delay is the requirement for high speed buffers at the receiving node to store incoming information while all paths converge. This <b>buffer</b> <b>space,</b> (B) can be equated to the bandwidth delay product such that B = n * D. Thus, each Virtually Concatenated connection requires B bits of <b>buffer</b> <b>space.</b> This need for <b>buffer</b> <b>space</b> eventually increases the network cost, so {{it is very important to}} select paths that minimize the differential delay, which is directly proportional to the <b>buffer</b> <b>space</b> required.|$|E

But L4 flow control works between a pair of CPorts (potentially multiple hops apart) and aims to isolate connections from one another ("virtual wire" [...] analogy). In contrast, L2 flow control is per-hop and avoids basic loss of data {{due to lack of}} receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

For continuous service rates, sample uniformly from the simplex {r≥0:r1+r2+...+rn≤R}.This {{can be done by}} generating n-1 independent uniform random variables U1,...,Un-1on 0,R, ordering them so that U(1)≤...≤U(n-1), setting U(0)=0 and U(n)=R, and finally setting rk=U(k)-U(k-1), k = 1,...,n.

40|$|A large fixed {{number of}} <b>buffer</b> <b>spaces</b> is given. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} allocating these spaces among the nodes of a tandem of last-come-first-served queues with general service time distributions and Poisson external arrivals so as to optimize some performance criterion associated with the time to buffer overflow, such as maximizing its mean or maximizing the probability that it exceeds some value. Consider the following rule of thumb: allocate the <b>buffer</b> <b>spaces</b> in inverse proportion to the logarithms of the effective service rates at the nodes. Here effective service rate denotes {{the ratio of the}} service rate to the stationary arrival rate. We prove that this rule of thumb achieves a nearly optimal buffer allocation under the assumption that the service time distributions satisfy an exponential tail condition. This problem has been studied earlier in the context of Jackson networks, where it was shown that the same rule of thumb achieves an allocation that is close to optimal. The technique of proof here is similar, but there are important differences. Both Jackson networks and the LCFS tandems considered here are product form networks (with infinite buffers). Optimism should lead us to expect that the near optimality of this rule of thumb holds much more generally for product-form networks, but this remains a conjecture at present...|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} L2 {{is the ability}} for an L2 {{transmitter}} to know whether there is <b>buffer</b> <b>space</b> for the data frame at the receiving end. This again relies on L2 control frames (AFC) which allow a receiver to tell the peer's transmitter how much <b>buffer</b> <b>space</b> is available. This allows the receiver to pause the transmitter if needed, thus avoiding receive buffer overflow. Control frames are unaffected by L2 flow control: they can be sent {{at any time and}} the L2 receiver is expected to process these at the speed at which they arrive.|$|E

50|$|CPorts {{also contain}} state {{variables}} {{that can be}} used to track how much <b>buffer</b> <b>space</b> the peer or connected CPort has. This is used to prevent the situation whereby a CPort sends segments to a CPort which has insufficient <b>buffer</b> <b>space</b> to hold the data, thus leading to stalled data traffic. Unless resolved fast, this traffic jam at the destination quickly grows into a network-wide gridlock. This is highly undesirable as it can greatly affect network performance for all users or, worse, can lead to deadlock situations. The described L4 mechanism is known as end-to-end flow control (E2E FC) because it involves the endpoints of a connection.|$|E

A method for statistically reserving link <b>buffers</b> <b>space</b> to virtual circuits sharing a transmission resource in ATM networks is proposed.

Effective network performance improvements has been observed by simulating real system behaviour in presence of homogeneous sources traffic for ditferent burstiness values.

In all three cases, the variable is a parameter of the distribution of service times at one of the queues. The derivative estimators considered are very simple and flexible, and they easily lend themselves to analysis of unbiasedness. Unlike most of the established SPA estimators, the present ones are not based on the computation of hazard rates...|$|R
50|$|Historically, these {{highlands}} {{have been}} used by lowland empires as reserves of resources (including slaves), and as <b>buffer</b> <b>spaces</b> between their domains. In 2009, political scientist James Scott argued that there is a unity across the Massif - which he calls Zomia - regarding political forms of domination and subordination, which bonds the fates of the peoples dwelling there, virtually all of whom had taken refuge there to avoid being integrated into a more powerful state, or even allowing the very appearance of a state-like structure within their own societies. This argument had also been made, in a slightly different manner, by Dutch social scientist Willem van Schendel in 2002. Van Schendel had coined the term Zomia, but its geographic coverage differs significantly from Scott's.|$|R

This work presents several mixed integer programming approaches to optimize the buffer allocation in ow lines with stochastic processing times. Sampling is used to represent the random processing times. The objective is to minimize the overall number of <b>buffer</b> <b>spaces</b> obtaining at least a given goal production rate.

For any given sequence, a limited equal buffer size is considered in computing job completion times. The scheduling objective is to minimize mean job flowtime.

The introduction of the buffer area shared by all machines of the system leads to an increase of production rate as demonstrated by simulation experiments.

Using this model we iteratively solve for the whole network. The technique is illustrated first for a simple system with tandem queues, and then for more complex systems. The method is compared with exact solutions or simulations, and found to be reasonably accurate. The method is easily implemented using standard software for closed queueing networks.

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of {{frameworks}} were proposed to extend interface theory to the domains of single-processor and distributed real-time systems. This paper unifies some of these approaches and proves properties like refinement and independent implementability. We also explicitly state the requirements to a framework for these properties to be fulfilled. Further, a new notion of adaptive interfaces is introduced that supports the design by providing mechanisms for propagating system constraints, such as (end-to-end) delays, available computing and communication resources, <b>buffer</b> <b>spaces,</b> and energy. Guarantees and assumptions on interfaces are not any longer static but adapt according to the system environment.

40|$|The optimal {{design of}} real-life systems modeled as finite {{queueing}} networks {{is a difficult}} stochastic optimization problem. Besides being non-linear and including integer variables, different objectives often conflict with each other. For example, one conflicting pair of objectives includes first minimizing {{the overall number of}} buffers and then maximizing throughput. In this paper, we present an original methodology to solve a buffer allocation and throughput trade-off problem in single server general queueing networks. An approximation of the complete set of all best solutions, known as the Pareto optimal or non-inferior set, is derived by a special version of a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The applied MOGA proves to be suitable for the stochastic trade-off problem. A comprehensive set of computational results attest to the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed methodology. We were able to show from a medium-sized mixed network that the squared coefficient of service time variation {{plays an important role in}} buffer allocation, which indicates the importance of using a general service model. Moreover, after the analysis of the solutions in the decision variable space, we confirm that the buffer allocation is highly dependent on the target throughput, which sometimes can be sacrificed in favor of using fewer of the usually expensive <b>buffer</b> <b>spaces.</b> <b>Buffer</b> allocation Queueing networks Optimization Genetic algorithms...|$|R
