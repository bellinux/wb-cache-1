5|$|During British Mandate rule in Palestine, al-Birwa {{was home}} to local power brokers, who {{mediated}} disputes in neighboring villages. Al-Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936–1939 revolt against British rule. By the 1940s, many of the village's agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt, and shifted to labor jobs in nearby cities, such as Haifa. However, {{the majority of the}} residents—men and women—continued to engage in farming, selling their olives, grains and other crops in the markets of Acre. Al-Birwa was captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> in early June 1948, after which its local militia recaptured the village. Al-Birwa was then permanently occupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> in late June. Afterward, its inhabitants, including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, fled to nearby villages or Lebanon. The Jewish communities of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on al-Birwa's lands in 1949 and 1950, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
25|$|Tasers {{were first}} used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Defense Force <b>by</b> <b>the</b> former special counter-terror unit Force 100 in 2004. The unit was disbanded in 2006. Tasers are {{expected}} to re-enter operational use <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Defense Forces in the near future.|$|R

50|$|The {{population}} in the 1967 census conducted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> authorities was 1,149. In 1978, Husan had a total land area of 7,134 dunams. Since the establishment of Betar Illit and land expropriations <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Defense Forces, <b>the</b> town has been downsized to 1,425 dunams.|$|R
5|$|At night, A Syrian force {{attempted}} to surround the Israelis by crossing the Jordan River {{to the north}} of the Sea of Galilee, but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded. This was spotted and reported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> at Tabgha, and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children, elderly and sick, as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the Poria-Alumot region. In the panic of surprise, many men also tried to flee the frontal villages, but blockposts were set up near Afula and Yavne'el by the Military Police Service's northern command, under Yosef Pressman, who personally stopped buses and allowed only the women and children to proceed to safety.|$|E
5|$|Sharon ordered Matt to push northward to Serabaeum again, where paratroopers of the 81st Battalion were occupying defenses. The attack failed once more, and Sharon now sent Reshef on Matt's left flank. Using a {{battalion}} of some thirty tanks with mechanized infantry, Reshef used his superior maneuverability to flank the Egyptian position. There was heavy, close-quarter fighting in the trenches, and extra units were brought up against the Orcha position. The paratroopers reported their defenses to have been penetrated during the afternoon, and they later withdrew after detonating the bridges over the Sweetwater Canal at Serabaeum. The Israelis captured Egyptian positions in the area, and discovered that Orcha Hill contained a major Egyptian radio intercept station. The capture of Orcha caused the collapse of Egyptian defenses in the area; the paratroopers pulled back {{to the village of}} Ain Ghasin five kilometres north, and Azmy ordered the 89th Battalion to withdraw to the adjacent Touscan strong point, abandoning the ramparts at Serabaeum. These were occupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> which they used to fire on Egyptian positions across the canal. The Egyptians hastily organised defenses at Touscan. This new line of defenses was just over 12 kilometres south of Ismailia.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, The Guardian {{newspaper}} reported that President Bush had vetoed a plan developed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to bomb Iran's nuclear sites. The precise {{motivation for the}} veto was not explored.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in the mid-1960s, at {{the request}} of Israel, Dassault Aviation began {{developing}} the Mirage 5, a fair-weather, ground-attack version of the Mirage III. Following the suggestions made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> advanced avionics located behind the cockpit were removed, allowing the aircraft to increase its fuel-carrying capacity while reducing maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{majority}} of Beersheba's civilian population had fled {{as a result of}} Israeli air strikes, about 350 still lived there {{at the time of the}} battle, and were expelled to Gaza in the aftermath. Some were allegedly shot <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> Some of the estimated 120 Egyptian soldiers taken prisoner were also allegedly killed. The rest were mostly put to work cleaning the streets following the battle.|$|E

25|$|Zubeidi's father, Muhammad, {{had been}} an English teacher, but was {{prevented}} from teaching <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> after {{he was convicted of}} Fatah membership in the late 1960s. He worked instead as a labourer in an Israeli iron foundry, did some private teaching on the side, and became a peace activist. The first Israeli Zubeidi had ever met was the soldier who came to take away his father for alleged membership of Fatah. His father died of cancer, leaving Zubeidi's mother Samira to raise their eight children alone.|$|E
25|$|According to an Egyptian {{telegram}} intercepted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> {{the forces}} {{in what would}} become the Fallujah Pocket were ordered to move to Beersheba, not knowing of the Israeli plan to take the town. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion did not believe in the IDF's ability to take Beersheba in such a short time, but the telegram significantly increased the town's importance in his eyes, and he worked to delay the United Nations-imposed ceasefire as much as possible so that it could be taken.|$|E
25|$|July 1, 1967: An Egyptian {{commando}} {{force from}} Port Fuad moves south and takes up {{a position at}} Ras el 'Ish, located 10 miles south of Port Said on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal, an area controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> since the ceasefire on June 9, 1967. An Israeli armored infantry company attacks the Egyptian force. The Israeli company drives off the Egyptians but loses 1 dead and 13 wounded. However, another source claims that an Israeli attack on Port Fuad was repulsed.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Syria was {{involved}} in the Arab-Israeli War, aligning with the other local Arab states who wanted to destroy the state of Israel. The Syrian army entered northern Palestine but, after bitter fighting, was gradually driven back to the Golan Heights <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> An armistice was agreed in July 1949. A demilitarized zone under UN supervision was established; the status of these territories proved a stumbling-block for all future Syrian-Israeli negotiations. It was during this period that many Syrian Jews, who faced growing persecution and fled Syria as part of Jewish exodus from Arab countries.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{reportedly}} used {{electronic warfare}} {{to take over}} Syrian air-defenses and feed them a false sky-picture, for the entire {{period of time that}} the Israeli fighter jets needed to cross Syria, bomb their target and return. This technology which neutralized Syrian radars may be similar to the Suter airborne network attack system. This would make it possible to feed enemy radar emitters with false targets, and even directly manipulate enemy sensors. In May 2008, a report in IEEE Spectrum cited European sources claiming that the Syrian air defense network had been deactivated by a secret built-in kill switch activated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout May 1948, Egypt's main force {{advanced}} {{north to}} the Ad Halom bridge, where it halted after the Israeli Operation Pleshet on June 2–3. Another wing of the Egyptian military positioned itself on the Majdal – Bayt Jibrin road and cut off the Israeli-held northern Negev {{from the rest of}} the country. Along its main advance path, Egypt succeeded in taking Nitzanim, and Yad Mordechai and Kfar Darom were evacuated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> During this period, numerous Jewish villages in the Negev were subject to constant Egyptian air and artillery harassment, Be'erot Yitzhak being one of them, suffering the hits of approximately 5,000 shells.|$|E

50|$|In addition, between 80,000 and 110,000 Syrians {{fled the}} Golan Heights, of which about 20,000 {{were from the}} city of Quneitra.

25|$|Assad used {{terrorism}} and intimidation {{to extend his}} control over Lebanon. Jumblatt died in a 1977 assassination allegedly ordered by Syria; in 1982, Syrian agents assassinated Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel (who was helped to power <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> during the 1982 Lebanon War). Jumblatt and Gemayel had resisted Assad's attempts to dominate Lebanon. Assad caused {{the failure of the}} 1983 Lebanon–Israel agreement, and by proxy guerrilla warfare forced the Israeli Defense Forces to withdraw to southern Lebanon in 1985. Terrorism against Palestinians and Jordanian targets during the mid-1980s thwarted the rapprochement between King Hussein of Jordan and the PLO, slowing Jordanian–Israeli cooperation in the West Bank.|$|E
25|$|Abbas' PLF {{continued}} to receive Arafat's endorsement, and in 1990 President George H. W. Bush rescinded his earlier {{recognition of the}} PLO for Arafat's refusal to condemn a PLF attack. (In 1990 he masterminded a plot to attack Israeli beaches with 17 terrorists using hang gliders but they were intercepted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> who killed four of them.) In 1990 Abbas went into hiding and the U.S. issued a warrant for his arrest with an offer of $250,000 reward for his capture, this was withdrawn in 1992 with the presidency of Bill Clinton and his administrations work towards the Oslo Accords. In 1990 Libya withdrew their support of the PLF, leaving Iraq as the only nation state actor supporting Abbas.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} final stage of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War started on October 15, 1948, when Israel {{launched}} Operation Yoav on the southern front. While the Israelis made significant tactical and strategic gains in Operation Yoav, the political situation changed little and Egypt was still dragging its feet on proposed armistice talks. Operation Horev was therefore launched in the south with the final aim of expelling all Egyptian forces from Israel. The main thrust of the operation was planned {{to be in the}} south and east of the southern front, with the initial aim of cutting the eastern wing of the Egyptian army off from the bulk of its forces in Palestine. It was the largest operation launched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> during the 1948 Palestine War.|$|E
