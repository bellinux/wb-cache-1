In this paper, we examine the effects of these policies on <b>broad</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> conditions, explicitly taking into account that policy was endogenously determined in response to prevailing financial market and economic conditions. We find that the Fed was more likely to initiate or expand new programs when financial market conditions were tighter than usual and economic conditions deteriorating.

40|$|During {{the first}} half of this decade, the belief that new {{financial}} products would adequately shield investors from risk encouraged financial flows to less creditworthy households and businesses. By late 2006, U.

Meanwhile, rising subprime mortgage defaults led investors to abandon their sanguine beliefs about the risk of many mortgage and nonmortgage products.; The backdrop for these events was a period of macroeconomic stability that fed complacency about risk. This relatively benign economic environment, when combined with the new, structured financial products, increased financial flows to nonprime mortgage and business borrowers.

30|$|The {{thesis on}} {{absolute}} comparative advantage {{according to which}} banks benefit from economies of scale resulting from carrying out in a professional manner activities of selection and control of creditors. In this way, the techniques adopted by intermediaries allow obtaining benefits from the information on creditors that outweigh the costs of screening and monitoring. Other lenders in the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> (venture capital, investment funds) {{are not able to}} reach a ‘critical mass of customers’ capable of achieving the same economies of scale. Therefore, in the credit market, the cost of reducing information asymmetries between the lender and borrower is lower compared to the <b>broader</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> In this case, the standardized assessment models of creditworthiness allow banks to gain a competitive advantage from the very first contact with the customer. Therefore, according to this theoretical approach, even within individual credit relationships based on single financing transactions but not intended to open up the business to the bank, the intermediary has a cost advantage over other lenders. These relationships are called transaction banking or arm’s length financing (Boyd and Prescott 1986; Ramakrishnan and Thakor 1984; Diamond 1984).|$|R
40|$|Pricing {{contingent}} {{claims on}} power presents numerous challenges due to (1) the unique behavior of power prices, and (2) time-dependent variations in prices. We propose {{and implement a}} model in which the spot price of power {{is a function of}} two state variables: demand (load) and fuel price. In this model, any power derivative price must satisfy a PDE with boundary conditions that reflect capacity limits and the non-linear relation between load and the spot price of power. Moreover, since power is non-storable and demand is not a traded asset, the power derivative price embeds a market price of risk. Using inverse problem techniques and power forward prices from the PJM market, we solve for this market price of risk function. During 1999 - 2001, the upward bias in the forward price was as large as $ 50 /MWh for some days in July. By 2005, the largest estimated upward bias had fallen to $ 19 /MWh. These large biases are plausibly due to the extreme right skewness of power prices; this induces left skewness in the payoff to short forward positions, and a large risk premium is required to induce traders to sell power forwards.

In addition, market participants can use futures prices as a reference for what the price of the commodity is expected to be in the future, thus futures markets can also be used as a price discovery tool. Over the years, futures markets have been through several changes, generally making them more efficient and effective for hedging and price discovery.

The implication, and our central hypothesis, is thus that increased tightness in the interbank market for liquidity is associated with an increase in the volume of more liquid assets relative to that of less liquid assets. Prices should also fall across the board, but not differentially so across assets with different “liquidity levels. ” We confirm these hypotheses on the CRSP universe of stocks using the three month Libor-OIS and TED spreads as measures of tightness in the interbank market. – All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

This reflects the well known trade-offs between the macro and micro dimensions of data collection and dissemination. It is possible, however, to adapt existing statistical reporting frameworks in ways that would facilitate an analysis of exposures and build-ups of risk over time at the aggregate (sectoral) level. To do so would move us significantly in the direction of constructing the ideal global risk map. It would also help us sidestep the complex legal challenges surrounding the sharing or dissemination of firm-level data, and it would support a two-step approach to systemic risk monitoring.

40|$|Abstract. Pricing {{contingent}} {{claims on}} power presents numerous chal-lenges due to (1) the nonlinearity of power price processes, and (2) time-dependent variations in prices.

In this model, any power derivative price must satisfy a PDE with boundary conditions that reflect capacity limits and the non-linear relation between load and the spot price of power. Moreover, since power is non-storable and demand is not a traded asset, the power derivative price embeds a market price of risk.

40|$|Analysts of {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis often refer {{to the role of}} asset "fire sales" in depleting the balance sheets of financial institutions and aggravating the fragility of the financial system. The term "fire sale" has been around since the nineteenth century to describe firms selling smoke-damaged merchandise at cut-rate prices {{in the aftermath of a}} fire. But what are fire sales in <b>broad</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> with hundreds of participants? As we suggested in a 1992 paper, a fire sale is essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated price. The asset sale is forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay creditors without selling assets. The price is dislocated because the highest potential bidders are typically involved in a similar activity as the seller, and are therefore themselves indebted and cannot borrow more to buy the asset. Indeed, rather than bidding for the asset, they might be selling similar assets themselves. Assets are then bought by nonspecialists who, knowing that they have less expertise with the assets in question, are only willing to buy at valuations that are much lower. In this paper, we selectively review some of the research on fire sales, emphasizing both concepts and supporting evidence. We begin by describing our 1992 model of fire sales and the related findings in empirical corporate finance. We then show that models of fire sales can account for several related phenomena during the recent financial crisis, including the contraction of the banking system and the failures of arbitrage in <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> exemplified by historically unprecedented differences in prices of very similar securities. We then link fire sales to macroeconomics by discussing how such dislocations of security prices and the reduction in balance sheets of banks can reduce investment and output. Finally, we consider how the concept of fire sales can help us think about government interventions in <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> including the evidently successful Federal Reserve interventions in 2009. Fire sales are surely not the whole story of the financial crisis, but they are a phenomenon that binds together many elements of the crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|Natural catastrophes {{and global}} {{reinsurance}} – exploring the linkages 1 Natural disasters resulting in significant losses {{have become more}} frequent in recent decades, with 2011 being the costliest year in history. This feature explores how risk is transferred within and beyond the global insurance sector and assesses the financial linkages that arise in the process. In particular, retrocession and securitisation allow for risk-sharing with other financial institutions and the <b>broader</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> While {{the fact that most}} risk is retained within the global insurance market makes these linkages appear small, they warrant attention due to their potential ramifications and the dependencies they introduce. JEL classification: G 22, L 22, Q 54. The physical destruction caused by severe natural catastrophes triggers a series of adverse effects. Damaged production facilities, shattered transportation infrastructure and business interruption produce both direct losses and indirect macroeconomic costs in the form of foregone output (von Peter et al (2012)). Beyond these economic costs are enormous human suffering and a host of longerterm socioeconomic consequences, documented by the World Bank and United Nations (2010). By examining catastrophe-related losses over the past three decades, this special feature explores the linkages that arise in the transfer of risk from policyholders {{all the way to the}} ultimate bearer of risk. It describes the contracts and premiums exchanged for protection, and the way reinsurers diversify and retain risks on their balance sheets. In so doing, the feature traces how losses cascade through the system when large natural disasters occur. Losses from insured property and infrastructure first affect primary insurers, who in turn rely on reinsurers to absorb peak risks – low-probability, high-impact events. Reinsurers, in turn, use their balance sheets and, to a lesser extent, retrocession and securitisation arrangements, to manage peak risks across time and space. 2 1...|$|R

By way of empirical examples in the cash, bond and options an futures markets, it is demonstrated that scientifically a much <b>broader</b> concept of <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> risk is needed. This new risk concept should allow for the measurement of the degree of market efficiency, which is time and horizon dependent. The proposed definition of <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> risk is a time - frequency distribution function P, where the shape of the function is determined not only by the second-order moments σ, differentiated by the investment asset return categorizations ω, but also of the length investment horizons, or maturities of the investment securities τ, and of the time period t. In other words, the new concept of financial risk P(ω,τ,t) should be able to account for both LT and ST nonlinear time dependence and for strict non- stationarity to be empirically compatible and thus scientifically acceptable. Such a time - frequency distribution P(ω,τ,t) can be measured and identified by modern forms of time - frequency signal processing analysis, like windowed Fourier and wavelet multiresolution analysis. market efficiency, degrees of, measurement, stable distributions, time-varying distibutions, multiresolution analysis...|$|R
40|$|The global {{expansion}} is losing speed {{in the face}} of a major financial crisis. The slowdown has been greatest in the advanced economies, particularly in the United States, where the housing market correction continues to exacerbate financial stress. The emerging and developing economies have so far been less affected by <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> turbulence and have continued to grow at a rapid pace, led by China and India, although activity is beginning to moderate in some countries. In the baseline, the U. S. economy will tip into a mild recession in 2008 as a result of mutually reinforcing housing and <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> cycles, with only a gradual recovery in 2009, reflecting the time needed to resolve underlying balance sheet strains. Activity in the other advanced economies will be sluggish in both 2008 and 2009 {{in the face of}} trade and financial spillovers. Growth in the emerging and developing economies is also projected to slow, although it should remain above long-term trends in all regions. Risks to the global projections are tilted to the downside, especially those related to the possibility of a full-blown credit crunch, while emerging and developing economies will not be insulated from a serious downturn in the advanced economies. Against this background, policymakers in the advanced economies must continue to grapple with the task of restoring stability to housing and <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> while addressing downside risks to growth, without jeopardizing inflation performance or longer-term policy goals. Many emerging and developing economies still face the challenge of avoiding overheating or any buildup in vulnerabilities, but policymakers should be ready to respond judiciously to a deteriorating external environment. burgeoning financial crisis that has shaken the advanced economies and the rising tide of the rapidly globalizing emerging economies. Overall, global GDP measured at purchasing-power-parity weights is estimated to have increased 4. 9 percent in 2007 —well above trend for the fourth consecutive year (Table 1. 1 and Figure 1. 1). � Following a stronger-than-expected third quarter, activity in the advanced economies decelerated quite sharply toward the end of the year, particularly in the United States, as the debacle in the U. S. subprime mortgage market had knock-on effects across a <b>broad</b> range of <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> and institution...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{interaction}} effect between cross sectional variation in individual stock investor sentiment and a <b>broad</b> set of <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> anomalies. An average anomaly strategy earns higher (lower) 3 -factor alpha conditioned on higher (lower) individual stock investor sentiment. This is mainly {{driven by the}} very negative alpha of the high sentiment conditioned short leg of each anomaly. Consequently, buying the low sentiment long leg of each anomaly and shorting the high sentiment short leg of each anomaly yields 0. 434 % to 0. 474 % more in monthly three-factor alpha than an unconditional anomaly strategy on average. In contrast, buying the high sentiment long leg of each anomaly and shorting the low sentiment short leg of each anomaly result in no alpha on average. ^ I present novel evidence that the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> anomalies are mispricings: firms act as arbitrageurs and tend to issue shares {{if they are in}} the short leg of an anomaly. In contrast, firms tend to repurchase shares and/or pay cash dividends if they are in the long leg of an anomaly. Individual stock investor sentiment exaggerates these effects. In particular, firms in the high sentiment short leg of anomalies trade equity ownership for cash or services (e. g. issuance of shares) while firms in the low sentiment long leg of anomalies pay or trade cash for equity ownership (e. g. cash dividends). The difference, measured using the Daniel and Titman (2006) composite issuance measure, is on average 0. 535 % to 0. 632 % per month. This is stronger than the unconditional effect by 0. 132 % to 0. 351 % per month. ...|$|R
