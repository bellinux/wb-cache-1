As the Scots Greys approached, prisoner lookouts at the camp spotted the dragoons when they moved through Onderstepoort. As word spread through the camp, the British prisoners over-powered the guards, mostly men either too old or too young to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> commando, pushed {{their way out of}} confinement to meet with the Scots Greys. Although the camp guards were easily overcome, and most likely unknown to the British forces and prisoners, Koos de la Rey and his men were positioned to try and prevent the rescue of the British prisoners. De la Rey ordered warning shells fired, trying to keep the prisoners in their prison camp. Faced with the approaching Scots Greys and the prisoners, De la Rey opted to not do more and instead ordered a retreat rather than fight a battle over the prison camp.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men {{under the command of}} Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the {{surrounding}} country to intercept messengers who might <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> horseback. [...] This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. [...] The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston. [...] A well-known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, [...] "Have you heard anything about when the regulars are coming out?" [...] upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.|$|E
500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} aesthete is immediacy. In Either/Or, there are several levels of immediacy explored, ranging from unrefined to refined. Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments {{that do not require}} effort or personal cultivation (e.g. alcohol, drugs, casual sex, sloth, etc.) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically. The [...] "theory" [...] of social prudence given in Crop Rotation is an example of refined immediacy. Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies, enjoyments are contemplated and [...] "cultivated" [...] for maximum pleasure. However, both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life, and do not accept the responsibility to change it. If things go wrong, the aesthete simply blames existence, rather than one's self, assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless. Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to Either/Or, Stages on Life's Way, [...] "The esthetic sphere is the sphere of immediacy, the ethical the sphere of requirement (and this requirement is so infinite that the individual always goes bankrupt), the religious the sphere of fulfillment, but, please note, not a fulfillment such as when one fills an alms box or a sack with gold, for repentance has specifically created a boundless space, and as a consequence the religious contradiction: simultaneously to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> 70,000 fathoms of water and yet be joyful. Just as the ethical sphere is a passageway-which one nevertheless does not pass through once and for all-just as repentance is its expression, so repentance is the most dialectical. No wonder, then, that one fears it, for if one gives it a finger it takes the whole hand. Just as Jehovah in the Old Testament visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the latest generations, so repentance goes backward, continually presupposing the object of its investigation. In repentance there is the impulse of the motion, and therefore everything is reversed. This impulse signifies precisely the difference between the esthetic and the religious as the difference between the external and the internal."

2500|$|Life for Italians under German {{occupation}} was hard, {{especially in}} Rome. Rome's citizens by 1943 had {{grown tired of}} the war and upon Italy signing an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, Rome's citizens took to the streets chanting [...] "Viva la pace!" [...] ("Long live the peace!), but within hours German forces raided the city and attacked anti-Fascists, royalists and Jews. Roman citizens were harassed by German soldiers to provide them food and fuel and German authorities would arrest all opposition and many were sent into forced labor. Rome's citizens upon being liberated reported that {{during the first week of}} German occupation of Rome, crimes against Italian citizens took place as German soldiers looted stores and robbed Roman citizens at gunpoint. Martial law was imposed on Rome by German authorities requiring all citizens to obey a curfew forbidding people to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the street after 9 p.m. During winter of 1943, Rome's citizens were denied access to sufficient food, firewood and coal which was taken by German authorities to be given to German soldiers housed in occupied hotels. These actions left Rome's citizens to live in the harsh cold and on the verge of starvation. German authorities began arresting able-bodied Roman men to be conscripted into forced labour. On 4 June 1944, the German occupation of Rome came to an end as German forces retreated as the Allies advanced.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Tinker, a 30-year veteran attorney, was {{assigned}} to defend Saldívar. Tinker was {{called one of the}} best criminal defense lawyers in the state of Texas, and was estimated by Richard Haynes, also a Texas criminal defense attorney, to be worth $50 million. His wife, fearful that they would suffer from community retribution, asked Tinker not to take the case. [...] Arnold Garcia, a former district prosecutor, was chosen by Tinker as his co-counsel. The judge honored Tinker's request for a private investigator. The court date was originally set for August 17, but, for unknown reasons, was pushed back two months to October 9. On May 18, Tinker and Valdez argued about the possibility of reducing Saldívar's bond to $10,000. Tinker argued that she should not be in prison since she had not yet been found guilty of murder and deserved to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> bail. Valdez argued that Saldívar was a flight risk, with contacts in Mexico, and, were she to be released from prison, it was unlikely she would be seen again. [...] Saldívar's parents, siblings, and former co-workers argued that she had no financial resources to make bond, and that she was incapable of the actions of which she was accused. Valdez called Rivera to the stand. He claimed that Saldívar had developed several foreign contacts as a result of working for Selena. Rivera also brought up the ongoing investigation of the embezzlement claims, stating that Saldívar might have access to funds that the investigation had not yet uncovered. Westergren denied the bond reduction, and Saldívar was returned to jail.|$|E
