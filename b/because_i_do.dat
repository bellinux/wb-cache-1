5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much about being in love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what does he want to get paid?' … <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1880 and 1887, Heaviside {{developed}} the operational calculus using p for the differential operator, (which Boole had previously denoted by D), giving {{a method of}} solving differential equations by direct solution as algebraic equations. This later caused {{a great deal of}} controversy, owing to its lack of rigour. He famously said, [...] "Mathematics is an experimental science, and definitions do not come first, but later on." [...] On another occasion he asked somewhat more defensively, [...] "Shall I refuse my dinner <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not fully understand the process of digestion?" ...|$|E

[...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He called me and said to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.'
