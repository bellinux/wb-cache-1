40|$|Modern {{production}} facilities are complex systems involving thousands of components and system parameters. In this real world application we model a line for production and packaging of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>briquette</b> bundles. We concentrate {{here on the}} problem of how to produce bundles with guaranteed (minimum) weight with minimal input of raw material. Variations of the incoming raw material parameters, the mechanics of the involved machinery, and complex interdependencies are mathematically modeled and analyzed. Based on this a computer model allows for simulation, parameter optimization, and minimization of input material. This results in a better understanding of the overall peformance of the facility and of the sensitivity and interdependence of the parameters. Based on these investigations a considerable increase inproduction output could be realized by the industrial partner. (orig.)

40|$|To {{improve the}} output rate {{of a complex}} packing process for <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>briquette</b> bundles we {{designed}} a simulation system combining statistics, visualization and optimization routines using state-of-the-art object-oriented software design techniques. With the optimization part we found optimal settings of the numerous production parameters like weight limits, briquette and bundle transport velocities, sensor positions, and delays etc. for different production conditions. Comparing conventional techniques and AI methods {{for this kind of}} optimization problems we can demonstrate that conventional methods will either fail in practice or cannot be realized at reasonable cost. Due to the optimization the performance and output of the plant could be increased significantly. The whole system serves as a basis for an on-line process control. Furthermore the system allows to simulate and investigate changes and extensions to the plant at minimal costs and without disturbing the production process. (orig.)

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>briquette</b> bundles {{in a completely}} automated production plant imposes strict quality requirements on the pressing of the briquettes. Thus the packaging of bundles which consist of several layers of briquettes requires that each layer has approximately the same length. As the pressing of briquettes with exactly predefined measurements can't be meastered technically, {{a part of the}} production must be picked out with a suitable quality surveillance procedure. The quality surveillance procedure that was used in production could mathematically be described exactly and was subject to an in depth analysis. It could be verified that besides the question for the optimal choice of single parameters, for that very special practical application it is essential that the performance of a quality surveillance procedure does not depend on the dynamic behaviour of the factors of production. The output of the factory could be increased considerably by eliminating these problems and optimizing the production plant. Besides the mathematical modeling this result was based on the optimization and simulation by a computer-based model. (orig.)

40|$|The solvent-induced {{swelling}} behaviour of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> {{was examined}} in detail {{to probe the}} bonding mechanisms in very low rank coals (in this case Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coal).</b> Correlation of solvent properties with differences in observed swelling behaviour were interpreted {{in terms of the}} coal structure, and means of predicting the observed behaviour were considered. Modification of the coal structure via physical compression (briquetting), chemical digestion, thermal modification, and functional group alkylation was used to further elucidate those structural features which govern the swelling behaviour of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals.</b> <b>Briquette</b> weathering (i. e. swelling and disintegration of briquettes when exposed to variations in humidity and temperature) was examined by making alterations to briquette feed material and observing the effects on swelling in water. The application of solubility parameter alone to prediction of coal swelling was rejected due to the many exceptions to any proposed trend. <b>Brown</b> <b>coal</b> swelling showed a minimum when the solvent electron-donor number (DN) minus its electron-acceptor number (AN) was closest to zero, i. e. when DN and AN were of similar magnitude. The degree of swelling increased either side of this point, as predicted by theory. In contrast to the solubility parameter approach (which suffers from the uncertainty caused by specific interaction between coal and solvent), the electron donor/acceptor approach is about specific interactions. It was concluded that a combination of total and three-dimensional solubility parameters and solvent electron donor/acceptor numbers may be used to predict solvent swelling of unextracted <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> with some success. Solvent access to chemically densified coal was found to be insensitive to a reduction in pore volume, and chemical effects were dominant. Thermal modification of the digested coal resulted in reduced swelling for all solvents, indicating that the structure had adopted a minimum energy configuration due to decarboxylation and replacement of hydrogen bonds with additional covalent bonds. Swelling of oxygen-alkylated coals demonstrated that the more polar solvents are able to break relatively weak hydrogen bonded crosslinks. The large difference between the rate and extent of swelling in water (and hence weathering) of Yallourn and Morwell briquettes was shown to be almost entirely attributable to exchanged magnesium. Magnesium exchange significantly increases the rate and extent of swelling of Yallourn coal. It was also shown that the swelling of briquettes due to uptake of water by magnesium-exchanged coals is reduced significantly with controlled ageing of the briquettes. The solvent swelling behaviour of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> is consistent with the notion that coal is a both covalently and non-covalently crosslinked and entangled macromolecular network comprising extractable species, which are held within the network by a wide range of non-covalent, polar, electron donor/acceptor interactions. Solvents capable of significant extraction of whole <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> are also capable of significant swelling, but not dissolution, of the macromolecular coal network, which supports the view that the network is comprised of both covalent and ionic bonding. Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> have also been shown to exhibit polyelectrolytic behaviour due to a high concentration of ionisable surface functionalities...|$|R

It is recommended to expose <b>coal</b> <b>briquettes</b> on a basis of ammonium humate to the thermal treatment at temperature 200 °C as necessary of long storage (more than a year). The technological scheme of briquetting and the working project of creation of briquette factory with productivity of 40 000 tons of coal per year are developed. </p...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>coal</b> <b>briquettes</b> as an {{alternative}} energy source is still relatively small compared to other energy sources such as oil and gas. This is because the ignition of <b>coal</b> <b>briquette</b> is difficult {{at an early stage}} of the combustion process and also South Sulawesi coal contains high sulfur which leads to emit SO 2. One way to overcome the problem is mixing the coal with a certain ratio of rice husk, a little proportion lime and starch as a glue. Water was poured while stirring the mixture. It then was molded and dried. In this study, the optimum condition was obtained at the ratio of coal-rice husk of 80 % (80 : 20) which gave the characteristics of briquettes with the heating value (Hv) = 5443 kcal / kg, SO 2 emission = 247 ppm, NOx emission = 115 ppm and CO 2 emission = 0. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} some {{selected}} {{physical and chemical}} measurable parameters were determined and discussed. These parameters {{can be used for}} screening <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> with respect to their suitability for soil reclamation purposes. Structural parameters, such as total cumulative volume, specific surface area, average pore radius, pore size distribution and total porosity were evaluated as a tool for the final selection of the suitable <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> materials for reclamation purposes. The investigations were carried out using samples of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> from the opencast in Livno (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> material (BC 1) from the Konin (Poland) deposit. Samples were taken from different depths to evaluate the effect of depth on the studied properties. Based on results of S, C, N, ash, humic acids contents, it can be stated that the <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> from Livno (BC 4) was the worst material {{to be used as a}} soil conditioner and/or for soil reclamation purposes. <b>Brown</b> <b>coal</b> samples from Livno were characterized by a very high acidity, thus in the case of their application for reclamation of soil contaminated with heavy metals, they have to be mixed with lime. The specific and bulk density of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> from Konin were lower than for <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> from Livno. The structural parameters can be recommended as a tool for final selection of suitable <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> materials for soil reclamation...|$|R
