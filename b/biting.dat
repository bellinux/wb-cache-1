5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for <b>biting</b> land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when <b>biting</b> down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by <b>biting.</b>|$|E

50|$|Human <b>bites</b> are {{the third}} most {{frequent}} type of <b>bite</b> after dog and cat <b>bites.</b> Dog <b>bites</b> are commonplace, with children the most commonly <b>bitten</b> and the face the most common target. About 4.7 million dog <b>bites</b> are reported annually in the United States. The US estimated annual count of animal <b>bites</b> is 250,000 human <b>bites,</b> 1 to 2 million dog <b>bites,</b> 400,000 cat <b>bites,</b> and 45,000 <b>bites</b> from snakes. <b>Bites</b> from skunks, horses, squirrels, rats, rabbits, pigs, and monkeys may be up to 1 percent of <b>bite</b> injuries. Pet ferrets attacks that were unprovoked have caused serious facial injuries. Non-domesticated animals though assumed to be more common especially {{as a cause of}} rabies infection, make up {{less than one percent of}} reported <b>bite</b> wounds. When a person is <b>bitten,</b> it is more likely to occur on the right arm, most likely due to defensive reactions when the person uses their dominant arm. Estimates are that three quarters of <b>bites</b> are located on the arms or legs of humans. <b>Bites</b> to the face of humans constitute only 10 percent of the total. Two thirds of <b>bite</b> injuries in humans are suffered by children aged ten and younger.|$|R
5000|$|A dry <b>bite</b> is a <b>bite</b> by a venomous {{animal in}} which no venom is released. Dry snake <b>bites</b> are called [...] "Venomous snake <b>bite</b> without envenoming". Dry <b>bites</b> can occur from all snakes, but their {{frequency}} varies from species to species. For example, Australian eastern brown snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) can inflict dry <b>bites</b> 80% of the time while taipans inflict dry <b>bites</b> only 5% of the time. About 25% of snakebite cases can be dry <b>bites.</b> They are characterized by fang and tooth marks {{and the absence of}} injected venom.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{applying}} map and filter functions on consecutive sublists {{instead of on}} individual list elements is discussed and developed in this paper. A non-empty, consecutive sublist is called a <b>bite.</b> Both map and filter functions accept a function parameter- a <b>bite</b> function- {{which is responsible for}} returning a prefix <b>bite</b> of a list. We develop families of <b>bite</b> functions via a collection of higher-order <b>bite</b> generators. On top of the <b>bite</b> generators, a number of <b>bite</b> mapping and <b>bite</b> filtering functions are introduced. We illustrate the usefulness of <b>bite</b> mapping and filtering via examples drawn from a functional programming library that processes music, represented as Standard MIDI Files...|$|R

5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by <b>biting</b> on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on <b>biting).</b> Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to <b>biting)</b> can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E

As many as one percent of pediatric emergency room visits are for treatment for animal <b>bites.</b> This is more frequent during the summer months. Up to five percent of children receiving emergency care for dog <b>bites</b> are then admitted to the hospital. <b>Bites</b> typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening.

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves <b>biting.</b> Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly <b>biting</b> him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E

5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to <b>biting</b> flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and <b>biting</b> insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E

5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by <b>biting,</b> pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and <b>biting</b> by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDespite the {{widespread}} use of police dogs, there is very little objective medical information about the injuries they cause when they <b>bite.</b> Our aim was to statistically describe police dog <b>bite</b> injuries. MethodsWe described police dog <b>bite</b> injuries by comparing them with domestic (non-police) dog <b>bites.</b> We retrospectively analyzed their demographic and specific injury data drawn from their medical records. The police dog <b>bite</b> victims came from the Los Angeles Police Department K 9 Unit from 1988 to 1990. The domestic dog <b>bite</b> victims came from King-Drew Medical Center, an inner-city public hospital from 1989 to 1996. All of the police dog victims’ medical records that could be located were included (595 out of 957). All domestic dog <b>bite</b> victims that arrived for treatment were included (n= 1109). ResultsPolice dog <b>bite</b> victims were usually <b>bitten</b> multiple times, whilst domestic <b>bite</b> victims were not. Police dog <b>bite</b> victims were <b>bitten</b> more often in the head, neck, chest and flank. They were hospitalised more often, underwent more operations and had more invasive diagnostic tests. ConclusionsPolice dog <b>bite</b> injuries appeared to be more serious than victims of domestic dog <b>bite</b> victims. The reasons for the differences were related to the types of dogs selected and their special training...|$|R

40|$|In 1981, {{more than}} 3, 200 Pennsylvania children, ages 4 to 18 years, were {{surveyed}} about their dog <b>bite</b> histories {{and attitudes toward}} animals. Dog <b>bites</b> were much more common than previously reported: 45 percent of children had been <b>bitten</b> during their lifetimes, and 15. 5 percent had been <b>bitten</b> in 1980, more than 36 times the rate reported to health authorities. In 1980, the highest <b>bite</b> rate occurred among children 7 - 12 years old (20 percent). Children were <b>bitten</b> more frequently by the dogs owned by their neighbors, followed by their own dogs, than by strays or by dogs whose owners were not known. Boys were <b>bitten</b> twice as frequently as girls by neighbors' dogs and strays; the <b>bite</b> rates from family dogs were identical in boys and girls. Despite the high <b>bite</b> rates, being <b>bitten</b> was not significantly associated, in most groups of children studied, with a dislike of dogs. These positive attitudes toward dogs may lead to inadequate precautions against <b>bites</b> and to biases in the reporting of <b>bites</b> to health authorities...|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{document}} in-vivo <b>bite</b> forces recorded {{from wild}} piranhas. Integrating this empirical data with allometry, <b>bite</b> simulations, and FEA, we have reconstructed the <b>bite</b> capabilities and potential feeding {{ecology of the}} extinct giant Miocene piranha, Megapiranha paranensis. An anterior <b>bite</b> force of 320 N from the black piranha, Serrasalmus rhombeus, is the strongest <b>bite</b> force recorded for any bony fish to date. Results indicate M. paranensis' <b>bite</b> force conservatively ranged from 1240 - 4749 N and reveal its novel dentition was capable of resisting high <b>bite</b> stresses and crushing vertebrate bone. Comparisons of body size-scaled <b>bite</b> forces to other apex predators reveal S. rhombeus and M. paranensis have among the most powerful <b>bites</b> estimated in carnivorous vertebrates. Our results functionally demonstrate the extraordinary <b>bite</b> of serrasalmid piranhas and provide a mechanistic rationale for their predatory dominance among past and present Amazonian ichthyofaunas...|$|R
