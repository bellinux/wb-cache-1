5|$|Joseph Brant's {{force was}} part of a {{combined}} British and Indian army being raised to counter Clark's offensive. Brant had too few men to challenge Clark, but when he intercepted messengers traveling between Clark and Lochry, he learned about Lochry's smaller group <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> When Lochry landed to feed his men and horses, Brant launched his overwhelmingly successful ambush. Because Clark had been able to recruit {{only a fraction of the}} men he needed for his campaign, the loss of Lochry's men resulted in the cancellation of Clark's expedition.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and {{the rest}} of the III Battle Squadron were the leading unit of the High Seas Fleet; the four s led the line. Kaiser, the {{flagship}} of Konteradmiral H.

I Battle Squadron, composed of the eight - and s, followed III Squadron, with the six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Hipper's five battlecruisers left the Jade estuary at 02:00 on 31 May; Scheer, with the High Seas Fleet, followed an hour and a half later.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's 'A' Company {{suffered}} a similar fate, the officer commanding was wounded crossing the start line, {{and at the}} same time every member of the 2nd Platoon was killed or wounded. The CSM assumed command of the company but was killed when they reached Bréville. The company second in command who had been <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear,</b> reached the village and found the 3rd Platoon only had nine men left but they had managed to clear the village Château and the 1st Platoon had cleared its grounds.|$|E

5|$|The next {{attempt to}} capture the Tebaga Gap was mounted on 27 March by the {{infantry}} of the 5th Brigade along with the 6th Brigade's 24th Battalion, supported by a regiment of the British 8th Armoured Brigade. The 25th Battalion only played a minor role, securing the extreme left flank, carrying out diversionary operations, and generally supporting the 24th Battalion during its advance. The attack was a total success {{and the next day}} the 2nd New Zealand Division moved forward with the 25th Battalion <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the 6th Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the high ground {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the high ground at Koepel. The delay in England meant it was 17:00 before the brigade started moving. With {{the element of surprise}} gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left. <b>Bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 on {{the morning}} of 18 December, a small boat sailed from Anse la Barque with a message {{offering}} the British a temporary truce. Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled {{at the entrance to the}} bay. Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. His plan was simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the flûtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships.|$|E

5|$|The Arab army {{marched in}} three {{separate}} corps, with Ashinas {{once again in}} front, the caliph in the middle, and Afshin <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Looting the countryside as they advanced, they arrived before Amorium seven days after their departure from Ancyra, and began their siege of the city on 1 August. Theophilos, anxious to prevent the city's fall, left Constantinople for Dorylaion, and from there sent an embassy to Mu'tasim. His envoys, who arrived shortly before or during {{the first days of}} the siege, offered assurances that the atrocities at Sozopetra had been against the emperor's orders, and further promised to help rebuild the city, to return all Muslim prisoners, and to pay a tribute. The caliph, however, not only refused to parley with the envoys, but detained them in his camp, so that they could observe the siege.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the coalition army {{when most of}} it had crossed the Kalka River. The Mongols appear to have caught the coalition forces by surprise in a fast transition from horse archer fire to massed cavalry charges, because the coalition rout began incredibly quickly: the Rus forces <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> had not yet arrived on the battle {{by the time the}} front ranks were dissolving. The armies of Volhynia and Kursk made a gap in their line so that the fleeing Cumans could retreat. However, the Mongol heavy cavalry charged through the newly formed gap and also enveloped them. The army of Chernigov, which was not aware that the battle had started, was advancing when they collided head-on with the retreating Cumans. Using smoke bombs to disrupt the coalition's ability to coordinate, the Mongol cavalry took advantage of the confusion in the Chernigov line and attacked, causing the line to collapse. This, in turn, led to the death of Prince Mstislav of Chernigov.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E

5|$|At {{daylight}} 4th Parachute Brigade {{started moving}} east towards the division at Oosterbeek, where the KOSB, {{moving through the}} night, had already arrived. Only the parachute battalions and brigade troops remained outside of the village. The order of march was 10 Para followed by brigade troops then 156 Para <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Virtually surrounded, the brigade fought a running hand-to-hand battle with German infantry supported by armour as they attempted to break through. During the fighting commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Des Voeux and the second in command of 156 Para were killed in action. Another high ranking casualty was the commanding officer of 10 Para Lieutenant-Colonel Ken Smyth, who was wounded and became a prisoner of war. With 156 Para leading, {{the remnants of the}} brigade carried out a bayonet charge and cleared the Germans from a large hollow which provided some shelter for the exhausted troops. Pinned down all day and with their numbers dwindling, at 17:00 Brigadier Hackett led a charge towards the divisions position, only the Brigadier and 150 men made it.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{followed}} in Vanguard, bringing {{the next two}} ships into action with the starboard side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence. As the French van was destroyed, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre. Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80-gun Franklin and Tonnant, both British ships suffered massive damage. Culloden, <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the British line, passed {{too close to the}} northern shoal and grounded, Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off. By 19:00 darkness had fallen, and within an hour the French van had been defeated, Guerrier, Conquérant, Spartiate, Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting. The British too had suffered damage, with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced to cut their anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents. Bellerophon had been dismasted, Majestics captain George Blagden Westcott had been killed, and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound.|$|E
25|$|The brigade's 24th Battalion was {{attached}} to the infantry of the 5th Brigade, along with a regiment of the British 8th Armoured Brigade in support for the next attempt to capture the Tebaga Gap on 27 March.

25|$|Napoleon left 39,000 {{troops to}} contain Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia. The {{formations}} were Oudinot's VII Corps, Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's II Corps, Étienne Maurice Gérard's Reserve of Paris, Henri Rottembourg's Young Guard infantry division, Milhaud's V Cavalry Corps and smaller units. Napoleon's striking force numbered about 20,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 horsemen. Another authority {{agreed that the}} French army numbered 30,000 men and added that it was supported by 120 guns. The army was formed by Marshal Michel Ney's two Young Guard infantry divisions, Marmont's VI Corps, part of the Imperial Guard cavalry, I Cavalry Corps and Defrance's cavalry division. <b>Bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> at Nogent was Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise with two Old Guard infantry divisions.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March, Blücher began {{retreating}} {{north in}} the direction of Soissons. While Yorck withdrew through Château-Thierry, Kaptzevich pulled back to La Ferté-Milon and Sacken fell back to Ancienville. <b>Bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> was Kleist, who was directed to send a probe south toward May-en-Multien. Led by Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten, the Silesian Hussars, Neumark Dragoons, Silesian Uhlans and two horse artillery batteries set out, supported by five battalions from the 9th Brigade. As the Prussian reconnaissance force emerged from Neufchelles, Christophe Antoine Merlin's 1st Light Cavalry Division charged them. Merlin was driven back but Ricard's 8th Division and Joseph Lagrange's 3rd Division soon appeared with 12 heavy caliber cannons. In the artillery duel that followed, six Prussian guns were knocked out of action and Zieten decided to retreat at 5:00 pm. Kleist fell back to Mareuil-sur-Ourcq but was unable to cross the river because the other corps had not passed. Not realizing the situation, Marmont did not press the Allies hard. Instead he simply bombarded Mareuil and Kleist got away.|$|E

About 41 men were <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> on January 25 near Simpsonville, when they were ambushed by Confederate guerrillas.
