40|$|Both {{policymakers and}} {{scholars}} {{have expressed concern}} that trade has increased inequality in advanced industrialized countries (AICs). We argue {{that the impact of}} trade on inequality depends on the availability of public goods, such as educational opportunities, that allow displaced workers to upgrade their skills and adjust to trade. The provision of public goods, in turn, depends on political institutions: institutions that unify <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> promote public-good spending while institutions that separate <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> discourage it. Trade should thus increase inequality more (reduce inequality less) in countries with a high separation of <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers.</b> We test and find support for these hypotheses with a cross-sectional time-series analysis of fourteen AICs. Our results imply that trade can improve aggregate welfare without worsening economic inequities, but only if governments adopt complementary policies that facilitate human capital formation and labor-market adjustment. ...|$|R

Pataki said the Legislature could then only change the numbers but could not change any policy decisions made in the budget document. Pataki and the Legislature ended up in court and the courts ruled in Pataki's favor, giving him more <b>budgetary</b> <b>power.</b> In 2005, the Legislature placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot to allocate more budget power to them.

40|$|The {{issues of}} public debt and budget deficit are {{regulated}} by constitutions (e. g. of Poland, Germany, Spain) {{as well as}} by the law of the European Union. The constitutional regulations concerning public debt and deficit are norms primarily directed at governments and parliaments. However, these regulations mainly have a preventive and auxiliary character and cannot by themselves stop the debt level of the state from increasing. Financial aims concerning debt and deficit can be achieved by non-financial methods, i. e. through the appropriate social and economic policies implemented by the authorities enjoying considerable social respect. The EU regulations regarding public debt and deficit can only be implemented with the instruments of the national law. The set of the EU regulations limiting the <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> of member states, including the <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> of governments and national parliaments, are questionable and undermine the authority of the state. ...|$|R

40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{reformed}} the {{budgetary procedure}} of the European Union (EU). This paper describes the key changes and presents a game-theoretical {{analysis of the}} annual budgetary procedure. Our {{focus is on the}} implications of these changes for the <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> of the European Parliament (EP). Against the common belief that the <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> of the EP were strengthened {{as a result of the}} Lisbon Treaty, our analysis paints a somewhat more sober assessment of its budgetary empowerment as a result of the reform. We find that the budgetary procedure operates much like the codecision procedure does in the legislative process. Compared to the budgetary procedure used prior to the Lisbon Treaty, it has become more difficult for the Parliament to pass amendments, if it wants to affect what used to be referred to as non-compulsory spending or decrease compulsory spending. The EP’s ability to pass amendments that increase compulsory spending is mostly unaffected. The configuration of preferences and bargaining powers in the Conciliation Committee determine whether on balance the EP is better off under the new procedure. nrpages: 31 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a history of}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> and politics in the EU during the period 1957 - 1978, focusing {{on the role of}} what was then still a non-(or indirectly) elected European Parliament. It follows a timeline divided into three periods: (i) beginnings (1957 - 1964), (ii) preparations for modification of the Treaty (1965 - 1969), and (iii) the first phase of democratic control (1970 - 1978). The modifications to the Treaty of Rome, with the two budgetary treaties of 1970 and 1975, were the results of conflicts, diplomacy and compromises. After more than 20 years the balance of power between the institutions had changed; full democratic control had not been achieved, but important progress had been made, and Parliament, though still not directly elected, had gained in influence and respect. This study gives a detailed description of various elements of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>powers</b> shaped by the two treaties, in particular those which would enable the elected Parliament to continue its fight for more influence and greater powers, not only in the budgetary domain but also in legislative and institutional matters too...|$|R

40|$|The European Union is {{a unique}} and {{exceptional}} organisation in many respects. Its financial system, whose rules and structure {{are very different from}} those of national budgetary law, has changed a great deal and is still changing. The most significant changes include: — The unification of budgetary instruments. Initially, each Community had its own budget or budgets (administrative and operating). These have now been replaced by a single budget, the general budget of the European Union. — Progress towards financial autonomy. Following the example of the ECSC, which was financed by real ‘tax revenue’ from the time it was set up, the EEC and Euratom changed to a system of own resources on 1 January 1971. — Reform of the Community financial system. The financial perspective, a genuine multiannual financial framework and instrument of budgetary discipline, was introduced in 1988. It forms an integral part of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. — The pursuit of an institutional balance between the Council, Parliament and the Commission in the exercise of <b>budgetary</b> <b>power.</b> Initially, <b>budgetary</b> <b>power</b> lay solely with the Council.

It finds that such budget offices mitigate the <b>budgetary</b> <b>power</b> of presidents, as well as prime ministers who are becoming more like presidents.
