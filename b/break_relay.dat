30|$|Extensive {{research}} {{had been done}} on the application of graph theory for protection coordination studies [11 – 16]. Network structures are analysed by determining the <b>break</b> points for <b>relay</b> coordination studies [15]. In graph theory approach, the relay coordination starts from the certain set of <b>relays</b> known as <b>break</b> point <b>relays</b> (BPS). Proper selection of BPS is very crucial for quick convergence of relay coordination problems. Graph theory was successfully applied for formulation of relative sequence matrix (RSM) [16, 17] and RSM later on used for determining the minimum <b>break</b> point <b>relays</b> as well as primary/backup (B/P) relay pairs.|$|R
50|$|Magee {{was one of}} {{the large}} group of athletes that New Zealand coach Arthur Lydiard used to revolutionise how the world trained for all sports. At the 1960 Olympic Games Lydiard's pupils and Magee's {{training}} partners, Murray Halberg and Peter Snell won gold medals over 5000 m and 800 m within one hour. Magee's bronze in the marathon confirmed Lydiard's training methods. Magee's run in Rome made him the fastest white marathon runner of all time to that moment. He went on to win many major international races, including the 1960 Fukuoka Marathon. But Magee was much more than a marathon runner; he also ran the world's third fastest time over 3miles and fifth fastest 5000 m at that time. He also recorded the world's fastest 10,000 m and 2nd fastest 5000 m for 1961 and was part of New Zealand's 4 × 1 mile world record <b>breaking</b> <b>relay</b> team in 1961.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new graph theory based {{algorithm}} for {{the determination of}} the minimum break point set of meshed systems. We show {{that if there is a}} k-tree in the graph G(V,E) associated with the system, then the minimum break point set has a cardinality of |E|−|V |+k. The proposed algorithm implements an iterative procedure to identify such a k-tree and having minimum k. It is found that the cardinality of the minimum break point set is 9 for the IEEE 14 bus system and 16 for the IEEE 30 bus system. These minimum values are smaller than the previously best reported results of 10 and 18 for the same systems. Index Terms—Directional <b>relays.</b> <b>Break</b> points.

50|$|Other {{considerations}} are made also; FM music stations rarely <b>relay</b> <b>breaking</b> news {{unless it is}} an event of grave national concern, though local weather warnings are relayed when in effect (either {{in the form of}} updates provided by an on-staff anchor or disc jockey, an emergency alert system or through an audio simulcast of a television station which maintains a contractual partnership with a radio outlet). Less urgent events allow a network to feed updates to stations at 20, 30 and 50 minutes after the hour to give a summary of events. Stations are also careful about what stories are relayed during play-by-play broadcasts of professional and college sports, as those are the programs most listened to on radio, so breaking news coverage is limited to only commercial breaks.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} enable {{connectivity}} {{in an ad}} hoc network through the exchange of routing information, an initial requirement {{is the ability to}} detect new links and link breaks. For instance, a proactive routing protocol needs to know about any new link and link break before routing update messages can be propagated. A reactive routing protocol can do without new link detection, but requires mechanisms to detect the failure of a link. To this end, an essential component of the routing protocol framework is the neighbor discovery module. This module is responsible for the detection of new links and link <b>breaks</b> and for <b>relaying</b> this information to the routing protocol. The information is stored in a neighbor table, which can be consulted by the routing protocol and monitoring agent. The detection of new links and link breaks can happen through the exchange of beacon messages. In addition, this exchange can take place at layer 3 or at layer 2 (as part of the radio interface implementation).|$|R
50|$|At a September 30, 2013 workshop, {{broadcasters}} {{and equipment}} makers were {{asked what the}} changes would cost. The result was that answers would only be possible after the FCC said who would be moving and how. The Spectrum Act provided $1.75 billion for the reasonable expenses of relocating stations, and the money {{would have to be}} paid in three years without further action by Congress. Among the expenses would be meeting new tower standards for dealing with wind and ice, interim facilities so some stations would not be temporarily forced off the air, and translators in areas that needed them, mostly in the West. The FCC asked for comments to be received by November 4, 2013, with spectrum auctions coming later. Providers of wireless services recommended that broadcasters give up two channels, or 15 MHz, of Broadcast auxiliary service, which is used for <b>relaying</b> <b>breaking</b> news, but the NAB said this spectrum could be shared with the United States Department of Defense.|$|R

5000|$|Furniss is {{the third}} of four {{successful}} aquatic brothers, {{often referred to as}} [...] "Orange County California's First Family of Swimming." [...] Older brother Steve Furniss, a two-time swimming Olympian (1972 Olympic bronze medalist and 1976 Olympic team captain), and Bruce are among a rare group of siblings, in any sport, to make the same Olympic team. The decision by the International Olympic Committee to remove the 200-meter individual medley from the 1976 Summer Olympics robbed Bruce and Steve of the unique opportunity to compete against each other in an Olympic swimming event. However, Bruce and Steve share the distinction as the only known brothers ever to have held and broken one another's world records consecutively. Bruce broke Steve's 200-meter individual medley world record in August 1975, while competing in the U.S. National Championships. In that same meet, Bruce and Steve, swimming for Long Beach Swim Club, shared the equally unique accomplishment, (along with teammates Tim Shaw and Rex Favaro), as the last club team to <b>break</b> a swimming <b>relay</b> world record (4×200-meter freestyle relay). Earlier that same summer at the 1975 World Swimming Championships team trials, Furniss also accomplished the rare feat of breaking the same world record twice in the same day (June 18, 1975) in the 200-meter freestyle.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecently, {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) has become a standard symptomatic procedure for Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement and psychiatric disorders. Despite its success, {{the effect of this}} invasive and costly procedure is not completely understood. Indeed, how high-frequency, electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the basal ganglia improves symptoms is not known. Furthermore, DBS raises several interesting paradoxes: it mimics the effects of a lesion, improves symptoms when the frequency is > 100 Hz whereas low-frequency DBS has no effect or even worsens symptoms. In order to reconcile these various paradoxes, we explore the complex formed by the STN and the external segment of the Globus Pallidus (GPe) with a computational model. We investigate the possibility that DBS induces a functional decoupling between STN neurons. First, we develop neuronal models for STN and GPe neurons based on the Izhikevich model. Second, we derive population equations for the STN-GPe complex including connectivity and time delays. Third, we explore the dynamical behaviour of this model under different connectivity patterns. Finally, we apply a DBS current to the STN at different frequencies. Our simulation results suggest that STN-GPe complex can exhibit two different dynamical states: 1) a stable state, where both nuclei have a low and stable activity (physiological condition), or 2) an oscillatory activity where both nuclei exhibit low-frequency (systematically below 10 Hz) synchronized bursts of activity (pathological condition). Thus, activity at low frequencies appears to be intrinsic to the STN-GPe complex when it becomes disrupted. Consequently, we propose that low-frequency (below 20 Hz) DBS is ineffective, or even enhances pathological activity in the STN-GPe complex, because it resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the STN-GPe complex. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that DBS causes a “stimulation-induced decoupling” (SID) between STN neurons, i. e., that individual dynamics of STN neurons become dominant compared to neuronal interactions within the STN. Thus, we simulate the activity of the STN-GPe complex with pathological dynamics, and apply a high-frequency DBS current to the STN. Our results show a high degree of similarity, whether there were recurrent connections in the STN or not. This suggests that DBS “isolates” neurons from one another, and <b>breaks</b> the <b>relay</b> of activity throughout and within the STN. Thus: 1) At the cellular level, high-frequency DBS prevents the generation of synchronized, low-frequency activity within the STN, 2) At the network level, this weakens the impact of cortical feedback to the STN and 3) At the motor feedback loop level (linking functionally cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus), the loop “opens”, {{as in the case of}} subthalamotomy. In summary, based on our results, we suggest that the difference in motor improvement between low and high frequency DBS is due to resonance phenomena between DBS current frequency and STN-GPe intrinsic frequency respectively. Furthermore, we suggest that SID is a plausible physiological mechanism for DBS which reconciles the paradox between stimulation and lesion effects and between excitation and/or inhibition of the STN. For the first time, this mechanism proposes a comprehensive multiscale (cellular, network, feedback loop) explanation of the effects of DBS in PD...|$|R
