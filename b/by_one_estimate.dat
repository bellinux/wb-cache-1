5|$|Claudius {{annexed to}} the empire three regions that became {{important}} sources of auxiliary recruits: Britannia (43AD), {{and the former}} client kingdoms of Mauretania (44) and Thracia (46). The latter became as important as Illyria {{as a source of}} auxiliary recruits, especially cavalry and archers. Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of auxiliary regiments in any single province: about 60 out of about 400 (15%). By the rule of Nero (54–68), auxiliary numbers may have reached, <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate,</b> about 200,000 men, implying about 400 regiments.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted {{people to think about}} the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. <b>By</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate,</b> 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot {{begins in}} June 1819, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, after the House of Bourbon had been {{restored to the}} throne of France. Tension was mounting between the aristocracy, which had returned with King Louis XVIII, and the bourgeoisie produced by the Industrial Revolution. During this era, France saw a tightening of social structures, with a lower class steeped in overwhelming poverty. <b>By</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate,</b> almost three-quarters of Parisians {{did not make the}} 500–600 francs a year required for a minimal standard of living. At the same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the Ancien Régime of previous centuries. Individuals willing to adapt themselves to the rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.|$|E
25|$|Travel by sea was {{faster than}} by land {{and it was}} easier to {{transport}} goods in bulk by ship than <b>by</b> road; <b>one</b> <b>estimate</b> reckons that a ship could travel sixty to ninety miles (96km to 145km) per day whereas an overland traveller might cover a distance of only twenty-five miles (40km).|$|R

5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. <b>By</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate,</b> 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate,</b> only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

40|$|This article proposes an {{adaptive}} predictive control design technique {{to mitigate the}} displacement in a hysteretical base-isolated system seismically perturbed. The obtained predictive control law {{is based on the}} measurable linear part of the base-isolated model, and programmed over a prediction-time of one-sampling-discrete-time period. Two main contributions are highlighted. First, we use a delta-modulator with hysteresis to avoid the zero-crossing in the control law caused <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimated</b> parameters. Second, we implement a dynamic hysteretic model based on relays as a command governor able to create new hysteretic reference trajectories. This is realized to robustly compensate the hysteretic behavior of the structure under control. Finally, and according to numerical experiments, our control design presents a good performance from the displacement control point of view in comparison to the open-loop system response, where the El Centro earthquake is invoked.

25|$|Derivative action predicts system {{behavior}} and thus improves settling time {{and stability of}} the system. An ideal derivative is not causal, so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate</b> in only 25% of deployed controllers – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.|$|E

25|$|The American Civil War {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} true industrial wars. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships and iron-clad ships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in World War I, World War II and subsequent conflicts. It remains the deadliest war in American history. From 1861 to 1865, it is estimated that 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers died, along with an undetermined number of civilians. <b>By</b> <b>one</b> <b>estimate,</b> the war claimed the lives of 10 percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.|$|E

More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23GW in 2011.
