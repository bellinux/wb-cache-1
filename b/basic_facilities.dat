5|$|The first railway {{hotels in}} London {{were built in}} Euston. Two hotels {{designed}} by Hardwick opened in 1839, located {{either side of the}} Arch; the Victoria on the west had <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> while the Euston on the east was designed for first-class passengers.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{transfer}} to local authority control, {{much of the}} property on the estate {{was found to be}} in poor condition. In 1971 a report by the London Borough of Haringey found that half the properties on the estate were still lacking <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> such as baths, internal toilets and hot water. Houses were systematically extended to the rear to accommodate modern bathrooms.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the very}} early days of alpine {{mountaineering}} a number of high-altitude mountain refuges have been positioned strategically across the massif to give climbers easier access to the high summits by permitting an overnight stay. The majority are owned by national mountaineering clubs, and many are wardened during the summer months, although the smaller bivouac huts are unmanned and have very <b>basic</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

5|$|Terminal 4 – {{originally}} {{called the}} Domestic Express or South Terminal – {{is dedicated to}} budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett. A$5million refit began in June 2007 {{along the lines of}} the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Lower landing and airport handling fees are charged to airlines due to the <b>basic</b> <b>facilities,</b> lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal. However, the terminal is located next to the main terminal building, unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.|$|E
5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E

25|$|Situated {{at the tip}} of a windswept {{peninsula}} {{without water}} or firewood, San Francisco lacked most of the <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> for a 19th-century settlement. These natural disadvantages forced the town's residents to bring water, fuel and food to the site. The first of many environmental transformations was the city's reliance on filled marshlands for real estate. Much of the present downtown is built over the former Yerba Buena Cove, granted to the city by military governor Stephen Watts Kearny in 1847.|$|E
25|$|The {{general state}} {{of health care in}} Myanmar is poor. The {{military}} government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> and equipment. The following is a summary of the public health system in the state, in the fiscal year 2002-2003.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 2 is {{the much}} smaller and newer {{of the two}} terminals, mainly used by {{low-cost}} carriers. It is located away from Terminal 1 on the southern border of the airport. It has 21 check-in desks (201–222) and 15 departure gates (201–215) using mainly walk boarding but also bus. There are only <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> and a few shops and service counters in Terminal 2. The terminal can only be reached by a free shuttle service from Terminal 1. The main users of Terminal 2 are Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air.|$|E

25|$|Gould {{asserted}} that he almost never practised on the piano, preferring to study music by reading {{it rather than}} playing it, another technique he had learned from Guerrero. His manual practising focused on articulation, rather than <b>basic</b> <b>facility.</b> He may have spoken ironically about his practising as there is evidence that, on occasion, he did practise quite hard, sometimes using his own drills and techniques.|$|R

25|$|High {{population}} densities, poor living conditions, low vaccination rates, insufficient {{health-related data}} and inadequate health service engender {{a higher rate}} of disease transmission in slums than that in non-slum areas. Overcrowding leads to faster and wider spread of diseases due to the limited space in slum housing. Poor living conditions also make slum dwellers more vulnerable to certain diseases. Poor water quality, a manifest example, is a cause of many major illnesses including malaria, diarrhea and trachoma. As Sur et al. suggest, improving living conditions such as introduction of better sanitation and access to <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> can ameliorate the effects of diseases.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, {{because of}} {{extensive}} poaching and political scandal, the Army was authorized to protect Yellowstone {{although it was}} not called upon by the Secretary of the Interior to do so until 1886. The Army stayed in Yellowstone in an administrative capacity until 1916. After 1890, the Army also was called on to protect Sequoia, the General Grant tree, and Yosemite. In each of the Army parks, the War Department was compelled to erect <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> for its own use. Fort Yellowstone, Wyoming, was {{the most important of these}} complexes. The army buildings there were constructed to standard Army specifications. The Army had no direct interest in the landscape, and this was echoed in their architecture.|$|E
25|$|Secure {{land tenure}} is {{important}} for slum dwellers as an authentic recognition of their residential status in urban areas. It also encourages them to upgrade their housing facilities, which will give them protection against natural and unnatural hazards. Undocumented ownership with no legal title to the land also prevents slum settlers from applying for mortgage, which might worsen their financial situations. In addition, without registration of the land ownership, the government has difficulty in upgrading <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> and improving the living environment. Insecure tenure of the slum, as well as lack of socially and politically acceptable alternatives to slums, also creates difficulty in citywide infrastructure development such as rapid mass transit, electrical line and sewer pipe layout, highways and roads.|$|E

25|$|The Economy SkyCouch is {{available}} on the 787-9, 777-200ER and 777-300ER. It is a set of three Economy class seats on the window rows of the cabin that have armrests that retract into the seat back, and full leg rests that individually and manually can be raised to horizontal to form a flat surface extending {{to the back of the}} seats in front. It is largely designed for families for use as a flat play surface, and for couples, who on purchasing the middle seat for 25% more each, can use it as a flat sleeping surface. Each SkyCouch seat is equipped with the same <b>basic</b> <b>facilities</b> as a standard Pacific Economy seat. The Skycouch is only available on routes longer than 6 hours duration; where the aircraft are used on shorter routes, the leg rests are locked out and the Skycouch seats act as regular economy seats.|$|E
25|$|By 1942, {{there was}} no longer a need for an {{additional}} fighter airfield. With its name changed to RAF Lulsgate Bottom, the airfield was declared operational on 15 January 1942. The Miles Masters, Airspeed Oxfords and Hawker Hurricanes of No. 286 (AA Cooperation) Squadron became resident, with the duty of providing realistic exercises for ground anti-aircraft defences. However, as the site lacked some <b>basic</b> <b>facilities,</b> No. 286 moved to RAF Zeals in May. From 1 June 1942, the airfield was under No. 23 Group of Flying Training Command, and initially became a satellite airfield for No. 3 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit (3 (P)AFU), based at RAF South Cerney, flying Oxfords. In March 1943, No. 1540 Beam Approach Training Flight (1540 BATF) was formed at Lulsgate, again flying Oxfords. On 27 September 1943, 3 (P)AFU left Lulsgate for RAF Southrop, and was replaced on 1 October 1943 by No. 3 Flying Instructors School (3 FIS), which was previously headquartered at RAF Hullavington. 3 FIS flew mostly Oxfords and some Masters.|$|E
25|$|In general, Negev Bedouins {{have one}} of the highest school dropout rates in Israel. Between grades one and twelve, 85% of girls and 71% of boys drop out. As with many other areas, poor {{infrastructure}} (especially pronounced in the unrecognized villages, but also in the official towns) is a significant obstacle. The physical conditions of school buildings are often substandard, with many lacking in <b>basic</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as libraries, gyms, cafeterias, and heating and cooling systems. Under Israeli law, education is compulsory for all students between the ages of six and thirteen. However, indifference at the government level has meant that this law has not always been enforced with regards to the Negev Bedouin. Moreover, the government will not support infrastructure developments to schools in the unrecognized villages, as the official policy is to incentivize the relocation of the Bedouin into towns. As the building and maintenance of schools is a municipal matter, there are relatively fewer Bedouin schools (compared to the rest of Israeli society), and schools are often further away from most households.|$|E
