5000|$|Unfortunately for the Jews, this [...] "protection" [...] {{turned out}} to be largely theoretical. As recent {{research}} on the Holocaust shows—including Switzerland's own <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission</b> (2002) -- Swiss banks not only helped the Nazis to transfer large amounts of Jewish assets to Nazi accounts under duress, but also stonewalled demands for information on millions of accounts after World War II, destroyed bank records for more than 2.7 million account records, and [...] "disappeared" [...] at least $100 billion—in $2015 -- of Jewish wealth.|$|E
50|$|Due to the détente {{between the}} Soviet Union and the West, {{followed}} {{by the collapse of}} European communist regimes and end of the Cold War, Pro Libertate lost some of its purpose. It shifted toward advocating for a strong Swiss Army, and opposing efforts to abolish the Army or end conscription. In 1989 it fought the first ballot initiative to abolish the Army, by the Group for a Switzerland Without an Army, and it has organised opposition to every such initiative since. In connection with the critical reappraisal of the role of Switzerland during the Second World War in the 1990s, Pro Libertate supported the traditional, positive view of Switzerland's active duty servicemembers and of the government's choices, in a submission to the <b>Bergier</b> <b>commission.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{most infamous}} auction of Nazi looted art was the [...] "degenerate art' auction {{organized}} by Theodor Fischer (auctioneer) in Lucerne, Switzerland, 30 June 1939 at the Grand Hotel National. The artworks on offer had been [...] "de-accessioned" [...] from German museums by the Nazis, yet many well known art dealers participated {{as well as}} proxies for major collectors and museums. Public auctions were only the visible tip of the iceberg, as many sales operated by art dealers were private. The Commission for Art Recovery has characterized Switzerland as [...] "a magnet" [...] for assets from the rise of Hitler {{until the end of}} World War II. Researching and documenting Switzerland's role [...] "as an art-dealing centre and conduit for cultural assets in the Nazi period and in the immediate post-war period" [...] was one of the missions of the <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission,</b> under the directorship of Professor Georg Kreis.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{controversy}} {{over the role of}} the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank, [...] "must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries." [...] This was confirmed by the Swiss <b>Bergier</b> <b>commission</b> in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources, of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted. The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jewish persons executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.|$|E
50|$|Fischer used {{an agent}} in Darmstadt named Carl Bümming to {{negotiate}} with Adolf Hitler's art agent Karl Haberstock, who like Fischer had worked for Cassirer. In Switzerland, Fischer used the services of Swiss-resident German dealer Hans Wendland to import large quantities of looted art into the country for onward sale. In November 1942, Wendland received a whole railway wagon full of art from Paris. In 1943 he received a large quantity of art from Italy. According to Douglas Cooper, Wendland acted on behalf of Fischer in negotiating with Hermann Göring's art agent Walter Hofer, and Wendland and Fischer were partners {{in most of the}} transactions. The two had known each other since at least 1931 when Fischer had bailed Wendland out of some financial difficulties. According to Cooper, the value of trade between Fischer and Hofer for the two years to December 1942 was Swiss Francs 1,133,930. Trade between Hofer and Wendland between 1940 and January 1944 was French Francs 7,420,000 and Swiss Francs 258,000. Fischer also had close connections with the Zurich galleries Galerie Schmidlin and Galerie Neupert, both of which dealt in looted art. The ALIU and <b>Bergier</b> <b>commission</b> Reports also point to the importance of German refugee art dealers such as Fritz Nathan who acted as an intermediary between Fischer, Hofer and Emil Georg Bührle.|$|E
5000|$|The Volcker {{commission}} audit cost CHF 300 {{million and}} gave its final report in December 1999. It {{determined that the}} 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis, or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were [...] "probably" [...] related to victims of Nazi persecution. In addition the commission found [...] "no proof of systematic destruction of records of victim accounts, organized discrimination against the accounts of victims of Nazi persecution, or concerted efforts to divert the funds of victims of Nazi persecution to improper purposes." [...] It also [...] "confirmed evidence of questionable and deceitful actions by some individual banks in the handling of accounts of victims". The Volcker commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland. Under these rules, a total of $379.4 million was awarded to account holders or their heirs. [...] In cases where the claimant could be verified but {{the size of the}} account could not, a $125,000 award was given. The commission recommended that the remaining balance of the settlement should be given to other victims of Nazi persecution. The <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission</b> reached similar conclusions about the banks' conduct in its final report, and found that trade with Nazi Germany did not significantly prolong World War II.|$|E
50|$|Thürer {{graduated}} from the Law Faculty of the University of Zurich in 1970. Subsequently, he obtained an LL.M. at the University of Cambridge, and completed his Ph.D. thesis on self-determination in 1974. After conducting post-doctoral research at the University of Zurich (with Prof. Dietrich Schindler jun.), as {{a fellow at the}} Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, and the Harvard Law School, he was the Legal Adviser to the Government of the Canton of Aargau. In 1985, he was appointed to the Chair of International, European and Constitutional Law at the University of Zurich, which he held until 2010, and whose previous occupants include Max Huber and Dietrich Schindler sen. and jun. He was also director of the university's Institute of Public International Law. Professor Thürer has been teaching regularly at other universities as well. He was a Visiting Research Professor at the Stanford Law School, Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Hong Kong, member of the Advisory Board of the Concord Center, School of Law in Jerusalem, Visiting Research Professor at the Harvard Law School, Consultant and Honorary Professor at the Gujarat National Law University, Visiting Professor at the University of Cambridge (Herbert Smith Visiting Programme), Visiting Professor at the Institute of Higher International Studies, Panthéon-Assas University and at the Institut des droits de l'homme in Strasbourg.In addition to his teaching activities, Professor Thürer has been an expert for and member of numerous international institutions. In 1991, he was elected to Assembly, the supreme governing body of the International Committee of the Red Cross. In this capacity, he participated in missions to Zimbabwe, Zambia, Russia, Belarus, Poland, East Timor, India, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines and New Zealand. As CSCE/Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe expert (human rights dimension), he visited the Baltic States, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Moldavia and the Ukraine. Since 2004, he has been a Member of the Council of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)). He {{was a member of the}} Constitutional Court of Liechtenstein from 1989-2000.From 1993 to 1998, Professor Thürer was a member of the expert commission on the revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution. From 2000-2001, he was also a member of the so-called <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission,</b> which re-considered Swiss policies during the Second World War.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hearings}} led {{to international}} {{friction between the}} US and Switzerland, with boycotts of Swiss companies and products threatened in several US states. In Switzerland, the most controversial contention of the Eizenstat report was that Switzerland assisted the Nazis beyond what was necessary for a neutral country, and prolonged the war. Swiss public opinion was overwhelmingly against any settlement. The banks' position was that the settlement demands were grossly {{out of proportion to}} the value of unclaimed assets, and the Swiss government's position was that negotiations relating to laundering of assets looted by the Nazis were settled during previous agreements with the Allied governments and could not be reopened, because no new historical information had come to light. [...] Audits of dormant accounts ordered by the Swiss government in 1962 and 1995 showed a total of $32 million (1995 dollars) in unclaimed war-era accounts. The WJC rejected initial offers from the banks and demanded payment of $1.8 billion to settle the lawsuit. During the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to pay for another audit—headed by ex Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker—of wartime accounts. This audit committee consisted of three representatives from the banks, and three representatives from the Jewish groups. NY City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi {{played a crucial role in}} the negotiations, convening a meeting in December 1997 with Swiss bank executives and Democratic Party state treasurers to discuss sanctions such as divesting state funds from Swiss banks and withholding licenses. [...] Hevesi also withheld an operating license for the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland with Swiss Bank Corporation, who together made $4 billion in profits per year in New York City. Author Angelo Codevilla (see Reference 7) argues that this was essentially blackmail of the banks by state banking officials, with backing of the US administration, to force a settlement between the banks and the WJC. Negotiations involving the banks, the WJC, and Undersecretary Eizenstat ultimately resulted in a settlement of $1.25 billion in August 1998. The Swiss government refused to take part in the settlement, and started a CHF 300 million Special Fund for Holocaust Victims with the Swiss National Bank. [...] It also commissioned an independent panel of international scholars known as the <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission</b> to study the relationship between Switzerland and the Nazi regime.|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} second Bergier report {{offers a}} wealth of information as well as some useful and valuable analytical insights, but it also suffers from a number of shortcomings and weaknesses, some of which are quite serious. The significance of important facts is not worked out properly. The abundant numerical data remain unexploited. The analysis is often repetitious and sometimes inconsistent. Many interpreta-tions are far-fetched. The general image of Switzerland's refugee policy it paints is difficult to reconcile with several central facts. Its severe judgements therefore seem to rest on fragile foundations. For all these reasons, a very different and, in part, a novel analysis of Switzerland's policy and practice vis-à-vis the refugees is proposed in a constructive spirit, an analysis that seems fully corroborated by the available information and numerical data. history; World War II; Switzerland; refugees; <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission...</b>|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{the data}} on {{civilian}} refugees admitted by Switzerland during the war are accepted by all, the figures on persons turned away are much more uncertain. Everyone uses today the 1996 estimates by Guido Koller. It is shown that these estimates were calculated in a questionable manner and that they greatly inflate the number of civilian refugees who were turned away. If more recent and reliable figures are taken instead, the estimated admission rates {{turn out to be}} very high for the asylum candidates in general and even more so for the Jews among them; the conclusion being that Swiss practice vis-à-vis the refugees during the war was actually quite generous. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Switzerland did the maximum of what it could reasonably be expected to do. A general policy model vis-à-vis the refugees (then) and vis-à-vis the asylum seekers (today) is presented and explained. history; World War II; Switzerland; refugees; <b>Bergier</b> <b>Commission...</b>|$|E
