40|$|Publicly owned or {{commissioned}} {{banks were}} common in Europe from the 15 th century. This survey argues {{that while the}} early public banks were characterized by great experimentation in their design, a common goal {{was to create a}} liquid and reliable monetary asset in environments where such assets were rare or unavailable. The success of these banks was, however, never guaranteed, and even well-run banks could become unstable over time as their success made them susceptible to fiscal exploitation. The popularization of <b>bearer</b> <b>notes</b> in the 18 th century broadened the user base for the public banks' money but was also accompanied by increased fiscal abuse. Wartime demands of the Napoleonic Era resulted in the reorganization or dissolution of many early public banks. A prominent exception was the Bank of England, whose adept management of a fiscally backed money provided a foundation for the development of central banks as they exist today...|$|R

50|$|According to {{the real}} bills doctrine, {{unrestricted}} intermediation either by private banks or by a central bank has a beneficial economic effect. The doctrine proposes unrestricted discounting of real billsevidences of indebtedness which, in accordance with Adam Smith's definition, are safe or free of default risk. The doctrine asserts that one function of banks is to issue notes or similar liabilities that are more convenient and easily held as assets than the bills being discounted. The keystone of the doctrine is that no government regulation ought to restrict the scope of such intermediation. In particular, market forces through competitive banking can be relied on to prevent excess credit creation. Moreover, if there happen to exist regulations that inhibit private intermediation - for example regulations that prohibit banks from issuing <b>bearer</b> <b>notes</b> that make a central bank the monopoly issuer of currency-like assets, then the central bank ought to conduct open-market operations or provide a discount window in order to vitiate such restrictions. By doing this, it brings together borrowers and lenders who might otherwise not be matched.|$|R

(Throughout the imperial era, soldiers were usually portrayed in non-combat mode). Note the off-white, long-sleeved tunics. The swastika embroidered {{on the left}} tunic was a mystical symbol, possibly of Indo-European origin, representing the universe and was commonly used by the Romans as a decorative motif.

The common man usually thinks that paper money is the real money, while in fact it is only a promissory <b>note</b> promising the <b>bearer</b> of the <b>note</b> the payment of the same amount (in coins, if not in gold) by the Reserve Bank. In the past, however, governments did deny such payment in exchange of the notes and one government even made the holding of gold by the citizens as illegal...|$|R

5000|$|The Japanese {{invasion}} money {{used in the}} Netherlands Indies {{was first}} denominated in Gulden (1942) [...] and later in Roepiah (1944-45). The Gulden issue bears the payment obligation [...] "De Japansche Regeering Betaalt Aan Toonder" [...] (The Japanese Government pays to the <b>bearer)</b> on <b>notes</b> one-half Gulden and above. On smaller change notes (1-10 cents) it is shortened to “De Japansche Regeering”. All Japanese invasion money used in the Netherlands Indies bear the block prefix letter “S” either followed by a number (lower denominations, 1-10 cents), a second letter, or as the numerator in a fractional block layout. Serial numbers {{were used for the}} initial printings of higher denomination notes (i.e., 1, 5, and 10 Gulden) but the printing machinery used by the Japanese after March 1943 (i.e., Kolff printing facility in Jakarta) did not allow for automatic sequential numbering thus the task was very slow and often resulted in multiple notes with the same serial number. By the middle of the second printing (the SB block) serial numbers were abandoned. Notes of one-half gulden and above are printed on paper watermarked with a repeating kiri flower.|$|R

60|$|Well was it {{for those}} who could get away! Never had the spring been sourer; Easter came so early as itself to seem untimely, and the Wednesday of its week was bleakness itself, as Lance and Robina stood {{on the top of}} the viaduct over the railway, looking over the parapet at the long {{perspective}} of rails and electric wires their faces screwed up, and reddened in unnatural places by the bitter blast. Felix had asked at breakfast if any one would be the <b>bearer</b> of a <b>note</b> to Marshlands; Lance had not very willingly volunteered, because no one else would; then Robina joined him, and they had proceeded through the town without a syllable from either of the usually lively tongues, till as they stood from force of habit watching for a train, the following colloquy took place, Robina being the first speaker.|$|R
50|$|A {{hearing on}} a writ of audita querela {{was a full}} trial {{on the merits of}} the case, rather than a simple {{procedural}} hearing, and could result in both equitable remedies as well as summary judgment. The expense of pursuing a full trial was one of the factors that led to the writ's decline by the late 1660s, particularly as many plaintiffs only sought summary judgment, and English courts became more willing to entertain much cheaper to pursue motions for summary judgment. Two English statutes in particular, in allowing relatively simple affidavits in ex parte proceedings to secure summary judgment, led to an increase in their use in place of audita querela: the Charities Procedure Act 1812 and the Summary Procedure on Bills of Exchange Act 1855. The former granted several English courts greater liberty to review affidavits and award summary relief in cases involving charitable trusts. The latter permitted <b>bearers</b> of promissory <b>notes</b> and endorsed bills of exchange to pursue ex parte proceedings for summary judgment through the filing of an affidavit.|$|R
60|$|The first {{emotion that}} stirred Barnaby {{was one of}} extreme and {{profound}} amazement. Then the thought came into his mind that some witty fellow, of whom he knew a good many in that town--and wild, waggish pranks they were--was attempting to play off some smart jest upon him. But all that Miss Eliza could tell him when he questioned her concerning the messenger was that the <b>bearer</b> of the <b>note</b> was a tall, stout man, with a red neckerchief {{around his neck and}} copper buckles to his shoes, and that he had the appearance of a sailorman, having a great big queue hanging down his back. But, Lord! what was such a description as that in a busy seaport town, full of scores of men to fit such a likeness? Accordingly, our hero put away the note into his wallet, determining to show it to his good friend Mr. Greenfield that evening, and to ask his advice upon it. So he did show it, and that gentleman's opinion was the same as his--that some wag was minded to play off a hoax upon him, and that the matter of the letter was all nothing but smoke.|$|R
6000|$|... [Washington {{had been}} an anxious spectator of the battle from the {{opposite}} side of the Hudson. The action about the lines to the south lay open to him. When he saw Cadwalader assailed in flank, the line broken, and his troops overpowered by numbers, he gave up the game as lost. Seeing the flag from Knyphausen's division go into the fort, he wrote a note to Magaw, telling him that if he could hold out until evening and the place could not be maintained, he would endeavor to bring off the garrison. Captain Gooch offered to be the <b>bearer</b> of the <b>note.</b> He crossed in a small boat, landed on the bank, ran up to the fort and delivered the message. It came too late.] [...] "The fort was so crowded by the garrison and the troops which had retreated into it that it was difficult to move about. The enemy, too, were in possession of the little redoubts around, and could have poured in showers of shells and ricochet balls that would have made dreadful slaughter." [...] It was no longer possible for Magaw to get his troops to man the lines: he was compelled, therefore, to yield himself and his garrison prisoners of war. The only terms granted them were that the men should retain their baggage and the officers their swords.|$|R
60|$|The first {{emotion that}} stirred Barnaby True {{was one of}} extreme and {{profound}} astonishment; the second thought that came into his mind was that maybe some witty fellow--of whom he knew a good many in that place, and wild, mad rakes they were as ever the world beheld--was attempting to play off a smart, witty jest upon him. Indeed, Miss Eliza Bolles, who was of a lively, mischievous temper, was not herself above playing such a prank should the occasion offer. With this thought in his mind Barnaby inquired of her with {{a good deal of}} particularity concerning the appearance and condition of the man who had left the note, to all of which Miss replied with so straight a face and so candid an air that he could no longer suspect her of being concerned in any trick against him, and so eased his mind of any such suspicion. The <b>bearer</b> of the <b>note,</b> she informed him, was a tall, lean man, with a red neckerchief tied around his neck and with copper buckles to his shoes, and he had the appearance of a sailor-man, having a great queue of red hair hanging down his back.
