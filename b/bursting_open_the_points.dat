60|$|Sutton <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door. Big, blustering, wet in his immense grey coat, he {{came into}} the dining-room.|$|R
60|$|Applying their united strength--with some {{assistance}} from Teddy Malone, and earnest encouragement from Mrs Lynch--they succeeded in <b>bursting</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> hatch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, there's a cab at the door!" [...] cried Inglewood, {{springing}} {{up with an}} unconscious energy and <b>bursting</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> glass doors that led into the garden.|$|R
60|$|Up {{the grand}} {{staircase}} I rushed, <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> pair of huge folding doors which faced me, and learned at last that my efforts were in vain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mother, mother!' cried {{two young}} people, <b>bursting</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} pretty dining-room of Bridgefield Rectory, where the grown-up {{part of the family}} were {{lingering}} over a late breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "The key of the church!" [...] I {{shouted to}} the clerk. [...] "We must try it that way--we may save him yet {{if we can}} <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> inner door." ...|$|R
60|$|And without {{listening}} {{to his wife and}} children, who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home, he ran across to <b>the</b> tavern and <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R
6000|$|At that inauspicious {{moment a}} spark {{fell from the}} pipe! Next moment <b>the</b> door was <b>burst</b> <b>open,</b> <b>the</b> window blown out, Hockins was laid fiat on his back, while Ebony went head-over-heels upon the floor! ...|$|R
60|$|It did {{not take}} them long to <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the cave, and then each one seized as many toys as he could carry and they all flew to Claus and laid the {{treasure}} before him.|$|R
60|$|Although {{knowing full}} well that we were not {{proceeding}} in accordance with the law, since we had no authority for forcing an entrance into a dwelling, we <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> rear door, and made thorough examination of the place.|$|R
60|$|He <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door. Why did he stand transfixed {{with open}} mouth and {{distended}} eyeballs? Was the sight too horrible to be borne? On the contrary, before him, in her peerless beauty, stood Genevra Tompkins, leaning on her father's arm.|$|R
60|$|On {{that day}} I {{was sitting in}} my room a little before supper, when John Paul <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door with no civility of knocking, and told me there was one below that wished {{to speak with the}} steward; sneering at the name of my office.|$|R
6000|$|... "And thinks your lordship such gallants would mind these impediments? {{such are}} {{the very essence of}} the adventures which they come to seek.--The Knight of the Swan would swim through the moat--he of the Eagle would fly over the wails--he of <b>the</b> Thunderbolt would <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> gates." ...|$|R
60|$|I had <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> ends of {{my fingers}} {{at the very}} first, and during the reefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks. And when all was done, I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion.|$|R
60|$|Mr Chuzzlewit {{no sooner}} {{gathered}} {{who these people}} were, than he <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> coach-door somehow or other, and came tumbling out among them; and as if the lunacy of Mr Tapley were contagious, he immediately began to shake hands too, and exhibit every demonstration of the liveliest joy.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} sound of tumult, Achmet--who was {{seated at the}} time on his {{accustomed}} throne of judgment, ready to transact the ordinary business of the morning--sprang up and roused his pet lion to a sudden and towering pitch of fury by thrusting <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of his dagger into it. The result was that when <b>the</b> door <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> huge creature sprang into {{the midst of the}} insurgents with a tremendous roar.|$|R
60|$|Phil was {{cut short}} by <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> <b>open</b> of <b>the</b> door and the sudden {{entrance}} of his friend George Aspel.|$|R
5000|$|... "Beneath {{the blazing}} of the sun, in that morning of new growth, the {{countryside}} rang with song, as its belly swelled {{with a black}} and avenging army of men, germinating slowly in its furrows, growing upwards in readiness for harvests to come, until one day soon their ripening would <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> earth itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have no fear}} in {{her company}} that a husband may rush back from the country, <b>the</b> door <b>burst</b> <b>open,</b> <b>the</b> dog bark, the house shake with the din, the woman, deathly pale, leap from her bed, her complicit maid shriek, she fearing for her limbs, her guilty {{mistress}} for her dowry and I for myself." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{one of his}} incalculable motions he sprang {{back and}} <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> doors into the garden. At the same time also, {{with one of his}} {{gestures}} that never seemed at the instant so unconventional as they were, he stretched out his hand to Mary Gray, and led her out on to the lawn as if for a dance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{it calls}} on Abel Hunt?" [...] a {{familiar}} voice from the outside cried, causing the blood to run chill in my veins, and almost {{at the same instant}} <b>the</b> door was <b>burst</b> <b>open,</b> <b>the</b> flimsy barriers we had set against it being of no avail as opposed to the strength of him who threw all his strength upon it.|$|R
60|$|And Iron-strong heard, and said: 'Yes, he is {{certainly}} calling, {{we must go}} at once.' And in an instant he had <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door, and all three were bounding away {{in the direction of}} the voice. When they reached the foot of the tree Peter just said: 'At him!' And in a few minutes there was nothing left of Eisenkopf.|$|R
60|$|For {{hours the}} storm raged without the {{slightest}} signs of abatement. The sea was now terrific; the waist of the ship was full of water. Green seas swept over the vessel's bows, carrying everything before them, and pouring aft <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> cabin door and deluged the cabin. By turns the boys {{made their way to}} the door and looked out.|$|R
60|$|The train slowed down: Yarmouth! One more station, then. Siegmund {{watched the}} platform, shiny with rain, slide past. On the dry grey under the shelter, one white {{passenger}} was waiting. Suddenly Siegmund's heart leaped up, wrenching wildly. He <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door, and caught hold of Helena. She dilated, gave a palpitating cry as he dragged {{her into the}} carriage.|$|R
50|$|He ravished {{his mother}} once, {{and as he}} tried a second time, Yemaja fell and <b>burst</b> <b>open,</b> whereupon <b>the</b> fifteen Orishas came forth from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "No human {{can fight}} against the powers of magic," [...] {{returned}} the King in a surly voice. [...] "That boy is either a fairy or {{under the protection of}} fairies. We escaped with our lives only because we were quick to run away; but, should we return to Regos, the same terrible power that <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> city gates would crush us all to atoms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word. He {{lives at}} the lodge with his mother, and as {{he was a very}} {{faithful}} fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there. Of course this Acton business has put every one on their guard. The robber must have just <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door--the lock has been forced--when William came upon him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nirarbuda (刺部陀), the [...] "burst blister" [...] Naraka, is even {{colder than}} Arbuda. There, <b>the</b> {{blisters}} <b>burst</b> <b>open,</b> leaving <b>the</b> beings' bodies covered with frozen blood and pus.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 March 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, in {{an event}} {{known as the}} [...] "Ermenonville air disaster", crashed in Ermenonville forest after {{take-off}} from Orly on a flight to London's Heathrow Airport when an improperly closed cargo door <b>burst</b> <b>open.</b> <b>The</b> explosive decompression that resulted brought down the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. All 346 people on board were killed, making the accident one of the deadliest in aviation history.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Tristram arms himself] So it {{was done}} as Sir Tristram commanded, and when all those were {{gathered}} together, and their horses ready, Sir Tristram {{and several of the}} knights of his party went openly to that tower where the Lady Belle Isoult was prisoner. And they <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> doors and went in with torches, and found Belle Isoult and her attendant in {{the upper part of the}} castle.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{this video}} {{was also used}} for {{promotion}} for Pepsi. In the commercial, people from the audience are holding Pepsi cans, which <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> to <b>the</b> rhythm of the song.|$|R
50|$|In the TV series Tough Nuts, Read {{also spoke}} of his mid-1980s to early 1990s rivalry with Alphonse Gangitano. Read {{explained}} {{that he had a}} disagreement with Gangitano regarding an elderly neighbourhood hero whom Gangitano admired. It is alleged by Read that Gangitano <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> toilet cubicle door with a number of associates and began a serious assault on Read who made his escape but not before spreading his faeces into Gangitano's face.|$|R
50|$|Another {{challenge}} the photographer faces with exposure timing {{is having to}} estimate how long to expose the image in relation to when <b>the</b> firework <b>bursts.</b> <b>Opening</b> <b>the</b> shutter just before the firework bursts and then closing it after its finished would provide the ideal timing for capturing that 'perfect moment'. This {{can be achieved by}} setting the camera to 'b' or 'bulb' whereby exposure times are under the direct control of the photographer through the shutter release button.|$|R
50|$|The Prussian {{columns of}} attack, {{advancing}} at the pas de charge (at the double), drove the French {{out of the}} Namur suburb, and endeavoured to gain possession of {{the gates of the}} town. Colonel Zastrow, the second in command of the Sixth Brigade, wished to <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> gate which leads to the Louvain road; but was repulsed by a most murderous fire of musketry and grape, directed upon the assailants from the walls of the town.|$|R
50|$|They plundered the palace, treasury., and <b>the</b> harem. They <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> {{treasure}} chests and gems, gold, silver, silk, and pearls were looted. Vijayabahu's valuables and royal wardrobe were tossed {{from hand}} to hand. However strict orders were conveyed by beating drums, {{that none of the}} citizens to be harmed so to prevent looting in the streets. Meanwhile Vijayabahu was allowed to escape to the upper storey. He locked himself in a room with two of his concubines.|$|R
6000|$|High {{up on the}} fells {{a little}} cottage stood perched on a cliff. It {{was one of the}} [...] "saeters" [...] or {{mountain}} dairies where the cattle were pastured in summer long ago--just as they are at the present day. Alric ran up the steep face of the hill, doubled swiftly round the corner of <b>the</b> enclosure, <b>burst</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door, and, springing in, held up the token, while he wiped the streaming perspiration from his face.|$|R
