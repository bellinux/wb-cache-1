5|$|Madness in the Fast Lane is the BBC documentary, first {{broadcast}} on BBC One on 10 August 2010, which brought {{the story of}} Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the public consciousness. The footage on the M6 motorway of the two women jumping into the passing traffic had previously been {{broadcast on}} Motorway Cops, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time {{the rest of the}} story had been told.|$|E
5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. An earlier version of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} consisting of Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore, most of it traveled with the iron as it sank into Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth {{at the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hard evidence of an impact.|$|E

25|$|By 09:13 UTC, {{the cargo}} ship Laurentian Forest {{discovered}} {{wreckage of the}} aircraft and many bodies floating in the water. India's civil aviation minister announced {{the possibility that the}} plane had been destroyed by a bomb, and the cause was probably some sort of explosion. Previous 747s had been damaged or destroyed on the ground, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> jumbo jet downed by sabotage.|$|E
25|$|How to Train Your Dragon was {{composer}} John Powell's sixth {{collaboration with}} DreamWorks Animation. Powell had scored many of DreamWorks' previous films, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of DreamWorks' films where Powell helmed the score {{on his own}} (on his previous efforts with DreamWorks, he had collaborated with other composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams and Hans Zimmer). Zimmer had long praised Powell's abilities, and on many occasions, asserted {{that he was the}} superior composer between them, thus firmly supporting Powell's first solo animation effort. For the score, Powell utilized many Celtic influences, employing instruments like the fiddle, bagpipes, dulcimer, pennywhistle, and even a harpsichord.|$|E
25|$|Two {{teams from}} ACS (Primary) {{went to the}} OM World Finals in Maryland 2008 and won 1st and 3rd positions. The team that {{achieved}} 1st place had taken part in OM for two years <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time they had reached the world finals. The third-placed team were competing {{for the second time}} and this was their second time in the World Finals. The first time they were in the World Finals (2007), they became champions. Four teams from ACS(I) also took part in the finals, with two of them returning World Champions. The two ACS (Barker Road) and the two ACS (Junior) teams also took part in the World Finals.|$|E

25|$|After her construction, Eastland was {{discovered}} to have design flaws, making her susceptible to listing. The ship was top-heavy, which became evident when passengers congregated en masse {{on the upper}} decks. During July 1903, a case of overcrowding caused Eastland to list with water flowing {{up one of the}} ship's gangplanks. The situation was quickly rectified, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of several incidents. Later in the same month, the stern of the ship was damaged when she was backed into the tugboat George W. Gardner. During August 1906, another incident of listing occurred which resulted in the filing of complaints against the Chicago-South Haven Line which had purchased the ship earlier that year.|$|E
25|$|The Karnataka State Industrial Security Force (KISF) is {{responsible}} for security on the Namma Metro. Bangalore Police conducted detailed mock drills at metro stations {{for the first time}} on 25 March 2017. Police officials stated that the drill was to assess readiness to deal with situations such as hoax bomb calls, terrorist infiltration or attacks. Sniffer dogs, bomb detection and disposal squad, anti-sabotage squad and Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) were involved in the drill. Police had previously conducted basic mock drills, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one aimed toward dealing with specific threats. The chosen day was a Saturday, when crowds are usually larger, in order to make the drill more challenging for officers. The BMRCL has not informed of the drill in advance.|$|E
25|$|Earlier British {{science fiction}} shows with marionettes and soap operas had interracial casting, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> American live-action series to do this. At {{a time when}} there were few non-white or foreign roles in American {{television}} dramas, Roddenberry created a multi-ethnic crew for the Enterprise, including an African woman (Uhura), a Scotsman (Montgomery Scott), a Japanese American (Hikaru Sulu), and—most notably—an alien, the half-Vulcan Spock. In the second season, reflecting the contemporaneous Cold War, Roddenberry added a Russian crew member, (Pavel Chekov). The original series is also credited with American television's first interracial kiss, between a white man and an African-American woman, although this had happened earlier in a British medical soap opera, Emergency– Ward 10. Also, the spy show I Spy, featured a scripted, unedited interracial kiss between Robert Culp (white) and France Nuyen (Vietnamese) in the episode 'The Tiger,'; a kiss that wouldn't gain the controversy or attention as the Star Trek kiss.|$|E

2500|$|By 1971, Malmö reached 265,000 inhabitants, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> peak {{which would}} stand {{for more than}} 30 years.(Svedala was {{for a few years}} in the early 1970s a part of Malmö municipality) ...|$|R
25|$|Another bold {{move in the}} show's final months saw Number 96 feature {{what was}} publicised as Australian television's first full frontal nude scene when new {{character}} Miss Hemingway (Deborah Gray) made {{the first of several}} unveilings in April 1977. Number 96 in 1976 had shown a bit-part nurse fleeing Dudley's bedroom which revealed a full frontal nude flash <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time such nudity was shown front and centre in protracted scenes. In one outrageous moment, Miss Hemingway wore a bra but no panties and yet despite screening at 8.30pm on free-to-air TV, there were barely any complaints (but when the same scene was shown on the ABC during Four Corners, {{the bottom of the screen}} was blacked out). Other bedroom farce comedy sequences of the period featured increasing levels of male and female semi-nudity, and some other instances of full frontal female nudity. Meanwhile, a scene where Jane Chester becomes a prostitute and is asked to whip her male client, new Number 96 resident Toby Buxton (Malcolm Thompson) gave viewers a brief glimpse of full frontal male nudity.|$|E
25|$|Such was O'Brien's {{effect on}} the team was that, along with batsman Paul Stirling, {{he was one of}} two Ireland players shortlisted for Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at the 2011 ICC Awards. Although a full-strength team played against England in an ODI in August, county {{commitments}} meant many of Ireland's senior players were unavailable to play in the team's opening match of the 2011–13 Intercontinental Cup. With regular captain William Porterfield playing for Warwickshire and Trent Johnston who often stood in injured, O'Brien was chosen to lead Ireland against Namibia. He had led Ireland in one-day matches before, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time he had captained in first-class cricket. In October Ireland sent a seven-man squad captained by O'Brien to participate in the Hong Kong Sixes. At the start of 2012 O'Brien was made Ireland's vice captain, taking over the role from Trent Johnston. Soon after, Cricket Ireland increased the number of players with contracts from 15 to 23; O'Brien was one of four players to be given a category A contract.|$|E
500|$|Before The Fiery Trial, {{several of}} Foner's works had {{discussed}} Lincoln, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{of his books}} to study the president directly. Foner began the book because he believed [...] "that it was still possible to say something new, despite the voluminous literature that's out there." ...|$|E
50|$|He wanted, {{like many}} German princes, {{to repeat the}} splendor of the court of the King Louis XIV of France in his own duchy; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cause of his {{financial}} ruin.|$|R
50|$|Greatest Hits Live is a live album by the Canadian {{rock band}} April Wine, {{released}} in 1997. Also known as King Biscuit Flower Hour, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> label it <b>was</b> released under.|$|R
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> {{case with}} S. Recall that because S {{is part of}} a private language, it is not {{possible}} to provide an explicit definition of S.

500|$|... 1983 was {{the first}} season for which the National Hurricane Center issued numeric {{landfall}} probabilities. Probabilities had been calculated for prior storms {{for use in the}} issuing of hurricane watches and warnings, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time the raw numeric probabilities were released to the public. The probabilities issued were accurate during Alicia, indicating that Galveston and surrounding portions of the upper Texas coast were the most likely area to be struck.|$|E
500|$|Later in the month, Hunter's {{campaign}} website was hacked by anti-war activists. For a few hours, the words, [...] "hacked by Adnali f0r TurkStorm [...] org No War!" [...] above {{images of}} children in a warzone were posted to Hunter's site. Turkstorm.org, cited in the hacking, appeared to have no connection as IP analysis identified the hackers location in Germany. Roy Tyler revealed that hackers had attempted to change the website at least six times, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> successful alteration.|$|E
500|$|The Department of Defense {{released}} filmed footage on May 16, 2006, {{that was}} recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight77 {{crashing into the}} Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a [...] "thin white blur" [...] and an explosion following. The images were made public {{in response to a}} December 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch.

500|$|The album's artwork {{followed}} Chuck D's {{concept of}} two planets, the [...] "Black" [...] planet and Earth, eclipsing. The group enlisted B.E. Johnson, a NASA illustrator, {{to create the}} cover. Cey Adams, creative director for Def Jam at the time, later said of the creative decision for the artwork, [...] "It was so interesting {{to me that a}} black hip-hop act did an illustration for their album cover. At that time black hip-hop artists, for the most part, had photos of themselves on their covers. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time someone took a chance to do something in the rock'n'roll vein".|$|E
2500|$|His most {{controversial}} Test match was {{the game at}} Lord's in 1960 between England and South Africa when he no-balled the South African fast-medium bowler Geoff Griffin 11 times for throwing. He and other umpires had already called Griffin for throwing earlier in the season, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time a touring team bowler had been called in a Test match. When the Lord's Test ended early, Lee's fellow umpire Syd Buller called Griffin again in the [...] "friendly" [...] match that was arranged {{to fill in the}} time, and the action of both umpires was instrumental in ending Griffin's career and in bringing to a head the problems of throwing and dragging that had affected international cricket for several years.|$|E
2500|$|Yasser Arafat, {{claimed the}} Battle of Karameh {{as a victory}} (in Arabic, [...] "karameh" [...] means [...] "dignity") and quickly became a Palestinian {{national}} hero; portrayed as one who dared to confront Israel. Masses of young Arabs {{joined the ranks of}} his group Fatah. Under pressure, Ahmad Shukeiri resigned from the PLO leadership and in July 1969, Fatah joined and soon controlled the PLO. The fierce Palestinian guerrilla fighting and the Jordanian Artillery bombardment forced the IDF withdrawal and gave the Palestinian Arabs an important morale boost. Israel was calling their army the indomitable army <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> chance for Arabs to claim victory after defeat in 1948, '53, and '67. After the battle, Fatah began to engage in communal projects to achieve popular affiliation. After the Battle of Karameh there was a subsequent increase in the PLO's strength.|$|E
