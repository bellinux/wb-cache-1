However, {{in order to allow}} a uniform air pressure even with only some nozzles, air bearing manufacturers take constructive techniques. In doing so, these air bearings cause dead volumes (non-compressible and thus weak air volume).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{simulate}} and determine a hydrodynamic pressure distribution in a lubrication gap of slide conical <b>bearing</b> <b>gap,</b> assuming that the lubricating oil has non-Newtonian properties. Investigations were carried out by using the commercial CFD software ANSYS Academic Research for fluid flow phenomenon (Fluent). Calculations were performed for bearings without misalignment, i. e. where the cone generating line of bearing shaft {{is parallel to the}} cone generating line of bearing sleeve. The Ostwald-de Waele model for non-Newtonian fluids was adopted in this simulation. The coefficients of Ostwald-de Waele relationship were determined by application of the least squares approximation method and fitting curves described by this model to the experimental data, obtained for motor oils. The calculated hydrodynamic pressure distributions were compared with the data obtained for corresponding bearings, but assuming that lubricating oil has Newtonian properties. In this research, the Gümbel boundary condition (also known as half-Sommerfeld condition) was imposed. Moreover, there was assumed: a steady-state operating conditions of a bearing, laminar, incompressible flow of lubricating oil, no slip on bearing surfaces, negligible heat conduction effect of bearing material, pressure on the side surfaces of <b>bearing</b> <b>gap</b> is equal to atmospheric pressure, no oil supply and oil outflow from <b>bearing</b> <b>gap.</b> This paper presents results for bearings with different rotational speeds and of different <b>bearing</b> <b>gap</b> heights.

Here, we report the identification of a new paxillin-binding protein, PAG 3 (paxillin-associated protein with ADP-ribosylation factor [ARF] GTPase-activating protein [GAP] activity, number 3), which is involved in regulation of the subcellular localization of paxillin. PAG 3 bound to all paxillin isoforms and was induced during monocyte maturation, at which time paxillin expression is also increased and integrins are activated. PAG 3 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm in premature monocytes but became localized at cell periphery in mature monocytes, a fraction of which then colocalized with paxillin. PAG 3, on the other hand, did not accumulate at focal adhesion plaques, suggesting that PAG 3 is not an integrin assembly protein.

The impact of design assumptions on the capacity estimates and dynamic characteristics of a multi-span curved bridge are investigated. A single nine-span bridge is studied whilst the level of attention to detail is significantly higher than can be achieved in a mass parametric study of a population of bridges. The objective is achieved by in-depth investigation of the bridge representing the ???as-designed??? (including features assumed in the design process) and that representing the ???as-built??? (actual expected characteristics) structure. Three-dimensional detailed dynamic response simulations of the investigated bridge including soil-structure interaction effects are undertaken. The behavior of the ???as-designed??? bridge is investigated on two different analytical platforms for elastic and inelastic analysis. A third idealization is adopted to investigate the ???as-built??? behavior by realistically modeling bridge <b>bearings,</b> structural <b>gaps</b> and materials. A comprehensive list of local and global, action and deformation, performance indicators are selected to monitor the response to earthquake action, including bearing slippage and segment collision. The adopted methodology and results of elastic and inelastic analyses are discussed. The comparative study has indicated that the lateral capacity and dynamic characteristics of the as-designed bridge are significantly different than the as-built behavior. The potential of pushover analysis in identifying structural deficiencies, estimation of capacities and providing insight into the pertinent limit state criteria are demonstrated.

This element is especially critical for the new generation non-spherical head designs. Bonnet polishing which is used successfully in the area of optics is potentially an excellent finishing process to control the form and finish of artificial joints. In the process of form control polishing an “influence function” which defines the material removal rate is of vital importance in developing a corrective polishing procedure.
