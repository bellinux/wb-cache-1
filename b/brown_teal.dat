Black swan, shoveler, mallards, and dabchicks live on the lake, and kingfishers, pukeko, harriers, kererū, and welcome swallows are also present.|$|E
25|$|The {{lake was}} {{the home of the}} Māori Muaūpoko iwi, who lived in several villages around it and {{harvested}} longfin and shortfin eels, waterfowl, and kakahi from its wetlands. <b>Brown</b> <b>teal</b> were chased into snares hung just above the water. The forest was preserved for its groves of kie kie, which produced a sweet fruit and much-prized succulent flower bracts (called tāwhara). The main island, Papaitonga (1.2 ha), was cleared and planted in groves of karaka trees, and a smaller man-made island, Papawharangi (0.3 ha), was built in 1820 from canoe-loads of soil and mussel shells. Both were fortified to use as pā in times of war.In 1822, Te Rauparaha and the Ngāti Toa arrived in the area. They were initially welcomed, but after the murder of a Muaūpoko woman Te Rauparaha narrowly escaped being assassinated; his son and daughter were killed. He and his warriors vowed revenge, and eventually returned and massacred 600 Muaūpoko on Papaitonga Island; the tribe was defeated and lost their territory, influence, and prestige. The lake was taken over by a hapū of Ngāti Raukawa, and ever since ownership and use of it has been contested by both them and descendants of the surviving Muaūpoko.|$|E

500|$|Explorers' journals, as a {{literary}} genre, often provide descriptions of black swans. For example, in December 1836, Lieutenant Bunbury of the 21st Fusiliers was the first European to travel overland from Pinjarra to the Vasse, describing the mudflats of the Leschenault Estuary at sunset covered by [...] "...immense flocks of <b>brown</b> ducks and <b>teal,</b> while the water was equally covered with swans and pelicans." ...|$|R
500|$|The duck {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 {{and given the}} name Anas fulva but the name was [...] "preoccupied," [...] or already used, by Friedrich Christian Meuschen in 1787 for another species. This led to the next available name proposed by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816 from a Paraguayan specimen as Anas bicolor The whistling ducks were moved to their current genus, Dendrocygna, by British ornithologist William John Swainson in recognition of their differences from other ducks. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek dendron, [...] "tree", and Latin cygnus, [...] "swan", and [...] bicolor is Latin for [...] "two-coloured". [...] "Fulvous" [...] means reddish-yellow, and is derived from the Latin equivalent fulvus. Old and regional names include large whistling <b>teal,</b> <b>brown</b> tree duck, Mexican duck, squealer and Spanish cavalier.|$|R
5000|$|Parts to be niter blued are steel {{which has}} been {{polished}} and cleaned, then immersed in a bath of molten salts; typically potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate (sometimes with 9.4 g of manganese dioxide per lb of total nitrate). The mixture is heated to [...] and the parts are suspended in this solution with wire. The parts must be observed constantly for colour change. The cross section and size of parts will affect {{the outcome of the}} finish and time it takes to achieve. This method must not be used on critically heat-treated parts such as receivers, slides or springs. It is generally employed on smaller parts such as pins, screws, sights, etc. The colours will range through straw, gold, <b>brown,</b> purple, blue, <b>teal,</b> then black. Examples of this finish can be seen commonly on older pocket watches whose hands exhibit what is called [...] "peacock blue", a rich iridescent blue.|$|R

Additionally, the Park attracts a range of native species {{to live in the}} Park grounds (such as bellbird) through habitat restoration initiatives.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} a {{scientific}} reserve holding many native {{animals and plants}} that are rare on the mainland. Notable species on the island include the Cook Strait giant weta, shore plover, North Island robin, takahe, Wellington green gecko, yellow-crowned parakeet, and <b>brown</b> <b>teal.</b> The most recent example is the critically endangered Wellington speargrass weevil from the Wellington South Coast in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The Auckland teal {{is smaller}} and rarer than the <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> {{of the main}} islands of New Zealand, a species with which it was once {{considered}} conspecific. The plumage is all over brown {{with a hint of}} green on the neck and a conspicuous white eyering. The female is slightly darker than the male. The wings are very small and the species has, like the related Campbell teal, lost the power of flight.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the islands}} are {{official}} or unofficial bird sanctuaries, holding important or critically endangered species like kiwi, takahe, <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> and grey-faced petrel. Centred on the main conservation island of Tiritiri Matangi and Little Barrier Island, numerous bird species that were locally extinct have been reintroduced in the last decades, while {{there have also been}} some naturally occurring bird [...] "re-colonisations", especially after introduced pests were removed from breeding and nesting grounds.|$|E
50|$|Asian small clawed otters {{arrived in}} 2000.

Pateke ducklings reared at Orana have regularly been released to the wild. The singing Siamang gibbons, Orana’s first species of ape, were added in 2004 and three youngsters have been raised. The siamang habitat won a zoo industry (ZAA) excellence in exhibit design award in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Kaikoura Island (formerly {{known as}} Selwyn Island) lies in an irregularly-shaped bay {{on the western}} side of Great Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf in New Zealand, 90 km north east of Auckland. Kaikoura Island is the seventh largest island in the Hauraki Gulf. It is 80 metres from Great Barrier Island at its closest point and forms the natural {{harbours}} of Port FitzRoy and Port Abercrombie. Its biota includes the endangered <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> duck, the North Island kaka and many native trees and shrubs.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} free {{of some of the}} more {{troublesome}} introduced pests that plague the native ecosystems of other parts of New Zealand. While wild cats, dogs, feral pigs, black rats, Polynesian rats and mice are present, there are no known populations of possums, mustelids (weasels, stoats or ferrets), hedgehogs, brown rats or deer, thus being a relative haven for native bird and plant populations. Feral goats were eradicated in 2006. Rare animals found on the island include <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> ducks, black petrel seabirds and North Island kākā parrots.|$|E
50|$|No {{evidence}} so far {{indicates the}} Hector's and Maui's dolphins interbreed, but given their close genetic composition, they likely could. Interbreeding {{may increase the}} numbers of dolphins in the Maui's range and {{reduce the risk of}} inbreeding depression, but such interbreeding could eventually result in a hybridisation of the Maui's back into the Hector's species and lead to a reclassification of Maui's as again the North Island Hector's. Hybridisation in this manner threatens the Otago black stilt and the Chatham Islands' Forbes parakeet and has eliminated the South Island <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> as a subspecies. Researchers have also identified potential interbreeding as threatening the Maui's with hybrid breakdown and outbreeding depression.|$|E
5000|$|Te Wahipounamu {{is home to}} many {{indigenous}} {{animals and}} contains {{the largest and most}} significant population of forest birds in the country. The total wild population, which is only about 170 birds, of the takahe is found in a few mountain valleys in the Fiordland harbor. Along the south-west coast, most of New Zealand’s Fur Seals are found. Also found in this region are Southern Brown Kiwis, Great Spotted Kiwis, Red deer, Yellow-crowned parakeets, Fiordland Penguins, New Zealand falcons, and the pateke/Fiordland <b>brown</b> <b>teal.</b> The world’s rarest and heaviest parrot, kakapo, was found in this region until the early 1980s. It is now believed that it is extinct on the mainland.|$|E
50|$|The Campbell teal or Campbell Island teal (Anas nesiotis) is a small, flightless, nocturnal {{species of}} dabbling duck {{of the genus}} Anas endemic to the Campbell Island group of New Zealand. It is {{sometimes}} considered conspecific with the <b>brown</b> <b>teal.</b> The plumage {{is similar to that}} of the Auckland teal, dark sepia with the head and back tinged with green iridescence, and a chestnut breast on the male, with the female dark brown all over. Its natural habitat is tussock grassland dominated by Poa tussock grass, ferns and megaherbs. The species also uses the burrows and pathways of petrel species that nest on the islands. They are apparently territorial in the wild, and probably feed on amphipods and insects.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas chlorotis) is {{a species}} of dabbling duck of the genus Anas. The Māori name for it is pāteke. For many years it had been {{considered}} to be conspecific with the flightless Auckland and Campbell teals in Anas aucklandica; the name [...] "brown teal" [...] has also been largely applied to that entire taxon. Common {{in the early years}} of European colonisation, the [...] "brown duck" [...] (as it had been often referred to) was heavily harvested as a food source. Its numbers quickly fell, especially in the South Island, and in 1921 they became fully protected. Captive breeding and releasing into predator-controlled areas has seen good localised populations re-introduced around the country in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|There are an {{increasing}} variety of nursing bras designs, including softcup, underwire, seamless, and lounging styles. Some nursing bras can {{also serve as}} a sports bra, allowing a nursing mother to exercise more easily. Some outerwear like tank tops and T-shirts have nursing bras that are built into the garment, and there are also padded and plus-size nursing bras. Some experts advise against wearing an underwire nursing bra because they can restrict the flow of milk and cause mastitis. [...] Most nursing bras have traditionally been white, but manufacturers now offer {{an increasing}} selection of colors and styles, including <b>brown,</b> <b>teal,</b> floral, and floral animal prints, and some are accessorized with lace and ribbon.|$|E
50|$|It feeds by dabbling and upending, {{like its}} relatives. Its diet {{consists}} mainly of aquatic invertebrates like insects and their larvae, or crustaceans. It appears quite fond of mollusks. Small {{species such as}} pipi (Paphies australis) and large wedge shell (Macomona liliana) are eaten whole and crushed in the gizzard. For feeding on larger cockles such as Austrovenus stutchburyi (New Zealand cockle), at least some New Zealand teals have developed a peculiar technique, as of now undocumented in other birds, to force their rather soft bills between the cockle shells and tear out the flesh with a jackhammer-like pumping motion. At night <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> will forage on land {{some distance from the}} streams used as a refuge during the day (Worthy 2002).|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} home to a number of native birds, mostly re-introduced. These include takahe, North Island kōkako, <b>brown</b> <b>teal,</b> stitchbird (hihi), North Island saddleback (tieke), tomtit (miromiro), fantail (piwakawaka), morepork (ruru), weka and North Island robin (toutouwai). The brown kiwi and little spotted kiwi were {{released}} on the island between 1890 and 1910, and the island is now the stronghold for the latter species. Rat eradication has led to increases in red-fronted parakeets, North Island robin, bellbirds, and saddlebacks, and the island is considered one of New Zealand's most important sites for bird recovery, as well as a major breeding site for sea birds. In April 2005, the critically endangered short-tailed bat was introduced to the island from a threatened population in the Tararuas, providing them with a separate, safer habitat.|$|E
50|$|Eighty-seven {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} {{on or near the}} island. Eleven native species have been translocated to the island as part of the ongoing restoration project. These are kākāriki / red crowned parakeet, tīeke / North Island saddleback, pāteke / <b>brown</b> <b>teal,</b> pōpokotea / whitehead, takahē, little spotted kiwi, hihi / stitchbird, North Island kōkako, mātātā / fernbird, miromiro / North Island tomtit and tītipounamu / rifleman. Non-avian translocations include a reptile tuatara in 2003, Duvaucel's gecko in 2006 and a large insect wetapunga in 2011. Non-native species present include the Australian brown quail. The success of the conservation project encouraged the creation of a number of similar projects around the Gulf, such as on Motuihe, Motuora and Motutapu. The closest land on the tip of the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, Shakespear Regional Park has recently (2011) also become a mammalian pest-free fenced sanctuary, increasing immigration of the birds on Tiritiri to the nearby mainland.|$|E
5000|$|Pōhutukawa Trust New Zealand {{was founded}} in 1992 by Ray Weaver and other private landowners who own 90% of the island, [...] "to {{rehabilitate}} the native flora and fauna of Kawau Island". Until then it was considered hopeless to reverse the considerable ecological damage caused by the introduced animal and plant species, and Kawau {{was said to be}} of historical rather than botanical importance. The Trust's plan is to eradicate significant animal pests including wallabies and possums, eradicate certain weed species and control others, and enable sustainable land uses in a restored ecological setting of native flora and fauna. The ongoing program is funded by donations and sponsors. Possum numbers have already been greatly reduced and kept at very low numbers since 1985 through sustained control, saving the coastal pōhutukawa tree, a New Zealand icon. The response to pest control work has been increasing native bird numbers, including increased kiwi calls, <b>brown</b> <b>teal,</b> kākā, Kererū, and bellbirds.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Chatham duck or [...] Chatham Island duck (Anas chathamica) is an {{extinct species}} of duck, {{formerly}} {{placed in a}} monotypic genus Pachyanas, which once lived in New Zealand’s Chatham Islands in the south-west Pacific Ocean. It was described by Walter Oliver (as a [...] "stoutly built duck") from bird bones {{in the collection of}} the Canterbury Museum in 1955 in the second edition of his work New Zealand Birds. Recently, analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from subfossil remains [...] showed that the Chatham duck was not, in fact, closely related to shelducks but instead belongs in the genus Anas: the dabbling ducks. Its closest living relatives appear to be the Auckland teal, Campbell teal and the <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> from New Zealand. Some authors have suggested that the Chatham duck was flightless; however, comparison of Chatham duck wing bones with those from living ducks indicates no disproportional reduction in wing length. The Chatham duck likely became extinct in about the 16th century because of hunting by humans.|$|E

Te Kēpa used his status as a war hero to keep hold of traditional Muaūpoko land, but was unable to prevent disputes with other iwi and within his own tribe, leading to the sale of land for railways and farming. Court cases led to debate in parliament and finally in 1896 a Royal Commission into land sales in the Horowhenua.|$|E
