5|$|Business in {{the area}} of the road {{increase}} <b>before</b> <b>US</b> 206 widens to four total lanes and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-80 and the southern terminus of Route 183. At this point, the road continues north into Netcong as Route 183 while US 206 heads west along I-80, a six-lane freeway that continues into Mount Olive Township. The freeway continues northwest, running through a small corner of Netcong before coming back into Mount Olive Township and interchanging with US 46. Immediately after US 46, the highway passes over New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line before turning north and reaching a trumpet interchange where US 206 splits from I-80. Following this split, US 206 is a four-lane freeway that heads northeast, crossing under Waterloo Valley Road and an abandoned railroad line before coming to an interchange with International Drive.|$|E
5|$|In November, the Board {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8in guns in four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7in guns in casemates. The decision to retain the 8in guns was made in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years <b>before.</b> <b>US</b> Navy officers had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the gun at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored belt and casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the belt and a transverse bulkhead, weight could be saved by reducing the level of direct protection.|$|E

5|$|US 22 {{continues}} into Branchburg Township, Somerset County, where development {{near the}} road increases but remains mostly rural. CR 614 parallels US 22 {{to the north}} {{to pass through the}} community of North Branch <b>before</b> <b>US</b> 22 intersects CR 637 and crosses the North Branch Raritan River into Bridgewater Township. In Bridgewater Township, the route comes to an interchange with the eastern terminus of CR 614 and the western terminus of Route 28. Past this interchange, US 22 passes business parks and the Raritan Valley Country Club, widening to six lanes in the process. Afterwards, it comes to an interchange with US 202 and US 206. Past this interchange, US 22 quickly transitions from a rural to a more suburban setting and heads east along the border of Somerville to the south and Bridgewater Township to the north, passing near the Bridgewater Commons shopping mall.

The road continues north and enters business areas before heading into neighborhoods and coming to an intersection with High Street, which runs east as U.S. Route 322/County Route 536 and west as County Route 641. Here, U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 join Route 47 for a concurrency. The three routes head through commercial areas <b>before</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 322 and County Route 536 turn to the west on West Avenue. Past this intersection, Route 47 continues north as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, passing more buildings. The route intersects County Route 553 and forms a concurrency with that route which lasts until County Route 553 turns north onto Woodbury Avenue. Along this concurrency, the road widens to five lanes as it passes a couple shopping centers. Past the concurrency, Route 47 runs north through suburban localities as a two-lane road, entering Washington Township at the crossing of Kressey Lake. In Washington Township, the road passes more populated areas as well as businesses. Route 47 runs to the east of Bethel Mill County Park before entering more residential areas, crossing County Route 635. The road passes through a mix of homes and commercial establishments with some farmland and wooded areas as it continues through more of Washington Township.|$|E
