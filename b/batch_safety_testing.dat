40|$|AbstractManufacturers of {{veterinary}} vaccines frequently incorporate animal-based <b>batch</b> release <b>safety</b> <b>tests</b> into their quality assurance monitoring protocols {{to meet their}} internal quality standards and to conform to government regulatory requirements. These tests are conducted by vaccinating target species animals or laboratory animals with a single dose or multiple doses of the test batch, and observing the vaccinated animals for signs of local or systemic adverse reactions. Manufacturers, standard-setting bodies, animal welfare advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies are actively investigating alternative methods to reduce their reliance on animal-based methods for <b>batch</b> release <b>safety</b> <b>testing.</b> Approaches which have been implemented or proposed include harmonizing technical requirements, developing in vitro tests, refining the existing animal tests, improving adverse reaction monitoring (vaccinovigilance), and improving manufacturing methods and quality controls to reduce batch-to-batch variability. An approach, known as the consistency approach, is increasingly being acknowledged as a potentially viable alternative to animal-based batch release tests for vaccines. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} currently utilized <b>batch</b> release <b>safety</b> <b>tests</b> for veterinary vaccines, the associated regulatory requirements, and some potentially acceptable alternative approaches for reducing, refining, and replacing the use of animals in these tests...|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the outcome of}} an international workshop organized by the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) on Modern science for better quality control of medicinal products: Towards global harmonization of 3 Rs in biologicals. As regards the <b>safety</b> <b>testing</b> of biologicals, the workshop participants agreed to actively encourage the deletion of abnormal toxicity tests and target animal <b>batch</b> <b>safety</b> <b>tests</b> from all relevant legal requirements and guidance documents (country-specific guidelines, pharmacopoeia monographs, WHO recommendations). To facilitate the global regulatory acceptance of non-animal methods for the potency testing of, e. g., human diphtheria and tetanus vaccines and veterinary swine erysipelas vaccines, international convergence on the scientific principles {{of the use of}} appropriately validated in vitro assays for replacing in vivo methods was recognized as a further means to unify regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions. It was recommended to include key regulators and manufacturers early in the corresponding discussions. Manufacturers and responsible expert groups, e. g. at the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Health Care of the Council of Europe or the European Medicines Agency, were invited to consider leadership for international collaboration.

40|$|The {{workshop}} on Three Rs Approaches in the Production and Quality Control of Fish Vaccines aimed a) to identify animal tests currently stipulated {{for the production}} and quality control of fish vaccines and to highlight animal welfare concerns associated with these tests; b) to identify viable options to replace, reduce, and refine animal use for fish vaccine testing; and c) to discuss the way forward and set out how the Three Rs may be implemented without jeopardizing {{the quality of the}} vaccines. The workshop participants - experts from academia, regulatory authorities, a scientific animal welfare organization, and the fish vaccine industry - agreed that efforts should be undertaken to replace the vaccination-challenge batch potency testing with tests based on antigen quantification or antibody response tests. Regulatory requirements of questionable scientific value and relevance for the quality of fish vaccines, such as the re-testing of batches produced outside Europe, or the double-dose <b>batch</b> <b>safety</b> <b>test,</b> should be re-considered. As an immediate measure the design of the current animal tests should be evaluated and modified in the light of refinement and reduction, for example, the number of unprotected control fish in vaccination-challenge tests should be reduced to the minimum.

40|$|AbstractEuropean {{technical}} requirements for veterinary vaccines are {{laid down in}} Annex 1, Title II, to Directive 2001 / 82 /EC, as amended by Directive 2009 / 9 /EC, and the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). <b>Safety</b> <b>tests</b> carried out on each batch are generally overdosage studies carried out {{in at least one}} of the most sensitive target species and by at least the recommended route of administration that poses the greatest risk. The dose administered should preferably be twice the standard dose for inactivated vaccines and ten times the standard dose for live vaccines. Each batch must also be tested to show that it will contain the appropriate potency or titer to ensure its safety and efficacy. Live vaccines are usually tested by in vitro titration, while serological or challenge tests in vaccinated animals are commonly used for inactivated vaccines, although alternative methods are encouraged if satisfactorily validated. Several amendments have been introduced into the Ph. Eur. to facilitate reduction in the severity of tests and the numbers of animals used, including: the ability to waive the <b>batch</b> <b>safety</b> <b>test</b> when consistency of production has been established; in vitro methods to test for extraneous viruses in live poultry vaccines; and humane endpoints for rabies vaccine potency tests. This report discusses some preliminary conclusions concerning how these changes have affected the numbers of animals used during batch control testing of vaccines released via the UK batch release scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Train {{control system}} is a safety-critical system, which {{requires}} a thorough <b>safety</b> <b>testing</b> before they are deployed. But the traditional technology of test automation is not sound for <b>safety</b> <b>test</b> of safety-critical software system because of its just aiming at the system functional requirements. Focusing on the safety requirements, this paper addresses a new method to perform <b>safety</b> <b>test</b> of safety-critical system based on safety requirement by using model-based test. The method presents safety automata to express safety properties in term of safety requirements and extract safety model from the safety requirements. It also provides a new technique for automatic generation of <b>safety</b> <b>test</b> case suite. By using the method, we have designed an automatic testing framework and developed an automatic testing platform, which {{has been applied to}} standard testing the product of train control system in term of the requirements of Ministry of railways in china, and implement effectively the functional and <b>safety</b> <b>test</b> of the product of train control system in china...|$|R
