40|$|A {{fiduciary}} breach due to secret use of <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> {{assets for}} personal gain marks the essential concern in both the insider trading realm and {{in the context of}} <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> political spending. Therefore, adopting a similar common law fiduciary rule that <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> managers must disclose the amount and target of political expenditures or refrain from engaging in political activity does not seem like much of an intellectual leap. Not only would such a common law disclosure duty fit neatly within existing <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> governance principles, but the compelled transparency would not offend corporations’ First Amendment rights. In the end, prohibiting political insider trading through a “disclose or abstain” rule for <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> political spending would promote greater efficiency in the capital markets, ensure <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> accountability and political legitimacy, and sustain the growing market for <b>Business</b> <b>Organizations</b> social responsibility...|$|R

25|$|Early {{forms of}} proto-capitalism and free markets {{were present in}} the Caliphate. An early market economy and early form of {{merchant}} capitalism developed between the 8th and 12th centuries. A vigorous monetary economy developed based on the wide circulation of a common currency (the dinar) and the integration of previously independent monetary areas. Business techniques and forms of <b>business</b> <b>organization</b> employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and early forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organizational enterprises similar to corporations independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world.

The first two years consisted of many social science classes such as American history and government, sociology, psychology, economics, and law. Students were required to take English and public speaking courses as well as courses in accounting and statistics. The last two years of coursework were the technical core: classes that were expected to provide the students with the technical skills and competencies which enable them to develop professional expertise with{{in the field of}} industrial and labor relations. Examples of these courses include: history of labor and labor-union organization and management, <b>business</b> <b>organization</b> and management, and corporate finance. Beyond the classroom, students were expected to gain applied experience. This was achieved primarily through a required summer work-training program. To fulfill this expectation, students would spend three of their summers working in the field for each of the following types of organizations: industrial or commercial, government, and labor.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the extent of statistical {{significant difference between the}} economic, environmental, governance and social aspects of sustainability reporting as a result of board committee on sustainability and time (year) of reporting for <b>business</b> <b>organizations</b> in the Nigerian banking sector. The years of reporting under consideration were 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Content analysis methodology was employed through a reporting index used to score the amount of economic, environmental, governance and social indicators of sustainability reporting. The results of this study indicated that <b>business</b> <b>organizations</b> with board committee on sustainability had more indicators of sustainability reporting than those without board committees on sustainability issues. Also, sustainability reporting in 2013 was higher than that of prior years (2012, 2011 and 2010) for the economic, environmental and social indicators. The governance indicators of 2012 was highest compared to the other years (2013, 2011 and 2010) under consideration in this study. The implication of this finding is that <b>business</b> <b>organizations</b> that have board committees on sustainability are monitored by such boards to report more to stakeholders. On the other hand, <b>business</b> <b>organizations</b> are appreciating the need to engage in sustainability reporting with each passing year. This could be due to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Sustainability Reporting framework that <b>business</b> <b>organizations</b> in the banking sector have to adhere to. When sustainability issues are monitored from the board of directors, <b>business</b> <b>organizations</b> are likely to increase and improve on their sustainability reporting...|$|R
