40|$|A pair of {{substantially}} opposed {{mating surfaces}} are joined {{to each other}} and sealed in place by means of an electrically-conductive member which is placed in proximity to the mating surfaces. The electrically-conductive member has at least one element secured thereto which is positioned to contact the mating surfaces, and which softens when the electrically-conductive member is heated by passing an electric current therethrough. The softened element conforms to the mating surfaces, and upon cooling of the softened element the mating surfaces are joined together in an effective seal. Of particular significance is an embodiment of the electrically-conductive member which is a gasket having an electrically-conductive <b>gasket</b> <b>base</b> and a pair of the elements secured to opposite sides of the <b>gasket</b> <b>base.</b> This embodiment is positioned between the opposed mating surfaces to be joined to each other.

The splitting on escape nodes of failing particles makes the event of reaching the <b>base</b> of the <b>gasket</b> possible with positive probability. The r. v.

40|$|A novel, compact {{hemispherical}} dielectric resonator antenna <b>based</b> on Apollonian <b>Gasket</b> of circles is proposed. The Apollonian Gasket is a fractal {{generated from}} triplets of circles, where each circle is a tangent {{to the other}} two. The dielectric material used is Rogers TMM 10, which is a ceramic thermoset polymer composite material having a dielectric constant of epsilon(r) = 9. 2. The fractal geometry offers a wide impedance bandwidth of around 1. 68 GHz (47 %) for S- 11 < - 10 dB at a resonant frequency of 3. 6 GHz. Experiments have been conducted up to the third iteration of fractal. Two modes have also been investigated which show presence of both TM 101 like and TE 111 like modes.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{evolving}} Sierpinski <b>gasket,</b> <b>based</b> {{on which we}} establish a model of evolutionary Sierpinski networks (ESNs) that unifies deterministic Sierpinski network [Eur. Phys. J. B 60, 259 (2007) ] and random Sierpinski network [Eur. Phys. J. B 65, 141 (2008) ] to the same framework. We suggest an iterative algorithm generating the ESNs. On {{the basis of the}} algorithm, some relevant properties of presented networks are calculated or predicted analytically. Analytical solution shows that the networks under consideration follow a power-law degree distribution, with the distribution exponent continuously tuned in a wide range. The obtained accurate expression of clustering coefficient, together with the prediction of average path length reveals that the ESNs possess small-world effect. All our theoretical results are successfully contrasted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma game is also studied on some limitations of the ESNs, i. e., deterministic Sierpinski network and random Sierpinski network...|$|R
40|$|Contact {{width and}} leakage {{had been used}} as the main {{parameter}} to optimize a new corrugated metal gasket for high working pressure. The leakage could be reduced as increasing the contact width. On the other hand, gaskets in piping for low pressure were used into distribution {{of water in the}} hotel. In this study, thin metal gasket is optimized by using simulation experiment. The design of experimentation (DOE) Taguchi method is used to analyze the effect of each parameter design and to predict optimal design of thin metal gasket. The L 27 orthogonal array is concerned to design the experimental matrix for five factors with three levels. The five factors are thickness (t), pitch (p), over hang (OH), lip height (h), and radius convex (R). The observed value is denoted by using the slope of the curve of relationship between contact width and clamping load. The slope of curve is increased; it will be reduce the clamping load. The optimum design of thin metal <b>gasket</b> <b>based</b> on the results of each observed values is a model with thickness (t) = 0. 3 mm, pitch (p) = 4 mm, over hang (OH) = 3 mm, lip height (h) = 0. 4 mm, and radius convex (R) = 2. 5 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} of the IAEA safety standards for Type B(U) packages include the thermal test as part of test sequences that represents accident conditions of transport. In comparison to mechanical tests, e. g., 9 m drop onto an unyielding target with short impact durations {{in a range of}} approximately 10 ms to 30 ms, the extended period of 30 min is defined in regulations for exposure of a package to a fire environment. Obviously, the required containment capability of the package has to be ensured not only after completing the test sequence but also {{over the course of the}} fire test scenario. Especially, deformations in the sealing area induced by the non-uniform thermal dilation of the package can affect the capability of the containment system. Consequently, thermo-mechanical analyses are required for the assessment. In this paper some aspects of finite element analysis (FEA) of transport packages with bolted closure systems under thermal loading are discussed. A generic FE model of a cask is applied to investigate the stress histories in the bolts, lid, and cask body as well as the deformations in the sealing area and the compression conditions of the <b>gasket.</b> <b>Based</b> on the parameter variations carried out, some recommendations in regard to modeling technique and results interpretation for such kind of analyses are finally given...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a gasketless interface, which was used successfully to couple an aluminium cylinder head to an open deck design cylinder block. The cylinder block was manufactured from aluminium, featuring shrink fit dry cast iron liners. Extensive CAE modelling was employed to implement the gasketless interface and thus avoid using a conventional metal or fiber <b>based</b> cylinder head <b>gasket.</b> The engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a 430 cm 3, highly turbocharged (TC) twin cylinder in-line arrangement with double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. The new design removed the conventional head gasket and relied on the correct amount of face pressure generated by interference between the cylinder head and block to seal the interface. This had advantages in improving the structural integrity of the weak open deck design. Extensive FEM analysis determined the correct amount of interference needed for successful operation under all operating conditions. Extensive thermal analysis concluded that removing the conventional gasket {{had the advantage of}} improving the heat path between the cylinder head and block, as the gasket behaves as an insulator. The possibility of gasket failure due to abnormal combustion is also eliminated. The design proved successful in operation, withstanding knock amplitudes of 30 bar, in-cylinder pressures exceeding 100 bar and high combustion temperatures. The engine completed extensive static and transient testing with no interface problems after initial development, recording 25 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) on pump gasoline. 13 - 16 NovemberOpen Acces...|$|R
