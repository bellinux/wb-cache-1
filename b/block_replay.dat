30|$|The {{utilization}} of random number {{challenges in the}} certificate-based user authentication procedure can also block an attacker attempting to intercept the authentication tokens, including the signature data created by other users, and prevent the attacker from using them successfully later on [28]. However, the random number challenge should be newly created for each authentication token exchange procedure. A security method for <b>blocking</b> <b>replay</b> attacks also depends on the random number challenges that were created repeatedly in the low probability. The TMZ system uses the FIPS approved by the random number generator.|$|R
50|$|Action Replay is a cheat device made by Datel, {{allowing}} gamers {{to enter}} codes to cheat at games. A FreeLoader is also {{included with the}} software. It contains a boot disc with the codes and startup, and a dongle that connects into memory card slot B. The dongle has less memory than a normal memory card, and thus is usually only useful for saving codes, or save files that only take up 1 or 2 memory <b>blocks.</b> The Action <b>Replay</b> save file can be copied onto other memory cards, as well, allowing for one person to share their codes with someone who may have {{an earlier version of}} Action Replay, or the sharing of custom-made codes.|$|R
50|$|In this study, {{two groups}} of {{participants}} {{took part in a}} two night counterbalanced study. Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm. The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs. The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task. At 11:00pm all participants were put on a two-hour infusion of either physostigmine or a placebo. Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Acetylcholine, thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the synapses. The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake. Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected recall memory (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo. Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 ± 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 ± 0.6 words when participants were given the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when participants were given physostigmine, and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physotigmine was administered. This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus -dependent declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS <b>blocks</b> memory <b>replay</b> on a hippocampal level.|$|R

50|$|Cory in the House is a {{television}} show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007, to September 12, 2008, {{and was a}} spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, {{as it is the}} channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for {{the entire length of the}} show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly <b>block</b> called Disney <b>Replay</b> on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.|$|R
