5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a <b>balisong</b> <b>knife</b> for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E

50|$|Aside from tourism, {{the locals}} {{in the area}} also make a living from fishing. Fishing boats are {{frequently}} seen with banana boats and jet skis along the shores. While most fishing villages {{elsewhere in the country}} would sell the catch to the market or a middleman, most of the catch of the fisherfolks in the area are sold directly to resorts in Laiya. Vendors are also frequently seen roaming in the beaches, selling souvenir items such as bracelets and butterfly <b>knives</b> or <b>balisong</b> in local language.

50|$|A pantographic {{knife or}} paratrooper knife is a folding knife whose blade is opened by a unique {{scissors}} method. The blade {{has a slightly}} longer tang than a folding knife heel. The handle is symmetrically segmented and articulated to fold away on both sides to grip the longer tang. The manner {{is similar to a}} <b>balisong</b> <b>knife</b> (also called a butterfly knife in western countries)—with which it is often confused. Unlike the <b>balisong</b> <b>knife</b> handles that swing freely and independently, the pantographic knife uses a pantograph linkage to keep the handles aligned during opening and closing. The pantographic knife is very strong when compared to most other folding knife designs, being joined at several points and along several planes—this increases the force required to break the blade away from the handle. By enclosing the blade on both sides, double edged blades can be used.|$|E

5000|$|Samson learned knife {{making and}} bladesmithing from John Nelson Cooper, a veteran knife maker located in Burbank, California, in 1969.

5000|$|Other {{relevant}} Scotland knife legislation {{includes the}} Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons Act) (Scotland) Order 2005, which bans sword canes, push daggers, butterfly (<b>balisong</b> <b>knives),</b> throwing stars, knives that can defeat metal detectors, and knives disguised as other objects, and the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006, {{which makes it}} an offence to sell a knife, knife blade, or bladed or pointed object to a person under eighteen years of age, unless the person is sixteen or older and the knife or blade is [...] "designed for domestic use." [...] In 2007, {{the passage of the}} Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 allowed exemption from criminal liability under section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 for selling a prohibited offensive weapon if the sale was made for purposes of theatrical performances and of rehearsals for such performances, the production of films (as defined in section 5B of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988), or the production of television programmes (as defined in section 405(1) of the Communications Act 2003).|$|R
5000|$|The Arms Act defines {{weapons as}} [...] "objects that {{by their very}} nature are {{intended}} to reduce or eliminate the defensive ability of a person through direct impact", specifically including all firearms. Consequently, certain knives are considered [...] "weapons" [...] in accordance with this definition. Except for firearms, however, which are heavily regulated, such [...] "weapons", including automatic opening lock-blade knives (switchblades), OTF automatic <b>knives,</b> <b>balisongs,</b> and gravity <b>knives</b> are implicitly permitted under the Arms Act, and thus may be bought, possessed and carried by anyone over the age of 18 who has not been expressively banned from owning any weapon (Waffenverbot) by the civilian authorities.|$|R
50|$|Other knives {{commonly}} {{mistaken for}} gravity knives include the automatic OTF knife, the switchblade and the butterfly <b>knife</b> (or <b>balisong),</b> the sliding <b>knife,</b> penny knife, and occasionally even common folding hunting knives {{such as the}} Buck 110 Folding Hunter.|$|R
5000|$|Some states {{prohibit}} {{the possession of}} a folding knife with a quick-opening mechanism such as a gravity <b>knife,</b> butterfly <b>knife,</b> <b>balisong,</b> or switchblade.

5000|$|In some countries, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, Canada, and {{in certain}} U.S. states, a gravity knife is defined under the law as a {{prohibited}} weapon, with attendant criminal penalties. Other laws may criminalize the ownership, sale, importation, or carrying of a gravity knife upon one's person, either concealed or unconcealed. In the United States, some state criminal codes prohibit either the ownership or the carrying of gravity knives, either by name or by including a functional description of their opening mechanisms. Other state criminal codes bar gravity knives by redefining them variously as switchblades or <b>balisongs</b> (butterfly <b>knives).</b> [...] Local jurisdictions including cities and counties may also restrict the ownership or carrying of gravity knives.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{thing to}} note {{is that the}} Philippines is a blade culture. The Southern Philippines with the Moros were never really conquered by the Spaniards or the Americans; nor the Northern {{mountains}} of Luzon with their feared headhunter tribes so they kept their weapons and their fighting skills. For the more [...] "civilized" [...] provinces and the towns where citizens had been [...] "disarmed", bolos (a cutting tool similar to the machete) and other knife variants are still commonly used for general work (farming in the provinces, chopping wood, coconuts, controlling talahib (sword grass), which could grow higher than roofs if not cut, etc.) and of course, the occasional bloody fight. Production of these weapons still survives {{and there are a}} few who still make some. In the province of Aklan, Talibongs are still being made in the remote areas. Until the 80s, <b>balisong</b> <b>knives</b> were still commonly used in the streets of Manila as general purpose pocket knives much like Swiss army knives or box cutters until new laws on allowable kinds of knives made it illegal to carry them in public without a permit or proof that it was a vital to one's livelihood (e.g. Martial arts instructor, vendor). They're still openly sold in their birthplace of Batangas, in the streets of Quiapo, souvenir shops and martial arts stores, wielded by practitioners and of course, street gangs. Thus, even when fighting systems were outlawed by the Spaniards, Filipinos still maintained their centuries-old relationships with blades and blade fighting techniques that survive from ancient times and are still much alive as they have been adapted and evolved to stay relevant and practical in colonial and modern times.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2011 in the Netherlands {{a new law}} prohibits {{ownership}} or {{possession of}} the following knives, whether kept at home or not: Stilettos, switchblades, folding knives {{with more than one}} cutting edge, throwing knives, folding knives with an overall length of more than 28 cm when open, butterfly (<b>balisong)</b> or gravity <b>knives,</b> disguised knives (belt knife, sword cane, etc.) and push daggers. [...] Also, it is illegal to carry a fixed-blade knife with more than one cutting edge, though such a knife may be kept at home for collector purposes.|$|R
50|$|All large side-opening switchblade knives (blade {{longer than}} 8.5 cm), OTF switchblades, <b>balisongs</b> or {{butterfly}} <b>knives</b> (blade longer than 4 cm), and gravity knives are illegal to own, {{import or export}} under German law. Side-opening switchblade knives with single-edged blades not longer than 8.5 cm and incorporating a continuous spine are legal to own. Legal switchblades may be carried both open and concealed on one's person {{if there is a}} justified need for it ("berechtigtes Bedürfnis") or if the weapon cannot be accessed with less than 3 moves ("Transport in verschlossenem Behältnis"). Other laws or regulations may still prohibit the carrying of otherwise legal automatic or switchblade knives, particularly in certain situations or places (gatherings on public ground, check-in areas of airports).|$|R
