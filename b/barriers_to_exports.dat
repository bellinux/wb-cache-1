Japanese firms exporting from developing countries, moreover, often received preferential tariff treatment in developed countries (under the Generalised System of Preferences).

In this paper we provide fresh evidence on the actual <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>exporting</b> firms face and how they vary with export experience and other firm-level characteristics. Our results indicates that the higher the export experience of firms the lower the trade costs firms face generated by specific <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>export.</b> The number of barriers is not related to other firms-level characteristics such as, productivity and size, found by the literature to be associated with export market entry. Overall, these results suggest the existence of a process of learning <b>to</b> <b>export</b> whereby firms learn how <b>to</b> cope with <b>export</b> <b>barriers</b> through direct experience in export markets.

The initial explanation for this poor performance focussed on deficient macroeconomic policies. However a number of SSA countries have undertaken and sustained a reasonable measure of macroeconomic reform and still see no significant expansion in the growth of manufactured exports. This suggests that a stable, credible, and consistent macroeconomic environment may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for export growth. This paper reviews the literature dealing with other constraints, including poor infrastructure, lack of appropriate human capital, a failure to develop a variety of export support services, and the impact of an unresponsive civil service.

To this end a literature review was conducted to, among others, identify <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>exports</b> faced by manufacturing SME’s contained in existing literature. A number of core groupings were identified.

Exporting respondents were asked what their biggest export facilitating factor was, and what the one thing was they felt each {{of the government and}} third party facilitators could do to assist in the export process. Non-exporting respondents were further asked for reasons for not exporting (if they wanted to export) as well as reasons for not wanting to export, as the case may be. Strong demographic differences emerged between exporters, interested nonexporters and not interested non-exporters. A number of factors emerged as to barriers and facilitators to exports and how the government and third party facilitators might assist in the export process.

The authors focus on the export performance of eight small transition economies with special emphasis on the behavior of exporting enterprises.

She notes that statements from Western political leaders, under pressure from increasingly vocal protestors, emphasizing the potential of trade liberalization to alleviate poverty in the developing world, have been greeted with much scepticism by the leaders of developing countries. In spite of its pious preaching in favour of trade liberalization, the North has left in place high protectionist barriers in the textiles, clothing and agricultural sectors that discriminate against imports from the South. And at the same time, the South is still being held to WTO commitments to introduce Western-style regimes such as intellectual property measures. Nevertheless, she notes that the over 100 developing country members of the WTO and the dozens of other developing countries seeking to accede to the WTO shows that poorer countries are {{not yet ready to}} give up on the WTO. In her paper, Macmillan takes a hard look at how effectively the multilateral trading system has really addressed developing country concerns. She also presents some concrete proposals for achieving a fairer balance in the world trading system. These include: the removal of tariff and non-tariff <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>exports</b> from the developing world; the reform of domestic agricultural programs; the provision of generous financial assistance and assistance in kind to developing nations to help them with implementation and trade adjustment; a substantial weakening of anti-dumping regimes; and the refusal to include environmental and labour standards in WTO Agreements.

40|$|Throughout Southeast Asia, {{government}} agencies are promoting good agricultural practices (GAP) standards for improving food safety, avoiding potential nontariff <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>exports,</b> and ultimately securing farmers' health and revenues. This paper presents {{an analysis of}} the adoption of a public standard in Thailand, the Rice Q-GAP where Q stands for “quality. ” In the Central Plains of Thailand, a major rice production area, rice is produced by relatively small farms but with very intensive use of chemical inputs, making it challenging to promote production standards. Our study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of standards and the differences in cultivation practices between adopters and nonadopters. Governmental agencies have organized training activities throughout the country about rice production and Q-GAP standards. That training is likely to have an important influence on Q-GAP adoption. We investigate the potential selection bias in training delivery, using a recursive bivariate probit model whereby training is successively an explanatory variable for the Q-GAP adoption and a variable to be explained. Our model suggests that lack of labor availability is an essential factor related to nonadoption. Belonging to farmers associations and groups is also shown to be an important factor of adoption. Unexpectedly, training has a slight negative effect on Q-GAP adoption. A possible explanation is that when concrete information about the program is delivered, some farmers make an informed decision not to participate; this reinforces the idea that the main factors that could hamper further adoption are not related to information but to real farm constraints and farmers' rational behavior. The paper also found some small but significant differences in terms of farmers' practices related to adoption. The most convincing change is the {{reduction in the number of}} pesticide applications by adopters. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{comprehensive}} World Bank - UNCTAD data base on tariff barriers NTBs), the authors examine {{the incidence of}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trade <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>exports</b> of the former Soviet Union (FSU). OECD markets have grown steadily in importance {{in the past decade}} and now receive more than half of FSU exports. And additional trade could help the FSU republics make the transition to market economies. Overall OECD tariffs that the FSU republics face are 70 to 90 percent higher than the average paid on all goods imported, but their worst effect {{is the result of the}} margins of preference they give other (non-FSU) exporters. For example, because of a special EFTA-EC protocol, manufactures are traded duty-free between countries in these blocs, while similar (competing) FSU goods may face duties of 20 percent or more. No significant trade expansion will occur until nontariff barriers are liberalized in NTB-"ridden"products groups of interest to FSU exporters. Sectors in which NTBs are particularly important include fish, fruit, sugar, vegetables, beverages, textiles, clothing, and ferrous metals. OECD trade barriers on some FSU commodity exports provide high levels of"effective protection"that constrain the efforts of the newly independent states of the FSU (NISs) to increase domestic commodity processing. Although the United States has granted most-favored nation status to the NISs (excluding Azerbaijan), and the European Community recently signed the Agreements on Trade, Commercial, and Economic Cooperation with the Baltic states, these developments have not substantially improved their market access. Because of geographic proximity and the existing transportation network, the European market is the most important OECD market for most NISs. But under present EC arrangements, NIS products are subject to higher tariffs and more restrictive nontariff barriers than exports from EFTA members, Lome Convention signatories, or former European CMEA members (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia). Lower wage rates in many NISs may not be sufficient to compensate for their generally lower productivity and the losses in value added (triggered by higher tariffs) that exportershave to absorb to compete in protected markets. Except for exports of energy and industrial raw materials trade opportunities for many products in which the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union might have a comparative advantage are greatly restricted by OECD tariffs and nontariff barriers.
