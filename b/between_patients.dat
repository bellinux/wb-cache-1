As scoliosis perturbs the architecture of the shoulders, spine and pelvis, gait also differs <b>between</b> <b>patients</b> and non-scoliotic people.|$|E

Clarity of health care providers' explanations and length of wait time were both significantly associated with patient satisfaction.

Better patient experiences in health care facilities could potentially improve HIV treatment retention in eastern sub-Saharan Africa, a key step in the HIV treatment continuum of care...|$|R

Material and Methods: Mean and maximum SUV and HU values were recorded from the areas of interest (min 12 mm in diameter) which showed FDG uptake in prostate, seminal vesicles and testicles from F- 18 FDG PET-CT images of 21 male patients under 40 years without genitourinary cancer. The effect of patient age to SUV and HU values was examined with Pearson correlation test using SPSS program. Results: There was a negative insignificant correlation <b>between</b> <b>patient</b> age and SUV and HU values for prostate. For seminal vesicles, correlation <b>between</b> <b>patient</b> age and SUV values and HUmax were positive but insignificant, while correlation with HUmean was significant (r= 0. 459, p= 0. 00). Correlation <b>between</b> <b>patient</b> age and SUVmax and SUVmean values were significant for testicles (r= 0. 506, p= 0. 002 and r= 0. 467, p= 0. 005, respectively) but the correlation <b>between</b> <b>patient</b> age and HUmax and HUmean values was not significant. Conclusion: F- 18 FDG uptake in testicles in males increases with age until 40, suggesting an increase in metabolic rate. The significant correlation between age and mean HU values is probably caused by thickening of the tissue without an increase in glucose metabolism in seminal vesicles. In prostate, the effect of patient age to SUV and HU values was not observed until the age 40. (MIRT 2011; 20 : 104 - 107...|$|R
