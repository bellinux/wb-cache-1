5|$|Chris (Rob Lowe) has fired Denis Cooper, {{the former}} health {{department}} public relations director, who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife. Leslie (Amy Poehler) suggests Ann (Rashida Jones) replace him, mainly {{because they can}} spend more time together, since Ann has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> dating numerous men. Although reluctant to leave {{her job as a}} nurse, Ann agrees to attend the job interview, and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests they make a game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar. April pretends to be Janet Snakehole, an aristocratic widow with a dark secret, while Andy poses as his frequent alter-ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin.|$|E
