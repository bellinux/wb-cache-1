"With your permission, I {{am going}} to breakfast," [...] said Professor Tizzi, as the tray was set down before him {{on the part of}} his great work {{relating}} to the vital compound of Adam and Eve. As he spoke, he took up the piece of bread, and rubbed the crusty part of it with the bit of garlic, till it looked as polished as a new dining-table. That done, he turned the <b>bread,</b> <b>crumb</b> uppermost, and saturated it with oil, added a few drops of vinegar, sprinkled with pepper and salt, and, with a gleam of something very like greediness in his bright eyes, took up the knife to cut himself a first mouthful of the horrible mess that he had just concocted. [...] "The best of breakfasts," [...] said the Professor, seeing me look amazed. [...] "Not a cannibal meal of chicken-life in embryo (vulgarly called an egg); not a dog's gorge of a dead animal's flesh, blood and bones, warmed with fire (popularly known as a chop); not a breakfast, sir, that lions, tigers, Caribbees, and costermongers could all partake of alike; but an innocent, nutritive, simple, vegetable meal; a philosopher's refection, a breakfast that a prize-fighter would turn from in disgust, and that a Plato would share with relish." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> or {{breadcrumbs}} (regional variants: breading, crispies) {{are small}} particles of dry bread, used for <b>breading</b> or <b>crumbing</b> foods, topping casseroles, stuffing poultry, thickening stews, adding inexpensive bulk to soups, meatloaves and similar foods, {{and making a}} crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially breaded cutlets like tonkatsu and schnitzel.

5000|$|Sprout {{damage is}} {{undesirable}} germination of wheat kernels that occurs on mature, unharvested wheat when wet field conditions persist {{just prior to}} and during the harvest. Mature wheat that has been cut and left lying in the field prior to threshing is particularly vulnerable to sprout damage. Early cold weather in Canada often forces wheat producers there to cut and windrow their crop to allow for drying. Wet conditions can then cause widespread sprout damage. If it has occurred, there is a dramatic increase of the enzyme alpha-amylase. The Falling Number test {{is a measure of}} the presence of this enzyme. A high falling number indicates that the wheat is sound and satisfactory for most baking processes. A low falling number indicates that harmful sprouting has occurred and is suggestive of reduced baking quality. In bread, too much alpha-amylase activity will cause wet sticky <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> with large voids in the loaf and too little causes dry crumble <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> and high loaf density.|$|E

Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> (such as panko), heavy cream and others. <b>Bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs.</b> Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|R
5000|$|Panko (パン粉) is {{a variety}} of flaky <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> used in Japanese cuisine as a crunchy coating for fried foods, such as tonkatsu. Panko is made from bread baked by {{electrical}} current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb. [...] It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating. Outside Japan, its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes: It is often used on seafood and is often available in Asian markets, speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large supermarkets.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, street {{foods are}} usually sold {{by a small}} store which {{is a mix of}} a cafe/bar and a {{fast-food}} restaurant, known as a snackbar or cafetaria. These stores may also contain the typically Dutch vending machine, an automatiek. While patat friet forms the main portion of the foods sold, many other items are also on offer including different types of deep-fried snack meats such as kroketten and frikandellen, and cheese snacks such as the kaassouffle (cheese deep fried inside a crispy <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> crust). Often, the product range includes other foods such as hamburgers, ice cream, bread rolls with different fillings, and occasionally pizza, falafel, doner kebab and shoarma. Also sold may be deep-fried Vietnamese spring rolls and other originally Asian and/or Surinamese snacks like bapao (a baozi filled with minced meat) and barra (a deep-fried savoury doughnut).|$|E

50|$|Professional bread {{recipes are}} stated using the baker's {{percentage}} notation. The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, {{and the other}} ingredients are expressed {{as a percentage of}} that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours absorb about 62% water, while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%. Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread. Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water. In yeast breads, the higher water percentages result in more CO2 bubbles and a coarser <b>bread</b> <b>crumb.</b> One pound (450 g) of flour yields a standard loaf of bread or two French loaves.|$|E

50|$|Three rowdy ranch workers {{sitting at}} a table nearby throw a <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> at him, which he ignores. However, after a short while, they begin again. This time, Dahlmann stands up in order to exit the establishment. The shopkeeper (calling him by name) anxiously asks Dahlmann to pay them no heed, saying they are drunk. This prompts Dahlmann to do the opposite, to face them. One of the ranch workers brandishes a knife. Seeing the {{situation}} getting out of hand, the shopkeeper calls out that Dahlmann does not even have a weapon. At this point, an old man in the corner, a gaucho (which to Dahlmann represents the essence of the South as well as the past) throws a knife to Dahlmann. It lands at his feet. As he picks up the knife, Dahlmann realizes that it will not be of any use to his defense. He knows he has never wielded a knife in his life and that if he fights he is going to die. However, he feels that his death in a knife fight is honorable, that it is the one he would have chosen when he was sick in the hospital, and he decides to go. The story ends with Dahlmann and the farmer exiting the bar and walking into the plain.|$|E
