5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
25|$|To reduce tank {{pressure}} and weight, high flow turbopumps {{were used to}} <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Increased maximum <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> to take {{advantage}} of 150-grade fuel; 2,245hp (1,675kW) at 9,250ft (2,820m).|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} the engine could also change {{according}} to the octane rating of the aviation fuel being used. Higher octane fuels allowed <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> to be increased without the risks of pre-ignition or knocking.|$|R
50|$|Production {{commenced}} in 2004 and it {{is found}} in the BA/BF Falcon-based FPV F6 Typhoon and Tornado models. The increase in power is achieved through the use of higher <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> from the otherwise under-utilised large Garrett GT3540 turbocharger. It has a blue-coloured rocker cover.|$|R
50|$|A {{supercharger}} delivers near-constant <b>boost</b> <b>pressures,</b> and so {{fuel consumption}} suffers. Superchargers {{have the advantage}} of having no boost threshold (an rpm-level below which a turbocharger does not operate effectively) and almost no lag. Superchargers only need to be connected to the engine's intake system, thus making installation easier and reducing to some extent the increase in internal temperatures that occurs with turbocharging.|$|R
25|$|Increased maximum <b>boost</b> <b>pressure,</b> 1,850hp (1,380kW) at 2,000ft (610m); {{impeller}} diameter 9.75in (24.7cm). Used on Seafire Mk.XV and Mk. XVII, Spitfire XII.|$|E
25|$|Diesel engine : NMHC catalyst, NOx {{reduction}} catalyst, NOx absorber {{particulate matter}} filter, exhaust gas sensor, EGR system, VVT system, <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> control, fuel system.|$|E
25|$|It {{provides}} information about track in-use performance for NMHC catalyst, NOx catalyst monitor, NOx adsorber monitor, PM filter monitor, exhaust gas sensor monitor, EGR/ VVT monitor, <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor and fuel system monitor.|$|E
5000|$|The 2.5 {{engine was}} offered in a Turbo I form {{starting}} in 1989. This engine had {{multipoint fuel injection}} and was rated at [...] and 170 lbft Nm. In some models the 2.5 Turbo I was available in a [...] "High Torque" [...] version, which put out [...] and 210 lbft Nm by allowing higher <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> at low rpms.|$|R
25|$|A gas booster, to <b>boost</b> the <b>pressure</b> of the {{reclaimed}} gas to {{the storage}} pressure.|$|R
50|$|The {{charge air}} cooler, located between the {{turbocharger}} {{and the engine}} air inlet manifold, is an air-to-air heat exchanger. It reduces the inlet air temperatures of turbocharged diesel engines from 200°C to 45°C while increasing inlet air densities to increase engine efficiencies. Even higher inlet temperatures (246°C or higher) and <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> {{may be necessary to}} comply with the emissions standards in the future.|$|R
25|$|Rather than use {{inches of}} mercury, the British {{measured}} <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> in psi. A reading of +6 meant the air/fuel mix was being compressed to 20.7 psi (6 psi {{more than one}} atmosphere) before entering the engine; +25 meant the air/fuel mix was being compressed to 39.7 psi.|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b> The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E
25|$|Arthur Rowledge, one of Napier's chief {{engineers}} and the {{designer of the}} Napier Lion engine, became fed up with management and left for Rolls. In this one move any Napier design effort ended while Rolls' received a boost. Applying every known advance since the D-12 was introduced, Rowledge designed the new engine to use supercharging at all altitudes, allowing it to outperform naturally aspirated engines {{by as much as}} they were willing to increase the <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|This was however during qualifying, where teams used {{unrestricted}} <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> {{for maximum}} power output, and for very quick lap times. These unrestricted engines were very unreliable, and would only last {{about a couple}} clean laps. Therefore, the 98T produced around 900 HP in race trim. The 98T was also the final Lotus powered by a Renault engine, as Lotus switched to Honda for the following year/season.|$|R
40|$|The present article {{deals with}} what is {{considered}} to be a simpler and more accurate method of determining, from the results of bench tests under approved rating conditions, the power at altitude of a supercharged aircraft engine, without application of correction formulas. The method of calculating the characteristics at altitude, of supercharged engines, based on the consumption of air, is a more satisfactory and accurate procedure, especially at low <b>boost</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of performance tests of a single-cylinder 4 -stroke-cycle compression-ignition engine having a vertical disk form of combustion chamber without air flow. The number, size, and direction of the orifices of the fuel-injection nozzles used were independently varied. A table and graphs are presented showing the performance of the engine with different nozzles; results of tests at different compression ratios, <b>boost</b> <b>pressures,</b> and coolant temperatures are also included...|$|R
25|$|Following the turbo domination, forced {{induction}} {{was allowed}} for two seasons before its eventual ban. The FIA regulations limited <b>boost</b> <b>pressure,</b> to 4 bar in qualifying in 1987 for 1.5L turbo; and allowed a bigger 3.5L formula. These seasons were still dominated by turbocharged engines, the Honda RA167E V6 supplying Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Formula One season on a Williams also winning the constructors championship, followed by TAG-Porsche P01 V6 in McLaren then Honda {{again with the}} previous RA166E for Lotus then Ferrari's own 033D V6.|$|E
25|$|The RS6 {{was used}} in the North American SPEED World Challenge GT Series of auto racing for three years - 2002 to 2004, {{claiming}} the manufacturers' championship victory successively in all three years. Once again, the special race derivative of the twin-turbo V8 engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). However, the 2005 season proved difficult due to performance restrictions imposed on Champion Audi Racing by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), with Champion deciding to run a different wheel diameter, and the trade-off was reducing <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{wastegate}} {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> assisted, generally vacuum hose attachment point diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s electronic control unit or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open, thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{directly}} related to the Spitfire, the Supermarine engineers gained valuable experience of high-speed flight with the S.5 and S.6 aircraft, their next project being the Rolls-Royce Goshawk-powered Supermarine Type 224 prototype fighter aircraft. Technological advances used in the R engine, such as sodium-cooled valves and spark plugs able to operate under high <b>boost</b> <b>pressures,</b> were incorporated into the Rolls-Royce Merlin design. The author Steve Holter sums up the design of the Rolls-Royce R with these words: ...|$|R
40|$|Local <b>pressure</b> <b>boosting</b> {{system is}} a complex and {{switched}} system, which is widely used in modern pneumatic systems, to optimize local <b>pressure</b> <b>boosting</b> system; firstly, the basic and the dimensionless mathematical models of the local pressure system were setup. Furthermore, the mathematical models were verified through the experimental study on the local <b>pressure</b> <b>boosting</b> system. Moreover, the influences of the tank’s three main parameters {{on the performance of}} local <b>pressure</b> <b>boosting</b> system were studied. It can be seen that the pressure wave amplitude is mainly affected by the dimensionless volume of the tank; its influence degree is 95. 1 %, and it increases when the later one decreases. The pressure loss of the tank is mainly affected by the dimensionless output pressure, and its influence degree is 68. 7 %, and it decreases rapidly with the increase of the dimensionless output pressure of the tank. Last, the optimization method of the local <b>pressure</b> <b>boosting</b> system was obtained...|$|R
50|$|The rich mixing {{can lead}} to {{hesitation}} or even stalling of the engine when the throttle is closed, a situation that worsens with higher <b>boost</b> <b>pressures.</b> Occasional events of this type may be only a nuisance, but frequent events can eventually foul the spark plugs and destroy the catalytic converter, as the inefficiently combusted fuel produces soot (excess carbon) and unburned fuel in the exhaust flow can produce soot in the converter and drive the converter beyond its normal operating temperature range.|$|R
25|$|While North American were {{concentrating on}} {{improving}} {{the performance of}} the P-51 through the development of the lightweight Mustangs, in Britain, other avenues of development were being pursued. To this end, two Mustang Mk IIIs (P-51Bs and P-51Cs), FX858 and FX901, were fitted with different Merlin engine variants. The first of these, FX858, was fitted with a Merlin 100 by Rolls-Royce at Hucknall; this engine was similar to the RM 14 SM fitted to the XP-51G and was capable of generating 2,080hp (1,550kW) at 22,800ft (7,000m) using a <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> of +25lbf/in2 (170 kPa; 80 inHg) in war emergency setting. With this engine, FX858 reached a maximum speed of 453mph (729km/h) at 18,000ft (5,500m), and this could be maintained to 25,000ft (7,600m). The climb rate was 4,160ft/min (21.1m/s) at 14,000ft (4,300m).|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} which allowed the {{continued}} {{development of the}} Spitfire was the development of progressively more powerful and improved engines, starting with the Rolls-Royce Merlin and progressing to the bigger and more powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon. The evolution of high octane aviation fuels and improved supercharger designs enabled Rolls-Royce to extract increasing amounts of power from the same basic designs. For example, the Merlin II and III which powered the Spitfire I produced a maximum of 1,030 hp (770kW) using the 87 octane aviation fuel which was generally available from 1938 through to 1941; from early 1940 increasing supplies of 100 octane fuel allowed the maximum power to be increased to 1,310hp (977kW) with an increased supercharger <b>boost</b> <b>pressure,</b> albeit for a maximum time limit of 5 minutes. In 1944 100/150 grade fuels enabled the Merlin 66 to produce 1,860hp (1,387kW) at low altitudes in F.S gear.|$|E
25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the display unit {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including <b>boost</b> <b>pressure,</b> oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by.|$|E
50|$|In {{the real}} world, on high-rpm IR IC engine, using a {{minimum amount of}} inlet radius gives the best wave {{strength}} and a power boost of 2% to 4% over a 3000 to 3500 rpm range.Using a larger radius, like 3/4", broadens out the resonant pressure wave rpm range, but the compression <b>boosting</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is greatly diminished and almost unnoticed by the engine. The term air horn is sometimes used for velocity stacks; it is unrelated to the noise maker or signalling air horn.|$|R

The objective of the thesis is to propose suitable turbocharger´s concept for defined diesel combustion engine with power of 430 [kW]. The air <b>boosting</b> <b>pressure</b> is controlled by exhaust gas flow through the turbine and different EGR regimes, which are considered in the basic and corrected calculations.

50|$|Super GT {{is unique}} in its open and blunt {{statement}} that it is committed to providing exciting racing first, {{at the expense of}} runaway investment by works teams. GT500 cars are fitted with many common parts, lowering costs and equalizing the performance of those parts across all competitors. In the GT300 class, air restrictor sizes, minimum weights, ride heights, and maximum turbo <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> are modified on a race-to-race basis to balance performance across all cars. All adjustments to the regulations and the balance of performance are publicly accessible.|$|R

5000|$|After the Normandy landings, some Spitfires (Griffon and Merlin engine marks) were {{retained}} in Britain {{to counter the}} V-1 flying bomb offensive in mid-1944 {{as part of the}} ADGB. Supplies of a new aviation fuel, which was called [...] "150 Grade", arrived from America in March 1944 and sufficient quantities were available to be used by ADGB fighters as the V-1 offensive started. The new fuel enabled the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon engines to operate at higher <b>boost</b> <b>pressures,</b> especially at lower altitudes, {{for the duration of the}} anti-V-1 campaign.|$|R
50|$|Before 1950, Sulzer started {{experimenting with}} {{two-stroke}} engines with <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> {{as high as}} 6 atmospheres, {{in which all the}} output power was taken from an exhaust gas turbine. The two-stroke pistons directly drove air compressor pistons to make a positive displacement gas generator. Opposed pistons were connected by linkages instead of crankshafts. Several of these units could be connected to provide power gas to one large output turbine. The overall thermal efficiency was roughly twice that of a simple gas turbine. This system was derived from Raúl Pateras Pescara's work on free-piston engines in the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Other series {{configurations}} exist {{where no}} bypass system is employed and both compressors are in continuous duty. As a result, compounded boost is always produced as the pressure ratios {{of the two}} compressors are multiplied, not added. In other words, if a turbocharger which produced [...] (pressure ratio = 1.7) alone blew into a supercharger which also produced 10 psi alone, the resultant manifold pressure would be [...] (PR=2.8) rather than [...] (PR=2.3). This form of series twincharging allows {{for the production of}} <b>boost</b> <b>pressures</b> that would otherwise be unachievable with other compressor arrangements and would be inefficient.|$|R
