25|$|Aristotle's {{association}} with natural law {{may be due}} to the interpretation given to his works by Thomas Aquinas. But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics (Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render those more literally. Aristotle notes that natural justice is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of distributive and corrective justice that would be established under the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> community; were this to take the form of law, this could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the Politics that the best regime may not rule by law at all.|$|E

Lead singer Bono reasserted the song's anti-sectarian-violence message to his audience for many years. Today, it {{is considered one of}} U2's signature songs, {{and is one of the}} band's most performed tracks. Critics rate it among the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> protest songs, and it has been covered by over a dozen artists.

500|$|Enactment {{of welfare}} reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did. A third version came up during his 1996 general {{election}} campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again. But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> compromise available. This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called [...] "sad and painful".|$|E
500|$|Moore briefly {{supported}} the Liberal Party in the 1950s, though condemned the Liberal Democrats, saying he believed they could alter their position radically {{and that they}} [...] "would happily join up with the BNP or the Socialist Workers Party... if [...] they could win a few extra votes." [...] He admired the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and was briefly their financial adviser. He wrote in his autobiography that Liechtenstein – a constitutional monarchy headed by a prince – had the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> system in the world. Moore was {{a critic of the}} Iraq War, and said [...] "the world was a safer place when Ronald Reagan was in the White House". He was a patron of the British Weights and Measures Association.|$|E

Academic Robert Boyers calls it [...] "one of the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> novels of our period", and an historical novel because of its [...] "retrospective homage to generations past". Gordimer herself described Burger's Daughter as [...] "an historical critique", and a political novel, which she defines as a work that [...] "explicates the effects of politics on human lives and, unlike a political tract, does not propagate an ideology".|$|E

500|$|Arular {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from music}} critics. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, reported an average score of 88 based on 33 reviews, described as [...] "universal acclaim". Julianne Shepherd of Spin appreciated the album's fusion of [...] "hip hop's cockiness with dancehall's shimmy and the cheap and noisy aesthetics of punk" [...] {{and claimed that}} Arular would {{be regarded as the}} <b>best</b> <b>political</b> album of the year. Adam Webb, writing for Yahoo! Music, described the album's style as [...] "professionally amateurish" [...] and M.I.A.'s approach as [...] "scattergun", but said that she [...] "effortlessly appropriates the music of various cultures and filters them through the most elementary equipment". He said, [...] "dancehall is the primary influence, but also one of many seismic collisions with several other genres." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{fell into}} early debt; his wife began loaning him {{tens of thousands}} of dollars to keep it alive. [...] Donations also came in from Jim Hensley and other Hensley & Co. executives, but the amounts grew large enough that the Federal Election Commission forced some of it to be returned. [...] By the close of the primary, McCain was able to outspend his opponents; more of than half of his primary expenditures were financed by the eventual $167,000 that his wife lent to the campaign. [...] (The McCains had made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns. [...] In the end, $93,000 of the 1982 loan would be forgiven.) [...] The spending advantage made itself felt in television advertising, including a highly effective two-minute mini-documentary that presented him as new leader for Arizona with a record of service to the country. [...] Rival Mack later called that ad the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> commercial he had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|Although Cobden's {{views were}} more {{progressive}} {{than those of}} the Liberal Party's mainstream, she stayed a member of the party, believing that it remained the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> vehicle whereby her causes could be advanced. Other suffragists, including Anne Cobden Sanderson, took a different view, and aligned themselves with socialist movements. When the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) began its militant campaign in 1905, Cobden refrained from participation in illegal actions, although she spoke out for her sister when Anne {{became one of the first}} suffragists to be sent to prison, after a demonstration outside Parliament in October 1906. On Anne's release a month later, Cobden and her husband attended a celebration banquet at the Savoy Hotel, together with other WSPU prisoners. Cobden moved closer to the militant wing in 1907 when she endorsed the WSPU's new magazine, Votes for Women. That year she hosted an [...] "At Home" [...] meeting at which the WSPU leader Christabel Pankhurst was the principal speaker. The WSPU was split when members who objected to the Pankhurst family's authoritarian leadership formed themselves into the Women's Freedom League; Cobden did not join Anne in the breakaway movement, although she supported its associated body, the Women's Tax Resistance League.|$|E

The Welcome to Country was given by Auntie Millie Ingram [...] and eulogies were delivered by Graham Freudenberg, Cate Blanchett, Noel Pearson, John Faulkner and Antony Whitlam. Pearson's contribution in particular was hailed as [...] "one of the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> speeches of our time". Musical performances were delivered by William Barton (a didgeridoo improvisation), Paul Kelly and Kev Carmody (their land rights protest song From Little Things Big Things Grow), {{as well as the}} Sydney Philharmonia Choir and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Benjamin Northey. In accordance with Whitlam's wishes, the orchestra performed [...] "In Tears of Grief" [...] from Bach's St Matthew Passion, [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] from Verdi's Nabucco, [...] "Un Bal" [...] from Symphonie fantastique by Berlioz and, as the final piece, Jerusalem by Parry. [...] Jerusalem was followed by a flypast of four RAAF F/A-18 Hornets in missing man formation. [...] Those attending the memorial included the current and some former governors-general, the current and all living former prime ministers, and members of the family of Vincent Lingiari.

2500|$|... 2015 Greek {{sovereign}} debt default: The publicly acrimonious discussions between Greece and EU-ECB-IMF troika {{culminated in the}} 2015 Greek referendum which massively rejected the terms for accepting bail-out money [...] {{and led to a}} surge in public support for populist political parties in Southern European countries. The suggestion of a temporary 'time-out' from the EuroZone for Greece by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and a German Finance Ministry suggestion that Greece move titles to Greek assets - including heritage sites and islands to an [...] "external fund" [...] based in Luxembourg to serve as collateral in exchange for bail-out money from the EU-ECB-IMF troika; infuriated many policy-makers who perceived Germany's demands as humiliating punishment and refreshed memories to post-WWII reparations owed by the German government which were never fully repaid due to extensive debt-relief accorded to Germany. Pablo Iglesias, a prominent anti-austerity leader in Spain, hailed the Greek rejection of the bailout plan and expressed solidarity with Greece: [...] "We don’t want to be a German colony". In Italy, Beppe Grillo mocked Germany and the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF troika of lenders saying [...] "Now Merkel and bankers will have food for thought.". Jacob Soll, professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California, summarized the sentiment amongst academics in Germany: [...] "Germans were honest dupes and the Greeks corrupt, unreliable and incompetent.". Expressing dismay about the far-reaching geopolitical implications of Greece leaving the Eurozone, Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, termed the German-inspired policy prescriptions as deeply flawed and possibly unachievable by Greece [...] "even with the <b>best</b> <b>political</b> will in the world." [...] and warned how the Grexit ("Greece exit") will be perceived elsewhere: [...] "EU can’t get its act together" [...] adding {{that it would be a}} [...] "huge blow for the EU particularly in the eyes of the outside world: China, India, Russia, and the U.S., not to mention closer neighbors." [...] Leading academics and analysts highlighted that EuroZone anti-deficit policies forced upon Greece by the German-backed troika to curb public spending had brought about deflationary pressure, weakened demand and led to widespread unemployment in several EuroZone countries. Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics winner, stated that he was troubled by the actions of the troika to use economics as a weapon to force a regime change in Greece. Fellow Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz squarely faulted the troika for imposing upon Greece an [...] "unconscionable torture of the present". Wharton finance professor Bulent Gultekin opined: [...] "The endless austerity measures have made it worse for the country. It's been the wrong remedy for the wrong patient at the wrong time". John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed to the source of the current crisis : [...] "Europe should not have bailed out German and French banks and allowed Greece to default in the first instance. In a currency union, {{sovereign debt}} is like corporate debt. Corporations default — or they should — without bailouts, and don’t leave a currency zone when they do so. Europe should not have allowed and encouraged national banks to load up on national debts." [...] Francesco Caselli, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, opined that Greece should [...] "focus on structural reforms rather than austerity. Greece should have gotten meaningful debt relief and much more time to balance the deficit." [...] Olivier Chatain, strategy and business policy professor at HEC business school in Paris opined: [...] "There's a big chasm between what's asked of Greece and what they can do." [...] Mauro Guillén, Wharton management professor and director of The Lauder Institute urged an effort from the creditor nations: [...] "Wages in Germany should rise and government demand for goods and services should increase,(...) Surplus economies, like Germany and the Netherlands, who can spend more should do so". Patrick Minford, professor of economics at Cardiff University in Wales pointedly observed the destructive nature of German economic policies which result in massive trade surpluses for Germany while pauperising weaker EuroZone countries: [...] "unhealthy for Germany to run very large trade surpluses. They’re sabotaging the rest of Europe." [...] Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute assessed the current situation saying: [...] "Greece's debt cannot be paid back under any circumstances, (..) They need to undergo bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot move forward until the Germans and Dutch begin to realize this money will never get paid back and [...] are pushing the Greek economy further into depression." ...|$|E
