5|$|Bullets and casings {{found at}} a scene require a known example to compare {{to in order to}} match them to a weapon. Without a weapon, the {{striation}} pattern can <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> to a database such as the National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network (NIBIN) maintained by the ATF or the United Kingdom's National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS). Information uploaded to these databases can be used to track gun crimes and to link crimes together. Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> into the database.|$|E
5|$|YouTube accepts {{videos that}} are {{uploaded}} in most container formats, including AVI, MP4, MPEG-PS, QuickTime File Format and FLV. It supports WebM files and also 3GP, allowing videos to <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> from mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|Players can pan {{around a}} map {{as the camera}} focuses on areas of intense fighting, and the Ghost Cam allows a player to roam freely around a map. The ability to take {{photographs}} is also featured, which enables the player to take a photo, which can <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> to the Gears of War website and is rated {{on the quality of}} action in the shot.|$|E

5|$|Videos with {{progressive}} scanning or {{interlaced scanning}} can <b>be</b> <b>uploaded,</b> {{but for the}} best video quality, YouTube suggests interlaced videos be deinterlaced before uploading. All the video formats on YouTube use progressive scanning. YouTube's statistics shows that interlaced videos are still being uploaded to YouTube, {{and there is no}} sign of that actually dwindling. YouTube attributes this to uploading of made-for-TV content.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{contains}} non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables {{players to}} insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps. Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects {{can be placed}} and moved on maps with Forge. Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time. A budget limits the amount of objects that can be placed. Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360's hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. Halo 3 offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> to Bungie's official website, Bungie.net. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on Halo 3.|$|E

25|$|TVNZ OnDemand is Television New Zealand's on-demand {{streaming}} platform, TVNZ OnDemand {{was launched}} March 20, 2007, {{and is available}} on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 via the TVNZ app on PlayStation Network for New Zealanders. It is also available on FreeviewPlus, iOS, Android, Xbox One and Windows 10. The content uses geotargeting for New Zealand only connections via a US-based Brightcove media company using the Akamai RTMP network, with some local content being made available to an international audience via their YouTube channel. At the end of 2012, the contract with Brightcove was expanded to include streaming to iOS devices via the Akamai HLS network. From 2012, TVNZ OnDemand began uploading episodes of select shows prior to their airing on TVNZ channels and usually within a day of their original overseas airings (although sometimes this was weeks or months after their international airing). In September 2014, {{it was announced that}} episodes of seventeen shows would <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> within a day of their airings in the US, coinciding with the 2014-2015 season. One of the shows, Manhattan Love Story was cancelled by the US network ABC, but episodes continued to <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> to TVNZ OnDemand in line with their intended US airings, making TVNZ the de facto original broadcaster of the series. On May 1, 2016 (01.06 am), when TVNZ Kidzone (channel version) closed it is now on TVNZ OnDemand with lot of the shows to watch (it is still use the former channel programs).|$|E
25|$|In 2008, RiffTrax {{launched}} iRiffs, {{which allows}} fans to upload commentaries {{to be sold}} on the website. iRiffs users are paid 50% of the net revenue generated by their products. iRiffs differentiates from normal RiffTrax in that both serious and humorous commentaries can <b>be</b> <b>uploaded.</b> In February 2009, a contest was held by RiffTrax, in which a winning iRiffs user would be given $1,000 {{and a chance to}} develop a RiffTrax Presents title, receiving instruction and critique from Nelson, Murphy and Corbett. The winners of the contest were Doug Walker, Rob Walker and Brian Heinz of That Guy with the Glasses, who contributed an iRiff of The Lion King. The RiffTrax commentary they produced was for Batman Forever.|$|E

25|$|While iTunes 10 {{supported}} the Cloud, {{it did not}} integrate offline and cloud libraries. A list of previously purchased content was accessible via the iTunes store, where users could download content to the device they were using. Automatic downloading of newly purchased content could also be enabled, and iTunes Match allowed content purchased outside of the iTunes store to <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> to the Cloud. With the release of iTunes 11, the Cloud became fully integrated into iTunes. Content stored in a user's Cloud is displayed {{in the same way}} as that stored on their device, and online content does not have to be downloaded to be played. Films and TV shows also resume from where they were left off on the last device to have played them.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomics {{methods are}} highly {{parallel}} and require significant computation to produce meaningful data for both microarray and RNA-Seq experiments. Microarray data is recorded as high-resolution images, requiring feature detection and spectral analysis. Microarray raw image files are each about 750 MB in size, while the processed intensities are around 60 MB in size. Multiple short probes matching a single transcript can reveal {{details about the}} intron-exon structure, requiring statistical models to determine {{the authenticity of the}} resulting signal. RNA-Seq studies produce billions of short DNA sequences, which must be aligned to reference genomes composed of millions to billions of base pairs. De novo assembly of reads within a dataset requires the construction of highly complex sequence graphs. RNA-Seq operations are highly repetitious and benefit from parallelised computation but modern algorithms mean consumer computing hardware is sufficient for simple transcriptomics experiments that do not require de novo assembly of reads. A human transcriptome could be accurately captured using RNA-Seq with 30 million 100 bp sequences per sample. This example would require approximately 1.8 gigabytes of disk space per sample when stored in a compressed fastq format. Processed count data for each gene would be much smaller, equivalent to processed microarray intensities. Sequence data may be stored in public repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RNA-Seq datasets can <b>be</b> <b>uploaded</b> via the Gene Expression Omnibus.|$|E
