50|$|Cyclone <b>Tilo</b> <b>was</b> {{preceded by}} the extratropical remains of ex-Hurricane Noel on 7 November, which {{paved the way}} for the {{stronger}} upstream storm Tilo. The jet stream was diverted to the north by a strong ridge of high pressure to the west of Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean forcing the jet stream over the north of Greenland and back towards Europe. The unusually long fetch was considered important in the potential destructiveness of the storm, stretching down from the Norwegian Sea into the North Sea before reaching the east coast of England and the Dutch and German coasts. In combination with a high tide, the tidal level was expected to exceed 3 m above normal sea levels.|$|R

40|$|Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's The Mistress of Spices (1997) explores {{issues of}} ethnic {{autonomy}} and feminine identity through its protagonist Tilo, an Indian immigrant in America, who is endowed with magical abilities to conjure {{the power of}} spices which she uses for healing people at her grocery store in Oakland, California. Tilo's fate comes to represent the complex socio-political debates surrounding cultural assimilation and racial othering in contemporary America on the one hand, and a woman's struggle against Indian tradition and patriarchy, on the other. In order to befit the gender roles prescribed by consumerist America, Tilo frames an exotic identity for herself selling mystical spices and practices from India and accordingly becomes the site of confluence of tradition and modernity in the novel. The chief problematic in the narrative, however, {{lies in the fact}} that in America while <b>Tilo</b> <b>is</b> free to help others transcend pain and seek autonomous identities, she herself remains confined by and rooted in Indian patriarchal culture and tradition which wield complete control over her mind and body. The present paper, by employing postcolonial and transnational discourses vis-à-vis diasporic femininity, attempts to explore how Tilo negotiates and subsequently attains an autonomous identity in Divakaruni's novel...|$|R

40|$|We report our experience, {{begun in}} 1998 {{on a small}} island in the Dodecanese area of Greece, which has been called TIMTEM. The aim of this project was to improve care for people liv-ing on islands, {{creating}} a model exportable to other rural areas. The operative setting of the TIMTEM project is the island of Tilos (Greece); local authorities take part in it {{under the guidance of}} the only physician available on the island. The University of Pisa–Italy (Depart-ment of Surgery, Post-graduate School of Emergency Surgery) manages the scientific and or-ganizational part of the project. <b>Tilos</b> <b>is</b> a rocky Mediterranean island with a surface of 64 km 2 and a population of about 500 inhabitants (with a peak of 2, 000 tourists in July and Au-gust). A physician and a nurse are responsible for the only medical care on the island, and they also dispense drugs. The project was implemented on three phases. During the first phase, a campaign was held to encourage the population to cooperate with clinical data col-lection; a temporary telemedicine station was established, and a complete screening of the population was performed. The second phase was focused on the application of telesonog-raphy. During the third phase, a telematic and/or direct participation for reference hospital physicians (Regional Medical Society–Dodecanese) and for Greek physicians was planned. As well, a fully equipped central telemedicine station in the reference hospital was estab-lished under the local jurisdiction. The results of the third phase are still incomplete; the data presented here are preliminary. But all indicators show that the project is exportable to re-mote areas elsewhere...|$|R
