40|$|Repository In a <b>Box</b> (<b>RIB)</b> is a {{software}} package for creating WWW metadata repositories. Interoperation, {{as one of}} the most significant features of RIB, allows repositories using similar data models to share metadata with each other. Interoperation had very limited capabilities in the previous implementations. This report presents ideas as well as their implementations on how to improve the interoperability of RIB. Application areas of interoperation will be broadened as a result of these improvements. The improved interoperability provides a general framework for effective sharing of metadata at various granularities, ranging from an entire repository to individual objects. Improving the interoperability of RIB will be a continuing work to create user-customized features, to meet specific user needs, and to make the interoperation among repositories more powerful and more useful...|$|E

Using the finite element program ANSYS, space finite element model of an arch bridge with two {{inclined}} thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>ribs</b> is build, stability safety factor of the bridge is calculated, eigenvalue buckling analysis and non-linear buckling analysis of inclined thin-walled ribs are carried out, and stability performance is discussed. The result shows that stability problems of this bridge mainly occur on the ribs and are out-of-plane buckling in general, and horizontal loads have greater influences on out-of-plane buckling.

50|$|The forward wing {{was divided}} into two half spans so that their angles of {{incidence}} could be altered together to control pitch or independently for roll. The semi-spans were built around main box spars with spruce spar caps and plywood webs. Forward of the spar the wings were ply skinned, forming a D-shaped torsion <b>box.</b> <b>Ribs</b> were built from spruce trellis work. There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim tab was positioned inboard on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place. A long trailing edge flap could be raised, but not lowered, to steepen descents. The tips carried triangular endplate fins fitted with horn balanced rudders, spring centred and only opening outwards. These vertical tails were wooden structures with fabric covering.|$|R

Structurally, the all-wooden wing was built around two <b>box</b> spars, <b>ribs</b> and three-ply skin. There were narrow-chord, full-span ailerons, each divided into two parts, the outer section conventional and the inner serving as a camber-changing flap.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of the distributed digital rights management (DDRM) system as undertaken by the eduSource project, a national network of learning object repositories built by a consortium of universities and other agencies in Canada. DDRM is foremost a system of rights expression, with transactions managed by a set of brokers acting on behalf of purchasers and providers. Rights are described using ODRL, contained in files managed by the provider broker, and accessed by means of pointers in the learning object metadata exchanged within the eduSource network. 1. eduSource The eduSource project is a network of Canadian learning object repositories providing access to all Canadian educational institutions to a broad array of educational resources. Funded by the contributions of project partners (more than 30 universities, agencies, and businesses across Canada) and by CANARIE, Canada’s Advanced Internet Development Organization, the intent of eduSource is to &quot;create a testbed of linked and interoperable learning object repositories. &quot; (McGreal, et. al., 2003) The development of eduSource involves not only the design of a suit of software applications, referred in project documentation as the Repository in a <b>Box</b> (<b>RiB),</b> it is also intended support the ongoing development of standards based tools, systems, practices and protocols necessary for a national learning infrastructure. eduSource is based in part on three prior CANARIE funded initiatives...|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built to replace an 1888 {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge; workers used the old bridge to begin construction of the present bridge's <b>box</b> steel <b>ribs.</b> Construction was made difficult by the great depth of the river at the bridge site and by the water traffic during construction. Construction workers used the cables of the old bridge to support the arch prior to completion by running cables from the arch, over the cables to an anchor on the far side. Once the new arch was completed, the old suspension bridge was dismantled. The present bridge was opened for public use on December 28, 1922; the cost of construction was published as $300,000.|$|R

A brief description of the definition of each mass is given for each component. As the split into 18 components is very detailed one might also sum up the different masses according to different mass accounting standard, such as e. g. DIN 9020 or the Airbus Mass Standard. Finally the validation of the different formulae is given in chapter 5. ...|$|R

40|$|When a {{concrete}} member is loaded {{for a long}} period of time, creep and shrinkage of concrete gradually develop. The prediction of this time-dependent behaviour is important as it may cause serious serviceability problems in concrete structures. The shape and size of {{a concrete}} cross-section and environmental conditions have an important effect on the moisture flow and moisture distribution of a concrete cross-section and affect the drying shrinkage and drying creep behaviour and thus the long-term behaviour of the concrete member. The impact of the shape and size of the cross-section on the net macroscopic temporal strain and curvature due to shrinkage is investigated in this contribution using numerical simulations. A time-dependent analysis is commonly based on equations given by design codes. The effect of moisture diffusion in these equations is included in an empirical manner and is commonly, among others, defined based on the notional size of the element. As a result of the investigations performed in this contribution, simple shape correction factors are proposed which can be applied to the notional size of elements with different shapes in order to improve the accuracy of the time dependent prediction of drying creep and shrinkage of existing code formulations. The proposed correction factor is based on numerical simulations of different geometries (rectangular, circular, T-shaped beams, <b>ribbed</b> plates, <b>box</b> girders, <b>ribbed</b> plates, hollow core slabs, TT-elements) and a wide range of element sizes...|$|R
40|$|The Rock Island Centennial Bridge {{spanning}} the Mississippi River between Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa was opened to traffic on July 12, 1940. It is a thoroughly modern, four-lane highway bridge, adequate {{in every respect}} for present day high speed passenger and transport traffic. The structure is ideally situated to provide rapid transit between the business districts of Rock Island and Davenport and serves not only the local or shuttle traffic in the Tri-City Area, but also heavy through motor travel on U. S. Highways 67 and 150. The Centennial Bridge is notable in several respects. The main spans are <b>box</b> girder <b>rib</b> tied arches, a type rather unusual in America and permitting simplicity in design with pleasing appearance. The Centennial Bridge is the only bridge across the Mississippi providing for four lanes of traffic with separation of traffic in each direction. It is a toll bridge operating alongside a free bridge and has the lowest rates of toll of any toll bridge on the Mississippi River. It was financed entirely by the City of Rock Island with no obligation on the taxpayers; there was no federal or state participation in the financing. But perhaps the most outstanding feature of the new bridge is its great need. A few remarks on the communities served by the new structure, the services rendered, and some statistics on cross-river traffic in the Tri-City Area will emphasize the reasons for constructing the Centennial Bridge...|$|R
50|$|The HKS-1 was {{a wooden}} aircraft, largely {{covered with a}} plywood/rigid plastic foam/plywood {{sandwich}} skin (PFP). The wings had strong spruce and ply double <b>box</b> spars; major <b>ribs</b> were made from PFP and were assisted by intermediate foam ribs. The first two layers of the sandwich skin were added from the leading edge to an auxiliary spar at 70% chord and precisely shaped. The outer plywood sheet of the PFP sandwich was then wrapped continuously around and glued to the inner layers, leaving no gaps. Final external shaping reduced the waviness to 50 μm. Before this outer layer was attached, the area of it corresponding to the last 30% of chord, where it formed the whole skin thicknees, was weakened by cuts through its inner plies, making it flexible enough to warp when driven by internal parallelogram frames opened and closed by lateral control rods. The edges could be warped differentially to act as ailerons or together to change camber. Control loads were reported as heavy.|$|R
40|$|A {{concept is}} {{presented}} here for simultaneous optimization of an aircraft wing shape and gauges of the corresponding structural wing box. The approach also follows {{the concept of}} a single common parametric description as a basis for structural and aerodynamic modelling. The coordinates of the segment corners or typical planform parameters like the wing sweep angle represent the design variables for planform variation. Control points of parametric Bezier surfaces are used to de¯ne the thickness distribution of the wing box structural elements (skin, ribs, and spars). This concept also takes into consideration common design rules for practicable wing box structures. The parametric description of the gauges of the wing box structural elements guarantees the creation of regular and smooth surfaces and thus supports the generation of practicable thickness distributions from the design engineer's point of view. To improve the optimization e±ciency a lumping of certain stress constraints using the Kreisselmeier/Steinhauser-Function was introduced. A generic wing design is presented as an application and test example for which conventional FE-based thickness optimiza- tions were already performed with various sweep angles. A further example is that of a wing with identical external geometry but with a more realistic wing <b>box</b> structure. Its <b>ribs</b> are perpendicular to the front spar and must be regenerated if the external geometry is modi¯ed...|$|R

Such duct geometries {{can be found in}} many engineering applications where cooling air extracts heat from hot internal walls of the duct, e. g., passage cooling inside gas turbine blades. Both friction factors and convective heat transfer coefficients were measured inside a U-duct for three different cases, namely (a) the smooth straight part, (b) the smooth bend (turn) part, and (c) a rough (ribbed) bend (turn) part. The details of the duct geometry were as follows: the cross section area of the straight part was 50 x 50 mm(2), the inside length of the bend part 240 mm, the cross section area of the rib was 5 x 5 mm(2) and the rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, e/D-h, was 0. 1.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of an adaptive {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) wing actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) devices is presented. The wing consists of a sandwich <b>box</b> substructure, flexible <b>ribs,</b> and a flexible laminated skin. The adaptation capability to the changing flight conditions is obtained via airfoil shape adjustments. Torsion SMA tubes are employed for wing camber control, while levers powered by SMA wires are employed for local shape control. A new architecture is proposed: the downward or upward actuation torque is provided by counterrotating concentric tubes connected through a clutch and a positioning piezoelectric motor to the flexible ribs. These actuator tubes are heated {{one at a time}} while the other is made free by the clutch in order to obtain any wanted shape without waiting for cooling. The capability of the wing to bear the aerodynamic loads, the power required by the actuators, and their force and torque are assessed by finite-element simulations. An improved version of a recently developed element is employed that accurately and efficiently captures stresses and deformations in the composite structure. The wing requires a peak power of 1, 223 W that is compatible with the UAV considered here, i. e., with a maximum take-off weight of 1, 000 kg and jet engine. It can smoothly deform with a camber mean rotation of 22 ° and rotation at the tip of 40 ° with a load factor of 5, a differential camber rotation of 10 °, and a profile variation from 40 to 55 % of the chord (4. 5 % increase and 3. 9 % decrease of thickness) at cruise spee...|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{experimental and}} numerical studies of pressure drop and heat transfer for turbulent flow inside a U-duct {{and in particular}} the bend part. Such duct geometries can be found in many engineering applications where cooling air extracts heat from hot internal walls of the duct, e. g., passage cooling inside gas turbine blades. The details of the duct geometry were as follows: the cross section area of the straight part was 50 x 50 mm 2, the inside length of the bend part 240 mm, the cross section area of the ribs was 5 x 5 mm 2 and the rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, e/Dh, was 0. 1. For the experimental study both friction factors and convective heat transfer coefficients were measured inside a U-duct for three different cases, namely (a) the smooth straight part, (b) the smooth bend (turn) part, and (c) a rough (ribbed) bend (turn) part. The Reynolds number was varied from 8, 000 to 20, 000. For case (c) different configurations and arrangements of ribs (single rib, two ribs and three ribs as well as continuous and truncated ribs) were tested inside the bend part. A value of Reynolds number of 20, 000 was used in comparison between the cases. The test rig has been built {{in such a way that}} various experimental setups can be handled as the bend (turn) part of the U-duct can easily be removed and the rib configuration can be changed. Both the U-duct and the ribs were made from acrylic material to allow optical access for measuring the surface temperature by using a high-resolution measurement technique based on narrow band thermochromic liquid crystals (TLC R 35 C 5 W) and a CCD camera placed facing the bend (turn) part of the U-duct.
