5|$|A {{week after}} being upset by LSU, Alabama {{returned}} to Bryant–Denny {{and began a}} three-game homestand to end the season by defeating long-time rival Mississippi State 30–10. The Crimson Tide took a 6–3 lead {{in the first quarter}} by trading field goals with the Bulldogs on a 36-yarder from Jeremy Shelley, a 24-yarder from Derek DePasquale and a 45-yarder from Cade Foster. In the second, Alabama reached the end zone {{for the first time on}} the evening after Greg McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 45-yard touchdown reception and a 13–3 lead. After a punt on the next Bulldog series, an 80-yard Maze touchdown return was called back as a result of an illegal block on the play by Alex Watkins. On the next play, Mark Ingram took a short <b>bubble</b> <b>screen</b> pass from McElroy 78-yards for a 20–3 lead at the half.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, and after achieving a first down, Christian Hackenberg threw a 68-yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown, the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had {{allowed in the}} previous eight quarters. Wisconsin failed to respond, going three-and-out, and punting on their subsequent drive. Penn State, though they began with poor field position, converted a few third downs, gained 52 yards on a <b>bubble</b> <b>screen</b> to Allen Robinson, and ultimately {{was faced with a}} fourth down and inches in the red zone, but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit. The field goal was blocked, continuing Penn State's special teams woes, however their defense remained stout, forcing another punt, however on the Lions' ensuing drive, Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day, forcing a punt. In the waning minutes of the first quarter, the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game. At the end of the quarter, they trailed 7–0, but were threatening, and a few minutes later, tied the game via a 4-yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak. Later in the quarter, Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation, and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth. On their next drive, Penn State was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized, and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3-yard pass to Geno Lewis. Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play, and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout, it was not granted, and the play stood. At the half, the score was tied at 14. After Wisconsin's opening drive stalled, the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put Penn State on top 21–14. On the ensuing Wisconsin drive, Penn State freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory. Penn State earned points, with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28-yard field goal to put Penn State up by 10 points. On the next two drives, each team went three-and-out. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal; at the end of the quarter, Penn State led 24–14. On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter, Trevor Williams intercepted Stave's pass, ending a scoring threat, and furthering the Nittany Lions' momentum. Penn State started their drive at their own 28-yard line, and had a third down and short, but a false start backed them up to a third and long; Hackenberg was unfazed, however, as he threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis, putting Penn State up by three possessions, 31–14. Down three scores, Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown, and tried to convert a fourth down and 23, but Penn State recorded a sack, and subsequently got the ball with 9:49 to play. They failed to execute, and about a minute later, punted the ball away. Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10, 31–21, on a Wozniak reception, his second touchdown catch of the day. Penn State got the ball off an onside kick with good field position, and faced a third down and three, but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day, and Penn State had to throw the ball, and the pass was incomplete. Penn State's subsequent punt was blocked. On the ensuing drive, Jack Russell kicked a career long 48-yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points. Penn State started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20-yard line. Penn State got some decent yardage on first down, but committed another false start, backing them up. Zwinak came through for the Lions, however, rushing on third-and-nine for 61 yards, his longest run of the season. From there, Penn State's drive stalled, and with 35 seconds left, Ficken attempted a 31-yard field goal, but missed, and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown, and they did get into Penn State territory, but ultimately, with nine seconds left, Stave threw the ball into the end zone, and Penn State safety Ryan Keiser came away with the interception for a touchback. Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game, and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset, winning 31–24.|$|E

40|$|Combinatorial {{synthesis}} {{and screening}} for discovery of electrocatalysts has received increasing attention, particularly for energy-related technologies. High-throughput discovery strategies typically employ a fast, reliable initial screening technique that {{is able to}} identify active catalyst composition regions. Traditional electrochemical characterization via current–voltage measurements is inherently throughput-limited, as such measurements are most readily performed by serial screening. Parallel screening methods can yield much higher throughput and generally {{require the use of}} an indirect measurement of catalytic activity. In a water-splitting reaction, the change of local pH or the presence of oxygen and hydrogen in the solution can be utilized for parallel screening of active electrocatalysts. Previously reported techniques for measuring these signals typically function in a narrow pH range and are not suitable for both strong acidic and basic environments. A simple approach to screen the electrocatalytic activities by imaging the oxygen and hydrogen bubbles produced by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported here. A custom built electrochemical cell was employed to record the bubble evolution during the screening, where the testing materials were subject to desired electrochemical potentials. The transient of the bubble intensity obtained from the screening was quantitatively analyzed to yield a bubble figure of merit (FOM) that represents the reaction rate. Active catalysts in a pseudoternary material library, (Ni–Fe–Co) O_x, which contains 231 unique compositions, were identified in less than one minute using the <b>bubble</b> <b>screening</b> method. An independent, serial screening method on the same material library exhibited excellent agreement with the parallel <b>bubble</b> <b>screening.</b> This general approach is highly parallel and is independent of solution pH...|$|R

5000|$|In {{their final}} game of the season, Penn State looked to play spoiler and try to prevent Wisconsin from {{achieving}} a 10-win season and BCS Bowl opportunity in coach Gary Andersen's first season with the Badgers, who entered the game with a 9-2 record and were 24-point favorites to win the game. The Badgers entered the game still employing their quintessential offensive philosophy even under their new coach - a power running game behind a physical offensive line led by two of the top rushers in the country, Melvin Gordon and James White, both of whom were on the preseason watchlist for the Doak Walker Award (given to the nation's best running back) and the former of whom was named one of ten semifinalists for the award in mid-November. White, a tough runner {{in the middle of the}} field, had emerged in recent weeks, whereas Gordon, a speedster, led the team in rushing and led the country with an 8.2 yards-per-carry average. Wisconsin's offense also featured a strong passing game, highlighted by quarterback Joel Stave and favorite target Jared Abbrederis, however one game preview asserted that Penn State's defense matched up well against the Badgers' offense. Defensively, Wisconsin entered the game the fifth-best scoring defense in the country, allowing just 13.4 points per game. The [...] "stingy" [...] defense, the preview noted, would likely prove problematic for Penn State.Penn State received the opening kickoff, and after achieving a first down, Christian Hackenberg threw a 68-yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown, the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had allowed in the previous eight quarters. Wisconsin failed to respond, going three-and-out, and punting on their subsequent drive. Penn State, though they began with poor field position, converted a few third downs, gained 52 yards on a <b>bubble</b> <b>screen</b> to Allen Robinson, and ultimately was faced with a fourth down and inches in the red zone, but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit. The field goal was blocked, continuing Penn State's special teams woes, however their defense remained stout, forcing another punt, however on the Lions' ensuing drive, Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day, forcing a punt. In the waning minutes of the first quarter, the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game. At the end of the quarter, they trailed 7-0, but were threatening, and a few minutes later, tied the game via a 4-yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak. Later in the quarter, Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation, and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth. On their next drive, Penn State was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized, and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3-yard pass to Geno Lewis. Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play, and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout, it was not granted, and the play stood. At the half, the score was tied at 14. After Wisconsin's opening drive stalled, the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put Penn State on top 21-14. On the ensuing Wisconsin drive, Penn State freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory. Penn State earned points, with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28-yard field goal to put Penn State up by 10 points. On the next two drives, each team went three-and-out. At the end of the third quarter, Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal; at the end of the quarter, Penn State led 24-14. On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter, Trevor Williams intercepted Stave's pass, ending a scoring threat, and furthering the Nittany Lions' momentum. Penn State started their drive at their own 28-yard line, and had a third down and short, but a false start backed them up to a third and long; Hackenberg was unfazed, however, as he threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis, putting Penn State up by three possessions, 31-14. Down three scores, Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown, and tried to convert a fourth down and 23, but Penn State recorded a sack, and subsequently got the ball with 9:49 to play. They failed to execute, and about a minute later, punted the ball away. Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10, 31-21, on a Wozniak reception, his second touchdown catch of the day. Penn State got the ball off an onside kick with good field position, and faced a third down and three, but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day, and Penn State had to throw the ball, and the pass was incomplete. Penn State's subsequent punt was blocked. On the ensuing drive, Jack Russell kicked a career long 48-yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points. Penn State started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20-yard line. Penn State got some decent yardage on first down, but committed another false start, backing them up. Zwinak came through for the Lions, however, rushing on third-and-nine for 61 yards, his longest run of the season. From there, Penn State's drive stalled, and with 35 seconds left, Ficken attempted a 31-yard field goal, but missed, and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown, and they did get into Penn State territory, but ultimately, with nine seconds left, Stave threw the ball into the end zone, and Penn State safety Ryan Keiser came away with the interception for a touchback. Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game, and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset, winning 31-24.|$|E
50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is reminiscent}} of that of Tetris and Puzzle Bobble in that {{the goal is to}} steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to other bubbles of similar color {{along the top of the}} screen. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated <b>bubbles</b> on <b>screen</b> reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{two-phase}} electrolysis processes, {{for example}} for hydrogen production, there are bubbles which are created at electrodes. This implies a great vertical motion {{source in the}} normal earth gravity field and then a quite important natural two-phase convection. All other fields are then affected. Heat, mass and electricity transfers are modified due to both <b>bubbles</b> <b>screening</b> (at surface and in volume) and to bubbles transport promotion. Many numerical modeling for two-phase processes such as kerosene pulverization in engines or coal combustion sciences have shown the difficulties of these multi-physics processes. Both particles and reactor scales must be considered according with a strong coupling modeling. In these processes the particles injection is "in the flow". In boiling or electrolysis processes, a new difficulty is added: particles birth or injection is strongly coupled to the local flow properties and leads to a complex boundary condition at surfaces. Electrical and electrochemical properties and processes are disturbed. This disturbance {{can lead to the}} modification of the local current density and to anode effects for example. There is few works concerning the local modelling of electrochemical processes during a two-phase electrolysis process. There are also few local experimental measurements in term of chemical composition, temperature or current density which will allow the numerical calculations validation. The present work shows the started numerical modeling strategy and the first results, both experimental and numerical obtained...|$|R
