40|$|Two {{aspects of}} {{mechanical}} property improvement {{in a modern}} low carbon copper bearing {{high strength low alloy}} (HSLA) steel have been investigated. These aspects are precipitation hardening by fine copper rich particles and, secondly, the production of fine packets of <b>bainitic</b> and martensitic <b>structures</b> with retained austenite films. The investigation involved a detailed study of the isothermal and continuous cooling transformation characteristics and microstructural evolution in commercially hot rolled samples of CR HSLA 80 steel, which is a low carbon low alloy variant of the ASTM A 710 type structural steel. The TIT- and CCTdiagrams were constructed by a combination of dilatometry and metallographic methods. It has been found that the austenite stabilising elements of copper, nickel and manganese significantly suppress the decomposition of austenite to lower transformation temperatures resulting in a prominent transformation region for <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures,</b> at temperatures intermediate between those of diffusional product (polymorphic ferrite) and the displacive transformation to martensite. The intermediate transformation range involves two typical stages: (i) the formation of a bainitic matrix at the early stage of transformation and (ii) decomposition of remaining carbon enriched austenite regions at lower temperatures. In the intermediate region, the microstructures were largely characterised by a bainitic matrix containing a high dislocation density, together with a minor dispersed 2 ̆ 2 island 2 ̆ 2 phase. Either on continuous cooling or a short isothermal holding time (5 seconds) at intermediate temperatures (580 - 430 °C), the island phase was identified as untempered twinned and lath martensite, autotempered twinned and lath martensite, and martensite/austenite constituent, depending on the level of carbon partitioning in the remaining austenite before quenching in water. For a longer isothermal holding time, the carbon enriched austenite regions decomposed to carbide and ferrite by coupled growth. Polygonal and quasi-polygonal ferrite were observed to grow across and eliminate the prior austenite grain boundaries at relatively high transformation temperatures. These structures contained low dislocation densities and e-copper precipitates formed by an interphase transformation mechanism. At a cooling rate ranging from 0. 35 to 20 °C/s, the structure was characterised by a mixture of quasi-polygonal ferrite, Widmanstatten side-plate ferrite, and <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures</b> associated with minor dispersed islands of martensite and/or retained austenite which were dark etching on preparation for optical microscopy. This microstructure develops by the following processes. The Widmanstatten side-plate ferrite nucleates from the ferrite grain boundary allotriomorphs at the early stage of transformation, together with the bainitic ferrite plates which nucleate directly at the prior austenite grain boundaries. On further cooling, the neighbouring plates of Widmanstatten ferrite and bainitic ferrite each tended to coalesce and the volume of untransformed austenite decreased and the shapes of the yγ particles evolved into residual islands between the ferrite plates. Provided the cooling rate was greater than 20 °C/s, the bainitic ferrite plates nucleated directly at the prior austenite grain boundaries, and the plate morphology was revealed by regions of elongated retained austenite or its decomposition products. At the fastest cooling rate obtained by dilatometry in this work (375 °C/s), the structure was largely characterised by a mixture of bainitic ferrite and martensitic packets surrounded by retained austenite films. Dilatometric and metallographic examination of the martensite and bainitic ferrite formed on rapid cooling failed to find a clear microstructural distinction between the two products. The packets of bainitic ferrite plates were generally nucleated directly from the prior austenite grain boundaries, whereas, the martensite was characterised by thinner ferritic units with a higher dislocation density. There also appeared to be a larger number of variants of lath packets and apparent intragranular nucleation in the case of martensitic ferrite. The general relationship between transformation on continuous cooling and transformation at constant temperature was also studied in the low carbon ferritic steel. It was found that the progress of isothermal ferritic transformation kinetics can be well expressed by the Avrami type equation (X= 1 -exp-K(T) tn). Considering the continuous cooling to be a series of isothermal steps, the temperature dependence of K(T) is determined from the isothermal kinetics data, assuming that 2 ̆ 2 n 2 ̆ 2 is independent of temperature. Using this expression, a kinetic equation for austenite decomposition during cooling was derived by extension of the additivity rule to the whole range of fractional completion. It has been shown that there is a good agreement between the measured and calculated CCT-curves. The experimental results indicated that the strength of CR HSLA 80 can be improved substantially by copper precipitation, and that the potential of copper based precipitation hardening is significantly affected by the pre-aging treatment. The copper age hardening response was investigated at temperatures of 450, 500, and 550 °C for three pre-treated structures (as rolled ferrite, bainitic ferrite, and martensite). The aging results reveal that the age hardening responses of both the martensitic and. <b>bainitic</b> ferrite <b>structures</b> are higher than that of the as rolled steel, and this observation is rationalised in terms of higher solute Cu content, and a higher density and greater uniformity of dislocations which provide a multitude of nucleating sites for copper precipitation. Moreover, it has been found that the peak hardness in the martensitic and <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures</b> was attained when copious amounts of fine ε-copper precipitates were observed on dislocations. Compared to the martensitic and bainitic cases, the presence of pre-existing interphase ε-copper precipitates, as well as the formation of additional copper-rich clusters and precipitates from supersaturated ferrite contribute to the aging response in the hot rolled condition. Examination of the commercial hot rolled samples of CR HSLA 80 steel indicated that relatively coarse interphase copper precipitates formed in the hot rolled steel plate during austenite to ferrite transformation on cooling from the rolling finish temperature and thus the full strengthening potential of the alloy was not achieved by the subsequent aging treatment. Higher strength levels can be obtained by cooling rapidly to temperatures lower than 580 °C to suppress interphase precipitation on cooling, producing Cu supersaturated <b>bainitic</b> or martensitic <b>structures,</b> and then aging to produce fine multivariant copper precipitation in the matrix...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the effects of Mn and Nb on the macro- and microsegregation of new-developed (3 - 5) Mn 1. 5 Al TRIP steels in the as-cast state and after hot forging. Design/methodology/approach: To assess possible macro- and microsegregation the chemical composition was investigated in the macro scale by OES and by the use of EDS in microregions. To reveal the macrostructure the ingots were etched by Oberhoffer’s reagent. The chemical composition along a diameter of the ingots was tested as well as in different regions of the plastically deformed flats. Metallographic investigations were carried out using optical (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The Mn and Nb contents have significant effects on the obtained bainitic-martensitic structures and the morphology of retained austenite. The tendency to macrosegregation of Mn and Al between middle and external parts of the as-cast ingots and hot forged flats was detected. The Nb micoalloying results in the overall refinement of obtained microstructures and reduces the identified segregation of Al and Mn. A little microsegregation of these alloying elements between structural constituents was also detected.

Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment and thermomechanical processing in a two-phase region to obtain ferritic – <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures</b> with the retained austenite in a low-carbon microalloyed steel were conducted. The heat treatment consisted of austenitizing of specimens at 750 °C, oil cooling, isothermal holding in a temperature range from 300 °C to 500 °C and slow cooling to room temperature. A part of the specimens was forged with a degree of deformation of 28 % before cooling. Optical and transmission electron microscopy were employed for structure observations. The retained austenite amount was determined by X-ray diffraction method. Findings: It was found that hot-working in the γ+α range contributes to a considerable refinement of a ferritic matrix. The grain size of the α phase is about 4 µm and its volume fraction equals from 60 to 68 %. The optimum structure containing 10 % fraction of retained austenite was obtained for the specimen forged in the two-phase region and isothermally held at a temperature of 300 °C.

40|$|Low carbon {{bainitic}} steels microalloyed with Nb, Ti and V {{are widely}} used for the pipeline, construction and automobile industries because of their excellent combination of strength, toughness and weldability. Boron as another major alloying element has been also frequently used {{in this type of}} steels since the 1970 s. The purpose of adding boron is to improve the hardenability of the steel by promoting bainite formation. It has been realized that Boron can only be effective as a strengthening element when it is prevented from forming BN and/or Fe 23 (C, B) 6 precipitates. Therefore, Boron is always added together with other alloying elements which are stronger Nitride or Carbide formers, such as Ti and Nb. However, the formation of complex <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures</b> and the interaction with precipitates at industrial coiling temperature are not adequately understood. In this study, the effect of boron on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a low carbon Nb-B steel was studied by a hot compression test (50 % reduction at 850 °C) followed by quenching samples into a salt bath. The microstructures of the tested samples were examined through optical microscopy and SEM; and the mechanical properties of these samples were investigated by micro-hardness and shear punch tests. The results indicate that during thermo-mechanical controlled rolling (TCR), the final properties of the products not only depend on the applied deformation but also depend on the coiling temperature where phase transformation takes place. According to the investigation, two strengthening mechanisms are responsible for the strength of the steel at the coiling temperature: phase transformation and precipitation. Under optical microscopy, the microstructures of all specimens appear to be bainite in a temperature range from 350 °C to 600 °C without distinct differences. However, the SEM micrographs revealed that the microstructures at 550 °C are very different from the microstructures transformed at the other holding temperatures. Two strength peaks were observed at 350 °C and 550 °C in the temperature range studied. It is believed that the NbC precipitates are the main contributor to the peak strength observed at 550 °C because the kinetics of NbC is quite rapid at this temperature. The strength peak at 350 °C is mainly due to the harder bainitic phase, which formed at relatively lower temperature...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the ever rising demands on {{material}} properties, microstructures in modern steel grades are often not only composed of several phases, but also become increasingly smaller and more complex in composition. These tendencies lead to big problems in the characterization. The small sizes of the structural constituents hamper the investigation and mapping processes. At the same time, a definite and quantitative characterization is prohibited {{by the presence of}} multiple phases, the complexity of their arrangements and the wealth of microstructural variants. This situation has a negative impact on the development and on the application of new materials, because in both cases a definitive characterization is required. The aim of this work is to create a tool for the quantitative characterization of fine-grained, multiphase and complex microstructures. In order to achieve this, an analysis method is developed based on the so-called object-based image analysis. The method aims at the analysis of scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) images, because SEM provides a good compromise between achievable high resolutions and the speed of investigation, i. e. it is possible to investigate statistically relevant areas in a reasonably short timeframe. The development is done in several stages, in which different analysis strategies are tested and evaluated. Simultaneously, the complexity of the investigated microstructures is gradually increased. The design of the analysis method is inspired by the human cognition process, which is very effective and flexible due to its simple core-structure. The final version of the image analysis routine is divided into two strictly separated steps: 1. Structure cognition: The structures within an image are analyzed and information about geometries and contexts of the identified constituents are extracted. No classification takes place in this step. 2. Classification: Using the information from the structure cognition, the microstructural constituents are classified. The structure cognition routine is universally applied in all analyses while each classification routine is specialized on a distinct microstructural type, like for instance ferritic-pearlitic structures in an AFP-steel or <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures</b> in a HDB-steel. The analysis routine is applied and tested in 5 practical scenarios, in which process dependent variations of different microstructural types are investigated. By applying the image analysis routine, large data sets become available, which provide information on phase fractions, sizes, shapes and distributions of all detected microstructure constituents. With this information it is possible to reveal correlations between process, microstructure and mechanical properties in the test scenarios. The routine also proves to be highly transferable. It allows the analysis of large numbers of SEM images with relatively few resources. The ability to quantify microstructural characteristics that is provided by the developed method solves many of the problems currently occurring during the efforts of classifying complex microstructures. The data sets delivered by the analysis method complement the characterization of microstructures in modern steel grades with essential information and allow a better comprehension of the complex interactions of the constituents...|$|R

The cooling ranges of UIC 60 type railway tracks plot on the CCT diagrams indicate {{that there is a}} 100 % <b>bainitic</b> <b>structure</b> in the scissors crossovers made of these cast steels as well, but mainly it would be a favourable for cracking resistance lower bainite. The achievable hardness of scissors crossovers made of new materials make it possible to use high–temperature tempering resulting in obtaining of good crack resistance. However one should provide a good quality of castings made...|$|E
40|$|The {{machinability}} of two prehardened mould steels, one continuously-cooled and one quenched and tempered, {{is compared}} {{in terms of}} cutting temperature, cutting force and tool life. Both materials have a hardness of ~ 40 HRC which is a typical hardness for prehardened mould steels. The results of machinability are related to mechanical properties and microstructural features, and the material removal rate is estimated for the materials. The continuously-cooled steel with <b>bainitic</b> <b>structure</b> shows higher machinability and possesses superior impact toughness and ductility compared to the {{quenched and tempered steel}} with martensitic structure. These properties are very important for plastic mould steels. The continuously-cooled bainitic steel also has the advantage of not requiring any costly quenching and tempering processes in connection with its production...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{microstructural}} and mechanical properties of high-carbon steel surface welded layer obtained with self-shielded flux cored wire {{are presented in}} standard rails and crossings. The testing results of tensile characteristics, hardness, toughness via instrumented Charpy pendulum, microstructural analysis and fatigue crack growth resistance of all characteristical zones are analyzed in detail, especially {{from the point of}} view of interaction between microstructure and properties. The obtained results indicate superior properties of repaired welded layers, which is due to their similarity to the new generation of bainitic steel, i. e., due to the change of microstructure from original pearlitic structure to final <b>bainitic</b> <b>structure.</b> Finally, fatigue crack growth parameters have shown that deposite layer has higher resistance than the crack growth, improving overall reliability of rails and crossings...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Influence of austenitiziation {{parameters}} (temperature and time) on {{grain size}} and mechanical properties of low alloy cast steel have been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The grain size of former austenite {{was determined by}} Image Pro Plus software and its distribution by STATISTICA software. The fractography was characterized using TEM. Moreover, mechanical properties (impact energy and hardness) have been measured. Findings: What has been evaluated is the optimum range of austenitization temperatures {{making it possible to}} obtain fine austenite grain in the Cr–Mo–V cast steel. Received mechanical properties (after various austenitization parameters) revealed an advantage of tempered <b>bainitic</b> – ferritic <b>structure</b> over the ferritic – pearlitic one (after full- and under-annealing). Practical implications: The established heat treatment parameters can be useful for preparation of regenerative heat treatment technology of Cr–Mo–V casts steels. Originality/value: The relationship between the austenitization parameters, grain size and mechanical properties in G 21 CrMoV 4 – 6 cast steel was specified...|$|R
40|$|S. G Cast iron {{is defined}} as a high carbon containing, iron based alloy in which the {{graphite}} is present in compact, spherical shapes rather than in the shape of flakes, the latter being typical of gray cast iron. As nodular or spheroidal graphite cast iron, sometimes referred to as ductile iron,constitutes a family of cast irons in which the graphite is present in a nodular or spheroidal form. The graphite nodules are small and constitute only small areas of weakness in a steel-like matrix. Because of this the mechanical properties of ductile irons related directly to the strength and ductility of the matrix present—as is the case of steels. One reason for the phenomenal growth in the use of Ductile Iron castings is the high ratio of performance to cost that they offer the designer and end user. This high value results from many factors, one of which is the control of microstructure and properties that can be achieved in the ascast condition, enabling a high percentage of ferritic and pearlitic structure. Heat treatment is a valuable and versatile tool for extending both the consistency and range of properties of Ductile Iron castings beyond the limits of those produced in the as-cast condition. Thus, to fully utilize the potential of Ductile Iron castings, the designer {{should be aware of the}} wide range of heat treatments available for Ductile Iron, and its response to these heat treatments. The most important heat treatments and their purposes are:Stress relieving - a low-temperature treatment, to reduce or relieve internal stresses remaining after casting Annealing - to improve ductility and toughness, to reduce hardness and to remove carbides Normalizing - to improve strength with some ductility Hardening and tempering - to increase hardness or to give improved strength and higher proof stress ratio Austempering - to yield <b>bainitic</b> <b>structures</b> of high strength, with significant ductility and good wear resistance Surface hardening - by induction, flame,or laser to produce a local wearresistant hard surface 1 Although Ductile Iron and steel are superficially similar metallurgically, the high carbon and silicon levels in Ductile Iron result in important differences in their response to heat treatment. The higher carbon levels in Ductile Iron increase hardenability, permitting heavier sections to be heat treated with lower requirements for expensive alloying or severe quenching media. These higher carbon levels can also cause quench cracking due to the formation of higher carbon martensite,and/or the retention of metastable austenite. These undesirable phenomena make the control of composition, austenitizing temperature and quenching conditions more critical in Ductile Iron. Silicon also exerts a strong influence on the response of Ductile Iron to heat treatment. The higher the silicon content, the lower the solubility of carbon in austenite and the more readily carbon is precipitated as graphite during slow cooling to produce a ferritic matrix. Although remaining unchanged in shape, the graphite spheroids in Ductile Iron play a critical role in heat treatment, acting as both a source and sink for carbon. When heated into the austenite temperature range, carbon readily diffuses from the spheroids to saturate the austenite matrix. On slow cooling the carbon returns to the graphite "sinks",reducing the carbon content of the austenite. This availability of excess carbon and the ability to transfer it between the matrix and the nodules makes Ductile Iron easier to heat treat and increases the range of properties that can be obtained by heat treatment. Austempered Ductile Irons (ADI) are the most recently developed materials of the DI family. By adapting the austempering treatment initially introduced for steels to DI, it has been shown that the resulting metallurgical structures provide properties that favorably compare to those of steel while taking advantage of a near-net-shape manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|White layers, formed during hard {{turning and}} wire {{electric}} discharge machining, {{were characterized by}} means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Different cutting speeds and flank wear were utilized {{in order to obtain}} different thermally and/or plastically deformed white layer. Since the white layer after wire electric discharge machining is mainly thermally induced, it was used as a reference structure. In the investigation, both <b>bainitic</b> and martensitic <b>structures</b> were studied. With a constant flank wear of 0. 175 mm the thickness of the white layer increased from 1. 5 μm to 3 μm as the cutting speed was increased. In both processes the white layer were characterized by nano-sized grains and surface tensile residual stresses. M 3 C carbides were observed in the hard turned white layer, indicating that the time and temperature needed for completely dissolving the carbides were not reached during cutting. For both materials the white layers formed by wire electric discharge machining consisted of ~ 30 vol. % of retained austenite. Observation regarding the volume fraction of the retained austenite in the white layer formed by hard turning for martensitic material showed an increase in the volume fraction of retained austenite from ~ 2 - 3 vol. % to ~ 6 vol. %, while this observation was not seen in the white layer formed in the bainitic material...|$|R
