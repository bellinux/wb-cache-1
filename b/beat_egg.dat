40|$|Every fact or {{task that}} we remember—the {{shape of the}} utensil we call a fork, the {{appropriate}} hand-motion needed to <b>beat</b> <b>egg</b> whites until fluffy, or the sequential steps involved in baking a cake—must be encoded by long-lasting {{changes in the way}} that our neurons function and in the strength with which they connect and communicate to each other. Current experimental evidence has led neuroscientists to propose that learning elicits a particular pattern of electrical activity in neurons, which can in turn induce changes in their morphology, their responsive-ness to incoming signals, the expression of their genes, and the strength of their connection to other neurons. These changes are the cellular counterpart of {{what we think of as}} memory. However, neuro-scientists have not found many mechanisms by which a neuron can store information relative to its previous activity. In a study just published in PLOS Biology, Friedrich Johenning, Anne-Kathrin Theis, Dietmar Schmitz, Sten Rüdiger, and colleagues provide evidence that specific electrical activity within neurons induces a long-lasting change in the amplitude of transitory increases of calcium ion concentration (Ca 2 + transients) inside dendritic spines—the special-ized protrusions of the dendrites of a neuron, which receive input from other neurons vi...|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} {{stress of}} <b>beating</b> <b>egg</b> whites {{can create a}} foam. Two types of physical stress are caused by beating them with a whisk, {{the first of which}} occurs as the whisk drags the liquid through itself, creating a force that unfolds the protein molecules. This process is called denaturation. The second stress comes from the mixing of air into the whites, which causes the proteins to come out of their natural state. These denatured proteins gather together where the air and water meet and create multiple bonds with the other unraveled proteins, and thus become a foam, holding the incorporated air in place, because the proteins consist of amino acids; some are hydrophilic (attracted to water) and some are hydrophobic (repelled by water). This process is called coagulation.|$|R

50|$|Mechanically made foams and froths, {{involves}} {{methods of}} introducing bubbles into liquid polymerisable matrices (e.g. an unvulcanised elastomer {{in the form}} of a liquid latex). Methods include whisking-in air or other gases or low boiling volatile liquids in low viscosity lattices, or the injection of a gas into an extruder barrel or a die, or into injection molding barrels or nozzles and allowing the shear/mix action of the screw to disperse the gas uniformly to form very fine bubbles or a solution of gas in the melt. When the melt is molded or extruded and the part is at atmospheric pressure, the gas comes out of solution expanding the polymer melt immediately before solidification. Frothing (akin to <b>beating</b> <b>egg</b> whites making a meringue), is also used to stabilize foamed liquid reactants, e.g. to prevent slumping occurring on vertical walls before cure - (i.e. avoiding foam collapse and sliding down a vertical face due to gravity).|$|R
50|$|In this capacity, {{it is the}} {{saponins}} {{found in}} soapberries that allow the formation of Indian ice cream. Like <b>beating</b> an <b>egg</b> white, agitating the soap berries introduces air into solution.

However, by stabilizing the interface of the dispersed and continuous phases of the foam, the air remains trapped in the agitated berry solution.|$|R

5000|$|The cake has a {{reputation}} as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor <b>beating</b> <b>egg</b> whites to frothy soft peaks. The wood-fired ovens of the time had no thermostats, making it difficult to produce a white cake. The pecans, raisins and coconut had to be chopped by hand or, more often, put through a meat grinder. [...] The filling ingredients can be chopped in an electric food processor today. Modern refrigeration also makes it easier to produce a stiff filling, allowing one to build an orderly multi-layer cake, rather than a sticky, lopsided dessert. Even with modern conveniences, making a traditional Lane cake is still quite a task to undertake. It is still a special cake, best made several days in advance of an important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas. By the time the cake arrived overseas, the spirits, raisins and cake had fermented into a special delight. Many southern families have stories of [...] "the best cake ever tasted".|$|R
