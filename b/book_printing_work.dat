50|$|The first {{copyright}} {{law in the}} United States, the Copyright Act of 1790, covered maps, charts or <b>books.</b> The <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> was protected for 14 years from registration of its title with the district court, and could be renewed for another 14 years by the author, if still alive.It did not provide for the copyright to be vested initially in an individual or employee who ordered or commissioned a map, chart or book.The work only covered American authors, allowing publishers to flood the market with cheap reprints of British books.The first major revision was the Copyright Act of 1831, which extended the initial term to 28 years with the option to renew for another 14 years, and granted widows and children of deceased authors the right of renewal.|$|R

40|$|A {{collection}} of handwritten books helped create {{one of the}} world’s first libraries, the great Library of Alexandria, which was accidentally burned down by Julius Caesar in 48 BC. Yet it was technology [...] -the invention of the printing press in 1439 [...] -that led to an explosion of books (not to mention pamphlets, magazines, journals and other <b>printed</b> <b>works)</b> and of libraries. Grand libraries {{were built in the}} 19 th and 20 th centuries, culminating in the grandest of all, the US Library of Congress, which houses 32 million <b>books</b> and other <b>printed</b> <b>works.</b> Today, technology is also revolutionising reading material, and with that libraries. Books now comprise a small proportion of what we read [...] -for Swinburne’s library, books are less than 25 per cent of what readers use; the rest is almost entirely digital and online content. Professor John Tarrant, secretary-general of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, has said: “The coming of the information technology revolution … has changed the role of libraries just as radically as did the mechanical printing press. ” It therefore raises the question, ‘Can the library make a second radical change in its role [...] -this time from print to digital?...|$|R

5000|$|The {{end date}} for {{identifying}} a <b>printed</b> <b>book</b> as an incunable is convenient but was chosen arbitrarily; {{it does not}} reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. <b>Books</b> <b>printed</b> {{for a number of}} years after 1500 continued to look much like incunables, with the notable exception of the small format <b>books</b> <b>printed</b> in italic type introduced by Aldus Manutius in 1501.

5000|$|He quit in 1844 at age {{fourteen}} {{and became}} an apprentice at the printing house headed by Zaharia Carcalechi, hoping to further his education by reading the <b>books</b> <b>printed</b> there. <b>Working</b> 14 hours a day, he became a qualified printer in 1848. In 1854, he was hired at the Copainie typography. In 1858, {{within the context of}} talks about the unification of Romanian Principates, the printing house accepted to publish the secret correspondence of Prince Nicolae Vogoride without the accord of the censorship. The police arrested all those involved and Petre Ispirescu was jailed for a month, losing his job. By the end of the year, Vasile Boerescu - a supporter of the union of Romanian Principalities and future Foreign Minister - offered him the manager position of a modern typography that owned the first mechanical printing press in Bucharest and published the Nationalul newspaper. His position introduced him to contemporary politicians and writers like Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Nicolae Filimon, Ion Ghica, and Dimitrie Bolintineanu. In 1863, Vasile Boerescu sold the typography and Petre Ispirescu became the manager of the typography publishing the Liberal Party newspaper Romanul. At the time, the Liberal Party was the main opposition party. The newspaper was suppressed in 1864. Ispirescu, together with Walter Scarlat and Frederick Gobl, then founded the United Workers Typography. A year later, Ispirescu publishes the Romanian Typographer pamphlet. The abdication of the first ruler of United Romanian Principalities Alexandru Ioan Cuza in 1866 is recorded with sadness there. After becoming the sole associate of the printing house, he renamed it Romanian Academy Publishing House in 1878.|$|R
