40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the factors that}} determine Indonesian <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> {{both before and after}} the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC). In the pre-AFC period, bank capital holdings are positively associated with <b>bank</b> revenue <b>risk,</b> which is attributed to a combination of regulatory laxity as well as laxity of enforcement. In the post-AFC period, capital is found to reduce <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> in a non-linear manner. Franchise value is associated with lower <b>bank</b> <b>risk,</b> but in a non-linear manner; low levels of franchise value are associated with increased <b>bank</b> <b>risk,</b> while higher levels of franchise value result in lower <b>bank</b> <b>risk.</b> It is also concluded the low-to-medium levels of bank loan growth are associated with lower bank risk; however, high levels of loan growth are risk increasing. These results point to the importance of enforcement of regulatory oversight in reducing <b>bank</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} ownership structure, managerial shareholdings, and {{national laws and regulations}} on <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> taking. Consistent with recent theories, we find that large owners with substantial cash flow rights increase <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> taking, but this relationship depends on management structure, investor protection laws, and bank regulations. Furthermore, standard bank regulations, such as capital requirements, supervisory oversight, and prompt corrective action policies, do not directly influence risk taking. Rather, regulations stressing diversification reduce <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> in economies with supportive legal systems. The results highlight the need to examine how a bank’s ownership and management structure combine with national policies to shape <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> taking...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of banking {{supervision}} in controlling <b>bank</b> <b>risk.</b> <b>Banking</b> supervision is {{measured in terms of}} enforcement outputs (i. e., on-site audits and sanctions). Our results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between on-site audits and <b>bank</b> <b>risk,</b> while the relationship between sanctions and risk appears to be linear and negative. We also consider the combined effect of effective supervision and banking regulation (in the form of capital and market discipline requirements) on <b>bank</b> <b>risk.</b> We find that effective supervision and market discipline requirements are important and complementary mechanisms in reducing bank fragility. This is in contrast to capital requirements, which prove to be rather futile in controlling <b>bank</b> <b>risk,</b> even when supplemented with a higher volume of on-site audits and sanctions. ...|$|R

40|$|Measures of Sovereign and <b>Bank</b> <b>Risk</b> show {{occasional}} {{bouts of}} increased correlation, {{setting the stage}} for vicious and virtuous feedback loops. This paper models the macroeconomic phenomena underlying such bouts using CDS data for 10 euro-area countries. The results show that Sovereign Risk feeds back into <b>Bank</b> <b>Risk</b> more strongly than vice versa. Countries with sovereigns that are more indebted or where banks have a larger exposure to their own sovereign, suffer larger feedback loop effects from Sovereign <b>Risk</b> into <b>Bank</b> <b>Risk.</b> In the opposite direction, in countries where banks fund their activities with more foreign credit and support larger levels of non-performing loans, the feedback from <b>Bank</b> <b>Risk</b> into Sovereign Risk is stronger. According to model estimates, financial rescue operations can increase feedback effects from <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> into sovereign risk.

40|$|The roles bank {{franchise}} value (‘skin in the game’) and CEO ownership play in determining <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> are studied for large United States Bank Holding Companies.

We argue that these {{results are consistent with}} those of Robert Merton, but in the context of franchise value rather than bank capital and deposit insurance, and accordingly offer some policy recommendations for regulatory monitoring of <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> that are consistent with these results...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION 1 Not {{too many}} years ago, the then Chairman of the U. S. House Banking Committee {{told me it was}} out of the {{question}} to require banks and savings and loans to mark their assets to market. Would anyone responsible for financial regulatory oversight have the temerity to be similarly dismissive today? I suspect the answer is yes. However, the increased attention formal, scientific appraisal of <b>bank</b> <b>risks</b> has received since then is gratifying to me and, I imagine, to most financial economists. The fact that contemporary <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> management employs many of the important theoretical and methodological advances in our field is a source of collective pride. My role on this program is to outline some of the theoretical underpinnings of contemporary <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> management. I shall begin with a discussion of why <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> management is needed. Then I shall provide some of the theoretical bases for <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> management with an emphasis on market and credit risks. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} interrelationship between {{financial}} openness, <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> and <b>bank</b> profit efficiency using a cross-country sample of 2, 007 commercial banks covering 140 countries {{over the period}} 1999 - 2011. To establish whether the impact of financial openness on both <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> and profit efficiency occurs directly or through {{each one of the}} two bank characteristics (efficiency and risk, respectively), we begin our analysis by investigating the potential reverse Granger causality between profit efficiency and risk using a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimation. We then account explicitly for the role of <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> in the estimation of bank profit efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis, allowing for the influence of different measures of financial openness and risk alongside other control variables. Our results indicate that financial openness reduces bank profit efficiency directly, not through changes in <b>bank</b> <b>risk.</b> We also find that financial openness increases <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> indirectly, through the decreased bank profit efficiency channel...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{trend of}} product {{diversification}} in the Indonesian banking industry {{underscores the importance}} of non-interest income activities. This study examines the relationship between product diversification and <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> over the period of 2002 - 2008. Our analysis shows clear evidence that the effect of product diversification on <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> depends highly on the bank's asset size. Specifically, the degree of product diversification is negatively associated with <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> for small-sized <b>banks.</b> Conversely, the degree of product diversification is positively related to <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> for large-sized <b>banks.</b> This finding suggests that deregulation encouraging banks to become more involved in non-traditional activities may have an adverse effect on the overall banking system where large-sized banks are playing a significant role in Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|The <b>banking</b> <b>risk</b> {{management}} {{is always a}} relevant topic in financial sector’s academic literature, but the detailed analysis of current studies showed {{that there is a}} lack of studies in risk management’s economic efficiency assessment in retail banking, where the risk management system’s administration cost may be a significant part of total credit institution’s cost. The scientific problem of this article is: how the economic efficiency of retail <b>banking</b> <b>risk</b> management system could be defined and assessed? To reach the aim, the risk management’s economic efficiency concept in retail banking is discussed and the risk management system development relevance in the context of economic efficiency is analyzed. The results of research allows concluding that the change of risk management system’s economic efficiency might be expressed as net benefit of risk management, which shows the difference between the change of risk cost and the change of risk management system’s administration cost.

40|$|This paper commences {{with the}} notion that {{existing}} international <b>banking</b> <b>risk</b> scoring systems are largely indicators of economic and finance related risk. They are, therefore, predicated primarily on historical economic data, and, to a lesser extent, on historical financial data. This is despite the fact that risk ratings agencies state that there is a significant subjective component. Evidence has been provided that, together, the economic and financial variables explain almost 85 % of the variance of overall international <b>banking</b> <b>risk</b> scores. The non-economic and non-finance components, or the component based on subjective assessment, {{has been shown to be}} a very small part of overall risk. Based on an overall IBR model, a new portfolio based model for total international <b>banking</b> <b>risk</b> and risk scoring is promulgated. The qualification is that that further work on the unsystematic component is required and is currently being undertaken. The importance of the study lies in an obvious need for detailed risk analysis so that cross border lending losses can be minimised. ...|$|E
