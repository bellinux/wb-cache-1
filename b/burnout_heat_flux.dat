40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Incipient boiling {{and burnout}} heat fluxes were studied for sub-cooled forced {{convection}} annular flow. Small wires varying from 0. 010 to 0. 020 {{inch in diameter}} were used as the inner core of the annulus and a one inch ID glass tube 24 inches long {{was used as the}} outer tube. This gave diameter ratios from 100 : 1 to 50 : 1. The water flow rate varied from 685, 000 to 2, 710, 000 LBM/(hr. ft. ²) at a constant temperature of 208. 4 °F and a constant pressure of 18. 7 psia. Alternating current was supplied to the wires, and the power required for incipient boiling and <b>burnout</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> measured.

50|$|A second {{method of}} {{measuring}} <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> is {{by using a}} <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor, or <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> transducer, to directly measure the amount of heat being transferred to/from the surface that the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor is mounted to.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{measuring}} <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> {{of boiling water}} is designed and built to study critical <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> (CHF) and observe the response of a <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor when CHF occurs. A high temperature <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor {{is embedded in the}} wall of a pipe to get a direct measurement of the surface <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> and sensor temperature. By submerging the pipe in water and applying a controlled <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> to the inside diameter over the area where the sensor is located, boiling is created on the outer surface while measuring the <b>heat</b> <b>flux.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> is gradually increased up to CHF and the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> response is observed to determine if the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor could sense CHF when it occurred.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. This paper deals with a study of enhanced critical heat flux (CHF) and <b>burnout</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> (BHF) in pool boiling of water with suspended silica nanoparticles using Nichrome wires and ribbons. Previously our group and other researchers have reported three-digit percentage increase in critical heat flux in silica nanofluids. This study investigates the effect of various heater surface dimensions and cross-sectional shapes on pool boiling heat transfer characteristics of water and water-based nanofluids. Our {{data suggest that the}} CHF and BHF decrease as heater surface area increases. For concentrations from 0. 1 vol% to 2 vol%, various properties such as viscosity, pH, and surface tension as well as silica deposition on surface and glowing length of ribbon are measured in order to study the possible factors in the heat transfer behavior of nanofluids. The deposition of the particles on the wire allows high heat transfer through inter-agglomerate pores, resulting in a nearly 3 -fold increase in <b>burnout</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> at very low concentrations. As the concentration is increased, the CHF and BHF each decrease prior to increasing again at higher concentrations. Results show a maximum of 270 % CHF enhancement for ribbon-type heaters.

40|$|A basic heat-transfer {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} and constructed {{for the study of}} forced-convection boiling in small channels. The various regions of forced-convection surface boiling were studied experimentally and analytically. In the region of low wall superheat, the heat flux can be predicted by available correlations for forced convection. Data indicate, however, that these correlations do not properly account for the radial variation of properties for water at high temperature difference. The conventional Dittus and Boelter-McAdams relationship is recommended for design purposes {{on the basis of its}} simplicity and conservative predictions. An analysis for the prediction of the inception of first significant boiling was developed. Experimental results are in good agreement with analytical predictions. The analysis provides information necessary for the prediction of the complete forced-convection surface-boiling curve. Data for a small-diameter tube indicate that the bubbles formed at incipient boiling can trip the laminar or transition boundary layer to a fully-developed turbulent boundary layer. The region of vigorous boiling coincides approximately with the extrapolation of the pool-boiling curve in one set of experiments. In other experiments, pool-boiling data were strongly influenced by fluid and surface conditions, as well as by bubble-induced convection in the pool. Due to the complexities in these pool-boiling data, it is impossible to make a conclusive comparison with forced-convection-boiling data. The heat flux obtained by a superposition of pool boiling and forced convection is close to the apparent asymptote for fully-developed boiling. For design purposes, it is concluded that fully-developed -forced-convection boiling can be related to pool boiling by either direct extrapolation or superposition of forced convection. (cont.) The <b>burnout</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> under conditions of forced convection and surface boiling is shown to be a complicated function of subcooling at low values of subcooling. This appears to be due to the velocity increase caused by the relatively large volume fraction of vapor. Burnout flux is shown to increase with decreasing tube diameter. This effect can be attributed to an increase in void fraction with decreasing tube diameter. Entrance effects are significant in forced-convection surface boiling as shown by the decrease of burnout flux with increasing length. Flow oscillations caused by system compressibility can greatly reduce the <b>burnout</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> in the subcooled region.

The friction factors are in satisfactory agreement with the Moody chart for the relative roughness of the test sections used, the burnout heat fluxes are well reproduced by the Soviet Zenkevich-Subbotin correlation, and the local and average heat-transfer coefficients are slightly larger than values predicted by the Hausen and Sieder-Tate equations. Miscellaneous experimental and analytical HFIR heat-transfer studies are included. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{experimental}} {{investigation was to}} obtain some information {{on the effect of}} the orientation of a heating surface on boiling heat transfer and particularly on the "burnout point". This was achieved by electrically heating a chromax strip that was cemented to some refractory backing so as to limit the heat transfer to one surface of the strip. The heating unit could be rotated about the longitudinal axis, thus allowing tests to be carried out with the surface of the strip oriented upwards, downwards, and vertically. The experiments were performed in a pool of subcooled isopropyl alcohol at three bulk temperatures. The results were presented in a graphical form with the heat transfer per unit area {{as a function of the}} difference between the strip surface and the bulk fluid temperatures. The curves obtained with the strip facing upwards or in a vertical position were qualitatively similar to the characteristic boiling curve while the curve for the downward facing strip resembled one commonly associated with free convection without boiling. With the bulk temperature at 80 [degrees]F, for example, the <b>burnout</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> for the strip facing upwards was found to be 0. 31 Btu/in[superscript 2]-sec, while that for a downward facing strip was 0. 62 Btu/in[superscript 2]-sec. These results indicate the necessity of considering the orientation of heating elements in the design of heat transfer equipment which is to operate in the nucleate boiling region...|$|E

The commercial code(Fluent Ver 6. 2. 16) was employed for the calculation of surface temperature in the case of steady and unsteady <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> condition. Based the surface temperature variation and surface material property, transient <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> method can calculate the surface <b>heat</b> <b>flux.</b> In the case of steady <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> condition, the error is about 2 %, {{and in the case of}} unsteady <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> condition, the error is about 3. 6 %.
