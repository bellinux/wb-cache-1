5|$|After the war, Wendover {{was used}} for {{training}} exercises, gunnery range and as a research facility. It was closed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force in 1969, and the base was given to Wendover City in 1977. Tooele County, Utah, assumed ownership of the airport and base buildings in 1998, and the County continues to operate the airfield as a public airport.

5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force in January 1959, seemingly {{out of fear}} of a negative public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} {{stages of the}} Second World War, the bailey was {{levelled}} and used to hold a set of temporary Nissen huts that formed a hospital for United States Army personnel. In 1945, the site was leased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry for use as offices. The Ministry of Works took over the guardianship of the castle in 1951. The ministry {{put pressure on the}} Air Ministry to leave the site, which occurred in 1956; the bailey was then grassed over again. Archaeological excavations were carried out in the bailey between 1961 and 1982, uncovering many of the medieval buildings.|$|E
5|$|Eccles {{became the}} first {{municipal}} corporation in England to operate a motorised fire engine in 1901.

5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion missile was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the role of an antenna test vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan lathes, the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.|$|E
50|$|The TU-141 {{was pressed}} back into service <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>Air</b> Force for <b>the</b> War in Donbass. Unverified {{reports from the}} separatist forces claim to have shot down one unit {{operated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>Air</b> Force.|$|R

5|$|It {{was also}} doubted that fast fighter {{aircraft}} could engage in dogfights. The g-force {{effect on the}} human body also seemed to suggest the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was impractical anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff and Air Ministry.|$|E
5|$|Military {{service is}} voluntary, though {{conscription}} may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System. American forces can be rapidly deployed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1937, Newall was {{appointed}} as Chief of the Air Staff, the military {{head of the}} RAF, in succession to Sir Edward Ellington. The promotion was unexpected; of the prospective candidates mooted for the job, Newall has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted. The most prominent candidate was Hugh Dowding, the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to Newall by three months, who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that {{he was expected to}} be appointed as the new Chief of the Air Staff. The decision was taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Minister, Viscount Swinton, without consulting Ellington for advice.|$|E

5|$|On 24 March, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak {{appeared}} before media at 22:00 local {{time to give}} a statement regarding Flight 370, during which {{he announced that he}} had been briefed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Accidents Investigation Branch that it and Inmarsat (the satellite data provider) had concluded that the airliner's last position before it disappeared was in the southern Indian Ocean. As there were no places there where it could have landed, the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1937, the 2nd Bombardment Group, now {{commanded}} by Lt. Col. Robert Olds, received {{the first of}} the newly developed B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, with 12 delivered during {{the spring and summer of}} 1937. Designated the YB-17 because of its prototype status, the Flying Fortress was the first multi-engine long-range bomber acquired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Corps, despite resistance from the Army General Staff over its necessity, and the centerpiece of the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force).|$|E
5|$|One {{experimental}} two-seat A-10 Night Adverse Weather (N/AW) {{version was}} built by converting an A-10A. The N/AW was developed by Fairchild from the first Demonstration Testing and Evaluation (DT) A-10 for consideration by the USAF. It included a second seat for a weapons system officer responsible for electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation and target acquisition. The N/AW version did not interest the USAF or export customers. The two-seat trainer version was ordered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force in 1981, but funding was canceled by U.S. Congress and the jet was not produced. The only two-seat A-10 built now resides at Edwards Air Force Base's Flight Test Center Museum.|$|E
