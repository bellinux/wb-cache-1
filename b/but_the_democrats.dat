5|$|Although Republicans {{expressed}} anger {{with his}} actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{took control of}} the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.|$|E
25|$|Atchison's Senate term expired March 4, 1855. He sought {{election}} to another term, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the Missouri legislature were split {{between him and}} Benton, while the Whig minority put forward their own man. No Senator was elected until January 1857, when James S. Green was chosen.|$|E
25|$|Carlisle {{became a}} leader of the {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and was mentioned as a presidential candidate <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> passed him over at their conventions for Winfield S. Hancock in 1880 and Grover Cleveland in 1884. Discomfort with nominating a southerner after the Civil War played a role in Carlisle's failure to win either nomination. In 1892 Carlisle was again proposed as a candidate for president at the Democratic convention, but this time Carlisle asked that he not be considered. It was reported at the time that Carlisle dropped out with the understanding that Cleveland, once nominated, would appoint him to his Cabinet.|$|E

50|$|Willmott nearly won {{outright}} the three-candidate nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007, {{to succeed}} <b>the</b> term-limited <b>Democrat,</b> Glenn Ansardi, who never again faced an opponent after the 1991 primary. Willmot led with 3,750 votes (46 percent). Fellow Republican Michael McMyne trailed with 2,593 votes (31.8 percent). Democrat Michael Austin trailed with 1,802 votes (22.1 percent). In the November 17 general election, Willmott defeated McMyne, 3,563 (65 percent) to 1,912 (34.9 percent). The New Orleans Times-Picayune endorsed McMyne before <b>the</b> primary, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Austin supported Willmott {{in the general}} election.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of September 19, 2006, the Thaksin {{government}} was overthrown by 2006 coup. Korn expressed his opinion that he was [...] "sad" [...] and {{felt that it was}} [...] "understandable for any democracy to denounce coups as a concept in general", however he felt that the coup had to be examined [...] "within the context of the Thai political situation." [...] Korn was reelected in the post-coup 2007 elections, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party remained in the Opposition after losing to the People's Power Party. During both Samak Sundaravej and Somchai Wongsawat's brief terms as Prime Minister, Korn served as Shadow Finance Minister for <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party.|$|R
25|$|They {{convinced}} Lieutenant Governor Mahlon Manson {{to resign}} from office, thereby removing anyone to easily take over the governorship should Gray have to resign. They used the issue to prevent his name from being entered as a candidate. Gray {{decided to have a}} Lieutenant Governor elected in the mid-term election to fill the seat, removing the issue, and allowing him to resign and accept the candidacy. The election was held and Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected. The Democrats in the Senate refused to accept the election, and declared it unconstitutional and elected Democrat Alonzo Green Smith to serve as Lieutenant Governor. The Senate Republicans were furious and began making a commotion in the opening prayer of the session. They went ahead and had Robertson sworn in <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> filed a court suit to prevent him from being seated.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{launched}} his campaign by declaring [...] "I believe in states' rights." [...] After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected {{one of his}} primary opponents, George H. W. Bush, to be his running mate. His appearance in an October televised debate boosted his popularity. Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Reagan received 51% {{of the popular vote}} while Carter took 41%, and Independent John B. Anderson (a liberal Republican) received 7%. Republicans captured the Senate {{for the first time since}} 1952, and gained 34 House seats, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> retained a majority.|$|E
500|$|With {{a hostile}} Whig-dominated legislature, Morton's reform agenda went nowhere. [...] Proposals such as {{reductions}} in the poll tax {{and the number of}} capital crimes were defeated, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were able to introduce some fiscal discipline and produced the first budget surplus in some years. [...] The Whigs attacked his proposals as poor economic policy, and regrouped to focus on defeating him in 1840. They convinced John Davis to return from the U.S. Senate to run against him, and Morton went down to defeat by a wide margin. [...] He made some gains in the 1841 rematch. [...] In 1842 the candidate of the upstart Liberty Party, an abolitionist party, secured enough votes to send the election to the state legislature. [...] Because of the third party there were also a large number of vacancies in the state senate which was to choose the winner. [...] The Liberty Party hoped to use its position in the balance of power to control the outcome, but a single Whig defector in the vote to fill the senate led to a Democratic majority in the chamber. [...] The senate then went on to choose Morton as governor.|$|E
50|$|Since 5 May 2005 the West Berkshire Council is Conservative-controlled {{because of}} a {{by-election}} in Thatcham North. Before that, <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> and Conservative Party had {{an equal number of}} seats <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> had control due to the casting vote of the council chairman. <b>The</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> had first taken power in 1991.|$|R
50|$|At {{the last}} {{election}} in 1999 the Conservatives won 34 seats, compared to 22 for <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> and 2 independents. In November 2003 the Conservatives gained 2 seats from <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> in a by-election in Uckfield, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> took one seat back in the same ward in a June 2002 by-election.|$|R

2500|$|When Cramer's two Republican {{legislative}} {{colleagues in}} 1951 named him minority leader, the Democrats teased them for [...] "caucusing {{in a phone}} booth." [...] Because the Florida legislature operates under {{the rules of the}} United States House of Representatives, Cramer was able to assert political [...] "minority rights;" [...] he raised his personal and the party visibility in state politics. In the state House, Cramer defended junior colleges from challenges waged by the four-year institutions. Having attended a two-year institution, Cramer considered junior colleges essential to lower-cost educational opportunities for state residents. Cramer worked to establish the state's first anti-crime commission, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> refused to name any Republicans to the panel.|$|E
2500|$|The bank lobbied to {{have its}} charter extended, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Free Bankers who {{controlled}} the General Assembly refused. The bank charter expired in January 1857, but the bank was permitted to continue operating until 1859 to help exchange the bank's currency for notes from the new national bank. Governor Joseph A. Wright was bitterly opposed {{to the bank and}} the extension of its charter. Before the bill was passed he went to the House of Representatives to personally deliver a speech indicting the bank for [...] "corruption and fraud", and alluded that the bank bribed members of the assembly {{to have its}} charter extended. Despite his speech and veto of the bill, the General Assembly passed the act with a super-majority.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{expected}} that his party would lose several {{races in the}} 1934 Congressional elections, as the president's party had done in most previous midterm elections, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> picked up seats {{in both houses of}} Congress. Empowered by the public's apparent vote of confidence in his administration, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program. The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, [...] "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program." [...] Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But {{for the first time the}} federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and the handicapped. Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act only applied to roughly sixty percent of the labor force, as farmers, domestic workers, and other groups were excluded.|$|E
25|$|During {{a censure}} debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat Suthep Thaugsuban accused Thaksin of {{profiting}} from insider {{information about the}} government's decision to float <b>the</b> baht, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> next <b>Democrat</b> party-led government did not investigate the accusations.|$|R
50|$|After the 1913 elections, {{in which}} <b>the</b> social <b>democrats</b> doubled their {{number of seats}} (from 7 to 15), the Liberal Union tried to form a {{coalition}} government with <b>the</b> social <b>democrats</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> social <b>democrats</b> refused to cooperate with what they perceived as bourgeois parties. The bourgeoise being the wealthiest of the third estate during the French Revolution, who reformed the French government.|$|R

60|$|IN the Boy's Town a {{great many}} men gave nearly their whole time to {{the affairs of the}} state, and did hardly {{anything}} but talk politics all day; they even sat up late at night to do it. Among these politicians the Whigs were sacred in my boy's eyes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> appeared like enemies of the human race; and one of the strangest things that ever happened to him was to find his father associating with men who came out of the Democratic party at the time he left the Whig party, and joining with them in a common cause against both. But when he understood what a good cause it was, and came to sing songs against slavery, he was reconciled, though he still regarded the Whig politicians as chief among the great ones, if not the good ones, of the earth. When he passed one of them on the street, he held his breath for awe till he got by, which was not always so very soon, for sometimes a Whig statesman wanted the whole sidewalk to himself, {{and it was hard to}} get by him. There were other people in that town who wanted the whole sidewalk, and these were the professional drunkards, whom the boys regarded as the keystones, if not corner-stones, of the social edifice. There were three or four of them, and the boys held them all, rich and poor alike, in a deep interest, if not respect, as persons of peculiar distinction. I do not think any boy realized the tragedy of those hopeless, wasted, slavish lives. The boys followed the wretched creatures, at a safe distance, and plagued them, and ran whenever one of them turned and threatened them. That was because the boys had not the experience to enable them to think rightly, or to think at all about such things, or to know what images of perdition they had before their eyes; and when they followed them and teased them, they did not know they were joining like fiends in the torment of lost souls. Some of the town-drunkards were the outcasts of good homes, which they had desolated, and some had merely destroyed in themselves that hope of any home which is the light of heaven in every human heart; but from time to time a good man held out a helping hand to one of them, and gave him the shelter of his roof, and tried to reclaim him. Then the boys saw him going about the streets, pale and tremulous, in a second-hand suit of his benefactor's clothes, and fighting hard against the tempter that beset him on every side in that town; and then some day they saw him dead drunk in a fence corner; and they did not understand how seven devils worse than the first had entered in the place which had been swept and garnished for them.|$|E

50|$|Car parking {{charges in}} Ripon were {{an issue in}} the run up to the election, with the Conservatives attacking them, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrat</b> council {{announced}} that they would end the charges in the market place in the month before the election.|$|R

50|$|In {{an ironic}} twist, {{the outcome of}} the litigious {{election}} was that the Republicans won the presidential race, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> carried the gubernatorial contest by 195 votes, which cost Dennis most, if not all, of his political power.|$|E
50|$|Russell was {{the lead}} {{candidate}} for the Australian Democrats in South Australia at the 2007 federal election to replace retiring senator Natasha Stott-Despoja, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> SA ticket received only 8,908 votes or 0.88 percent, suffering a 1.50 percent swing against them.|$|E
