500|$|In late August 1945 Middleton {{returned}} to LSU and reported to President Hatcher, requesting his old job as comptroller. [...] While still in Europe in May, {{he was very}} busy getting troops {{returned to}} the states. Now at LSU {{he was at the}} other end of the pipeline, getting things ready for thousands of soldiers who would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to school. Enrollments had swollen in 1945, but in 1946 the bulge in new students became an avalanche. [...] One of Middleton's priorities was to get housing for all of these new students, many of whom were married. With keen insights into military procurement, he was able to find a variety of types of excess housing units that the military no longer needed, and was able to provide both students and faculty with adequate housing at a very small cost.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Espinoza said, [...] "He's OK... Maybe it {{was just}} a little too much for him those three weeks, flying back and forth. He was running pretty {{comfortable}} there, but not like he used to." [...] Baffert was proud of the horse's fighting effort, stating [...] "It was just guts." [...] Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." [...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{knowing when}} his next billed episode would be, Nimoy {{said in an}} {{interview}} before [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] aired that he's [...] "waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for the future. I’m expecting that I probably will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to work for them before too much longer. I'm looking forward to what they send me on the page". After shooting the episode, Pinkner said [...] "We want him back as much as he wants to come back". Nimoy's next appearance occurred six episodes later, in [...] "Grey Matters". As a reference to a brief appearance by Nimoy's character William Bell, sound editor Bruce Tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in the scene when Bell encounters Olivia and gives her vital information about the parallel universe. Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he [...] "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some [...] "reversed" [...] ship's bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as [...] "a little ominous" [...] but not [...] "too cliche".|$|E

Talking to 1883 Magazine, Fletcher said: [...] "After doing two massive Arena tours with McBusted, we really wanted to do something different for this tour to herald the return of McFly. So we're playing some iconic rock venues that will allow our fans to experience the songs in a much more up close and personal environment." [...] Jones added: [...] "We're going to play every song from every album over three nights in each city, plus some surprises. So it's a mammoth set to rehearse, but really exciting!" [...] They also revealed that they'll be making new music after the tour, with Judd stating, [...] "We all agreed to go on tour first and then that will be the catalyst of what's to come." [...] On 25 May 2016, it was announced the band would have to postpone the Anthology Tour due to Judd herniating a disc in his neck. McFly eventually toured in September 2016.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook would reprise the role {{for a few}} episodes. Her return will coincide with Kemp's return as Sam's brother Grant and Windsor's final appearance as Sam's mother Peggy. Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only be back for a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to be there for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016. In March 2017, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising her role as Sam but feared the show would just use her for publicity. On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen. It's very odd that she keeps harping on about her return to the soap cause it has plainly never been discussed." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E
