25|$|Wines listed with Solera {{were made}} in a style similar to sherry, with {{fractional}} <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from different vintages in a solera system. The Solera method of blending is most widely practiced in the Sherry production of Spain. However, the rules for Madeira Soleras is different. When it comes to Sherry, as wine is used for bottling, new wine {{is added to the}} barrels of older wine and this continuous addition of young wine to old would result in very little wine being from the original vintage. With Madeira, approximately 50% of a bottle would likely be from the stated year because they are only allowed to add up to 10%, not more than 10 times. Another interesting peculiarity of old Solera Madeiras is that they were initially developed as a result of trying to extend the stocks of vintages when the vines had stopped being productive due to Phylloxera. Therefore, as there was no younger wine to add to the vintage, it was usually older wines which were added. In recent years, vintage Madeiras have been commanding higher prices than Soleras but, from 1966 , until {{about the end of the}} 20th Century, Solera Madeiras always fetched a premium at auction over the vintage ones.|$|E

50|$|A summer fruit cup made by vacuum-distilling strawberries, cucumber, {{orange and}} mint in wheat spirit. To this a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines,</b> fruits, {{herbs and spices}} are added.|$|R
50|$|Austin's Fruit Cup is a fruit flavour aromatised wine, {{available}} in 70cL bottles at 17.5% (originally 21.9%) ABV, it is a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> grain spirit, and fruit flavour and is packed and distributed by Aldi. Austin's logo features a chap in a bow tie, top hat, and monocle.|$|R
5000|$|Like Sherry, Vernaccia di Oristano {{wines are}} often made {{utilizing}} a solera system of [...] "fractional blending" [...] where new wine {{is added to}} barrels at the [...] "top" [...] of the solera and then gradually <b>blended</b> into barrels <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> from other vintages as it works it way down through the solera and eventually being bottled. This means that within a single bottle of Vernaccia di Oristano could be <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from several decades of vintages with one Sardinian producer having a solera that contains wine from over a 100 different vintages.|$|R
25|$|Various wines {{containing}} wolfberries (called gǒuqí jiǔ from 枸杞酒) {{are also}} produced, including {{some that are}} a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> grape <b>wine</b> and wolfberries.|$|R
25|$|Melissa DOC - For the red <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> this <b>wine,</b> Greco is {{permitted}} to make up to 5-25% <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> along with Gaglioppo and white grape varieties of Greco bianco, Trebbiano and Malvasia bianca.|$|R
50|$|Medio y medio is {{a special}} <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>wine</b> and {{sparkling}} wine, or sparkling wine and caña (rum). Uvita is a fortified wine with caña that resembles marsala wine.|$|R
50|$|Red Windsor is a pale cream, English cheddar cheese, {{made using}} {{pasteurised}} cow's milk marbled with a wine, often a Bordeaux <b>wine</b> or a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> port <b>wine</b> and brandy.|$|R
5000|$|Scotsmac is an {{alcoholic}} drink consisting <b>of</b> a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> and whisky flavouring. It {{is sold in}} 700ml bottles from discount supermarket stores such as Netto and Lidl across the United Kingdom. Scotsmac has a strength of 15%. [...] Also known as the [...] "Bam's Dram" [...] or [...] "Wham's Dram", it was once blended by D & L Ariano, imported and bottled by J.H. Wham & Son (Largs) Ltd. It is now bottled for Accolade Wines in Guildford, Surrey.|$|R
50|$|Entice is a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Chantal's ice <b>wine</b> {{and barrel}} aged grape brandy, {{making this a}} white port.|$|R
5000|$|Champagne is a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from {{different}} locations. Thanks to its vineyards, Louis Roederer has a vast palette <b>of</b> the finest <b>wines</b> {{from which to}} create its [...] "cuvées". Not all <b>of</b> these <b>wines</b> are used immediately. Some are set aside to age in large oak casks in the reserve wine cellar; {{at a later date}} they will either be included in the <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> Louis Roederer's Brut Premier champagne to ensure quality, or be used for the dosage in the [...] "liqueur d'expédition". The reserve wines destined for the [...] "liqueur d'expédition" [...] are selected from the best wines from each vintage. Pinot noir and Chardonnay wines from eight to ten different crus are blended together and matured in oak vats for up to ten years. The reserve wine cellar contains several thousand litres <b>of</b> reserve <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 12 March 2009, Philippe de Villiers and Frédéric Nihous gave a joint statement. They {{objected to}} a France-supported draft January 27 European Union {{regulation}} on oenological practices {{that allowed the}} <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> white <b>wine</b> and red wine to produce rosé wine.|$|R
50|$|Another {{growing trend}} {{has been the}} {{practice}} <b>of</b> the <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> bulk <b>wine</b> from other countries with local wine. In some cases, a wine marketed as a local product may be sourced entirely from elsewhere. Regulations on this practice vary widely, depending on the jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the Champagne produced is non-vintage (also known as mixed vintage or multivintage), a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from several years. This means that no declared year will be displayed on the bottle label. Typically, however, the majority <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> is from the current year but a percentage is made <b>of</b> reserve <b>wine</b> from previous years. This serves to smooth {{out some of the}} vintage variations caused by the marginal growing climate of Champagne, which is the most northerly winegrowing region in France. Most Champagne houses strive for a consistent house style from year to year (largely for reasons related to price-setting and successful marketing), and this is arguably one of the hardest tasks of the house winemaker.|$|R
50|$|White {{wines from}} the {{southern}} Rhône sub-region, such as in Châteauneuf-du-Pape whites, are also typically <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> several <b>wine</b> grapes. These may include Ugni blanc, Roussanne, Bourboulenc, Picpoul, and Clairette. Since about 1998 Viognier is increasingly being used and is also appearing as a single varietal.|$|R
50|$|Crusted port {{is usually}} a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> port <b>wine</b> from several vintages, {{although}} single vintage crusted ports have sometimes {{been made in the}} past. Unlike vintage port, which has to be sourced from grapes from a single vintage, crusted port affords the port blender the opportunity to make best use of the varying characteristics of different vintages.|$|R
25|$|It is a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> {{brandy and}} <b>wine</b> made from sun-dried Savatiano, Sultana and Black Corinth grape varieties. It is then blended with an aged Muscat wine from the Aegean islands of Samos and Lemnos.|$|R
50|$|Counoise {{is one of}} {{the grapes}} allowed into the <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Châteauneuf-du-Pape <b>wine.</b> In 2004 only 0.5% of the appellation's area was planted with Counoise. Some {{producers}} who favour the variety use about 5% of it in their blends, and those account for most of the plantings. One such producer is Château de Beaucastel, which is noted for using all the 13 allowed varieties.|$|R
5000|$|Aubun {{is easily}} {{confused}} with Counoise, {{because of a}} large similarity in the vineyard. Aubun and Counoise were also grown mixed in a field blend in some older vineyards. Therefore, Counoise is found as a synonym for Aubun, but the [...] "real" [...] Counoise {{is considered to be}} a grape of higher quality, which is one of the grape varieties allowed in the <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Châteauneuf-du-Pape <b>wines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> the red <b>wine</b> has {{previously}} included traditional grown varieties of North Africa (which {{it used to}} share with Languedoc-Roussillon), such as Alicante, Aramon, Carignan, Cinsault, and Grenache. The current composition is more [...] "New World-like".|$|R
2500|$|Village {{appellation}} {{wines are}} produced from a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from supposedly lesser vineyard sites {{within the boundaries}} of one of 42 villages, or from one individual but unclassified vineyard. Wines from each different village are considered to have their own specific qualities and characteristics, and not all Burgundy communes have a village appellation. Village wines make up 36% of production at 50 hl/ha. These wines can be consumed two to four years after the release date, although again some examples will keep for longer. Village wines will show the village name on the wine label, such as [...] "Pommard", and sometimes - if applicable - the name of the single vineyard or climat where it was sourced. Several villages in Burgundy have appended the names of their Grand Cru vineyards to the original village name - hence village names such as [...] "Puligny-Montrachet" [...] and [...] "Aloxe-Corton".|$|R
50|$|French Wine Coca was {{essentially}} an imitation <b>of</b> Angelo Mariani's <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Bordeaux <b>wine</b> and coca, called Vin Mariani. Mariani's beverage achieved extraordinary {{success in the}} 1880s, inspiring a host of knock-offs, of which Pemberton's was merely {{one of the more}} successful. However, Vin Mariani lacked both damiana, a reputed cure for impotence, as well as kola nut, a source of caffeine - both of which were later included in Coca-Cola.|$|R
25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the main constituent <b>of</b> <b>wine),</b> a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|R
50|$|Melissa-The Melissa DOC {{is located}} south of Cirò and {{produces}} <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> similar style, though {{not with the}} same international reputation of quality. The red <b>wine</b> grapes <b>of</b> the region are the Gaglioppo and Greco nera with some <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> the white <b>wine</b> grapes Greco bianco, Malvasia bianca and Trebbiano.|$|R
50|$|The Côte-Rôtie is one <b>of</b> the few <b>wine</b> appellations {{that allow}} white wine grapes {{to be used}} in a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> red <b>wine.</b> (The {{southern}} Rhône region Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC is another.) The region {{was also one of the}} first Rhône regions to make use of new oak barrels for aging, though the practice did fall out of favor in the late 19th century following the phylloxera epidemic. Négociants revived the practice in the 1980s and today its use varies according to the producer.|$|R
50|$|Cheese fondue {{consists}} <b>of</b> a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> cheeses, <b>wine</b> and seasoning. To {{prepare the}} caquelon it is first rubbed with a cut garlic clove. White wine is slightly heated with cornstarch, and then grated cheese is added and stirred until melted. It is often topped {{off with a}} bit of kirsch. The cornstarch or other starch is added to prevent separation. The mixture is stirred continuously as it heats in the caquelon.|$|R

The design incorporates a thistle motif and {{an image of a}} Scottish castle and loch but the rear label says: bottled for Constellation Europe Ltd., Guildford (southeast England).|$|R
50|$|Lillet is an {{aperitif}} <b>wine</b> (a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Bordeaux <b>wines</b> {{and citrus}} liqueur). It should be served well chilled at 6-8 °C (43-46 °F). In France, Lillet is generally served on ice with {{a slice of}} orange, or a lemon or lime peel. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland Lillet blanc is more often served as a Lillet Vive, a Lillet blanc long drink. A Lillet Vive is 5cl Lillet blanc, 10cl tonic water, a slice of cucumber, a strawberry and mint leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Dubonnet is a sweet, aromatised wine-based {{aperitif}} with 15% alcohol by volume. It is a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> fortified <b>wine,</b> herbs, and spices (including {{a small amount}} of quinine), with fermentation being stopped by the addition of alcohol. The brand is currently produced in France by Pernod Ricard, and in the USA by Heaven Hill Distilleries of Bardstown, Kentucky. The company says it is the [...] "number-one selling aperitif brand in the United States". The beverage is famous in the UK for having been the favourite drink of the Queen Mother.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Lasseters brought aboard {{winemaker}} Julia Iantosca. Iantosca {{had spent}} {{time as the}} winemaker at Stevenot Vineyards in Murphys, William Wheeler Winery and Lambert Bridge Winery, both in Healdsburg, and worked closely with consulting winemaker Merry Edwards, who helped inspire Iantosca's love <b>of</b> <b>blended</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the rice wine, various fruit wines and herbal wines exist in Korean cuisine. Acacia, maesil plum, Chinese quince, cherry, pine fruits, and pomegranate are most popular. Majuang <b>wine</b> (a <b>blended</b> <b>wine</b> <b>of</b> Korean grapes with French or American wines) and ginseng-based wines are also available.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Kendall-Jackson {{rejected}} the California wine industry's trend toward vineyard-specific wine labeling. It ignored {{the concept of}} terroir in favor <b>of</b> <b>blending</b> <b>wines</b> from different regions to achieve desired wine characteristics. They reversed that direction in the mid-2000s, along with a push to upgrade their quality.|$|R
50|$|Since high-yielding Aramon {{gives one}} of the least {{coloured}} wines that still pass as red, the practice <b>of</b> <b>blending</b> such <b>wines</b> with wines from teinturier grapes such as Alicante Bouschet was a measure used to give them a measure of increased credibility as reds.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{wine in the}} Americas {{is often}} {{associated}} with Argentina, California and Chile, all of which produce a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>wines,</b> from inexpensive jug wines to high-quality varietals and proprietary <b>blends.</b> Most <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> production in the Americas is based on Old World grape varieties, and wine-growing regions there have often [...] "adopted" [...] grapes that have become particularly closely identified with them. California's Zinfandel (from Croatia and Southern Italy), Argentina's Malbec, and Chile's Carmenère (both from France) are well-known examples.|$|R
5000|$|Like other wineries at Vino Piazza, Olde Lockeford Winery {{produces}} {{less than}} 2500 cases <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> per year. Most of the grapes used by Olde Lockeford Winery comes from vineyards {{in the nearby}} regions in the Lodi AVA. [...] Olde Lockeford Winery produces a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>wines,</b> including varietal Mourvedre, Sangiovese, Petit Verdot, Merlot, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Barbera, Riesling, Viognier, Chardonnay, Muscat Canelli, and Black Muscat.
