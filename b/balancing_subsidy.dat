However, its effect on uptake rate, i. e., price elasticity of demand, has not been well studied. Methods Japan's decentralised vaccination programme allows observation of various pairs in price and uptake rate of flu shots among the elderly by the municipality from 2001 / 2002 to 2004 / 2005 season. We combine our sample survey data (nÂ =Â  281), which monitor price, subsidy and uptake rate, with published data on local characteristics in order to estimate price elasticity of demand with panel model. Results We find price elasticity of demand for influenza vaccine: nearly zero in nationwide, nearly zero in urban area, and - 1. 07 in rural area. Conclusions The results question the rationale for subsidy, especially in urban area. There are cases where maintaining or increasing the level of subsidy is not an efficient allocation of finite health care resources. When organising a vaccination programme, health manager should be careful about the <b>balance</b> between <b>subsidy</b> and other efforts in order to encourage the elderly to receive shots with price elasticity in mind.

40|$|An {{important}} part of evaluating common economic politics of countries in the European Union (EU) is the observation of microeconomic consequences of governmental subsidies in agriculture. This article mentions some basic theoretical and practical connections regarding subsidies in agriculture and of agricultural products on the Czech market, and regarding consequences of implemented price intervention programs. If a subsidy is directed to large-scale producers {{as well as to}} geographically unfavourably situated small-scale producers, it can not only miss its own target, but even deepen the existing problem. It is now becoming apparent that prospering large companies have an overall bigger profit from each crown of the subsidized price than small farms, which were originally the reason to implement the subsidies. The size structure of agricultural companies in the Czech Republic has so far been relatively favourable with respect to subsidies. After 2013, a reform of the Common agricultural politics of EU is planned and the amounts of direct payments for agriculture from the EU budget will be newly set. However, the European Parliament supports a proposal of limiting subsidies according to size of farms. Along with that, there is a real threat of growing prices of agricultural products on the market. Results of statistical analyses of source materials have revealed the largest proportion of subsidies in the outputs of Czech agricultural companies in the last years as compared to our neighbours, and also in up to now <b>balance</b> of <b>subsidy</b> level and aid in terms of economic size of the companies.

40|$|The supply {{chains of}} the mobile phone {{industry}} span national and firm boundaries. To analyze how value is distributed among the participants, a framework based on theories of firm strategy is applied, and a novel methodology {{is used to}} measure value capture in three phone models introduced from 2004 to 2008. The research shows that carriers capture the greatest value (in terms of gross profit) from each handset, followed closely by handset makers, with suppliers a distant third. However, the situation is reversed in terms of operating profit. Carriers shoulder the burden of network installation, maintenance, and upgrading, which absorbs much of the value from their subscription fees. Handset maker nationality, which may also influence supplier choice, is a key determinant of the geographic distribution of value capture. The results are also used to estimate the relationship of handset subsidies to carrier profits, which has been an issue of concern for antitrust authorities in several countries. The analysis shows how the framework {{can be used to}} calculate how much service charges might be inflated to cover the subsidies.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{scope of}} municipal economy in Poland is somewhat too large. The hotels, zoological gardens, botanical gardens etc., {{which do not}} render services of a strictly municipal character (the essence of said services consists of meeting the everyday requirements of the local population), should not be included in this field of economy. The activity {{of some of the}} municipal establishments, especially of those which render services free of charge (e. g. the town sanitary services) can not be based on the principle of economic calculation. The best organisational form would be in that case the form of budgetary establishments. Enterprises and municipal establishments ought to be subordinated to the competent regional national councils (for boroughs or towns). It does not seem advisable to set up on a voivodship level a special corporation of enterprises and municipal establishments — parallel to the already existing departments of municipal economy at the voivodship national councils. The municipal enterprises and establishments are, as a rule, of a deficit character; the levied municipal fees and tariffs do not fully cover the operation costs and the deficit is being <b>balanced</b> by <b>subsidies</b> coming from the budgets of the regional national councils. That is — in fact — a characteristic feature of the municipal enterprises, which distinguishes them from any other regional enterprises. The municipal fees and tariffs which do not fully cover the costs of services rendered are causing many negative economic and social results. The raising of municipal fees and tariffs ought to be accompanied by simultaneous recompensation provided for the family budgets. A specific institution of the municipal financing system is the institution of shares of some business enterprises in the municipal investments costs. In practice, however, there are great difficulties first of all in fixing the portions of the shares and secondly in collecting them.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} general guidelines {{to design and}} implement (or reform) unemployment benefit programs in developing countries. Our main proposition is that the debate between risk-pooling (traditional insurance) vs. savings is misplaced. We have shown that UI and UISAs are {{two sides of the}} same coin. In both cases, administrators need to keep track of contributions and benefits. The main difference is that the savings that accumulate in some of the accounts in a UI program are used to cover the accounts that have a negative balance (savings are taxed at a 100 percent rate). Clearly, under an ’actuarially fair’ risk pooling arrangement, none of the accounts would systematically accumulate savings or be in deficit. But this is not the case with traditional UI programs because plan members have different risk profiles. Given a level and duration of benefits and the contributions rate, some accounts can systematically accumulate savings (which are taxed) whereas others systematically run negative <b>balances</b> (which receive <b>subsidies).</b> These taxes and subsidies can reduce incentives to search, take, and keep jobs. At the other extreme, in the case of pure UISAs, savings are not taxed and individual accounts cannot become negative which improves incentives for job search. However, this also implies that workers are less protected against the risk of unemployment.|$|R

In bad economic times, public universities are increasingly hard hit as education is one of the few discretionary items in state budgets (Kane and Orszag, 2003).

40|$|My thesis investigates {{issues of}} {{sustainability}} and belonging surrounding the Bulgarian feature film industry. There {{is a limited}} body of scholarship on Bulgarian cinema, most of which focuses on film aesthetics and fails {{to account for the}} socio-historical and industrial context of local film creation, dissemination and consumption. My work is a continuation of Dina Iordanova’s New Bulgarian Cinema (2008) which promoted the idea of cross-Balkan creative collaborations. In contrast, I see pan-Balkan alliances as simply one part of the transnational co-operation and appropriation practices that have shaped Bulgarian film culture. I reveal that early productions like The Bulgarian Is Gallant (Vassil Gendov, 1915) and Cairn (Alexander Vazov, 1936) sought to reaffirm Bulgaria’s place in European culture and act as a business bridge between the East and the West. During Communism (1944 - 1989) the Bulgarian Poetic Realist movement and the detective cycle appropriated narrative and aesthetic ideas from, respectively, the Italian Neorealism and British/American spy movies, achieving sustainability not necessarily reliant on state funding. With the shift to an open market economy, I show how the notion of national cinema changed under different legislation as did the <b>balance</b> between state <b>subsidy</b> and private funding. The tension between the art-house canon and contemporary domestic audiences’ idea of Bulgarian cinema is evident in my case-studies of The World Is Big and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner (Stephan Komandarev, 2008), Mission London (Dimitar Mitovski, 2010) and Love. net (Ilian Djevelekov, 2011). The emergence of the Sofia International Film Festival, digital distribution and piracy further redefined the cinema experience in Bulgaria. The case of Bulgaria illustrates the complexities of describing a small national cinema in an environment of legislative and economic inconsistency. It exposes the need for overcoming stereotypes when examining Eastern Europe and questions the existence of singular definitions when it comes to European film culture...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation focuses on measuring financial constraints for industrial R&D and {{the identification of}} firms that face such constraints and hence are potentially not able to pursue their R&D at the desired level. The identification of potentially constrained firms is crucialfor the design of efficient innovation policy schemes. The thesis contributed to previous empirical studies on incentive and financing problemsfor private sector investment in innovation projects. Themain contribution is basically twofold. First, the thesis adds to previous research on that topic by {{taking into account the}} heterogeneity of R&D investments. Second, it contributes to earlier research in terms of methodology. In particular, it is attempted to overcome limitations of previous measuring approaches by introducing direct measures of credit market access andeven a direct measures for the financial constraint itself. The first part presents a test for financial constraints on R&D investment and how they differ from capital investment. To identify constraintsin the access to external capital, a credit rating index is employed. The models show that internal constraints, measured by mark-ups, are moredecisive for R&D than for capital investment. For external constraints,a monotonic relationshipbetween the level of constriction and firm size for both types of investment is found. Thus, external constraints turn out to be more binding with decreasing firm size. The second part analyzes financial constraintson R&D, where it is accounted for heterogeneity among investments whichhas been neglected in previous literature. According to economic theory, investments should be distinguished by their degree of uncertainty, e. g. routine R&D versuscutting-edge R&D. Financial constraints should be more binding for cutting-edge R&D than for routine R&D. Using panel data it can be shown thatR&D spending of firms devoting a significant fraction of R&D to cutting-edge projects is curtailed by credit constraints while routine R&Dinvestments are not. This has important policy implications with respect to the distribution of R&D subsidies in the economy. The third part compartmentalizes R&D activities in its components, R and D as these activities do not only differ in their nature, but also to a large extenttake place sequentially. The results show that R investment is more sensitive to the firms operating liquidity than D indicating that firms have to rely even more on internal funds for financing their research compared to development activities. Moreover, it is found that (basic) research subsidy recipients investment is less sensitive to internal liquidity. The fourth part presents an entirely different approach to the identification of financing constraints. In particular, a survey-based measure of financing constraints is derived from a test that comes closer to the 'ideal experiment' for identifying financing constraints as suggested by Hall (2008). This article furthermore introduces the concept of innovation capability into the context of financing constraints. There are two possible theories on how innovative capabilities affect financingconstraints. First, as innovation capabilities are necessary to do innovation, firms with high capabilities should be able to attract funds easier because of the higher expected success of their projects. On the other hand, {{it can be argued that}} investors - although they might be aware of the fact that skill is an important success factor of R&D - do not value such skills. In terms of economic theory this means that uncertaintyabout the outcome of innovation projects outweighs the information on skills. The results from this paper suggest the second alternative. Although one could expect firms with high innovative capacity to be less constrained as they should be able to better convince banks and investors because of all the evidence that skill increase success of innovation projects, they are actually more likely to be constrained. This may be due to the increased demand for financing one the one hand, but also due to the fact that banks and investors may still value 'tangible collateral capital' more than something intangible as innovationcapabilities. The conclusions that can be drawn from this dissertation have important implications for innovation policy particularly for economies in which bank financing plays such a crucial role as it does for example in Germany. Firms in Anglo-Saxon 'market-based' economies with developed and liquid stock markets generally rely to a lower extend on bankfinancing compared to firms in 'banking-dominated' financial systems that can be found in continental Europe. Given that even independently of any financial crisis, economic theory and empirical evidence stress the relevance of financing constraints, the problem presumably deteriorates as the current financial crisis will require banks to conduct an even more detailed risk assessment in the future. Systematic risk assessment techniques as within the implementation of the New Basel Capital Accord affect financing of innovation, in particular the screening of innovative firms. As intangible investments like R&D are not reflected in the firms' balance sheets, financial statement-based estimations of firm value and creditworthiness (internal, but alsoexternal ratings) penalize firms that invest in R&D at least in the short-run. A starting point for future research is thus for example how investments in intangible assets such as the outcome from R&D projects, affect banks' risk evaluation and the decision to provide credit. In addition, the rigorous evaluation of existing policy schemes addressing financial constraints appears to be a desirable task for (European) innovationpolicy. Despite the suggested need for government intervention to support financially constrained firms, it should be noted that also governments are not immune against information asymmetry problems either. With respect to project selection within support programmes, it may be that selection committees do not pick those proposals that promise highest social returns or those that are least likely to attract financing at privatesector sources, but those that seem the most feasible or most likely toyield successful outcomes in the not too distant future. As highly basic research projects may score low on selection criteria like 'feasibility' or 'expected economic value', government agents may behave similar as private lenders when it comes to project selection. Hence, itmay happen that very challenging research projects are not awarded a subsidy. For the pattern of innovation project grants by the Flemishgovernment, there is slight evidence that basic research projects are indeed rejected more frequently. For future European innovation policy, it will therefore remain a challenge to find an optimal policy path that <b>balances</b> targeted <b>subsidy</b> and incentive programmes as well as initiatives that pave the way for market based solutions. The latter may even involve the implementation of fundamental ideas such as legal reforms with respect to accounting policies to better position R&D investments vis-à-vis traditional capital investments. nrpages: 195 status: publishe...|$|R
