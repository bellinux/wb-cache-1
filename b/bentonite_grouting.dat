40|$|A <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouting</b> {{technology}} has been developed {{to meet the requirements}} of fracture sealing for nuclear waste isolation and environmental engineering. The work reported presents an experimental evaluation of the performance of the bentonite fracture sealing in densely welded tuff. Included are the study of grout stability and resistance to erosion, theoretical and numerical analyses of the grout penetration process, pressure distribution in the fracture during grouting, grout delivery distance, breakthrough pressure and rheological characterization. Bentonite suspensions with solids content of 18, 20 and 22 % by weight have been injected into single fractures in rock samples at 0. 07 to 3. 45 MPa pressure. <b>Bentonite</b> <b>grouting</b> reduces the fracture hydraulic conductivity by 7 to 9 orders in magnitude, to the level of 10 ⁻⁷ to 10 ⁻⁹ cm/s. Grout stability and erosion have been studied with long-term flow testing at up to 121 kPa hydraulic pressure. After 1, 000 to 5, 000 hours of flow testing, at pressure gradients of up to 91 cm/cm, the hydraulic conductivity of the grouted fracture does not increase with test time. The hydraulic conductivity of the grouted fracture decreases with increasing pressure gradient up to the wash-out pressure. Analytical solutions have been derived for pressure distribution during grouting in wedge shaped fractures and in fractures with constant aperture. Influence factors on pressure distribution in a fracture have been identified. They are yield stress, fracture shape, original aperture, deformation properties of the rock mass and the fracture, mixing of air in a grout and sample size. A mathematical solution of grout delivery distance under a given injection pressure has been developed. The breakthrough pressure has been studied, based on the mechanical deformation of the fracture applied by a normal stress across the fracture and by the grout pressure within the fracture during grouting. Results indicate that <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouting</b> is a promising fracture sealing technology. Bentonite grout has great hydraulic conductivity reduction and chemical physical stability. Some disadvantages of bentonite grout have been identified, such as the formation of hydraulic fractures in the grout and the washing away of grout particles when the applied pressure gradient is high enough...|$|E
30|$|Below, in Figure  9, ERT profile II_II is {{overlaid}} {{with the}} dam structure. The data used for establishing this cross-section had been compiled from several sources (mainly provided by Design and Research Institute HYDROPROJECT, Kara-Kul). The core part represents the blast material (1) {{covered by the}} material filled immediately after the blast event (2, mainly moved from the blast site). On top, the dam crest is composed of gravel-sand material (3, 4) with uncertain composition and structure. One loam-tarmac (5) and one clay layer (6) cover the lower upstream face of the dam. In this part, <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouting</b> had been completed (7). Additional bentonite grouts were injected along the dam crest (8). Concrete screens were installed both on the up- and downstream faces (9).

30|$|On the ERT profile II_II of July 2012 {{along the}} section shown in Figure  9 a, {{it can be}} seen that the lowest resistivities of less than 100 [*]Ω.m appear within the fill {{material}} while the underlying blasted material has clearly higher resistivities of more than 200 [*]Ω.m, and in many places even above 1000 [*]Ω.m. The highest resistivities were measured within the gravel-sand material composing the dam crest indicating that no water infiltration occurred in the upper part, even when the reservoir level was near its maximum, probably due to the strong screening by the concrete plates (material 9 on the upstream face). Low resistivities within the fill material can be associated with water inflow below these plates due to insufficient compaction of the post-blast filling. On the basis of the combined observation of piping below the crest and water inflow in the fill material, we recommended an enhancement of the <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouting</b> below the dam crest. This was completed in summer 2013. The test ERT survey in September 2013 showed that this additional measure apparently had reduced the water inflow as clearly higher resistivities were observed within the former piping zones below the crest (Figure  10 d) marked now by medium resistivity of more than 500 [*]Ω.m and within the fill material along the main section (Figure  9 b). However, it can be noted that those additional measures do not seem to have had any influence on the piezometer levels (see Figure  9).|$|E

40|$|Grouting is {{the process}} of ground {{improvement}} techniques which is used to improvise the foundation where there is loose state of the soil. Grouting can be classified as permeation grouting, compaction grouting or hydraulic fracturing. Permeation grouting is an effective way to send the grout into the ground without disturbing the soil structure. In this investigation, an attempt is made to study the effect of cement with <b>bentonite</b> <b>grout</b> in improving the bearing capacity of the sandy soil.

Grouting experiment is performed with perforated PVC pipe in a tank of 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm sandy soil. To study the improvement in the strength property of the grouted soil the plate load test is performed with 5 cm x 5 cm plate on the grouted sand after 3 days curing and 7 days curing.

30|$|In this paper, a {{case study}} is {{presented}} that combined investigation and modelling of the blast- and earth-fill dam of Kambarata 2 HPP in the Central Tien Shan, Kyrgyz Republic. The blast event of December 22, 2009 had been recorded both by accelerometric and by seismometric instruments. Related measurements showed that accelerations of about 1  g affected the slope opposite to the explosion site and that the vertical acceleration in the powerhouse was close to 2  g (but without causing significant damage). However, the blast cannot be considered as totally successful as the design height of the blast-fill of about 50  m above river level had not been reached. Consequently, immediately after the blast, earth material had to be transported from the explosion site to the opposite flank to rapidly increase the dam crest height {{in order to avoid}} overtopping. In 2010, additional works were carried out to complete the dam construction. Bentonite grouts were installed in parts of the upstream face and along the dam crest, over the entire dam height. These were added following recommendation by some of the authors because our geophysical monitoring had provided evidence of piping across the dam. During the geophysical survey completed in September 2013, after the additional <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouting</b> near the dam crest, clearly higher resistivities had been measured in the same places, which was likely {{to be related to the}} reduced groundwater flow across the dam. The geophysical surveys further showed that the blast-fill material, representing about 75 % of the total dam volume, is characterized by relatively high resistivities (> 500 [*]Ω.m) and medium seismic velocities (S-wave velocity of about 500  m/s). These properties indicate a good compaction of the blast-fill material that contrasts with the lower quality of the earth fill that had been added on top of the rocks produced by blasting.|$|E

40|$|A new {{fracture}} grouting {{technology has}} been developed {{to meet the requirements}} of high-level nuclear waste isolation. <b>Bentonite</b> fracture <b>grouting</b> tests are performed on a fracture model, made of circular acrylic plates with outer diameter of 30 cm and a central injection hole of 2. 5 cm diameter. Suspensions with bentonite concentration of 9 % to 31 % have been injected into fractures with apertures of 9 to 39 microns under injection pressures less than 0. 5 MPa. After grouting, the hydraulic conductivities of the fractures are reduced from the 10 - 1 to the 10 - 5 cm/s level. When the suspension is thin enough and the fracture is very small, channeling develops in the grouted fractures. Preliminary results indicate that the permeability of a grouted fracture does not increase with time in 125 days. The flow properties of bentonite suspensions, viscosity, shear stress, yield stress and gelation, are investigated. Water flow through ungrouted fractures and movement of water in <b>bentonite</b> <b>grout</b> are studied...|$|R

30|$|The {{benefit and}} {{practicality}} of implementing multiple loop borehole designs {{to improve performance}} and/or reduce installation cost is arguable. The use of a thermally enhanced grout with a single loop appears to lower borehole resistance by 30  % over neat <b>bentonite</b> <b>grout</b> at standard U-bend separations, despite higher thermal shunting between {{the legs of the}} loops. But, unless the pipe legs can be guaranteed to be separated and not twisted and contacting over a substantial length of the bore, this 30  % benefit may never be realized in practice. Physical separation, {{such as the use of}} Geo-Clips, is at least as beneficial as thermally enhanced grout. With this in mind, the obvious benefit of multiple loops in reducing borehole resistance is increased surface area for heat transfer and thinner HDPE walls that result from employing smaller diameter pipe loops. Another advantage to multiple loops is in lowering the pressure drop of the ground heat exchanger, which can be as much as 35  %. This benefit develops from dividing the flow into multiple pipe loops of a given cross section as well as shortening the length. In operation, this can save considerable pump energy over the year.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{challenges}} to the {{ground source heat pump}} market is the cost burden of implementing the ground heat exchange. For the case of closed-loop vertical borehole designs, the thermal barrier presented by a loop can be significant. The high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe loop contacts the bore wall via a thermal grout. For example, a 7 – 8  °C temperature difference between the water circulating in the loop and the bore wall reduces the heat pump operating performance. In general, the loop legs are not constrained within the bore cross section, and during installation, the legs can twist and contact one another over {{a substantial portion of the}} bore length, thereby degrading performance. Typically, the loop is sealed to the bore wall with a <b>bentonite</b> <b>grout</b> mixture, of which the hydraulic and thermal properties are very important to insure optimal performance of the installation. The use of a thermally enhanced grout, while advantageous to heat transfer between the loop and the bore wall, presents its own challenges. For example, the addition of sand to enhance conduction also increases thermal shunting between the legs of the loop and presents challenges in uniform mixing and deployment through a tremie pipe.|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} {{closed loop}} field {{is composed of}} pipes that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically 50 to- 400 ft deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped cross connector {{at the bottom of}} the hole. The borehole is commonly filled with a <b>bentonite</b> <b>grout</b> surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the heat transfer. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents artesian wells from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5-6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10 kW (3 ton) of heating capacity might need three boreholes 80 to 110 m deep. (A ton of heat is 12,000 British thermal units per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 kilowatts.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the thermal {{conductivity}} of proprietary grout mixes versus local ones in Malta. Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems consume 75 % less electricity than conventional environmental control systems and have lower maintenance costs. On the other hand the installation costs of GSHPs are comparatively higher. Attention has therefore been focused to try to lower the costs of installing the borehole heat exchange system. The grout {{is one of the key}} factors that influence the efficiency of ground source heat pumps, being the principal conductive medium to the natural terrain. This paper explores the variations in the thermal conductivity of different sand-cement grouts. It compares and evaluates options for the suitability of these materials for backfilling vertical boreholes of ground heat exchangers. In this study sixteen different sand-cement grouts have been designed, evaluated and compared with materials, which have been conventionally used to fulfil this purpose. Imported silica sand and local sand mixes were formulated, tested and compared so that the potential use of local sands could be closely examined. Output results prove that local sand-cement grouts improve thermal conductivity values by 27 % and are also 17 % less expensive when compared to silica sand-cement and <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouts.</b> This win-win scenario points towards improvements in both in thermal conductivity and cost effectiveness when using local resources. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Proper completion of a well is essential to the protection of ground-water resources. Selecting a proper material for the annular seal should be based on the geologic conditions at the well site. Previous studies have not adequately linked annular seal material selection with geologic variability. This study created unique geological-based criteria for the selection of annular seal materials. The shear strength with which the annular seal materials held the PVC well pipe was tested, as were the expansive properties of annular seal materials. Both bentonite and cement seals were tested. Unidirectional swell and reserve expansion of bentonite was also examined. Bentonite pellets were found to have a greater reserve (potential) expansion than bentonite chips. However, when emplaced dry and subsequently hydrated, bentonite chips showed greater unidirectional expansion than pellets, because the slaking of pellets caused them to quickly fall apart and seal the remaining bentonite from the water supply. When emplaced through a standing column of water, pellets showed greater unidirectional expansion, because they adhered to the sides of the container, ensuring a larger volume of water to a greater surface area of <b>bentonite.</b> Pumpable <b>bentonite</b> <b>grouts</b> were found to have shear strengths of 0. I psi or lower. Chips were found to have strengths of approximately 0. 7 psi and pellets around 2 psi. However, when pellets were emplaced through water, they achieved shear strengths of only 0. 8 psi. All bentonite samples had good recoverability. Cement-based samples had initial shear strengths of 4. 7 psi or greater. After failure these values dropped significantly, they are therefore considered to have poor recoverability. 'Me performance of various annular seal materials was related to rock strength, hole condition, and hydrologic condition to devise a material selection technique. Pumpable grouts are best suited for pressurized (artesian) well conditions because their weight counters the upward pressure of water; semi-rigid bentonite seals (chips and pellets) are best suited for wet hole conditions because when hydrated these materials form a low permeability seal with moderately high shear strength; and cement base seals are best suited for dry strong rock environments...|$|R

The yield stress and viscosity were significantly reduced {{with the addition of}} Sodium Pyrophosphate (SPP). The main advantage of using SPP is the temporary nature of the reduction in yield stress and viscosity; both parameters increase with time and exceed the values of the original suspension without the SPP. Permeability tests were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the bentonite suspensions in decreasing the hydraulic conductivity of the sand. Permeated samples were prepared with clean sand and bentonite using 7. 5, 10, and 12 % bentonite suspensions.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Shallow anchor {{systems have}} been widely used for decades due to their time and cost efficiency. Yet when it comes to cold regions like Alaska, new {{challenges}} caused by the harsh environment need to be resolved before they are used extensively in cold regions. One challenge associated with anchor installation could be the potential thawing of warm permafrost due to the grout mortar hydration, which might undermine the capacity of the anchor. Another challenge is that due to low temperature the grout may cure slower or not cure at all, which will also result in a significant decrease in the ultimate strength of the anchor. Field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of shallow anchors including duckbill anchors and grouted anchors with three types of different grouting materials, including Microsil Anchor <b>Grout,</b> <b>Bentonite</b> Clay and a newly-developed Antifreeze Grout Mortar. Constant-load creep test and pullout test were conducted to evaluate the performance of the anchors. Test results indicated that the anchors grouted with Antifreeze Grout Mortar caused the least permafrost disturbance and degradation, gained the largest tensile strength, exhibited the least creep displacement, and showed relatively large pullout capacity, and thus achieved the best performance among all types of shallow anchors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cement-based grouts {{has been}} used {{successfully}} to repair cracks in many concrete structures such as bridges, tunnels, buildings and to consolidate soils or rock foundations. In the present study the rheological characterization of cement grout with water/binder ratio (W/B) is fixed at 0. 5. The effect of the replacement of cement by bentonite (2 to 10 % wt) in presence of superplasticizer (0. 5 % wt) was investigated. Several rheological tests were carried out by using controlled-stress rheometer equipped with vane geometry in temperature of 20 °C. To highlight the influence of bentonite and superplasticizer on the rheological behavior of grout cement, various flow tests {{in a range of}} shear rate from 0 to 200 s- 1 were observed. Cement grout showed a non-Newtonian viscosity behavior at all concentrations of bentonite. Three parameter model Herschel-Bulkley was chosen for fitting of experimental data. Based on the values of correlation coefficients of the estimated parameters, The Herschel-Bulkley law model well described the rheological behavior of the grouts. Test results showed that the dosage of bentonite increases the viscosity and yield stress of the system and introduces more thixotropy. While the addition of both bentonite and superplasticizer with cement grout improve significantly the fluidity and reduced the yield stress due to the action of dispersion of SP.

40|$|Compensation {{grouting}} {{is often}} {{employed as a}} mitigation technique to reduce the settlements induced by tunnelling. The efficiency of compensation grouting, defined as {{the ratio of the}} volume of heave induced at ground surface to the volume of injected grout, is strongly dependent on grout properties, injection characteristics and soil properties. In clayey soils, site observations and laboratory tests show high values of compensation efficiency immediately after injection. However the efficiency can decrease with time if positive excess pore water pressures develop in the soil during the injection process. Conversely, in sandy soils, a loss of volume occurs due to pressure filtration of the grout during and soon after the injection process, which reduces the compensation efficiency. This paper describes an analytical model {{that can be used to}} evaluate the volume loss produced by pressure filtration of cement-bentonite grouts as a function of soil, grout and injection parameters. The magnitude of pressure filtration is evaluated as the grout efficiency, which is given by the ratio of the volumes of the final grout body to the injected grout. Results show that the grout efficiency increases with decreasing soil permeability and with increasing <b>grout</b> <b>bentonite</b> content. The result of a grout injection test on a silty soil is back-analysed using this approach in which the grout efficiency is first evaluated through the proposed filtration model and then used to calibrate a numerical simulation of the test. The good agreement between experimental data and computed results shows that prediction of the efficiency of compensation grouting can be improved using the proposed approach...|$|R
