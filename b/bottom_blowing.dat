Mechanisms of droplet generation and mechanisms of the effect of <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> on droplet generation were investigated in a 2 -D water model, using high speed cinephotography. Two mechanisms of the droplet generation, 2 ̆ 2 dropping 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 swanning 2 ̆ 2, were found, corresponding to low and high jet gas flow rates respectively. Ejection of individual droplets and liquid fragments are characteristics of the 2 ̆ 2 dropping 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 swarming 2 ̆ 2 regions respectively. It was found that the significant increase in the droplet production due to <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> is principally caused by the interaction between the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> in the impingement zone, and not by the <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> as such.

The evidence obtained from this study suggests that there is a strong indication to take the momentum number as a link between the model and the prototype in terms of droplet generation due to an impinging gas jet.

In this study, the simulated experiments of the ironmaking smelter using water model were conducted to investigate the mixing degree of molten iron/slag under different gas <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> conditions. In the experiments, the major parameters of the gas <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> were the inside diameter of tuyere (6. 0 to 15. 0 mm), the total gas flow rate (320 to 480 normal liter/min), the placement of the <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> tuyeres, and the stirring energy.

In this study, transparent acrylic is used to construct a water model, which is 60 % {{as big as the}} original experimental melting reduction furnace of the China Steel Corporation. The mixing time of the molten iron phase in the water model is measured by using gas <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> and changing the number of tuyeres (from three to five), the tuyere placement, the tuyere size (6. 0 – 15. 0 mm), and the gas flow rate per tuyere (80 – 120 NL/min). The mixing trials adopt KCl as an indicator and use water filtrated using reverse osmosis (RO) in place of liquid iron to investigate the effect of gas <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> conditions on mixing of the molten iron phase. The experimental results indicate that in the cases of four tuyeres in the square-corner and triangle-corner-center placements, 10. 0 mm tuyeres yield the shortest mixing time (and thus the best mixing effect) under different total gas flow rates. In the case of five tuyeres in the square-corner-center placement, 10. 0 mm tuyeres also have the shortest mixing time under total gas flow rates of 400 NL/min and 500 NL/min. However, 12. 5 mm tuyeres have the shortest mixing time under a total gas flow rate of 600 NL/min.

40|$|Emulsification {{behaviour}} {{caused by}} gas bubbles rising through a slag/metal interface was studied in both a thin-slice model and a three-dimensional model using low temperature oil/aqueous and oil/mercury analogues. A generalized model characterizing the transitional volume of droplets entrained {{in the upper}} phase in the emulsification process was developed. The transient volume of "metal" entrained, $ rm V sb{d}(t),$ following the start of bubbling followed the relation $ rm V sb{d}(t) =V sb{ propto}(1 -e sp{-t/ tau}). $ Based on this model, the birth rate and mean residence time of droplets dispersed by rising bubbles could be quantified. Dimensional {{analysis was used to}} express the volume of lower liquid carried up into the emulsion per bubble, thereby allowing better estimates of the droplet birth rate in a practical emulsification process induced by <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing.</b> Emulsification behaviour in industrial in-bath smelting processes were interpreted with the present modelling results. Slag foaming in "in-bath" iron smelting was modelled by injecting gas through a porous disc into a vertical cylinder containing a variety of low temperature liquids. Based on experimental evidence and theoretical arguments, difficulties with previous studies characterizing foam height as a function of fluid properties were addressed, and an alternative analysis {{in the form of a}} general relationship was developed. The fractional volume of gas holdup, $ varepsilon,$ in foaming slags containing large spherical cap bubbles could be expressed as $ rm varepsilon=U sb{g}/ lbrack U sb{g}+(0. 5 gd sb{b}) sp{ 0. 5 } rbrack. $ The average bubble size in the foaming slag of the AISI pilot trials on the smelting reduction of iron ores was estimated to be 10 - 25 cm equivalent diameter, suggesting that significant coalescence of small bubbles (such as CO) occurs in the process. In modelling the mixing behaviour of ferroalloy additions in intensively stirred reactors, the AOD process was used to simulate slag chrome oxide reduction period by ferro-silicon additions. These phenomena were examined with the aid of a two dimensional slice model and then a three dimensional model using low temperature oil/aqueous analogues. Based on these modelling studies, it was observed that the ascending gas/liquid plume created two asymmetric mixing zones: a smaller mixing zone near the side wall fitted with tuyeres and a larger main mixing zone away from it. In "slag free" experiments, a dead zone formed at the far surface corner opposite the tuyeres. There, the particles simulating ferro-alloy additions accumulated. However, in the "slag covered" model experiments, the injected gas generated an emulsified "slag/metal" phase of lower apparent density which lead to the entrainment of the buoyant ferro-silicon alloy additions. This, in conjunction with the significantly modified flow patterns, and absence of any dead zones, allowed the particles simulating ferroalloy additions to be readily entrained within the recirculation flow. These results suggest that the mixing-in of such additions into the molten slag during the chrome oxide reduction period can be accomplished efficiently...|$|E

The boiler water needs to be alkaline and not acidic, {{so that it does}} not ruin the tubes. There can be too much conductivity in the feed water when there are too many dissolved solids. These correct treatments can be controlled by efficient operator and use of treatment chemicals. The main objectives to treat and condition boiler water is to exchange heat without scaling, protect against scaling, and produce high quality steam. The treatment of boiler water can be put into two parts. These are internal treatment and external treatment. (Sendelbach, p. 131) The internal treatment is for boiler feed water and external treatment is for make-up feed water and the condensate part of the system. Internal treatment protects against feed water hardness by preventing precipitating of scale on the boiler tubes. This treatment also protects against concentrations of dissolved and suspended solids in the feed water without priming or foaming. These treatment chemicals also help with the alkalinity of the feed water making it more of a base to help protect against boiler corrosion. The correct alkalinity is protected by adding phosphates. These phosphates precipitate the solids {{to the bottom of the}} boiler drum. At the bottom of the boiler drum there is a <b>bottom</b> <b>blow</b> to remove these solids. These chemicals also include anti-scaling agents, oxygen scavengers, and anti-foaming agents. Sludge can also be treated by two approaches. These are by coagulation and dispersion. When there is a high amount of sludge content it is better to coagulate the sludge to form large particles in order to just use the <b>bottom</b> <b>blow</b> to remove them from the feed water. When there is a low amount of sludge content it is better to use dispersants because it disperses the sludge throughout the feed water so sludge does not form.|$|R

40|$|In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the suitable burning technique and grate type of wheat and sunflower stalks. Wheat and sunflower stalks were burnt in three different forms. In the first form, wheat straw was burnt in bale slices, sunflower stalks as it {{was removed from the}} field; in the second form, both stalks were burnt after being chopped without being compressed; and in the third one after being chopped and compressed in polyethylene bags. Three different grates with circle, oblong and mixed (circle+oblong) holed were used in the boiler. Fuels were burnt in the grates in three different forms, i. e., by front natural draft, bottom natural draft and <b>bottom</b> fan <b>blowing.</b> In the study, the highest boiler efficiency for the 1. forms of wheat and sunflower stalks were found as 25. 7 and 25. 1 % in front burning with circle holed grate. The highest boiler efficiency in the 2. form trials were obtained under front burning conditions with circle holed grate, being 35. 8 and 30. 5 % in wheat straw and sunflower stalks, respectively. The highest efficiency in the 3. form trials were obtained in the burning type <b>bottom</b> fan <b>blowing</b> and mixed holed grate with <b>bottom</b> fan <b>blowing</b> and circle holed grate in sunflower stalk with 30. 9 %. Low O 2 values were obtained for front and bottom burning conditions in all three grates for the I. forms of fuels, in the chimney gas measurements of wheat and sunflower stalks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{mathematical}} models to explore the mixing and its related phenomena in converter bath. Specifically, first, a mathematical model of a physical model converter, which was scaled down to 1 / 6 th of a 30 t vessel, was developed in this study. A number of parameters were studied and their effects on the mixing time were recorded in a top blown converter. Second, a mathematical model for a combined top-bottom blown was built to investigate the optimization process. Then, a side tuyere was introduced in the combined top-bottom blown converter and its effects on the mixing and wall shear stress were studied. Moreover, based on the above results, the kinetic energy transfer phenomena in a real converter were investigated by applying the mathematical models. A simplified model, in which the calculation region was reduced to save calculation compared to simulations of the whole region of the converter, was used in the mathematical simulation. In addition, this method was also used in the simulation of real converters. This approach makes it possible to simulate the Laval nozzle flow jet and the cavity separately when using different turbulence models. In the top blown converter model, a comparison between the physical model and the mathematical model showed a good relative difference of 2. 5 % and 6. 1 % for the cavity depth and radius, respectively. In addition, the predicted mixing time showed a good relative difference of 2. 8 % in comparison to the experimental data. In an optimization of a combined top-bottom blown converter, a new bottom tuyere scheme with an asymmetrical configuration was found to be one of the best cases with respect to a decreased mixing time in the bath. An industrial investigation showed that the application effects of the new tuyere scheme yield a better stirring condition in the bath compared to the original case. Furthermore, the results indicated that the mixing time for a combined top-bottom-side blown converter was decreased profoundly compared to a conventional combined top-bottom blown converter. It was found that the side wall shear stress is increased by introducing side blowing, especially in the region near the side blowing plume. For a 100 t converter in real, the fundamental aspects of kinetic energy transfer from a top and bottom gas to the bath were explored. The analyses revealed that the energy transfer is less efficient when the top lance height is lowered or the flowrate is increased in the top blowing operations. However, an inverse trend was found. Namely, that the kinetic energy transfer is increased when the bottom flowrate is increased in the current <b>bottom</b> <b>blowing</b> operations. In addition, the slag on top of the bath is found to dissipate 6. 6 %, 9. 4 % and 11. 2 % for the slag masses 5, 9 and 15 t compared to the case without slag on top of the surface of the bath, respectively.   QC 20151015 </p...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} impurity contents in concentrates, {{the control}} of the minor elements is an important issue for the oxygen <b>bottom</b> <b>blown</b> copper smelting process (Shuikoushan process or SKS process). In this work, the distribution behaviors of the minor elements (such as Pb, Zn, As, Sb, and Bi) among the matte, slag, and gas phases as a function of matte grades was investigated by adjusting the ratios of oxygen/ore in the SKS process. With a matte grade around 70 %, about 82 % As and 70 % Bi enters the gas phase, and about 70 % Sb and 64 % Zn reports to the slag phase, while 55 % lead enters the matte phase. The tendency of changes in the distribution of the minor elements in the SKS process is different from that in the Isasmelt process and the Flash smelting process. It may be concluded from this study that the distributions of the minor elements could be optimized to reduce adverse effects in the SKS process by regulating the matte grade...|$|R
40|$|Average {{diameter}} of bubbles {{is important in}} copper furnace. Based {{on the principle of}} similarity, a slice water model of a furnace with bottom-blown oxygen in matte-smelting process was established. A high-speed camera was used to record images continuously and clearer pictures were selected for treatment. Finally, image processing software was used for obtaining the average {{diameter of}} the bubbles. The effects of different injection conditions and equipment factors such as the diameter of nozzle, the nozzle installing angle, and gas velocity on the average diameter of bubbles were studied with cold water model experiment, exploring the dispersion and disintegration rules of bubbles. According to experimental data and Buckingham’s theorem, by using dimensional analysis method, an empirical formula on average diameter of bubbles was established (dB= 0. 41666 d 0. 29374 θ- 0. 46572 v- 0. 16725).

40|$|Analysis of {{quenched}} copper smelting slag {{from the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>blown</b> furnace at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals Co., Ltd. (Fangyuan) shows that significant ZnO {{is present in}} both liquid and spinel phases. Phase equilibria have been investigated in the system ZnO-Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2 in air and system ZnO-'FeO'-SiO 2 in equilibrium with metallic iron. These conditions cannot represent copper smelting process in which oxygen partial pressure is around 10 - 8 atm. In the present study phase equilibria in the system ZnO-'FeO'-SiO 2 {{have been carried out}} at Po 2 10 - 8 atm. A series of experimental difficulties have been overcome to enable the ZnO-containing system to be investigated under reducing conditions controlled by CO-CO 2 gas mixture. The experimental approach includes master slag preparation, high-temperature equilibration, quench and electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA). Phase compositions in the quenched samples were measured by EPMA and used for construction of phase diagram. It was found that the isotherms of the system ZnO-'FeO'-SiO 2 at Po 2 10 - 8 atm are significantly different from those in air or in equilibrium with metallic iron. Presence of ZnO in copper smelting slag significantly increases the liquidus temperature in spinel primary phase field. The partitioning of ZnO in liquid and spinel is also reported in this paper...|$|R
