5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops.

5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted <b>by</b> <b>historians</b> that, although Otto failed, he deeply loved Greece {{as his own}} new homeland.

Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
