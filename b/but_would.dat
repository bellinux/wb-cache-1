5|$|In January 2006, Seven officially {{announced}} that they had cancelled Blue Heelers, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> air a final shortened season of only 11 episodes in mid-2006—the 11 episodes which had been filmed in late 2005, before Blue Heelers had been cancelled.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013, Walsh {{announced}} that he would be stepping down as the chief of Diageo in September, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> stay with the company as an advisor until June 2014 to aid the transition process.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Cedar Point {{announced}} the pending closure of Mantis scheduled the following month. The park later revealed that Mantis wouldn't be removed <b>but</b> <b>would</b> {{be transformed into}} a floorless roller coaster design for the 2015 season. It reopened as Rougarou on May 9, 2015.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{you know}} I could have mamma go, <b>but</b> it <b>would</b> bore her; or I {{could have a}} maid go, <b>but</b> that <b>would</b> bore me; and so I've decided to have you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Ugly One? Very willingly," [...] replied Kaliko. [...] "I begged Ruggedo {{long ago}} {{to send him}} away, <b>but</b> he <b>would</b> not do so. I also offered to help your brother to escape, <b>but</b> he <b>would</b> not go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Winston gravely. [...] "It <b>would,</b> <b>but</b> it <b>would</b> {{not cause}} me to desist. Nothing would do that, if Miss Barrington can {{overlook}} the past." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} table {{sets out}} the official, or establishment, strength of auxiliary {{units in the}} 2nd century. The real strength of a unit would fluctuate continually, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> likely have been somewhat less than the establishment most of the time.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius' heir Caligula {{not only}} spent Tiberius' fortune of 2,700,000,000 sesterces <b>but</b> <b>would</b> also begin {{the chain of}} events which would bring about the {{downfall}} of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in AD 68.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running from}} Hunters Point in Queens heading {{southeast}} to Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. The line {{would consist of}} between two and four tracks, and at Lafayette Avenue, the line would split. Two of them would continue as a Lafayette Avenue, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> then become four tracks. The remaining two tracks would run to Franklin and Flatbush Avenues.|$|E
60|$|Mattie {{began to}} drop hints. <b>But</b> Jed <b>would</b> not take them. True, {{once or twice}} he thought that perhaps Mattie did care a little for him yet. <b>But</b> it <b>would</b> not do {{for him to take}} {{advantage}} of that.|$|R
6000|$|... "There it is, John! Now, you oughtn't to reproach me with it; for {{you know}} it was your own idea. I didn't want the {{alterations}} made; <b>but</b> you <b>would</b> insist on it. I didn't think it was best; <b>but</b> you <b>would</b> have them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>but</b> that <b>would</b> not be {{the effect}} of an explanation, because the truth {{is not likely to}} {{reconcile}} us. If I were to explain the difficulty to a man, he <b>would</b> argue. <b>But</b> Marian <b>would</b> just infer that I despised her, and nothing else." ...|$|R
5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee {{concluded that there was}} sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992–93 season, Bridgman {{was fired}} and {{replaced}} by Senators Vice-President Randy Sexton. In the 1993–94 season, the club added prospects Daigle and Yashin. Yashin would have an outstanding rookie season and become {{a finalist for the}} Calder Memorial Trophy. Yashin led the team in points with 30 goals and 79 points, while Daigle had 51 points. The Senators would make some progress, improving their record to 14 wins and 37 points, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> again finish last in the League. The Senators would select Radek Bonk with their pick, third overall, in the 1994 Draft.|$|E
60|$|The jailer {{said that}} many men might have gone to see him, so easy was Sir Robert to him. <b>But</b> he <b>would</b> have no man; and none dare enter save Sir Robert and he, for fear of their lives. <b>But</b> he <b>would</b> ask him of Herepol.|$|R
30|$|<b>But</b> he <b>would</b> {{rather die}} than put down the gun.|$|R
50|$|Any {{number of}} words could be formed by {{stringing}} roots and affixes together, <b>but</b> some <b>would</b> be more useful than others. For example, the English word rainer means a person who rains, <b>but</b> most people <b>would</b> be surprised that it is included in English dictionaries. The corresponding Interlingua word pluviator is unlikely to appear in a dictionary because of its lack of utility. Interlingua, like any traditional language, could build up large numbers of these words, <b>but</b> this <b>would</b> be undesirable.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|As he {{made his}} {{preparations}} for a further expedition, Scott was aware of other polar ventures being planned. A Japanese expedition was being planned; the Australasian Antarctic Expedition under Douglas Mawson was to leave in 1911, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> be working in a different sector of the continent. Meanwhile, Roald Amundsen, a potential rival, had announced plans for an Arctic voyage.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Liberal Party, Turnbull {{supported}} the introduction of an ETS. In June 2009, he indicated in principle support for an ETS proposed by the Rudd Government despite the opposition of his Coalition partner, the National Party. Turnbull subsequently outlined the Coalition's position that it would oppose the ETS introduced to Parliament by the government, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> be open to negotiating an amended version.|$|E
60|$|Aynsley felt confused; <b>but</b> he <b>would</b> {{not seek}} refuge in deceit.|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} left early, <b>but</b> it <b>would</b> have been too noticeable.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> he <b>would</b> {{not trust}} himself to speak {{again on the}} subject.|$|R
5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, {{there is a good chance}} that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E
5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} {{be broken down into}} smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route <b>but</b> <b>would</b> charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one claimed the lives of more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, and the rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system. Tour de France 1904 winner Cornet would enter the Tour de France for seven more times, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> never again play an important role.|$|E
60|$|STRANGWAY. You {{were very}} good to come; <b>but</b> I <b>would</b> rather not.|$|R
60|$|We {{tried to}} interfere, <b>but</b> she <b>would</b> not listen, even to Orme.|$|R
60|$|Then the earls bade {{him take}} Hereward's advice. <b>But</b> he <b>would</b> not.|$|R
5|$|Christopher {{was born}} in Richmond, California. His brother, Loyd Christopher, {{went on to become}} a major league outfielder. Loyd was the one first {{interested}} in becoming a professional baseball player, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> not sign a contract unless Russ signed one as well. As a child, Christopher had a case of rheumatic fever, which damaged his heart.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{arose from}} other genres. Players {{turned away from}} RPGs, flight {{simulators}} and adventure games in favor of action-oriented titles, such as first-person shooters and real-time strategy games. Later RPGs would draw influences from action genres, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> face new challenges {{in the form of}} massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a late-1990s trend that may have siphoned players away from single-player RPGs. They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E
5|$|Diageo {{maintained}} {{ownership of}} BK until 2000 when Diageo {{decided to focus}} solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain. In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block this because it believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, <b>but</b> <b>would</b> instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands.|$|E
50|$|Korn {{gives this}} an exclamation mark, <b>but</b> 37.Rh8+ <b>would</b> also win quickly.|$|R
50|$|Proportional {{fairness}} {{would result}} in lower throughput, <b>but</b> starvation <b>would</b> be avoided.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{the fault}} of Lycoris. She begged and entreated me not to come, <b>but</b> I <b>would</b> not listen to her. You are angry with me, Beric, <b>but</b> you <b>would</b> not be angry if you {{knew what it was}} to me. Younger than I have died for the Faith, and I would die too if it were necessary." ...|$|R
