500|$|Galvis {{was born}} November 14, 1989, in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and at age 14, the Philadelphia Phillies began to scout {{him during his}} days playing youth baseball. He participated on Latin America's team in the Little League World Series, but due to his slight stature ( [...] ), {{struggled}} to captivate scouts' attention. Galvis said, [...] "They told me that I couldn't play (pro) baseball. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had the ability." [...] In 2006, scouts Sal Agostinelli and Jesus Mendez signed him during the amateur player signing period. Galvis, 16 years old, was not a particularly heralded prospect, but did receive some attention from scouting experts before signing with the Phillies.|$|E
500|$|Several Scandinavian {{actors were}} cast in major roles, {{including}} Pihla Viitala, Peter Stormare (who Arterton said had actually inspired her to start acting), Bjørn Sundquist, and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal. In addition, actors from Germany and Poland (including Thomas Mann, Rainer Bock, and Joanna Kulig) {{and other parts}} of the world were also cast. Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film. Minor parts, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could get great actors in small parts and Ingrid has a great physicality." [...] Stormare said he was only surprised at [...] "how smart Tom [...] is, and how broad this fantasy is and the span of his imagination," [...] his favourite aspect being how [...] "some of the witches are so sexy and cool." [...] He compared the film's production to being in Disneyland, saying it felt like a dream to him.|$|E
2500|$|At age 18, Mulgrew {{left her}} family in Dubuque to study acting in New York. By 1977, she found herself {{pregnant}} while acting in the lead role of Mary Ryan on Ryan's Hope. [...] "I was single, alone and flooded with terror. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> would have that baby," [...] Mulgrew said. She placed the baby for adoption three days after giving birth.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{was just}} a fat heavy," [...] Burr told {{journalist}} James Bawden. [...] "I split the heavy parts with Bill Conrad. We were both in our twenties playing much older men. I never got the girl but I once got the gorilla in a 3-D picture called Gorilla at Large. I menaced Claudette Colbert, Lizabeth Scott, Paulette Goddard, Anne Baxter, Barbara Stanwyck. Those girls would take one {{look at me and}} scream and can you blame them? I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart's [...] "Rod the Mod" [...] image gained wider {{visibility}} in November 1965, {{when he was}} {{the subject}} of a 30-minute Rediffusion, London television documentary titled [...] "An Easter with Rod" [...] that portrayed the Mod scene. His parallel solo career attempts continued on EMI's Columbia label with the November 1965 release of [...] "The Day Will Come", a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on Sam Cooke's [...] "Shake", with the Brian Auger Trinity. Both failed commercially and neither gained positive notices. Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, [...] "I didn't sound like anybody at all ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke." [...] This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a [...] "crossing of the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Who You Are {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{anticipated}} releases of 2011, due to Jessie J winning the Critics Choice award at the 2011 BRIT Awards and topping the BBC's Sound of 2011 poll. On Twitter, Jessie J confirmed that it took her 6 years to completely finish the album - it was completed on 19 January 2011. In an interview Jessie J stated that she wrote her first song, [...] "Big White Room", at the age of 17, about when she was in hospital, at 11 years old. A ward mate of hers, a little boy, died. She recalls waking up in the middle of the night and seeing him praying, and her mother explaining that he was having an operation the next day and was asking God to save him. [...] "He died the next day so I said to my mum 'but God didn't save him'. I was so angry and it really confused me. I always wanted to write a song about the experience, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had to be of an age where it wasn't tacky or depressing and had a lightness to it." [...] She prefers the song with just an acoustic guitar; stripped down and bare.|$|E

2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composer}} told Meryle Secrest, [...] "I {{just wanted}} to study composition, theory, and harmony without the attendant musicology that comes in graduate school. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> wanted to write for the theatre, so I wanted someone who did not disdain theatre music." [...] Barrow suggested that Sondheim study with Milton Babbitt, who Sondheim described as [...] "a frustrated show composer" [...] with whom he formed [...] "a perfect combination." [...] When he met Babbitt, {{he was working on}} a musical for Mary Martin based on the myth of Helen of Troy. Sondheim and Babbitt would meet once a week in New York City for four hours (at the time, Babbitt was teaching at Princeton University). According to Sondheim, they spent the first hour dissecting Rodgers and Hart or George Gershwin or studying Babbitt's favorites (Buddy DeSylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson). They then proceeded to other forms of music (such as Mozart's Jupiter Symphony), critiquing them the same way. Babbitt and Sondheim, fascinated by mathematics, studied songs by a variety of composers (especially Jerome Kern). Sondheim told Secrest that Kern had the ability [...] "to develop a single motif through tiny variations into a long and never boring line and his maximum development of the minimum of material". He said about Babbitt, [...] "I am his maverick, his one student who went into the popular arts with all his serious artillery". At Williams, Sondheim wrote a musical adaption of Beggar on Horseback (a 1924 play by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, with permission from Kaufman) which had three performances. A member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, he graduated magna cum laude in 1950.|$|E
