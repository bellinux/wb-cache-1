500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland {{smiles at}} himself in the mirror. BOB stares back at him from the {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E
2500|$|On January 16, 2013, All Nippon Airways Flight NH-692, {{en route}} from Yamaguchi Ube Airport to Tokyo Haneda, had a battery problem warning {{followed}} by a <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> while climbing from Ube about [...] west of Takamatsu, Japan. The aircraft diverted to Takamatsu and was evacuated via the slides; three passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation. Inspection revealed a battery fire. A similar incident in a parked Japan Airlines 787 at Boston's Logan International Airport within the same week led the Federal Aviation Administration to ground all 787s. On January 16, 2013, both major Japanese airlines ANA and JAL voluntarily grounded their fleets of 787s after multiple incidents involving different 787s, including emergency landings. At the time, these two carriers operated 24 of the 50 787s delivered. [...] The grounding reportedly cost ANA some 9 billion yen (US$93 million) in lost sales.|$|E

60|$|At first, as I lay {{quiet on}} the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I might say impossible, {{to get rid of}} the {{impression}} of the glare of the flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce <b>burning</b> <b>smell.</b> If I dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention engaged.|$|E
6000|$|Staniford laughed, as he {{had laughed}} at {{everything}} on {{the way from the}} station, and had probably thus wounded Ezra Perkins's susceptibilities. The village houses, separated so widely by the one long street, each with its path neatly tunneled from the roadway to the gate; the meeting-house, so much vaster than the present needs of worship, and looking blue-cold with its never-renewed single coat of white paint; the graveyard set {{in the midst of the}} village, and showing, after Ezra Perkins's disappearance, as many signs of life as any other locality, realized in the most satisfactory degree his theories of what winter must be in such a place as South Bradfield. The <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> of the sheet-iron stove in the parlor, with its battlemented top of filigree iron work; the grimness of the horsehair- covered best furniture; the care with which the old-fashioned fire- places had been walled up, and all accessible character of the period to which the house belonged had been effaced, gave him an equal pleasure. He went about with his arm round Lydia's waist, examining these things, and yielding to the joy they caused him, when they were alone. [...] "Oh, my darling," [...] he said, in one of these accesses of delight, [...] "when I think that it's my privilege to take you away from all this, I begin to feel not so very unworthy, after all." ...|$|E
50|$|Patricia McCusker, Assistant Superintendent of the Work Camp at Florida State Prison, also testified. She {{said she}} saw Medina's left hand tighten {{as the current}} was being applied. She corroborated Dickson's {{observation}} of smoke and flames coming from Medina's head and a smell, which she said was a <b>burning</b> <b>smell.</b> McCusker claimed she also saw movements in Medina's chest after the current had been turned off, but claimed it was contractions of the chest muscle which did not imply breathing.|$|E

60|$|He {{was awakened}} at dawn the {{following}} morning by the <b>smell</b> of <b>burning</b> pine--a <b>smell</b> that summons the ranger as a drum arouses a soldier. Rushing out of doors, he soon located the fire. It was off the forest and to the southeast, but as any blaze within sight demanded investigation, he put {{a pot of coffee}} on the fire and swiftly roped and saddled one of his horses. In thirty minutes he was riding up the side of a high hill which lay between the station and Otter Creek, a branch of the Shellfish, at the mouth of which, some miles below, stood Kitsong's ranch.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the core}} plug will twist apart mid-cut, {{creating}} a condition where the core inside the hole saw spins on the yet-uncut {{portion of the}} core still in the workpiece. This tends to stop the cutting action of the saw, and if the workpiece is wood or plastic, the friction will start to singe it, creating a <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> and heating up the hole saw. The twisted-off core must then be pried {{out of the hole}} saw before the cutting can continue.|$|E
50|$|After {{taking off}} from Heathrow at 19:52, Flight BD 092 was {{climbing}} through 28,300 feet to reach its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet when a blade detached from the fan of the port (left) CFM International CFM56 engine. While the pilots {{did not know the}} source of the problem, a pounding noise was suddenly heard, accompanied by severe vibrations. In addition, smoke poured into the cabin through the ventilation system and a <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> entered the plane. Several passengers sitting near the rear of the plane noticed smoke and sparks coming from the left engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, Thomas {{takes longer}} to start than usual and arrives at Knapford with Gordon's coaches later than usual. Still cross with Thomas for waking him up, Gordon starts sooner than expected before Thomas can be uncoupled. By the time Gordon reaches Wellsworth, Thomas is worn out and is uncoupled. Back at Knapford the following day, Thomas meets Jerome and Judy, two cranes of the breakdown train while shunting in the yard. James arrives with a goods train and prepares to take Annie and Clarabel, while Thomas again notices the strange <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> {{which is coming}} from James' wooden brake blocks.|$|E
50|$|Surprisingly {{the next}} morning {{there was very little}} damage to be seen. Actually all the houses around were intact, except for one house — the house of the parson. His house was in ruins, and it was still burning. Some neighbors even thought they <b>smelled</b> <b>burning</b> brimstone. Presumably the devil himself had made the parson pay for desecrating the kistvaens.|$|R

60|$|For fully half an hour, Gyp {{continued}} to sit up, straining her ears. Where was he? What doing? On her over-excited nerves, {{all sorts of}} possibilities came crowding. He must have gone downstairs again. In that half-drunken state, where would his baffled frenzies lead him? And, suddenly, she thought that she <b>smelled</b> <b>burning.</b> It went, and came again; she got up, crept to the door, noiselessly turned the key, and, pulling it open a few inches, sniffed.|$|R
50|$|One stormy {{night at}} Tidmouth Sheds, Thomas meets Henry whom Edward {{tells the story}} about the time he hid in a tunnel {{to get out of the}} rain. The {{following}} day, Thomas is sent to the Sodor Steamworks where he is repainted blue and given the number 1. Gordon explains that the last #1 engine was a vertical-boilered engine called a coffee pot and orders Thomas to fetch his express coaches. Thomas accidentally tries to take two four-wheeled coaches called Annie and Clarabel, who belong to James. James later returns Annie and Clarabel to the yard, causing Thomas to notice a <b>burning</b> <b>smell.</b> Later, seeing Henry at the water tower, Thomas asks him about his fear of the rain.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} patrolled by two {{security}} guards, {{both of whom}} were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am in the morning when the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had <b>smelled</b> <b>burning</b> plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.|$|R
50|$|Since 2007, locals {{have been}} {{concerned}} by a re-occurring smell which has been regularly engulfing the town, impacting upon the amenity and health of local residents and visitors. It had been described by some as resembling a <b>burning</b> chemical gas <b>smell,</b> the stench of dead bodies or as a putrid smell that was able to infiltrate homes. The smell was found to originate from the Drovers Place area where Transpacific Industries, a leading organic waste recycler, was based. The business has since closed. Concerns over the rapid pace of urban expansion in the Pakenham area have also been raised, as traditional farmland surrounding the town has been rezoned {{to allow for the}} development of housing estates, causing protests by some residents who have sought to have these undeveloped or 'green wedge' lands protected.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chemical}} {{oxygen generator}} system connected to all masks in the compartment. Pulling {{down on one}} oxygen mask removes the firing pin of the generator igniting a mixture of sodium chlorate and iron powder, opening the oxygen supply for all the masks in the compartment. Oxygen production cannot be shut off once a mask is pulled, and oxygen production typically lasts at least 15 minutes. During the production of oxygen, the generator becomes extremely hot {{and should not be}} touched. A <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> may be noted and cause alarm among passengers, but this smell is a normal part of the chemical reaction. This system {{can be found on the}} MD-80 aircraft, whose system is also unique in the fact that the face masks are clipped to the inside of the compartment door and do not drop out and hang, by the oxygen tube, in front of the passengers. [...] "For any aircraft which carries more than a very few passengers, the weight, complexity and maintenance issues associated with a compressed gas system would be prohibitive. As a consequence, the industry relies on chemical oxygen generators." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the Elektron unit {{shut down}} due to (initially) unknown causes. Two weeks of {{troubleshooting}} {{resulted in the}} unit starting up again, then immediately shutting down. The cause was eventually traced to gas bubbles in the unit, which remained non-functional until a Progress resupply mission in October 2004. In 2005 ISS personnel tapped into the oxygen supply of the recently arrived Progress resupply ship, when the Elektron unit failed. In 2006 fumes from a malfunctioning Elektron unit prompted NASA flight engineers to declare a [...] "spacecraft emergency". A <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> led the ISS crew to suspect another Elektron fire, but the unit was only [...] "very hot". A leak of corrosive, odorless potassium hydroxide forced the ISS crew to don gloves and face masks. It has been conjectured that the smell came from overheated rubber seals. The incident occurred shortly after STS-115 left and just before arrival of a resupply mission (including space tourist Anousheh Ansari). The Elektron did not come back online until November 2006, after new valves and cables arrived on the October 2006 Progress resupply vessel. The ERPTC (Electrical Recovery Processing Terminal Current) was inserted into the ISS to prevent harm to the systems.|$|E
50|$|Lucy and Spencer go to {{the house}} where {{everyone}} else lives and discuss {{the events of the}} night. Lucy suggests to the housemates that they may have summoned a djinn, saying the burns on Annie are signs of this being true. The housemates are still skeptical, so they watch the tape they recorded of the 'summoning' to check if anyone was pushing it. Soon after Liam freaks out in the video, however, the electricity in the house goes out. Webster and Spencer break into Becker (Tom Bell), the landlord's, flat and find a hidden shrine of sorts to the Djinn with grisly photos and newspaper cuttings. It is also revealed that Liam's father, Paul Brennan, had been in the same predicament once (as shown in the prologue) and killed his mother as a result. He pleaded insanity and was put in a mental hospital. Joe attempts to get information out of Liam about it the next day at college, but he gets angry and leaves. Stella also leaves soon after, and goes to the toilet. She starts to freak out about a <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> when an unnamed female black student (Tameka Empson) tells her it's just a joint. Calming down, Stella goes to leave, but is pulled into another stall, where she is brutally murdered (the viewer can only see her feet lifting off the ground as they slowly become covered in her own blood). Her body is discovered by the female student. Liam goes to see his father to get answers but it quickly descends into a row. When Liam mentions Becker his father shouts that he is there to protect Liam. Liam leaves without hearing this.|$|E

60|$|When, {{feeling very}} dizzy, Breckenridge raised {{himself in the}} corner {{where he had been}} lying, the hall was empty save for two huddled figures in the doorway, and while he blinked at them in a half-dazed fashion, {{it seemed to him that}} a red glare, which rose and fell, shone in. He could also <b>smell</b> <b>burning</b> wood, and saw dim wreaths of smoke drive by outside. His hearing was not {{especially}} acute just then, but he fancied that men were trampling, and apparently dragging furniture about, all over the building. Then, as his scattered senses came back to him, he rose feebly to his feet, and finding to his astonishment that he still possessed the power of locomotion, walked unevenly towards the motionless objects in the doorway. One of them, as he expected, was Grant, who was lying very white and still, just as he had fallen.|$|R
2500|$|Kansas pop {{rocks are}} concretions of either iron sulfide, i.e. pyrite and marcasite, {{or in some}} cases jarosite, which are found in {{outcrops}} of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation within Gove County, Kansas. They are typically associated with thin layers of altered volcanic ash, called bentonite, that occur within the chalk comprising the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. A few of these concretions enclose, at least in part, large flattened valves of inoceramid bivalves. These concretions range in size from a few millimeters to as much as [...] in length and [...] in thickness. Most of these concretions are oblate spheroids. Other [...] "pop rocks" [...] are small polycuboidal pyrite concretions, which are as much as [...] in diameter (Hattin 1982). These concretions are called [...] "pop rocks" [...] because they explode if thrown in a fire. Also, when they are either cut or hammered, they produce sparks and a <b>burning</b> sulfur <b>smell.</b> Contrary to what has been published on the Internet, none of the iron sulfide concretions, which are found in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member were created by either the replacement of fossils or by metamorphic processes. In fact, metamorphic rocks are completely absent from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member (Hattin 1982). Instead, all of these iron sulfide concretions were created by the precipitation of iron sulfides within anoxic marine calcareous ooze after it had accumulated and before it had lithified into chalk.|$|R
50|$|In the night, Black Beauty, Merrylegs and Ginger are all {{asleep in}} their stables. Soon, many mice began leaping {{up onto the}} hay sacks in the barn, only to be chased by a cat. But the cat knocks over Filcher's smoking pipe, which lands behind the bags, setting them alight. Smoke pours into the air; then flames burst out. Black Beauty smells a <b>burning</b> <b>smell</b> and Merrylegs tells them it's coming from the bags. Soon, Raffles the dog smells the smoke as well and starts to bark, {{alerting}} Squire Gordon. John then rings the bell to alert {{all of the people}} that the barn is on fire. Gordon orders the men to fetch buckets of water to put the flames out. Filcher watches with a smirk as the men desperately try to put the flames out using water. John climbs into the burning barn to rescue the horses. In the barn, John gets Black Beauty to use his hooves to break the barn door down. The door is broken open and the horses are free from the fire. The crowd cheers as John comes out with the horses. As soon as the fire cools, John tells Filcher that he left his pipe in the stables making the hay burn. Filcher tries to make an excuse, but Gordon angrily banishes Filcher from working in the stables due to burning the barn roof down. Gordon is called by Bertie to come quickly and is very horrified to find his daughter has fainted. She is taken into bed by Mrs. Bates. John assures Beauty that Polly will be fine.|$|E

Such knowledge is important to help devise monitoring and control measures {{that could be used}} to target gravid females. This study set out to develop a suite of tools that can be used to study the attraction of gravid Anopheles gambiae s. s. towards visual or olfactory cues associated with aquatic habitats. Methods Firstly, the study developed and assessed methods for using electrocuting nets to analyse the orientation of gravid females towards an aquatic habitat. Electric nets (1 m high × 0. 5 m wide) were powered by a 12 V battery via a spark box. High and low energy settings were compared for mosquito electrocution and a collection device developed to retain electrocuted mosquitoes when falling to the ground. Secondly, a range of sticky materials and a detergent were tested to quantify if and where gravid females land to lay their eggs, by treating the edge of the ponds and the water surface. A randomized complete block design was used for all experiments with 200 mosquitoes released each day. Experiments were conducted in screened semi-field systems using insectary-reared An. gambiae s. s. Data were analysed by generalized estimating equations.

Shiny sticky surfaces attract gravid females possibly because they are visually mistaken as aquatic habitats. These materials might be developed further as gravid traps. Anopheles gambiae s. s. primarily land on the water surface for oviposition. This behaviour can be exploited for the development of new trapping and control strategies. </p...|$|E
25|$|Early in 1937, Gershwin {{began to}} {{complain}} of blinding headaches and a recurring {{impression that he}} <b>smelled</b> <b>burning</b> rubber.

There was no wind to blow them out. He kept {{his head to one side}} to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was <b>burning.</b> He could <b>smell</b> it. Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.|$|R
