Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and <b>bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are workable with sodium. [...] An effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is Met-L-X. Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand. Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas. Pool-type sodium fires are prevented using different design measures called catch pan systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak-recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.|$|E

50|$|Halotron I is a fire-extinguishing agent {{based on}} the raw {{material}} HCFC-123 (93%) mixed with tetrafluoromethane and argon as propellants. It was originally introduced in 1992 to replace the severely ozone depleting halon 1211, or <b>bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> (BCF).|$|E
50|$|<b>Bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> is commercially synthetized in a two-step way. First, {{chloroform}} is fluorinated with hydrogen fluoride.

50|$|Halon 1211 has one carbon atom, two {{fluorine}} atoms, one {{chlorine atom}} and one bromine atom.

However, recycling of halon 1211 allows it to remain in use, although parts availability is limited to a few manufacturers and can be an issue. Halon 1211 is still widely used in the United States, despite its high cost, with the US Military being the biggest user, but Europe and Australia have banned its use for all but [...] "critical applications" [...] such as aviation, military, and police use.|$|E
50|$|Brominated haloalkanes {{were first}} used during World War II as fire {{extinguisher}} for aircraft and tanks. <b>Bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> was introduced {{as an effective}} gaseous fire suppression agent in the mid 1960s for use around highly valuable materials {{in places such as}} museums, mainframe rooms and telecommunication switching centers. They were also widely used in the maritime industries in the engine rooms of ships and also in the transport industry in vehicles. Its efficiency as a fire extinguishing agent has also led it to be the predominant choice of fire extinguishing agent on commercial aircraft and is typically found in cylindrical hand-held canisters. Its advantages as a fire extinguishing agent are that it has lower toxicity than chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and that since it is a covalently bonded compound, it does not form conductive ions, therefore being usable on electrical equipment.|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{associated}} with monitoring {{the velocity of}} water in unsaturated porous media is the difficulty of removing samples of the pore water at different times for analysis. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is to use volatile fluorocarbon tracers which are transported in a soluble form, yet can be measured in a gaseous state, thus eliminating the difficult process of extracting liquid samples from soils with high matric suction. The three fluorocarbon tracers used to investigate the suitability of a volatile tracer method were <b>bromochlorodifluoromethane,</b> chlorodifluoroethane and sulfur hexafluoride. Five laboratory column experiments were conducted to determine under what conditions volatile tracers would give reliable estimates of water flow rates. The Discrete State Compartment computer model was used to interpret the laboratory data, thereby allowing a more accurate estimate of water travel times in unsaturated media...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> (BCF) on {{reproduction}} in the rat {{has been investigated}} in two studies. Pregnant female rats were exposed by inhalation to 1000, 10, 000, or 50, 000 ppm BCF for {{six hours a day}} on days six to 15 of gestation (day of mating = day 0). Exposure to 50, 000 ppm BCF caused a reduction in maternal weight gain over the exposure period but {{there was no evidence of}} either teratogenicity or embryo/fetotoxicity at any concentration. In a study designed to assess the potential effect of BCF during a complete reproductive cycle male and female rats were exposed to 5000 ppm or 25, 000 ppm BCF for six hours a day for five days a week for 10 weeks (males) or three weeks (females) before mating. Exposure to BCF continued during mating and up to day 20 of gestation for half the females which were subsequently allowed to litter and the development of their offspring monitored. The remaining females were removed from exposure to BCF after mating and killed on day 20 of gestation for examination of their uterine contents. There were no effects on adult fertility, pup numbers, survival, or pup development. It was concluded that BCF had no reproductive toxicity potential in the rat...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Although {{there are}} ample {{data on the}} {{respiratory}} effects of exposure to fire extinguisher gas, the potential hematologic effects have not been fully documented. We conducted this study to determine the possible etiologic agent(s) for a decrease in red blood cells among community residents in Taipei, Taiwan, after they were exposed to leakage of mixed fire extinguishants containing bromotrifluoromethane (CF 3 Br, Halon 1301), <b>bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> (CF 2 BrCl, Halon 1211), and dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl 2 F 2, CFC- 12). CASE PRESENTATION: We studied 117 exposed residents who came into one hospital for physical examinations. We also selected age- and sex-matched referents for comparison from residents {{who came to the}} same hospital for health examinations. Nine months after the exposure to mixed fire extinguishants, 91 of the exposed residents came back for a second physical examination. In the first examination of the exposed residents, we found a significant reduction in red blood cell count and hemoglobin and a relationship between dose and response. DISCUSSION: After excluding iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, and other possible agents, we suspected that the hematologic effects might have resulted from pyrolytic products of CFC- 12 and Halon 1211, which may contain phosgene, among other products. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acute transient hematologic effects observed in the exposed residents were associated with the incident of leakage of mixed fire-extinguisher gases and were most likely caused by a small amount of pyrolytic products, probably phosgene. Nine months after the exposure, we found a significant improvement in the abnormalities without any specific treatment...|$|E
40|$|The pearl river delta (PRD) {{region is}} one of the most {{important}} industrial and manufacturing centers of China and the world. In order to explore the regional mixing ratios of halocarbons in the PRD atmosphere and to reconcile the major halocarbon emission sources, air samples were collected in an urban site in Guangzhou City, a semi-urban site in Panyu and a rural site on Dinghu Mountain, as well as roadside sites and vehicular tunnels of the PRD in 2001 and 2004. The samples were analyzed for a variety of carbon-containing compounds. The results revealed elevated regional mixing ratios of most halocarbons, especially trichloroethene (C 2 HCl 3), methyl iodide (CH 3 I), tetrachloroethene (C 2 Cl 4), <b>bromochlorodifluoromethane</b> (Halon- 1211, CBrClF 2), 1 -dichloro- 1, 1 -fluoroethane (HCFC- 142 b, CH 3 CClF 2) and trichloromethane (CHCl 3) when compared with the background levels of the western Pacific and East Asian coast, and the Northern Hemisphere suggesting that there are significant sources of halocarbons in the PRD region. Higher dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC- 12, CCl 2 F 2), 1, 1, 1 -trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC- 113, CCl 2 FCClF 2), dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2) and tribromomethane (CHBr 3) mixing ratios were found in the tunnels and roadside samples when compared with the ambient samples. In these samples, CH 2 Br 2 and CHBr 3 correlated well with each other and methyl bromide (CH 3 Br) suggesting they are associated with exhaust emissions from vehicles running on leaded gasoline. High levels of methyl halides: methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl), CH 3 Br and CH 3 I, and CH 2 Br 2, bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl 2), CHBr 3 and dimethyl sulfide (C 2 H 6 S, DMS) were simultaneously observed in the oceanic air masses that originated from the coastal areas of southeast China and had passed over the Pearl River Estuary. Good correlations were found between CH 2 Br 2 and CHBr 3 with linear regression slopes of 0. 17 and 0. 15 for the Dinghu Mountain and Guangzhou City samples, respectively, and between CH 3 I and CHBr 3, and DMS suggesting that emissions from the coastal territorial ecosystems of the PRD are important sources of the methyl halides, CH 2 Br 2, CHBrCl 2, CHBr 3 and DMS observed.
