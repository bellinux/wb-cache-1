5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing at-grade intersections {{and improving the}} highway to 400-series standards. Planning for this work initially <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1990s with the EA for the section north of the Speed River, {{which resulted in the}} construction of the Wellington Street interchange. The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair Road intersection were the first projects completed as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, a {{diplomatic}} crisis emerged in Chile, {{otherwise known as}} the Baltimore Crisis. The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile; his action increased tensions between Chile and the United States, which <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the War of the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> eighteenth century. By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, and after World War II, the whale population increases to 33 percent of the pre-whaling population. Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales {{were killed by the}} various whaling nations in the nineteenth century, while in the twentieth century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.|$|E

5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and {{template}} for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} historians <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type {{was really the}} work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but {{he died in the}} First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E
5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
5|$|Farther east in Utica, {{construction}} <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1950s {{on a new}} arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through {{the city}} center. The new roadway bypassed NY5, which was initially routed on Genesee Street and Herkimer Road through Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment north of River Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964, at which time it became part of a rerouted NY5 and NY12. Two portions of Genesee Street, from NY12 in New Hartford to the Utica city line and from NY5S to Herkimer Road in Utica, remain state maintained to this day as unsigned NY921E and NY921C, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the Syracuse {{suburbs of}} Camillus and Geddes, NY5 was {{initially}} routed on West Genesee Street between {{the villages of}} Camillus and Solvay. Construction on a bypass of this segment of NY5 <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1970s and was completed between NY695 and Genesee Street by 1977. By the following year, the freeway was open to traffic up to Hinsdale Road; however, NY5 remained on Genesee Street between Hinsdale and the Solvay village limits. The remainder of the Camillus Bypass was completed , at which time NY5 was realigned to follow the freeway. Genesee Street is now largely maintained by Onondaga County as CR98; however, two portions of the street remain state maintained. Near {{the western end of}} the expressway, the former routing of NY5 became part of an extended NY174. Between the Camillus town line and the eastern end of the bypass, Genesee Street is unsigned NY930W.|$|E

5|$|Jarrow, {{situated}} on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, {{as the home of}} Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little changed in the remote rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.|$|E
5|$|One of Johor's main rivals at {{the time}} was the Sultanate of Aceh, a {{cosmopolitan}} entrepòt and centre for religious and ideological learning. Aceh's rise to power <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1500s: during the following decades the sultanate expanded its territories in Sumatra and sought military assistance from Suleiman the Magnificent in a quest to banish the Portuguese from Malacca. In 1613 Aceh launched an attack of Johor, destroying its capital and taking as prisoners the sultan, his family and entourage. The Seri Rambai was captured during the assault: a Javi inscription on the gun's barrel records the event and the senior Acehnese officers involved.|$|E

The film was eventually dubbed in Tamil and released in 1961 as Akbar, but that version's commercial failure resulted in the abandonment of the planned English dubbing, for which British actors were considered. Asif was accompanied by an extensive crew, which included his assistant directors S. T. Zaidi, Khalid Akhtar, Surinder Kapoor (assisting primarily for the English version), and five others. Additional crew members included cinematographer R. D. Mathur, choreographer Lachhu Maharaj, production manager Aslam Noori, cameraman M. D. Ayub, editor Dharamavir, makeup artists P. G.
