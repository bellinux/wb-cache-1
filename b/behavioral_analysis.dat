Four psychiatric experts from the Serbsky Institute also testified as {{to the results of}} a <b>behavioral</b> <b>analysis</b> they had conducted on Chikatilo in May, following the initial adjournment of the trial.

25|$|A 2009 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving {{a total of}} 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews. Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD {{in the areas of}} cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior. In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI. Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI. Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site randomized trials are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism. Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied <b>behavioral</b> <b>analysis</b> (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.|$|E

[...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974.

40|$|A <b>behavioral</b> {{testability}} <b>analysis</b> {{technique is}} proposed for early prediction of testability by analyzing behavioral specifications written in VHDL. The technique extracts functional properties by {{an analysis of}} variable range, statement hardness and dependency relation between variables of the specification. It predicts the testability for the whole design with a low computational cost. Another feature of the proposed technique is that it reduces the number of design iterations since the hard-to-test parts of the design are grouped and several testability improvement techniques can be applied in each design iteration. Experimental {{results show that the}} <b>behavioral</b> testability <b>analysis</b> technique predicts the hard-to-test parts accurately and efficiently. 1.

This paper presents a novel approach based on <b>behavioral</b> graph <b>analysis</b> to study social behavior of Internet application traffic based on bipartite graphs and one-mode projection graphs. Through a vector of graph properties including coefficient clustering that capture social behaviors of end hosts, we discover the inherent clustered groups of Internet applications that not only exhibit similar social behavior of end hosts but also have similar characteristics in the aggregated traffic. In addition, we demonstrate the usage of the proposed <b>behavioral</b> graph <b>analysis</b> in detecting emerging applications and anomalous traffic patterns towards Internet applications. I...|$|R
