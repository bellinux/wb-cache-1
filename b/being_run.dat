5|$|On May 27, 2005, the 9 {{train was}} {{discontinued}} and all 1 trains {{began to make}} all stops. The skip-stop service made less sense by 2005 because of the increased number of trains <b>being</b> <b>run</b> and the higher ridership at the bypassed stations; the MTA estimated that eliminating skip-stop service only added 2 to 3 minutes of travel time (for passengers at the northernmost stations at 242nd Street and 238th Street) but many passengers would see trains frequencies double, resulting in decreased overall travel time (because of less time waiting for trains).|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Culver Line extension, the BRT's fare was cut from 10 cents to 5 cents, and Coney Island became a much more {{affordable}} vacation area compared to in previous years.

Riders at the new station were promised trains that ran every three minutes during rush hours, but this quickly proved not to be true. In 1923, a reporter for the Brooklyn Standard Union observed that rush hour trains had headways of eight minutes on the Sea Beach Line and fifteen minutes on the West End Line, and that no direct Manhattan service was <b>being</b> <b>run</b> on either the Brighton or Culver Lines during rush hours.|$|E

Grossman's Sons unsuccessfully prevented the sale of their securing collateral, a debtor's home, to the debtor's daughter. In January 1912, J.
