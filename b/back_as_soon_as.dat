'Wake up and entertain, or you could be drawing {{unemployment}} benefits next week'...remind yourself that England's selectors dropped first Ken Barrington and later Geoff Boycott from England sides after they had refused to get a move on. Isolated punishments such as these clearly were not effective. Those drawbridges of defences were brought <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> it was thought to be politic.|$|E

2500|$|Bryson's {{start to}} the season was {{hampered}} by an injury which he {{picked up in the}} opening game of the season away to Bolton Wanderers on 8 August. He was taken off in the 21st minute suffering from what was later revealed to be a stretched ligament on the inside of his knee and was ruled out for 2 to 4 weeks. However, he was ruled out for longer than first thought; six weeks later, new Derby manager Paul Clement reported that Bryson was still feeling some discomfort in his knee, which meant he was [...] "finding some things difficult to do relating to shooting and long passing". A week later, on 1 October, Clement revealed that Bryson had had injections in his knee to speed up the healing process and would thus miss training for a fortnight to allow his knee to settle. Clement said that [...] "I think we all underestimated the severity of the injury he picked up on the opening day just because of his character. He wanted to push and push to get <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible but you have to allow the healing process to take place." [...] Bryson returned to training on 16 October, played 90 minutes in an under-21 match against Newcastle United on 26 October and finally made his return to first team action on 31 October, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute for new signing Jacob Butterfield in a 3–0 win against Rotherham.|$|E
