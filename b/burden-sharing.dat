25|$|Schlesinger devoted much {{attention}} to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, citing the need to strengthen its conventional capabilities. He rejected the old assumption that NATO did not need a direct counter to Warsaw Pact conventional forces because it could rely on tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, noting that the approximate nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviets in the 1970s made this stand inappropriate. He rejected the argument that NATO could not afford a conventional counterweight to Warsaw Pact forces. In his discussions with NATO leaders, Schlesinger promoted the concept of <b>burden-sharing,</b> stressing the troubles that the United States faced in the mid-1970s because of an unfavorable balance of international payments. He urged qualitative improvements in NATO forces, including equipment standardization, and an increase in defense spending by NATO governments of up to five percent of their gross national product.|$|E
2500|$|The Dublin {{regulation}} {{determines the}} EU {{member state responsible}} to examine an asylum application to prevent asylum applicants in the EU from [...] "asylum shopping", where applicants send their applications for asylum to numerous EU member states {{to get the best}} [...] "deal," [...] instead of just having [...] "safety countries", or [...] "asylum orbiting", where no member state takes responsibility for an asylum seeker. By default (when no family reasons or humanitarian grounds are present), the first member state that an asylum seeker entered and in which they have been fingerprinted is responsible. If the asylum seeker then moves to another member state, they can be transferred back to the member state they first entered. This has led many to criticise the Dublin rules for placing too much responsibility for asylum seekers on member states on the EU's external borders (like Italy, Greece and Hungary), instead of devising a <b>burden-sharing</b> system among EU states.|$|E

The programme was very varied with speakers {{from a wide range}} of countries delivering presentations on developments within their own areas or specialisation. The 2004 Conference theme “Map Collections and GIS or Digital Data - the death of the paper Map?” in some parts echoed the 2002 conference that had started to look at the impact that digital data and archives were beginning to make on collections across the continent. The title was intentionally partially controversial in questioning the death of the paper map, although the subsequent discussions did identify that whilst digital data is certainly all pervasive in the library arena, the demands for traditional paper mapping continue unabated. One of the major themes that came out of many of the presentations was a desire to better understand the scope and complexity of digital data and also the desire to share experiences wherever possible to ensure that the collections were not all going in different directions. There was also a strong desire to <b>burden-share</b> wherever possible, primarily to avoid the duplication of effort where the same material was under consideration for digitisation either as a means of improving access or as a means of preservation...|$|R

40|$|This article compares European Union (EU) <b>burden-sharing</b> in {{security}} governance distinguishing between assurance, prevention, protection, and compellence policies. We employ joint-product models {{and examine the}} variation {{in the level of}} publicness, the asymmetry of the distribution of costs and benefits, and aggregation technologies in each policy domain. Joint-product models predict equal <b>burden-sharing</b> for protection and assurance because of their respective weakest-link and summation aggregation technologies with symmetric costs. Prevention is also characterized by the technology of summation, but asymmetry of costs implies uneven <b>burden-sharing.</b> Uneven <b>burden-sharing</b> is predicted for compellence because it has the largest asymmetry of costs and a best-shot aggregation technology. Evaluating <b>burden-sharing</b> relative to a country's ability to contribute, Kendall tau-tests examine the rank-correlation between security burden and the capacity of EU member states. These tests show that the smaller EU members disproportionately shoulder the costs of assurance and protection; wealthier EU members carry a somewhat disproportionate burden in the provision of prevention, and larger EU members in the provision of compellence. When analyzing contributions relative to expected benefits, asymmetric marginal costs can largely explain uneven <b>burden-sharing.</b> The main conclusion is that the aggregated burden of collective security governance in the EU is shared quite evenly. © 2009 The IO Foundation...|$|E

This thesis conceptualises <b>burden-sharing</b> {{as an international}} norm. The implementation of international norms, however, depends upon domestic political processes, actors and structures. The thesis therefore conducts a critical discourse analysis of the Norwegian political field, until late September 2015. The analysis uncovers three dominant discourses in the political field - the humanitarian discourse, the cost-and-capacity discourse, and the nation-state discourse. These discourses {{take part in a}} discursive battle over conflicting norms, meanings and values. The outcome of this battle, in turn, shapes the political space for <b>burden-sharing.</b> In particular, the hierarchical relationship between the different discourses has significant consequences for Norwegian <b>burden-sharing</b> initiatives.

40|$|My Major Research Paper is an {{examination}} of non-Jewish African asylum seekers entering Israel from the Sinai Peninsula. I argue {{that the best way}} of solving the current crisis is through the implementation of a robust <b>burden-sharing</b> scheme. My research paper is split into three sections. The first section examines the ethical dimensions of non-Jewish asylum seekers in Israel. I argue that Israel’s founding as a Zionist state, meant to protect Jews from harm, gives it special responsibilities to African asylum seekers fleeing persecution. The best way to fulfill this responsibility is through the principle of humanitarianism. The second section examines a brief history of refugee protection and Israel’s status in it, starting with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. It then examines how Israel’s system of refugee protection attempts to meet its international obligations to African asylum seekers. Finally, the third section examines a solution to the influx of African asylum seekers – <b>burden-sharing,</b> a legal mechanism by which host countries can send refugees to safe, third countries. I argue that <b>burden-sharing</b> remains one of the few durable solutions available to the State of Israel, but Israel is ultimately failing to implement this policy because it lacks a refugee determination system. To justify this claim, I examine <b>burden-sharing</b> in international law, followed by an account of different jurisdictions application of <b>burden-sharing,</b> including the European Union. Finally, I examine how <b>burden-sharing</b> can be theoretically applied to non-Jewish African asylum seekers in Israel...|$|E
