25|$|The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement of 1932 {{mandated}} {{the change}} of broadcast frequencies {{of a number of}} radio stations to cause less interference in Canada and Mexico. Station WEVD was among those affected, forced to move from 1300 to 1330 kilohertz. At this time WEVD shared its <b>broadcast</b> <b>frequency</b> with another station, WHAP/WFAB — a station which was ultimately sold to WEVD and eliminated through merger in 1938.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally radio {{programmes}} were {{broadcast on}} different frequencies via AM and FM, {{and the radio}} had to be tuned into each frequency, as needed. This used up a comparatively large amount of spectrum for {{a relatively small number}} of stations, limiting listening choice.

25|$|Originally {{known as}} 2XB this station was first started in March 1958 {{broadcasting}} on 840AM. The stations call sign {{was changed to}} 2ZD in 1968 and in 1978 the station moved to 846am. The station was known on air during the 1980s and 1990s as Radio Wairarapa before becoming 90.1 Wairarapa FM in 1999, when the station began broadcasting on 90.1FM. In 2001 the station was rebranded as Classic Hits Wairarapa. The <b>broadcast</b> <b>frequency</b> was changed to 90.3FM in October 2010.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1922, WWV's purpose {{shifted to}} {{broadcasting}} standard frequency signals. These signals were desperately needed by other broadcasters, because equipment limitations at the time meant that the broadcasters could not stay on their assigned frequencies. Testing began on January 29, 1923, and frequencies from 200 to 545kHz were <b>broadcast.</b> <b>Frequency</b> broadcasts officially began on March 6, 1923. The frequencies were accurate to [...] "better than three-tenths of one percent." [...] At first, the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next, using a wavemeter. The first quartz resonators (that stabilized the frequency generating oscillators) were invented in the mid-1920s, and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV's frequency broadcasts.|$|E

The transmitter site would also be moved very slightly to the west and the antenna raised to [...] in height above average terrain. The station received a new construction permit to authorize the change on September 17, 2007. The station began licensed operation on 100.1MHz on February 17, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{two other}} {{stations}} shared the <b>broadcast</b> <b>frequency</b> with WEVD: [...] WHAZ, {{the radio station}} of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, which was on-air only on Monday evenings, and WBBR (later called WPOW) also of New York, New York, owned by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, publishing arm of the religious group Jehovah's Witnesses. From {{the time of the}} 1932 broadcasting agreement through the 1970s the Socialist and Yiddish-language WEVD continued to share its station frequency with the religious group, transmitting 86 hours per week while leaving Sundays and early mornings until 8 am to WPOW, and Monday nights to WHAZ. [...] WHAZ was sold to the owners of WPOW in 1973 and turned into a non-interfering, daytime-only station, with WPOW taking the old WHAZ Monday night hours.|$|E

[...] The first add in Bosworth's magazine for a Bosworth radio program was in January 1930, indicating that his radio evangelism started in either late 1929 or early 1930. [...] He began with a program called the [...] "Sunshine Hour". [...] Bosworth eventually established [...] "The National Radio Revival Missionary Crusaders" [...] as a nonprofit corporation in Illinois. [...] By the early to mid-1930s he was broadcasting regularly over radio stations in the Chicago area, including WJJD. [...] Bosworth's increased radio ministry in Chicago appears to coincide with Paul Rader's reduced <b>broadcast</b> <b>frequency.</b> [...] Due to financial problems, Paul Rader's last evangelistic broadcasts in Chicago were in 1933. [...] Bosworth continued to broadcast well into the 1940s. [...] There is a general gap in the information available on F. F. Bosworth and his radio ministry from the early 1930s to the mid-1940s, with the one available magazine of his from 1942 indicating that he was broadcasting from several stations across the country, and a 1963 article providing a general overview of Bosworth's radio ministry.|$|E
