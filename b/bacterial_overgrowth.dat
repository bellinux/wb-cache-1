25|$|The {{condition}} that predisposed {{the patient to}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> should also be treated. For example, if the <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> is caused by chronic pancreatitis, the patient should be treated with coated pancreatic enzyme supplements.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestine}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> (SIBO), also termed bacterial overgrowths, {{or small}} bowel <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> syndrome (SBBOS), is a disorder of excessive bacterial {{growth in the}} small intestine. Unlike the colon (or large bowel), which is rich with bacteria, the small bowel usually has fewer than 10,000 organisms per millilitre. Patients with <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> typically develop symptoms including nausea, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss and malabsorption, which {{is caused by a}} number of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms, {{many of which are}} also found in other conditions, making the {{diagnosis}} challenging at times. Many of the symptoms are due to malabsorption of nutrients due to the effects of bacteria which either metabolize nutrients or cause inflammation of the small bowel, impairing absorption. The symptoms of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> include nausea, flatus, constipation, bloating, abdominal distension, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, fatigue, and weakness. SIBO also causes an increased permeability of the small intestine. Some patients may lose weight. Children with <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> may develop malnutrition and have difficulty attaining proper growth. Steatorrhea, a sticky type of diarrhea where fats are not properly absorbed and spill into the stool, may also occur.|$|E
30|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) or mucoviscidosis is a multi-system monogenetic disease {{caused by}} mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene leading to abnormal folding {{and function of}} the CFTR protein, which is a chloride/bicarbonate channel. Absence of a functional protein leads to dehydration and acidification of glandular and other secretions. Lung manifestations are abnormal mucus viscosity and rheology, abnormal mucociliary clearance with propensity to bacterial infection, and increased inflammation [1]. Gastrointestinal manifestations of CF include pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, and abnormal intestinal motility often associated with <b>bacterial</b> intestinal <b>overgrowth.</b> Intestinal obstruction in the newborn period and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in older patients can occur secondary to abnormal viscosity and probably also due to intestinal mucus obstruction. Metabolic abnormalities that are {{not considered to be}} a consequence of malabsorption have been reported for essential fatty acids, for instance docosahexaenoic acid and linoleic acid [2], and cholesterol and triglyceride pathways [3].|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} in a two-part series of {{articles}} dealing with orthopedic infections, and will examine osteomyelitis as a clinical condition ·from its initial development through to its clinical resolution. Osteomyelitis is a term describing an inflammatory condition which involves the periosteum, cortex, and/or medullary cavity. While fungal, viral and parasitic invasion of bone are known, it is <b>bacterial</b> contamination and <b>overgrowth</b> that most commonly results in osteomyelitis.

40|$|Certain {{forms of}} dental decay and {{periodontal}} disease {{appear to be}} due to specific <b>bacterial</b> infections following <b>overgrowth</b> of certain indige-nous plaque bacteria, i. e., the specific plaque hypo-thesis. If so, then antimicrobial treatment based on a diagnosis of elevated levels or proportions of these organisms shiould be considered. Such treat-ment cannot be administered according to con-cepts of the non-specific plaque hypothesis. A treatment philosophy is presented which is based upon considerations long established in medical infections following overgrowth of certain indige-nous plaque bacteria, i. e., the specific plaque hypo-microbial {{to the site of the}} infection for periods long enough to suppress or destroy the pathogenic agent.

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> {{is made by}} a number of techniques, with the gold standard being an aspirate from the jejunum that grows in excess of 105 bacteria per millilitre. Risk factors for the development of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> include dysmotility; anatomical disturbances in the bowel, including fistulae, diverticula and blind loops created after surgery, and resection of the ileo-cecal valve; gastroenteritis-induced alterations to the small intestine; and the use of certain medications, including proton pump inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|In older adults, {{small bowel}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> is {{associated}} with a higher frequency of diarrhea, a lower body mass index, and a significantly lower serum albumin concentration.|$|E
25|$|The small {{intestine}} can also become involved, leading to <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> and malabsorption of bile salts, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. The colon can be involved, {{and can cause}} pseudo-obstruction or ischemic colitis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> {{intestinal}} <b>overgrowth</b> syndrome (SIBO) {{treatment is}} based on antibiotics. Probiotics {{have been shown to}} give similar results, whilst no study is available about prebiotics. This study evaluated the addition of probiotics or prebiotics to antibiotics on SIBO symptoms in a 6 -month follow-up. We enrolled 40 patients (14 males and 26 females) reporting abdominal compliant without gastrointestinal diseases/alarm symptoms. SIBO was diagnosed by the agreement of lactulose and glucose breath tests. Patients were randomly divided into two groups homogeneous for sex and age: group 1 received Rifaximin 400 mg/day for 7 days/month followed by Lactobacillus casei for 7 days more and group 2 antibiotic followed by short chain fructo-oligosaccharides. All patients recorded a questionnaire for subjective symptom evaluation according to Rome III criteria and Bristol scale for stool characters before the study and after 6 months. Statistics: Student's t and Fisher's exact tests. In group 1, a significant improvement was obtained in 5 out of 6 symptoms, whilst in group 2 in 4 out of 6 symptoms (nausea and number of bowel movements failed to improve). Despite we observed a trend of probiotics to be more effective than prebiotics, the difference in the percentage of improved symptoms was not significant (83, 3 % vs 66. 6 %; p= 0. 57). Our preliminary data show a good outcome with sequential antibioticprobiotic/ prebiotic administration in patients with SIBO...|$|R
40|$|Hyperhidrosis is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by perspiration {{in excess of the}} physiologic amount necessary to maintain thermal homeostasis. primary or idiopathic hyperhidrosis and secondary hyperhidrosis are the two main categories. Patients can have excessive sweating either in a localized area (focal) or over the entire body (generalized). Primary disease is usually focal, affecting the soles, palms, and axillae in various combinations and with varying degrees of severity. Secondary hyperhidrosis can be generalized or focal. In secondary hyperhidrosis the symptoms are a consequence of certain medical condition, example diabetes, or the use of certain drugs, example nortriptyline. Hyperhidrosis can have very significant effects on patients lives, causing physical discomfort, social embarrassment and impacting negatively occupational and daily activities.

40|$|Sepsis is an {{inflammatory}} condition that {{is associated with}} reduced propulsive gastrointestinal motility (ileus). A therapeutic option to treat sepsis is to promote intestinal propulsion preventing <b>bacterial</b> stasis, <b>overgrowth</b> and translocation. Recent evidence suggests that anti-oxidants improve sepsis-induced ileus. Cannabidiol, a non-psychotropic component of Cannabis sativa, exerts strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects without binding to cannabinoid CB(1) or CB(2) receptors. Cannabidiol also regulates the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) which is the main enzyme involved in endocannabinoid breakdown and which modulates gastrointestinal motility. Because of the therapeutic potential of cannabidiol in several pathologies, we investigated its effect on sepsis-induced ileus and on cannabinoid receptor and FAAH expression in the mouse intestine. Sepsis was induced by treating mice with lipopolysaccharides for 18 h. Sepsis led to a decrease in gastric emptying and intestinal transit. Cannabidiol further reduced gastrointestinal motility in septic mice but did not affect gastrointestinal motility in control mice. A low concentration of the CB(1) antagonist AM 251 did not affect gastrointestinal motility in control mice but reversed the effect of cannabidiol in septic mice. Sepsis was associated with a selective upregulation of intestinal CB(1) receptors without affecting CB(2) receptor expression and with increased FAAH expression. The increase in FAAH expression was completely reversed by cannabidiol but not affected by AM 251. Our results show that sepsis leads to an imbalance of the endocannabinoid system in the mouse intestine. Despite its proven anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cannabidiol may be of limited use for the treatment of sepsis-induced ileus...|$|R

25|$|Small bowel <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> {{syndrome}} is treated with an elemental diet or antibiotics, {{which may be}} given in a cyclic fashion to prevent tolerance to the antibiotics, sometimes followed by prokinetic drugs to prevent recurrence if dysmotility is a suspected cause.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{evolution}} of duodenal lymphocytosis (DL), a condition characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy/histology for abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, weakness or other extraintestinal features compatible with celiac disease (CD) were included. Evaluation of IELs infiltrate in duodenal biopsy samples {{was carried out by}} CD 3 -immunohistochemistry and expressed as number of positive cells/ 100 enterocytes. Diagnostic agreement on the IELs count was tested by calculating the weighted k coefficient. All patients underwent serological detection of autoantibodies associated with CD: IgG and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase and endomysium. Each patient underwent further investigations to clarify the origin of DL at baseline and/or in the course of 2 years of follow-up every six months. Autoimmune thyroiditis, intestinal infections, parasitic diseases, <b>bacterial</b> intestinal <b>overgrowth,</b> hypolactasia and wheat allergy were detected. Colonoscopy and enteric magnetic resonance imaging were performed when necessary. Risk factors affecting the final diagnosis were detected by multinomial logistic regression and expressed as OR. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (16 males, 69 females, aged 34. 1 ± 12. 5 years) were followed up for a mean period of 21. 7 ± 11. 7 mo. At baseline, endoscopy/duodenal biopsy, CD 3 immunohistochemistry revealed: > 25 IELs/ 100 enterocytes in 22 subjects, 15 - 25 IELs in 37 and 25 (OR = 1640. 4) or 15 - 25 (OR = 16. 95), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ 2 / 8 (OR = 140. 85) or DQA 1 ∗ 0501 (OR = 15. 36), diarrhea (OR = 5. 56) and weakness (OR = 11. 57). GS was associated with IELs 15 - 25 (OR = 28. 59), autoimmune thyroiditis (OR = 87. 63), folate deficiency (OR = 48. 53) and diarrhea (OR = 54. 87). CONCLUSION: DL may have a multifactorial origin but the IELs infiltrate and HLA are strong predictive factors for CD development and a clinical diagnosis of GS...|$|R
25|$|Probiotics are {{bacterial}} preparations that {{alter the}} bacterial flora in the bowel {{to cause a}} beneficial effect. Animal {{research has demonstrated that}} probiotics have barrier enhancing, antibacterial, immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects which may have a positive effect in the management of SIBO in humans. Lactobacillus casei {{has been found to be}} effective in improving breath hydrogen scores after 6 weeks of treatment presumably by suppressing levels of a small intestinal <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> of fermenting bacteria. The multi-strain preparation VSL#3 was found to be effective in suppressing SIBO. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei have all demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment and management of SIBO. Conversely, Lactobacillus fermentum and Saccharomyces boulardii have been found to be ineffective. A combination of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus has been found to be effective in suppressing <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> of abnormal gas producing organisms in the small intestine.|$|E
25|$|Colon cancer, {{inflammatory}} bowel disease, thyroid disorders, and giardiasis can all feature abnormal defecation and abdominal pain. Less common {{causes of}} this symptom profile are carcinoid syndrome, microscopic colitis, <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth,</b> and eosinophilic gastroenteritis; IBS is, however, a common presentation, and testing for these conditions would yield low numbers of positive results, {{so it is}} considered difficult to justify the expense.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> (SIBO) {{was demonstrated}} to have greater prevalence in rosacea patients and treating it with locally acting antibiotics led to rosacea lesion improvement in two studies. Conversely in rosacea {{patients who were}} SIBO negative, antibiotic therapy had no effect. The effectiveness of treating SIBO in rosacea patients may suggest that gut bacteria {{play a role in}} the pathogenesis of rosacea lesions.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> {{occurs with}} greater frequency {{in patients who}} {{have been diagnosed with}} IBS compared to healthy controls. SIBO is most common in diarrhea-predominate IBS but also occurs in constipation-predominant IBS more frequently than healthy controls. Symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation among others. IBS {{may be the result of}} the immune system interacting abnormally with gut microbiota resulting in an abnormal cytokine signalling profile.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a {{syndrome}} {{caused by}} a malformation of the digestive system, characterized by a severe impairment {{in the ability of}} the intestines to push and assimilate. Symptoms include daily abdominal and stomach pain, nausea, severe distension, vomiting, heartburn, dysphagia, diarrhea, constipation, dehydration and malnutrition. There is no cure for intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Different types of surgery and treatment managing life-threatening complications such as ileus and volvulus, intestinal stasis which lead to <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth,</b> and resection of affected or dead parts of the gut may be needed. Many patients require parenteral nutrition.|$|E
25|$|The healthy vagina of a {{woman of}} child-bearing age is acidic, with a pH {{normally}} ranging between 3.8 and 4.5.; {{this is due to}} the degradation of glycogen to the lactic acid by enzymes secreted by the Döderlein's bacillus, which is a normal commensal of the vagina. The acidity delays or slows the growth of many strains of pathogenic microbes. An increased pH of the vagina (with a commonly used cut-off of pH 4.5 or higher) can be caused by <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth,</b> as occurs in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, or rupture of membranes in pregnancy. There are different types of bacterial vaginosis.|$|E
25|$|An {{elemental}} diet {{taken for}} two weeks is an alternative to antibiotics for eliminating SIBO. An elemental diet works via providing nutrition for the individual while depriving the bacteria of a food source. Additional treatment options {{include the use of}} prokinetic drugs such as 5-HT4 receptor agonists or motilin agonists to extend the SIBO free period after treatment with an elemental diet or antibiotics. A diet void of certain foods that feed the bacteria can help alleviate the symptoms. For example, if the symptoms are caused by <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> feeding on indigestible carbohydrate rich foods, following a FODMAP restriction diet may help.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} laboratory or imaging {{test can}} be performed to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis involves excluding conditions that produce IBS-like symptoms, and then following a procedure to categorize the patient's symptoms. Ruling out parasitic infections, lactose intolerance, small intestinal <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth,</b> and celiac disease is recommended for all patients before a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is made. In patients over 50 years old, they are recommended to undergo a screening colonoscopy. IBS sufferers {{are at increased risk}} of being given inappropriate surgeries such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hysterectomy due to their IBS symptoms being misdiagnosed as other medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} IBS are not clear. Theories include {{combinations}} of gut–brain axis problems, gut motility disorders, pain sensitivity, infections including small intestinal <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth,</b> neurotransmitters, genetic factors, and food sensitivity. Onset may {{be triggered by}} an intestinal infection, or stressful life event. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms {{in the absence of}} worrisome features. Worrisome features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, or a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Other conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bile acid malabsorption, and colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} for detection of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> is the aspiration of more than 105 bacteria per millilitre from the small bowel. The normal small bowel has less than 104 bacteria per millilitre. Some experts however, consider aspiration of more than 103 positive if the flora is predominately colonic type bacteria as these types of bacteria are considered pathological in excessive numbers in the small intestine. The reliability of aspiration in the diagnosis of SIBO has been questioned as SIBO can be patchy and the reproducibility can be as low as 38 percent. Breath tests have their own reliability problems with {{a high rate of}} false positive. Some doctors factor in a patients' response to treatment as part of the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Total {{food intake}} and {{absorbance}} rate of food will rapidly decline after gastric bypass surgery, {{and the number}} of acid-producing cells lining the stomach increases. Doctors often prescribe acid-lowering medications to counteract the high acidity levels. Many patients then experience a condition known as achlorhydria, where there is not enough acid in the stomach. As a result of the low acidity levels, patients can develop an overgrowth of bacteria. A study conducted on 43 post-operative patients revealed that almost all of the patients tested positive for a hydrogen breath test, which indicated an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> causes the gut ecology to change and induces nausea and vomiting. Recurring nausea and vomiting eventually change the absorbance rate of food, contributing to the vitamin and nutrition deficiencies common in post-operative gastric bypass patients.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 10 {{percent of}} IBS cases are {{triggered}} by an acute gastroenteritis infection. Genetic defects {{relating to the}} innate immune system and epithelial barrier as well as high stress and anxiety levels appear to {{increase the risk of}} developing post-infectious IBS. Post-infectious IBS usually manifests itself as the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Evidence has demonstrated that the release of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines during acute enteric infection causes increased gut permeability leading to translocation of the commensal bacteria across the epithelial barrier resulting in significant damage to local tissues, which can result in chronic gut abnormalities in sensitive individuals. However, increased gut permeability is strongly associated with IBS regardless of whether IBS was initiated by an infection or not. A link between small intestinal <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> and tropical sprue has been proposed {{to be involved in the}} aetiology of post-infectious IBS.|$|E
2500|$|However, some {{physicians}} {{suggest that}} if the suspicion of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> is high enough, the best diagnostic test is a trial of treatment. [...] If the symptoms improve, an empiric diagnosis of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> can be made.|$|E
2500|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can cause <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth.</b> [...] Chronic pancreatitis, or {{inflammation}} of the pancreas can cause <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> through mechanisms linked to this. [...] The use of immunosuppressant medications to treat other conditions can cause this, as evidenced from animal models. [...] Other causes include inherited immunodeficiency conditions, such as common variable immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency, and hypogammaglobulinemia.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{patients}} with symptoms of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> will undergo gastroscopy, or visualization {{of the stomach}} and duodenum with an endoscopic camera. [...] Biopsies of the small bowel in <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> can mimic those of celiac disease, making the diagnosis more challenging. [...] Findings include blunting of villi, hyperplasia of crypts and an increased number of lymphocytes in the lamina propria.|$|E
2500|$|Breath {{tests have}} been {{developed}} to test for <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth,</b> based on bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates to hydrogen and/or methane, or based on the detection of by-products of digestion of carbohydrates that are not usually metabolized. [...] The hydrogen breath test involves having the patient fast for a minimum of 12 hours then having them drink a substrate usually glucose or lactulose, then measuring expired hydrogen and methane concentrations typically over a period of 2–3 hours. [...] It compares well to jejunal aspirates in making the diagnosis of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth.</b> [...] 13C and 14C based tests have also been developed based on the bacterial metabolism of D-xylose. [...] Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids. [...] The glycocholic acid breath test involves the administration of the bile acid 14C glychocholic acid, and the detection of 14CO2, which would be elevated in <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen-positive {{patients}} were then given a 10-day course of rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic {{that does not}} leave the digestive tract and therefore does not enter the circulation or reach the skin. [...] 96% of patients experienced a complete remission of rosacea symptoms that lasted beyond 9 months. [...] These {{patients were}} also negative when retested for <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth.</b> [...] In the 4% of patients that experienced relapse, {{it was found that}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> had returned. [...] These patients were given a second course of rifaximin which again cleared rosacea symptoms and normalized hydrogen excretion.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{species of}} {{bacteria}} are more {{commonly found in}} aspirates of the jejunum taken from patients with <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth.</b> [...] The most common isolates are Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus species.|$|E
2500|$|Intestinal {{bacteria}} {{may play}} a causal role in the dermatological condition rosacea. [...] A recent study subjected patients to a hydrogen breath test to detect the occurrence of SIBO. [...] It was found that significantly more patients were hydrogen-positive than controls indicating the presence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> (47% v. 5%, p<0.001).|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{people are}} more {{predisposed}} {{to the development of}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>overgrowth</b> because of certain risk factors. [...] These factors can be grouped into three categories: (1) disordered motility or movement of the small bowel or anatomical changes that lead to stasis, (2) disorders in the immune system and (3) conditions that cause more bacteria from the colon to enter the small bowel.|$|E
