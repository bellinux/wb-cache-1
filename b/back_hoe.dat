5000|$|Despite the {{problems}} {{and despite the fact}} that tianguis merchants do not pay taxes, rent or services (however bribes are paid to many city officials) like established businesses do, eliminating them or even moving them is very difficult due to the large number of people they employ and their firm place in the culture. [...] Attempts to remove illegally placed merchants or move tianguis entirely generally meet with protest. For about 34 years, the area around the permanent Mercado Juarez had been the scene of one of the largest tianguis in the city of Toluca, operating more or less every day. On weekends, the number of vendors was as high as 2,800. More than 1,100 police were needed to forcibly remove 560 stands from the triangular plaza in front of Mercado Juarez and the four blocks surrounding it. To prevent the vendors from returning, the entire plaza was <b>back</b> <b>hoed</b> and a large fence installed around the plaza. Police patrolled it and the four-block area for weeks afterwards. While there was no violence, tensions were high and there were verbal protests. The clearing of this tianguis was done to alleviate traffic problems in this part of the city, with vendors offered new space at the site of the old airport. [...] In some areas, such as Tepito in Mexico City, almost the entire neighborhood is employed as informal merchants with even more that come in to sell. This market has a long tradition here and is the largest and most vibrant in the city in the 21st century.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a unique telescope for lidar using a holographic optical element (HOE) as the primary optic. The HOE diffracts 532 nm laser backscatter making a 43 deg angle with a normal to its surface to a focus located 130 cm along the normal. The field of view scans a circle as the HOE rotates about the normal. The detector assembly and baffling remain stationary, compared to conventional scanning lidars in which the entire telescope and detector assembly require steering, or which use a large flat steerable mirror {{in front of the}} telescope to do the pointing. The spectral bandpass of our HOE is 50 nm (FWHM). Light within that bandpass is spectrally dispersed at 0. 6 nm/mm in the focal plane. An aperture stop reduces the bandpass of light reaching the detector from one direction to 1 nm while simultaneously reducing the field of view to 1 mrad. Wavelengths outside the 50 nm spectral bandpass pass undiffracted through HOE to be absorbed by a black <b>backing.</b> Thus, the <b>HOE</b> combines three functions into one optic: the scanning mirror, the focusing mirror, and a narrowband filter...|$|R

40|$|These records {{supplement}} David Bouldin's data {{on water}} quality for samples collected from these wells. Wells on the Harford Teaching and Research Center, College of Agriculture and life Sciences. Installation, measuring point (mp), depth and elevation of monitoring wells 	Several monitoring wells were installed {{under the supervision}} of the USGS (mostly by Allan Randall in the mid 1970 s). Basically a casing was sunk, a 2 inch plastic pipe with a screen at the lower end was installed. The casing was gradually pulled partially and the annular ring between casing and plastic pipe was sealed with clay pellets. Some times a second pipe was installed above this seal, more of the casing was pulled, another seal of clay was installed and finally a heavy duty cast iron pipe was placed around the upper 2 - 3 foot of the exposed plastic pipe as protection. Also a locked cap was placed on top of the protective pipe. The elevation of the top of the plastic pipes was determined relative to a known elevation; this elevation is known as the ?measuring point?. (called the mp). The depth to water is measured by lowering a sensor which rings when the water surface is reached and this depth relative to the mp is recorded as ?depth? in the date files. The elevation of the water surface is recorded as the difference between the mp and depth and this is referred to as ?elevation? in the data files. The depth of the wells is usually expressed as depth from the surface and hence is not as accurate as the mp. Usually the mp is 2. 5 to 3 feet above the surface. 	Additional shallow wells were installed by CALS personnel as follows. A pit was dug by a <b>back</b> <b>hoe,</b> an 1. 5 inch diameter rod was driven into botton of the pit to make a cavity for insertion of a 1 inch diameter plastic pipe fitted with about a 1 foot length of screen inserted into this hole, the void between the hole and sampling pipe was filled with sand and a clay seal placed above this and finally the hole was refilled with original material and packed back to original density.
