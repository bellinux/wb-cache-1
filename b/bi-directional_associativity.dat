At the time, several other software packages such as ArchiCAD and Reflex allowed working with a three-dimensional virtual building model, and allowed individual components to be controlled by parameters (parametric components). Two key differences in Revit were that its parametric components were created using a graphical [...] "family editor" [...] rather than a programming language, and all relationships between components, views, and annotations were captured by the model so that a change to any element would automatically propagate to keep the model consistent. For example, moving a wall would update the neighboring walls, floors, and roofs, correct the placement and values of dimensions and notes, adjust the floor areas reported in schedules, redraw section views, etc., so that the model would remain connected and all documentation would be coordinated. The concept of <b>bi-directional</b> <b>associativity</b> between components, views, and annotations was a distinguishing feature of Revit for many releases. The ease of making changes inspired the name Revit, a contraction of Revise-It. At the heart of Revit is a parametric change propagation engine that relied on a new technology, context-driven parametrics, that was more scalable than the variational and history-driven parametrics used in mechanical CAD software. [...] The term Parametric Building Model was adopted to reflect the fact that changes to parameters drove the whole building model and associated documentation, not just individual components.|$|E

Working like an OpenGL driver, {{it takes all}} of the information of the existing application, streams them on a Windows of Linux PC, or PC cluster, and changes the camera so that the viewpoint is dependent on the tracking system. A user can then utilize a robust set of TechViz XL tools to create a dynamic virtual session with the model. A Virtual session can also be controlled directly from the user's application with changes updating instantly in the virtual system. Finally, <b>bi-directional</b> <b>associativity</b> can be established if the users wish to drive changes from both the system and the application.|$|E
