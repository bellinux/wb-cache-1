5000|$|During the {{discharge}} phase, molten elemental sodium {{at the core}} serves as the anode, meaning that the Na donates electrons to the external circuit. The sodium is separated by a beta-alumina solid electrolyte (<b>BASE)</b> <b>cylinder</b> from the container of molten sulfur, which is fabricated from an inert metal serving as the cathode. The sulfur is absorbed in a carbon sponge. BASE is a good conductor of sodium ions, but a poor conductor of electrons, and thus avoids self-discharge. When sodium gives off an electron, the Na+ ion migrates to the sulfur container. The electron drives an electric current through the molten sodium to the contact, through the electrical load {{and back to the}} sulfur container.

30|$|In {{comparison}} with the degeneracy of elliptic equations at an inner point, the main difficulty in the consideration of the Dirichlet problem to equation (1) is related with the formulation of the boundary value conditions on the <b>bases</b> of <b>cylinder</b> Q, to be precise, with the behavior of boundary functions at the points P_ 0 (0, 0, 0) and P_H(0, 0,H) in which the line of degeneracy crosses the <b>bases</b> of <b>cylinder</b> Q.

40|$|A {{circular}} cylinder {{is one of}} an object, it have fundamental characteristics {{in the field of}} fluid engineering. Typical example, the vibration of structure caused by a shedding vortex. During the past century, many researches are carried out about the flow structure of the surface or wake of the {{circular cylinder}}. In a uniform flow, the circular cylinder can be produce the lift and drag force by the rotating or the circulation. This is called the MUGNUS effect and it is well known. This paper described on the wake control method behind a circular cylinder, which has one and two or four small rotating circular cylinders on a base large circular cylinder. The effectiveness of the wake control by the rotating small cylinders is evaluated by the flow visualization in water channel, the measuring of velocity and pressure distribution behind a <b>base</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the numerical calculation of flow filed around a <b>base</b> <b>cylinder</b> having small rotating cylinders [...] The results of flow visualization clearly suggest that even though in the case of one rotating small cylinder can be take place the MUGNUS effect for a base large cylinder. The flow around a <b>base</b> <b>cylinder</b> is asymmetric. To be symmetric the flow around a <b>base</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the rotating cylinder is need two or four. In the case of two or four rotating cylinders, the flow around a <b>base</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be the potential flow, at the time the speed ratio is from nine to twelve.

40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out in order to study the effect of full-span mini-spoilers on the afterbody vortex drag of a slanted <b>base</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Two different protrusion heights (h/D = 2. 5 % and 5 %) were examined at various chordwise locations along the upsweep. The tests were performed on a slanted base cylindrical model with an afterbody upsweep angle Φ = 28 ° at a test Reynolds number of 200, 000 based on model diameter. Drag measurements, surface pressure measurements and 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry measurements were the main experimental tools utilized within this investigation. Placing the spoilers closer to {{the leading edge of the}} upsweep caused an increased drag due to the separation induced by the spoiler itself, leading to a more diffused vortex, but with a larger circulation at the trailing-edge. Drag reductions were observed when placing the spoiler closer to the trailing-edge, with the optimum location being x′s /c = 87. 5 % resulting in drag reductions of 4. 5 % and 4. 8 % for h/D = 2. 5 % and 5 % heights respectively. This reduction is due to an increase in surface pressure upstream of the spoiler. For the drag reducing spoiler location, the vortex was found to be displaced away from the surface, with the streamlines of the model trailing-edge deflected downwards into the wake of the spoiler, altering the trailing-edge flow. Unsteady aspects are discussed and underlying flow mechanisms are presented using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Further results are also presented for a vortex generator configuration that was examined which may present a useful starting point for future studies. A co-rotating half delta wing type vortex generator placed at an incidence of β = 20 ° at x/c = 20 % with a leading edge sweep of Λ = 70 ° was found to show the most promising results...|$|E
40|$|Finned {{cylinders}} {{are commonly}} {{encountered in the}} design of heat exchangers. Critical to the design and performance of a heat exchanger are the mean and fluctuating loading on the tubes, as they relate to pressure losses across the model and may lead to structural vibrations. The loading characteristics are related to the vortex shedding phenomena in the wakes of finned tubes, which motivates the need to understand their relationship in detail. The flow development and structural loading characteristics of cylinders with equispaced circular fins were studied experimentally in the University of Waterloo water flume facility. Finned cylinders of diameter ratio Df/D = 2. 0, fin thickness ratio t/D = 0. 028 and range of fin pitch ratios 0. 083 ≤ c/D ≤ 1. 0 were investigated using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), and force balance measurements. The Reynolds number ranged from ReDeff = 1020 - 2040 based on the effective diameter of the models, corresponding to the shear layer transition turbulent shedding regime. For c/D = 1. 0, the vortex development resembles that of a uniform <b>base</b> <b>cylinder,</b> besides a region of affected flow near each fin. Further reduction of c/D results in similar scales of vortex formation, but with increased unsteady flapping of the separated shear layers. Following that, for c/D ≤ 0. 083, boundary layer coalescence between the fins leads to the flow redirection and separation at the fin diameter. The generation of lateral vorticity between the fins leads to the progressive weakening of the spanwise shear layers with decreasing c/D. However, the bleeding of low-energy fluid into the near wake from the viscous regions between the fins has a stabilizing effect on the mixing of vorticity during vortex formation, thereby augmenting the structure of turbulence in the wake and inducing stronger wake vortex shedding. Linear increases in the mean drag with increasing fin density are attributed to the independent viscous shear contributions introduced by each finned surface, and the fall off of the linear trend with high fin density is due to the loss of this independence with lateral boundary layer coalescence. The RMS of the fluctuating lift is shown to increase initially for decreasing c/D → 0. 33, as the wake vortices increase in strength and flow unsteadiness increases near the cylinder surface. However, the fluctuating lift is severely diminished for low c/D = 0. 083, with vortex formation displaced much further downstream, despite exhibiting stronger wake vortices. The vortex shedding frequency is shown to decrease with decreasing c/D. A modification of the definition of the Strouhal number based on the cylinders effective diameter is proposed which incorporates Reynolds numbers effects associated with the differences in the added flow blockage created by the boundary layers developing on the fin surfaces. This definition is found to universally collapse the shedding frequency data in the study and literature onto a constant StDeff* ≈ 0. 2 with little scatter...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} an analytical model for the assessment of kinematic interaction of large-diameter shaft foundations. The model is derived using recently obtained solutions of soil structure interaction problems of rigid walls and fixed <b>base</b> <b>cylinders</b> subjected to a dynamic excitation. The proposed model constitutes an extension to a deformable base of the elastodynamic solution of a rigid fixed-base cylinder imbedded in a homogeneous or inhomogeneous soil stratum with different lateral boundary conditions. The analytical model has been validated by means of a finite elements code and it has been implemented in a consistent seismic soil-structure-interaction analysis procedure. An application of the model to a long, multispan continuous prestressed concrete viaduct with tall piers has been carried out focusing on the importance of kinematic interaction. The main result is that the foundation input motion is characterised not only by a translational horizontal component which is usually of a reduced amplitude if compared with the free-field ground motion, but also by a rotation component that is responsible for a large seismic demand in the superstructure. The proposed model represents an effective tool to be used in the engineering practice to assess both the seismic actions induced by the ground shaking on the foundation system and the effective input motion of a superstructure founded on massive and large diameter shaft...|$|R

Motivation: An ability to obtain this information would be extremely useful in applications such as virtual reality, remote human identification (gait analysis), nonintrusive medical diagnostics, and others. The common way to model human body for this purpose is a kinematic tree which is parametrized on the sizes of the limbs and the joint angles.
