25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but he kept it quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information would slip and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the <b>big</b> <b>secret</b> was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because he was thinking about Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses to go to the hospital, using his final moments to tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} ranged from mixed to negative. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an odd way to build a mythology: the <b>Big</b> <b>Secret</b> seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea." [...] She gave it [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{commonly}} reported {{statement that the}} action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. [...] Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to [...] "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to [...] "create {{the illusion of a}} continuous camera move." [...] Once the team was able to create a [...] "seamless blend", they would {{move on to the next}} shot. [...] These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. [...] The coffee shop scene was composed of [...] "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in [...] "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene [...] "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. [...] In an interview with Variety, Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the [...] "single-shot" [...] action sequences: [...] "Maybe I'm spilling a <b>big</b> <b>secret,</b> but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces." ...|$|E

2500|$|A running theme through {{nearly all}} of Kroupa's writing is his drug use. He was a very vocal proponent of self-selecting one's own state of {{consciousness}} and freely wrote and talked about his own drug history. The caveat being, some of his drug use was open and public. The {{fact that he was}} an advocate of LSD and other psychedelic drugs was no <b>big</b> <b>secret.</b> The darker side of his life [...] that he regularly lost weeks of time injecting speedballs, {{was in and out of}} detoxes and rehabs, and suffered from bipolar disorder [...] were not publicized or mentioned until nearly a decade later.|$|E

According to Garrison, the bartender felt it was no <b>big</b> <b>secret</b> and “my men began encountering one person after another in the French Quarter who confirmed that it was common knowledge that 'Clay Bertrand' was the name Clay Shaw went by.” A February 25, 1967 memo by Garrison investigator Lou Ivon to Jim Garrison states {{that he could not}} locate a Clay Bertrand despite numerous inquiries and contacts.|$|E

2500|$|On the November 26, 2005 {{episode of}} Impact!, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett {{was shocked and}} frightened by Gayda's {{unexpected}} appearance and soon ordered her backstage. He was heard saying, [...] "It's not what you think." [...] After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, {{the same thing happened}} in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there {{had nothing to do with}} a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, she turned on the television to see Kim in her place. She said she had a <b>big</b> <b>secret</b> about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear, but did not reveal what it was.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook {{would return to}} film scenes for broadcast later in the year, said to be an [...] "explosive storyline". A spokesperson for the show said [...] "It's a great comeback for her. She proved really popular with viewers and producers soon realised they should get her back for more." [...] Santer's successor, Bryan Kirkwood told Digital Spy, [...] "When Sam Mitchell is in Albert Square, trouble is never far behind. We last saw her heading for a stretch in prison and ostracised by her family. When she returns on her release, it's with a lot of grudges and a <b>big</b> <b>secret.</b> Danniella brings a lot of fun and mischief to the role of Sam and I'm looking forward to having her back where she belongs". Her return was broadcast on 20 August 2010 and centred around a [...] "Who's the daddy?" [...] storyline, when Sam revealed she was pregnant and unsure who was her baby's father, Ricky or Jack Branning (with whom she had been cheating on Ricky). After the completion of this storyline in which Jack {{was confirmed}} as her baby's father, Sam departed once again. Her final episode aired on 21 September 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was created as {{the sister of}} established character, Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen) due to Blampied's and Allen's physical similarity. Bree first appeared on the show when Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) mistook her for his girlfriend – Brooke. Although Bree tried {{to get on with}} Brooke, the feelings were not mutual and Brooke struggled to accept her sister. Whilst the two characters were getting to know each other, so too were their actresses; Blampied and Beth Allen and the two shared a dressing room. Blampied herself was an only child, but found working alongside Allen reassuring, [...] "I was kind of getting to know Beth in an almost sisterly way at the same time Bree and Brooke were getting to know each other. So it's kind of worked for me." [...] After Vinnie left Brooke for her behaviour towards Bree, he and Bree started an affair, creating a love triangle between the sisters. Bree revealed to Vinnie that her qualifications as a surgeon were dodgy and alerted Brooke. However instead of deepening the rival between the two, it only forced the two closer together. Blampied explained the situation stating; [...] "Instead of throwing Bree under a bus, Brooke decides she quite likes that Bree has a <b>big</b> <b>secret,</b> because it makes her more human – or more like she is ... Brooke decides she is going to take Bree under her wing and help her out of the mess. In many ways Bree becomes Brooke's little protege. I think they've both had the chance to let their guard down with one another. Now that Brooke has seen Bree at her lowest – desperate and vulnerable – it has endeared her to Brooke." ...|$|E
