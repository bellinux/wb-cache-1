30|$|Arcithelphusa cochleariformis is an {{omnivore}} species, which mainly {{feeds on}} a wide range of plant material (grasses, aquatic vegetation, leaves of colocasia, green algae, creepers and areca nut shells), earthworms and insects (grasshoppers, <b>brown</b> <b>planthoppers</b> and praying mantes) (A.R. Sudha Devi, unpublished data). They also survive on decaying leaves and detritus. Decayed leaves and remnants of food material are often seen accumulated near their burrows. Juvenile crabs prefer aquatic plants, grasses, green algae, moss plants, insect larvae, decayed leaves and detritus as their food. These crabs are mainly nocturnal and are found active during early morning and night. They very rarely forage during the day time. Adult crabs prefer to stay inside the burrows while juveniles mostly spend their time in water. Their predators include birds (herons and egrets) and mammals (wild boars, mongooses and cats). The new species was sympatric with Vela carli (Roux, 1931).|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} complex {{processes}} {{to ward off}} attacks by insects. In parallel, insects have evolved mechanisms to thwart these plant defenses. To gain insight into mechanisms that mediate this arms race between plants and herbivorous insects, we investigated the interactions between gramine, a toxin synthesized by plants of the family Gramineae, and glutathione S transferase (GST), an enzyme found in insects that is known to detoxify xenobiotics. Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa), a hydrophytic plant, also produces gramine and that rice resistance to <b>brown</b> <b>planthoppers</b> (Nilaparvata lugens, BPHs) is highly associated with in planta gramine content. We also show that gramine is a toxicant that causes BPH mortality in vivo and that knockdown of BPH GST gene nlgst 1 - 1 results in increased sensitivity to diets containing gramine.

There are two strains of the planthopper, one that only lays eggs on rice and one that favors cutgrass; the rice strain does not effectively reproduce on cutgrass and vice versa, even when sympatric. While they can be crossed in laboratory tests, the two strains do not interbreed in the wild.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the changes in the orientation behaviour of Anagrus nilaparvatae (Pang et Wang), the egg parasitoid of rice <b>brown</b> <b>planthoppers</b> (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)), after being exposed to sublethal concentrations of deltamethrin. The impact of residue on plants to the behaviour of parasitoid was also studied. The sublethal concentrations (LC 10 and LC 40) used were 0. 023 ppm and 2. 235 ppm, respectively. Deltamethrin applied to the rice plants were 12. 5 ppm and 6. 25 ppm, and its effect was observed at 3 hours, 1, 3 and 7 days after application. Orientation behavior was studied using Y-tube olfactometer. Application of deltamethrin at subletal concentration reduced the ability of surviving A. nilaparvatae to detect odors (volatile ompounds) released by the host, N. lugens. The higher the concentration of deltamethrin applied to the parasitoid or to the rice plants, the more prominent effect observed in the changing in the parasitoid behavious, in particular disruption to the parasitoid’s orientation to find their host. As consequences, effects of deltamethrin may lead to reduce the effectiveness of A. nilaparvatae as biological control agents in the field as a result of declining their searching capacity.  </p...|$|R

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of disrupted particles of RRSV gave five major polypeptides with tool. wt. of 145000 (145 K), 137 K, 72 K, 47 K and 37 K. Core particles prepared by suspending particles in 0. 5 M-MgCI 2 contained the 145 K, 137 K, 72 K proteins and relatively small amounts of the 37 K protein, whereas the supernatant fluid recovered after centrifugation of the core particles contained the 47 K and 37 K proteins. The {{results suggest that the}} 145 K, 137 K and 72 K proteins are core proteins and {{one or both of the}} 47 K and 37 K proteins are components of the spike.

[...] To identify changes in the types of accessory gland proteins (Acps) and reproductive proteins that mated female planthoppers received from male planthoppers, researchers conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of mated N. lugens females.

50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper</b> is dimorphic, with fully winged 'macropterous' and truncate-winged 'brachypterous' forms. The macropterous {{forms are}} {{potentially}} migrants and {{are responsible for}} colonizing new fields.

Adults usually mate on the day of emergence, and the females start laying eggs from the day following mating. Brachypterous females lay 300 to 350 eggs, while macropterous females lay fewer eggs. The eggs are thrust in a straight line generally along the mid-region of the leaf sheath. Eggs hatch in about six to nine days. The newly hatched nymphs are cottony white, and turn purple brown with in an hour; they feed on plant sap. They undergo five instars to become adults.|$|E

It hosts the rice stem nematode, which causes ufra disease of rice. It is susceptibe to many plant viruses that infect rice plants, such as rice grassy stunt virus, rice transitory yellowing virus, and rice tungro virus. It is susceptible to fungi such as pathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae, which causes leaf blight of rice, and Cochliobolus miyabeanus, which causes brown spot.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{significant}} factor in this impressive increase in output and productivity was the spread of high-yield rice varieties. By the mid-1980s, 85 percent of rice farmers used highyield variety seeds, compared with 50 percent in 1975. High-yield varieties were promoted together with subsidised fertiliser, pesticides, and credit through the [...] "mass guidance" [...] or Bimas rice intensification program. This extension program also offered technical assistance to farmers unfamiliar with the new cultivation techniques. The new technology was not without its own problems, however. Several major infestations of the <b>brown</b> <b>planthopper,</b> whose natural predators were eliminated by the heavy use of subsidised pesticides, led to a new strategy in 1988 to apply the techniques of integrated pest management, relying {{on a variety of}} methods aside from pesticide to control insects and rodents.
