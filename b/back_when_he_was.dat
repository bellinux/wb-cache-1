5|$|As a three-year-old, Soyer was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia, and doctors were pessimistic about his chances for survival. Despite being declared cancer free {{by the age of}} six, the cancer came <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eight years old. As a child, he played Australian rules football and was a member of Little Athletics. He attended Benalla College.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, {{explorer}} David Thompson set {{out from}} Saskatchewan to find {{the source of the}} Columbia. He crossed over the Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived {{on the banks of the}} Kootenay, which he thought to be the Columbia. Thompson traveled down the river a ways but turned <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked by Native Americans. The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding the Columbia. They crossed over the Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to the Columbia, eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively. After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach the Columbia by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.|$|E

25|$|After {{the events}} of the Brightest Day, Alan {{and the rest of the}} JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been {{attacked}} by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Alan's neck. In the subsequent story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Alan and Jay had been tasked by the president with killing the experiment <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in infancy during World War 2. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live.

5|$|Led by Jim Peplinski, an alumni {{game was}} {{organized}} for Saturday, February 19, at McMahon. The game featured 14 {{members of the}} Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, including Lanny McDonald, Al MacInnis, Joel Otto, Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk. For Nieuwendyk, {{at the time the}} General Manager of the Dallas Stars, the chance to participate in the game was important enough that he chose to overlook the chronic pain in his <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> on skates. Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only {{a few weeks before the}} game, also took part for Calgary.|$|R
500|$|Because the dialogue-integrated {{tutorial}} in {{the first}} game had been well received, it was considered a major point for future games in the series. In the first game, Takumi had Phoenix being guided through his first trial by the judge and Mia, and for the second game, he had Phoenix suffer from amnesia; when writing the third game, Takumi {{did not know what to}} do, as it would not seem credible if Phoenix had amnesia a second time. Eventually he came up with the idea of using a flashback to a case where Mia had just become an attorney; he developed this idea further, and ended up using flashbacks as a major theme for the game's story. He decided that he wanted to include a case where Mia faces off against Edgeworth <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a rookie prosecutor, but encountered a problem: both characters had previously been established as never having lost a single case. Trying to come up with a way for a case in the past to work with neither of them winning or losing, he came up with the story for Terry Fawles, who dies during the trial. The game's main theme was [...] "not everything is always what it seems on the surface".|$|E
500|$|Graham {{was drafted}} by the Philadelphia Eagles {{in the first round}} with the 13th overall pick after trading up in the 2010 NFL Draft. [...] Graham decided to wear number 54 for the Eagles {{immediately}} after the draft, but changed his mind and chose number 55. Graham shares the same sports agent (Joel Segal) as former teammate Michael Vick. He was the first Big Ten Conference player selected in the 2010 NFL Draft. He agreed to terms on a five-year contract on July 29, 2010. Graham recorded his first NFL sack against the Detroit Lions in a week 2 win on September 19, 2010. After suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a week 14 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Graham was placed on the injured reserve list on December 14. He underwent microfracture surgery on his right knee on December 21. Graham was placed on the active/physically unable to perform list on July 28, 2011, before the start of training camp. He was removed him from the physically unable to perform list so he could return to practice on October 24 and activated on November 5, 2011. In 2013, Graham moved from defensive end to linebacker. Many people had predicted he would become a linebacker at the pro level <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still in college. After coming close to signing with the New York Giants, in 2015, Graham signed a 4-year $26 million contract with $14 million guaranteed with the Eagles to remain with the team. Following the 2016 NFL season, in which he moved back to defensive end under new defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, Graham was named to the 2016 All-Pro 2nd Team by the Associated Press.|$|E

Krens's conception came to fruition when the site became the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) in 1999. He was not discouraged by those that did not get off the ground, and through persistence was able to see several huge projects to completion. [...] The success of the expansion in Berlin came on the heels of the collapse of a proposed Guggenheim satellite in Salzburg, Austria, while at one time there were as many as three nascent projects in Venice.|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Harrison Ford {{fractured}} his leg while filming at Pinewood after {{a hydraulic}} {{door on the}} Millennium Falcon set fell on him and {{was taken to a}} hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle [...] "went to a 90-degree angle". Production was suspended for two weeks to accommodate Ford's injury. Ford's son Ben stated that the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said that Ford was recovering rapidly. Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident. However, he kept this to himself and did not tell anyone about it for over a month. In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident. Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.|$|E
