The Jenkins-Laporte doctrine provides a legal foundation <b>for</b> <b>circumvention</b> of the exclusive rights provided by the Copyright Act, as the doctrine requires the copyright owner to prove the negative.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} a widening gap between the conventional theory and current practice of Islamic banks. It finds fault at both the ends. ’No risk, no gain’ is inadequate as a general principle for organizing Islamic finance. It is also not always valid to say that Islam is averse to granting of a time value for money. The overuse of deferred contracts in Islamic finance threatens to violate the juristic principle of sadd al-dhara’i i. e. controlling the potential avenues <b>for</b> <b>circumvention</b> of the law. Some structural changes in Islamic financial arrangements are suggested to create a balance {{in the use of}} PLS and deferred contracts in Islamic banking. ...|$|R

Writing in the Australian Financial Review, journalist Laura Tingle identified a number of methods <b>for</b> <b>circumvention</b> including the use of phone me via a provider Skype, advertising supported email services such as Google’s Gmail and instant messaging service, Facebook Messenger. In an interview with Sky News, then Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull suggested journalists could avoid leaving a data trail through using over-the-top applications:"If you have a device, a smartphone and if I call you through the mobile phone network then there will be a record at Telstra that I called your number." ...|$|R

40|$|Censorship {{systems that}} make dynamic {{blocking}} decisions must inspect network activity on-the-fly to identify content to filter. By inferring the analysis models of such monitors {{we can identify}} their vulnerabilities to different forms of evasions that we can then exploit <b>for</b> <b>circumvention.</b> We leverage the observation that censorship monitors essentially work on the same principles as Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and therefore inherit the same evasion vulnerabilities already discussed in the NIDS context for years. Using this past work as a guide, we illustrate the power of illuminating a monitor’s analysis model by conducting extensive probing to test for vulnerabilities in the Great Firewall of China. We find exploitable flaws in its TCB creation and destruction, fragment and segmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{active participation}} {{of individuals in}} the creation of sexual violence narratives online, as opposed to the previously passive consumption of news stories offline, could prove problematic in ensuring justice is served. Social media allows <b>for</b> <b>circumvention</b> {{of the criminal justice system}} in response to its perceived inadequacies. With the 24 -hour news cycle, the ease with which media consumers can interact with the story as it breaks online, and the manner in which social media has been used by laypersons and secondary bystanders to target victims or perpetrators before a case ever makes it to court, raises questions about how narrative construction online possibly influences people’s beliefs and understandings about sexual violence and the effect this may have for the justice system...|$|R

40|$|Debt limits, {{interest}} coverage ratios, one-off {{balanced budget}} requirements, pay-as-you-go rules, and tax and expenditure limits {{are among the}} most important fiscal rules for constraining intertemporal transfers. There is considerable evidence that the least costly and most effective of such rules are those that focus directly on the rate of spending growth, even with their seemingly ad hoc nature and possibilities <b>for</b> <b>circumvention.</b> In this paper, we use optimal control theory and martingale methods to justify a transparent, nonarbitrary rule governing maximum sustainable rate of spending growth, treating the revenue structure of a jurisdiction as a given continuous-time stochastic process. Our results can be used to determine whether a proposed rate of spending growth is sustainable or not. © 2009 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|R

We examine a specific case, that of obfuscated Tor bridges, and conduct experiments designed to {{discover how}} long it takes censors to block them (if they do block at all). Through a year's worth of active measurements from China, Iran, Kazakhstan, and other countries, we learn when bridges become blocked. In China we found the most interesting behavior, including long and varying delays before blocking, frequent failures during which blocked bridges became reachable, and an advancement in blocking technique midway through the experiment. Throughout, we observed surprising behavior by censors, not in accordance with what we would have predicted, calling into question our assumptions and suggesting potential untapped avenues <b>for</b> <b>circumvention...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The main {{law that}} affects the {{legality}} of iOS jailbreaking in the United States is the 2012 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which says [...] "no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under" [...] the DMCA, since this may apply to jailbreaking. Every three years, the law allows the public to propose exemptions for legitimate reasons <b>for</b> <b>circumvention,</b> which last three years if approved. In 2010 and 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office approved exemptions that allowed smartphone users to jailbreak their devices legally, and in 2015 the Copyright Office approved an expanded exemption that also covers other all-purpose mobile computing devices, such as tablets. It is still possible Apple may employ technical countermeasures to prevent jailbreaking or prevent jailbroken phones from functioning. It is unclear whether it is legal to traffic in the tools used to make jailbreaking easy.|$|R
