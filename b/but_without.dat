60|$|We {{are in a}} civil war. In {{such cases}} there always is a main {{question}}, {{but in this case}} that question is a perplexing compound--Union and slavery. It thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four sides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who are against it. Thus, those who are for the Union with, <b>but</b> not <b>without</b> slavery; those for it <b>without,</b> <b>but</b> not with; those for it with or <b>without,</b> <b>but</b> prefer it with; and those for it with or <b>without,</b> <b>but</b> prefer it <b>without.</b>|$|R
