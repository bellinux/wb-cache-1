40|$|Dental amalgam {{is still}} the {{material}} most commonly used to restore posterior teeth in many countries. Amalgam is very popular because of its strength, longevity, low cost, and relative ease of handling compared to other direct restorative materials. Two important disadvantages of amalgam restaurations are lack of adhesion to tooth structure and marginal leakage. Introduction of dentin adhesive systems enabled better marginal seal between amalgam and tooth structure. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate, in vitro conditions, the marginal seal of amalgam restaurations with dentin adhesive systems using the method of diffusion dye. Material and methods: In this study 50 extracted human teeth were used. Class II cavities were prepared on all the teeth. The teeth were divided in five groups and materials applied according to manufacturer’s instructions: Gamabond, Optibond Solo, OptiGuard, Ionosit - <b>Base</b> <b>Liner</b> and control group. All the teeth were thermocycled 200 times, at temperatures: 5 - 7 ºC, 37 ºC and 57 - 59 ºC. Method of diffusion dye was used to estimate the quality of marginal seal of amalgam restaurations. All teeth were immersed into 50 % solution of silver nitrate, and then into 10 % developing solution. All teeth were cut with a diamond disc in the meso - distal plane. Penetration dye was estimated using binocular magnifying glass that magnifies 25 times, with inserted micrometar scale. Results were statistically analysed with Student t - test. Results: The least penetration dye was recorded in the group of amalgam restaurations rebonded with OptiGuard. Higher penetration dye was noted in the groups of adhesive amalgam restaurations, where Gamabond showed lower penetration dye in comparison with Optibond Solo. Penetration dye in the group Ionosit - <b>Base</b> <b>Liner</b> was higher than in the groups where dentin adhesive systems were used: on the occlusal wall, penetration dye in comparison with Gamabond showed statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 5) while penetration dye in comparison with Optibond Solo showed no statistically significant difference. On the gingival wall, penetration dye in comparison with dentin adhesive systems - Gamabond and Optibond Solo, showed a statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 01). The highest penetration dye was in the control group. Conclusion: The best marginal seal of amalgam restaurations was achieved with OptiGuard. Use of dentin adhesive systems also provided good marginal seal, with better results from Gamabond compared to Optibond Solo. Using Ionosit - <b>Base</b> <b>Liner</b> good marginal seal on the occlusal wall was also accomplished, while penetration dye on the gingival wall showed a statistically significant difference in comparison with adhesive and rebonding amalgam restaurations...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Before placing or {{cementing}} {{a restoration}} into a cavity preparation, the clinician {{must decide whether}} a cavity <b>base,</b> <b>liner</b> or a protective cavity sealer should be placed. While this seems simple, the decision is complicated by an ever-increasing number of products available. In addition, the clinical success of an indirect restorative procedure depends, to a great extent, {{on the relationship between}} the restoration and the tooth. The practice of fixed prosthodontics has changed dramatically with the introduction of innovative techniques and materials. Adhesive resin systems are examples of these changes that have led to popularity of bonded ceramics and resin-retained fixed partial dentures. Materials and Methods: This review was collected with a scientific search in MEDLINE in relation to the following categories: the definition of liners, bases and cements, their clinical applications, mechanical properties, biocompatibility, principles of adhesion, specific types of materials and their use as liners, bases or cements. In addition, the review discusses cementation techniques for different types of restorations, and other relevant clinical information. Tables of products available and their properties are also presented. Conclusion: Although each cement type has been widely investigated, the correct clinical choice between them is not always clear. None of them is suitable to be used for the entire broad range of indirect restorative procedures. Therefore, their proper application requires a thorough understanding and awareness of each material's advantages and disadvantages, taking into account the restorative material, moisture control and preparation design (retentive or adhesive).

40|$|Fly ash has {{potential}} application {{in the construction}} of base liners for waste containment facilities. While most of the fly ashes improve in the strength with curing, the ranges of permeabilities they attain may often not meet the basic requirement of a liner material. An attempt has been made in the present context to reduce the hydraulic conductivity by adding lime content up to 10 % to two selected samples of class F fly ashes. The use of gypsum, which is known to accelerate the unconfined compressive strength by increasing the lime reactivity, has been investigated in further improving the hydraulic conductivity. Hydraulic conductivities of the compacted specimens have been determined in the laboratory using the falling head method. It has been observed that the addition of gypsum reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the lime treated fly ashes. The reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the samples containing gypsum is significantly more for samples with high amounts of lime contents (as high as 1000 times) than those fly ashes with lower amounts of lime. However there is a relatively more increase in the strengths of the samples with the inclusion of gypsum to the fly ashes at lower lime contents. This {{is due to the fact}} that excess lime added to fly ash is not effectively converted into pozzolanic compounds. Even the presence of gypsum is observed not to activate these reactions with excess lime. On the other hand the higher amount of lime in the presence of sulphate is observed to produce more cementitious compounds which block the pores in the fly ash. The consequent reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of fly ash would be beneficial in reducing the leachability of trace elements present in the fly ash when used as a <b>base</b> <b>liner.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Thermal {{power station}} in most {{countries}} is saddled {{with the problem of}} fly ash disposal and unless suitable avenues are found for its proper use, this would pose a gigantic problem to the power sector. Disposal of huge quantities of fly ashes without proper care causes considerable impact on the environment particularly the one leading to soil and groundwater contamination. On the other hand, fly ashes have many desirable properties which can find applications in civil engineering, especially in geotechnical engineering. The pozzolanic reactivity is one of the important properties of fly ashes that enhance its application. Thought the fly ashes with self – pozzolanic property are well utilized, fly ashes with insufficient free lime, such as class F fly ashes are being grossly underutilized and they form a considerable portion of fly ashes that are disposed. Yet another factor restricting the use of fly ash is the concern about the leachability of lime under field conditions particularly under saturated or partially saturated conditions. Hence an attempt is made in this thesis, to reduce the lime leachability of class F fly ashes with different additives. Thus, selection of right amounts of additives to reduce the lime leacability is an important aspect studied in this thesis. Effect of such as strength, compressibility, and CBR value is also investigated. Another simple way to reduce the problem of disposal of fly ash is to utilize it for the construction of waste disposal sites particularly for lining solid waste disposal facilities in place of the natural clay materials which are very often procured by excavating and transporting from far off places. Also, the capacities of fly ashes to sorb heavy metal that are likely to be present in the leachates generated from the industrial wastes have been studied. Of the other factors limiting the generous use of fly ashes is the leachability of several trace elements present in them. Hence the leachability of trace metals from fly ashes under different practical situations, before and after incorporating the selected additives for improving the engineering properties of fly ashes, has been studied. The thesis is presented in 10 chapters. 	The relevant background for the studies and scope of the work is given Chapter 1. Sources of the fly ashes collected for the investigating along with their physical and chemical properties are presented in chapter 2. Two low line fly ashes are collected directly from the electronic precipitators of the thermal power plants located at Neyvelli town of the Tamil nadu and Maddanur town of Andhra Pradesh, India, named NFA and MFA respectively. MFA has greater finer particle content than NFA. The particles of MFA Have rougher surface compared to those of NFA. Both of fly ashes have predominantly quartz and mullite phase in them. The silica, total lime and carbon contents which have major influence on the pozzolanic reactivity of fly ashes vary considerably in the both the fly ashes. Lime leachability is taken as the amount of lime that is converted into soluble form (by dissociation into calcium and hydroxyl ions) under a standardized condition. It can be used to asses the long term sustainability of the strength achieved in fly ashes with lime. Lime leachability studies have been conducted on the fly ashes stabilized with different additives in specially designed moulds. Results presented in Chapter 3 showed that leachability of lime in fly ashes increases with the increase in lime content though it is not in proportion to the increase in lime content. This is because the solubility of lime is less and is independent of the total lime present. The marginal reduction in leachability is mainly due to cemented matrix of fly ash inhibiting the leaching of time. The higher the strength of the matrix the lower is the leachability. Further it is made clear that at any lime content presence of gypsum reduces the time leachability which has been attributed to the transformation of pozzolanic compounds into less soluble form than the compounds formed with lime alone. With the increase in curing period, the amount of lime that leaches from the lime-stabilized fly ashes as well as those treated with gypsum to a considerable extent. The nature of alteration does not seem to change with time as revealed by a good correlation between lime leachability ratios obtained after 7 days and 14 days of curing periods. Chapter 4 presents the results of unconfined compressive strength tests carried out on fly ashes with varying lime and gypsum contents, before soaking and also soaking in several heavy metal solutions, along with the durability to the cycle of wetting and drying. The results revealed that the strength of low lime fly ashes increases with lime content significantly up to the optimum lime content of about 2. 5 – 5 % and gradually thereafter. Addition of gypsum of 1 – 2. 5 % increases the strength of fly ashes further at any lime content. Increase in strength with gypsum, which is quite significant at lower lime contents initially, is observed for a considerable period (up to 180 days) at higher lime contents. The increase in strength is as high as 40 -fold in some instances. This increase in strength which is also more durable has been attributed to the formation of calcium – sodium – aluminium - silicate hydrate along with calcium silicate hydrate. Further, it is observed that fly ash which responds better to lime stabilization shows accelerated gain in strength due to the addition of gypsum at early curing periods than the fly ash that responds solely to lime. Decrease in lime leachability ratio is a good indication of the increased strength along with the increased durability. California Bearing Radio (CBR) values are of great significance in the utilization of fly ashes in bulk quantities for the construction of road and railway embankments and pavements. Studies conducted to determine the CBR values of fly ashes with different lime and gypsum contents after curing for different time periods are described in chapter 5. The CBR values are observed to increase with lime alone significantly up to 2. 5 % and only marginally beyond. But the increase in CRB values is considerable with gypsum at any lime content. The increase in CBR value is particularly more with 2. 5 % gypsum for fly ashes with 2. 5 % lime. The CBR values of stabilized fly ashes are generally higher for 5 mm depth of penetration than those for 2. 5 mm one due to the high stiffness of the matrix formed even at low strain levels. The loss in CBR values with soaking is relatively more at lower curing the periods due to the improper cementation of particles. Even after this significant loss in CBR values, fly ashes with 2. 5 % lime and 2. 5 % gypsum register the maximum values after curing under soaked condition. Unlike in the case of unconfined compressive strength, lime leachability values could not be well correlated with the CBR values of fly ashes with different lime and gypsum contents since many more factors influence the CBR values than those of unconfined compressive strength alone. Chapter 6. brings out the effects of addition of lime alone and lime along with gypsum on the compressibility behaviour of the fly ashes. Since the fly ashes when treated with additives develop strength and exhibit lower compression with the passage of time, consolidation testing with conventional duration of load increment may not be appropriate. Hence an attempt has been made to assess the minimum duration of load increment necessary to study the compressibility characteristics of such materials. Thus the compressibility behaviour of fly ashes with additives has been studied using conventional consolidation test with different durations of load increments varying from 30 minutes to 48 hours. The results indicated that 30 minutes of duration of load increment can be used to assess the compressibility behaviour of such materials. The effect of lime which reduces the compression is seen to be maximum from the results obtained with the load duration increment of 30 minutes but gradually reduce with higher duration of load increment. It has also been observed that the rate of decrease in the compressibility is maximum up to 2. 5 % lime and thereafter gradual. The compressibility of lime –treated fly ashes further reduces when gypsum is incorporated, the optimum gypsum percentage being 2. 5. This reduction in the compressibility of fly ashes enhanced by incorporating lime and gypsum makes them versatile in the construction of embankments and for structural fills, particularly reducing the time required in between laying of each lift. It has been brought out that decrease in the lime leachability decreases the compressibility of fly ashes. 	Fly ash has potential application in the construction of base liners of waste containment facilities. While most of the fly ashes improve in the strength with curing, the ranges of hydraulic conductivities they attain may often not meet the basic requirement of a liner material. Attempts to reduce the hydraulic conductivity by adding lime as gypsum along with lime to both the fly ashes are presented in chapter 7. Hydraulic conductivities of the compacted specimens have been determined in the laboratory using the falling head methods. It has been observed that the addition of gypsum reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the lime treated fly ashes. The reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the fly ashes containing gypsum is significantly more of sample with high amounts of lime contents (as high as 1000 times) than those with lower amounts of lime. However, there is relatively more increases in the strengths of the samples with the inclusion of gypsum to the fly ashes even at lower lime contents. This {{is due to the fact}} that excess lime added to fly ash is not effectively converted in to pozzolanic compounds. Even the presence of gypsum is observed not to activate these reactions with excess lime. On the other hand the higher amount of lime in the presence of gypsum is observed to produce more cementitious compounds which block the pores in the fly ash. Amount of lime leached in the found to be directly related to the hydraulic conductivity inspite of many –fold variations in the hydraulic conductivity achieved by curing fly ash with lime and gypsum. The consequent reduction on the hydraulic conductivity of fly ash would be beneficial in reducing the leachability of trace elements in the fly ash when used as <b>base</b> <b>liner.</b> Fly ash contains trace metals and other substances in the sufficient quantities which may leach out over a period of time. The study has been extended to examine the leachability of a few selected trace metals viz., Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Pb and Zn from fly ash before and after incorporating additives has been reported in chapter 9. The standard laboratory leaching test for the combustion residues developed by Van der Sloot et al. has been employed to study the leachabilities of trace elements as a function of liquid to solid (L/S) ratio and pH. The leachability test were conducted on the powdered fly ash samples obtained from unconfined compressive strength tests, conducted after a curing period of 28 and 180 days. It observed that, there is a marked reduction in the relative leachabilities of trace elements present, at the end of 28 days which reduced only marginally at the end of 180 days. Chapter 9 reports the retention capacities of fly ashes for copper, lead and zinc metals ions. Various parameters like contact time, initial concentration and pH have been varied and their effect on retention mechanism studied. The retention order of metals ions, Cu+ 2 > Pb+ 2 >Zn+ 2, is observed to be the same for both the fly ashes at all pH values. The dominant mechanisms responsible for the retention are precipitation at higher pH’s as hydroxides and adsorption at lower pH’s Due to presence of silica and alumina oxide surface in fly ash. First order kinetic plots have revealed that the rate constant value increases with increase in initial concentration and pH. Langmuir adsorption isotherms have been plotted to study the maximum adsorption isotherms have been plotted to study the maximum adsorption capacities for metal ions under different conditions. The older indicates that the adsorption is predominantly by silica surface than that by alumina or iron oxide surfaces. This thesis demonstrates that incorporation of gypsum along with lime in the optimal proportions not only reduces the lime leachability but also greatly enhances the strength and CBR values, reduces the compressibility and minimizes the leaching of trace elements present in them enhancing the potential of fly ashes for many applications. Detailed conclusions are presented in chapter 10. The study greatly helps in promoting the use of fly ashes for many geotechnical and geo-environmental applications...|$|E

We briefly touch on outlines of price and emission opportunities, as well as operational and safety challenges, and system adaptation stages of LNG bunkering for container ships. We demonstrate an LNG fuelled global marine container transport network model in order to meet requirements of bunkering operations, fleet utilisation and marine container transportation demand. Outcomes of {{this research}} will assist further developments of LNG bunkering <b>based</b> <b>liner</b> service operational strategies of deep sea container liner ship operators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Geosynthetic {{reinforcement}} in landfill {{applications in}} the US has involved conventional reinforced soil structures and veneer stabilization with reinforcements placed along the landfill slope and anchored at the crest. In addition, innovative approaches have been recently implemented in the US to reinforce landfill covers and <b>base</b> <b>liners.</b> This includes horizontally placed geosynthetic reinforcements, which are anchored into solid waste, and fiber reinforcement to enhance the shear strength of the soil liner material and the interface shear strength between the soil liner and texture geomembranes. This paper presents a framework {{for the design of}} steep reinforced liners. Recent case histories illustrating the use of the different geosynthetic reinforcement applications are also presented to document the different approaches in specific projects...|$|R
40|$|Iraq {{passed through}} many {{destructive}} wars {{where the country}} infrastructures have been destroyed. Consequently, various types of hazardous wastes generated from 1991 and 2003 wars are exposed {{in different parts of}} Iraq without any aspect of human and environment considerations. Contaminants are found in the form of contaminated rubble with depleted uranium (DU). Landfill disposal is still an economical and vital solution that should serve between 300 - 1000 years for confining hazardous wastes like DU. The longevity of a hazardous waste landfill is mainly controlled by clay <b>based</b> <b>liners.</b> There are many factors affecting the performance of clay liners. These factors were discussed. The main requirements of hazardous waste landfills were listed according to USEPA and German regulations. Finally, the main aspects of landfill siting criteria in Iraq were suggested.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the valorization of local materials such as desert dune sand obtained from Laghouat region in the South Algeria and mine bentonite intended for the realization of <b>liner</b> <b>base</b> layers in the conception of insulation barriers for hazardous waste facilities. In practice, an economical mixture satisfying the hydraulic requirements is generally concerned. First, in order to get an adequate dune sand–bentonite mixture compacted to the optimum Proctor condition, an investigation on saturated hydraulic behavior is carried out in this study for different mixtures. Using oedometer test (indirect measurement), the adequate mixture of 85 % dune sand and 15 % bentonite satisfies the conditions of saturated hydraulic conductivity (k    3  MPa). This technique is conducted based on the exploitation of the water retention curve in order to establish the relationships between hydraulic conductivity, degree of saturation, and suction. It shows that the hydraulic conductivity increases with the degree of saturation and decreases with the suction. However, the hydraulic conductivity has a constant value for suctions larger than 20  MPa. The selected dune sand–bentonite mixture satisfies the regulation requirements and hence constitutes a good local and economical material for the conception of barrier <b>base</b> <b>liners...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of soil materials for waste deposit <b>base</b> <b>liners</b> requires {{the determination of}} physical/mechanical properties also in dependence of thermal, mechanical stress and hydraulic transport processes. Of special importance are measurements {{about the effect of}} additional shrinkage and reswelling on alterations in the hydraulic conductivity under mechanical stress. None of the materials could be recommended without restrictions although the samples had been precompacted to Proctordensity. Repeated shrinkage and swelling always induced further crack formation even under intensive loading. The physical/mechanical properties were modelled in 3 joint projects. While the model developed by Schmidt et al. included the parameters: temperature effect, mechanical stress, but merely stable hydraulic soil parameters, the FEM approach also included the effect of varying hydraulic properties.

40|$|Migration of liquids lead to {{embarrassing}} post construction scenarios {{such as that}} of leaks from roofs, {{potable water}} leaking from water tanks/ reservoirs, rising damp in walls with groundwater seeping into basement structures, leakage of water from ornamental lakes and ponds or leachate leakage into the environment from MSW landfill sites. Such failures demand immediate and expensive maintenance. A stringent control on structural and waterproof stability is deemed necessary for long term service life of structures and in particular underground and near surface structures. On a micro scale and over a longer time scale, the phenomenon of rising dampness occurs in older buildings with the groundwater rising up through walls, floors and masonry via capillary action. Even slower rates of contaminant fluid migration occur through landfill <b>base</b> <b>liners.</b> In this paper a variety of hydraulic barrier technologies is critically discussed against a backdrop of relevant case studies. The choice of an appropriate hydraulic barrier technology for a given scenario will depend also on the sustainability, financial affordability and subjective aesthetics...|$|R
40|$|Dumping grounds are {{characterized}} {{by the absence of}} engineering controls such as <b>base</b> <b>liners</b> and cover layer. Consequently, these dumping grounds present risks for surrounding resources such as soil, groundwater and air. The concern for groundwater contamination by leachate from tropical dumping grounds is heightened due to the greater amounts of rainfall and subsequent infiltration and percolation through the waste mass. The emergent demand for old dumping grounds reclamation drives the need to employ remediation technologies. Generally, in-situ aeration is a remediation method that promotes aerobic conditions in the later stage of dumping ground. It accelerates carbon transfer, reduces remaining organic load, and generally shortens the post closure period. However, high rainfall in tropical areas straitens this technique. For example, pollutants could be easily flushed out and more energy should be required to overcome hydrostatic pressure. Although heavy rainfall could supply sufficient water to the substrate and accelerate degradation of organic matter, it may inhibit aerobic activities due to limited air transfer. The waste characterization from Lorong Halus Dumping Ground (closed dumping ground in Singapore) showed that the waste material...|$|R
