The last expedition of the KNAG was in 1959 to Netherlands New Guinea.|$|R
5|$|In some species, {{offspring}} may <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> {{around the}} next spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Mochtar and Soekarsih, {{who first}} {{met on the}} set of Pareh, married after {{appearing}} together in Terang Boelan. This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies.

5|$|The {{opposition}} {{culminated in}} the Algiers putsch of 1961, led by retired generals. After its failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a cease-fire agreement, the Évian Accords, and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> from France.|$|E
5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they <b>become</b> <b>independent,</b> and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} European {{colonies in}} the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after World War II. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago <b>became</b> <b>independent</b> in 1962, and Guyana and Barbados both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the Bahamas, Grenada, Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines all <b>became</b> <b>independent</b> of the United Kingdom, and Suriname <b>became</b> <b>independent</b> of the Netherlands. Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved {{independence from the}} United Kingdom in the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|The State Department {{sent two}} consuls to Mogadishu in 1956 to {{establish}} a diplomatic post and on July 1, 1957, the United States Consulate-General in Mogadishu opened. The consulate was {{an offshoot of the}} US embassy to Italy. At the time, Mogadishu was the capital of the Trust Territory of Somalia, a United Nations Trust Territory under Italian administration that was scheduled to <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> in 1960. In addition to establishing a presence, the consulate staff were also charged with political research and developing relations with future Somali leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{college was}} {{established}} in 1871 by the English philanthropist Thomas Rhodes Armitage and the American anti-slavery campaigner Francis Joseph Campbell, who lost his sight as a young boy. Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London {{would be a more}} suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E

5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and <b>become</b> <b>independent.</b> With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training {{both in and out}} of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E
5|$|During India's {{independence}} struggle, Gandhi {{launched the}} Dandi March along India's west coast to {{protest against the}} sales tax levied on salt extraction. His close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> India's first Governor-General, carried out a salt march in parallel, {{on the east coast}} starting from Trichonopoly (modern day Tiruchirappalli) in Vedaranyam. His group, having people like Sardar Vedaratnam, started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coast of the town. After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930, the group was arrested by the British. After India's independence, Vedaranyam continued {{to be a part of}} Thanjavur district until 1991, and later became part of the newly created Nagapattinam district.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, the Stadt Huys was {{the site}} of the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there. This was the first formal proposal to unite the British American colonies. The Plan of Union's original intention was to unite the colonies in defense against aggressions of the French to the north; it was not an attempt to <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> from the auspices of the British crown. Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan of Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the move from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the BWSA {{accepted}} the invitation from the football club to hold its monthly meetings at the new stadium. The Macron Stadium has continued to be their venue ever since. In the year 2000, the Association expanded significantly when its invitation to affiliate was accepted by Bolton Wanderers supporters groups {{in other parts of}} Britain, and also by groups around the world. All of these foreign groups have come on board to <b>become</b> <b>independent,</b> but integral, parts of the official Bolton Wanderers supporters' family. Requests for affiliated status continue to be received regularly from other places around the world where Wanderers fans find themselves gather together.|$|E
5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to <b>become</b> <b>independent</b> of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{to a greater or}} lesser extent until they <b>become</b> <b>independent,</b> and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
