5|$|In 1969, Fitzgerald {{received}} a safety award {{for eight years}} of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970. Later that same year, she struck {{the wall of a}} lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> more than half a century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} 1939 pavilions are {{the last}} and only example of Stalin's monumental propaganda in their original setting. Such propaganda pieces were not <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> (like Shchusev's War Trophy Hangar in Gorky Park); some were demolished during the de-Stalinization of 1956.|$|E
25|$|Farley Boats {{were high}} quality boats and <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last.</b> However, {{because of high}} {{frequency}} of hurricanes {{and the fact that}} no new models have been built in 40 years, there are very few remaining Farley Boats.

Toyota switched Camry production to its new Altona, Victoria factory two weeks later in January 1995, with the official launch of the assembly line commissioned by Prime Minister Keating on 31 March. There was little difference between the Port Melbourne and Altona vehicles, except for a new water-borne, environmentally friendly paint process.|$|R
25|$|For the Rocket 150 {{event in}} 1980, a {{completely}} new replica of Novelty was constructed by Locomotion Enterprises in the Springwell Workshop of the Bowes Railway. It was a fully working replica that was built to look correct when display at the planned event. However, many changes were made to reduce the construction costs and meet modern standards. It {{has been suggested that}} the replica was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> no longer than the three days of the Rocket 150 event.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of their father, Henry Wills and George Wills donated money for the {{building}} of a university building in memory of their father. He met with George Oatley (later Sir George Oatley) to plan the building of what was to become the Wills Memorial Building which the brothers requested would be <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> for 400 years. When the Wills family acquired Royal Fort gardens as a site they were given to the university and were to be the site of a castle like building which became the physics department.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{the temple}} began {{designing}} {{for the building}} of a huge stupa (a mound-like structure) which was later to become known as the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya. The monument would be <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> for a thousand years, and would consist of a million Buddha images. An experienced architect and experienced engineers were employed, and the latest technology was used in the construction, {{to meet the demands of}} the project and to follow the traditions of cetiyas and stupas. Though traditionally stupas were often financed by kings, the Dhammakaya Cetiya was to be financed by people of all parts of society, all contributing their part. Attempts were made to involve the devotees of the temple through different stages of construction, through organizing meditations around the Cetiya, and holding ceremonies, in which people were given hammers to symbolically hit a foundation pile into the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Since 2001, Stony Brook University's Campus Residences {{has been}} accused of {{overbooking}} residence halls and assigning two people to bedrooms designed for one person. Commenting on earlier claims that the buildings are [...] "poorly maintained", a member of the Schomburg Rent Review quoted that [...] "the Chapin Complex was <b>built</b> 1981 <b>to</b> <b>last</b> 10 years." [...] Also, protests broke out in 2010 over the fact that rent was increasing when graduate student stipends remained unchanged.|$|R
5|$|A {{school was}} built in Vietnam in memory of Pryce. His colleagues raised enough money to have the school <b>built</b> <b>to</b> leave a <b>lasting</b> legacy in his honour. The primary school opened in 2007. Its cost was met by the Hong Kong office of Pryce's employer, Linklaters.|$|R
5000|$|The campus {{include a}} four-storey yellow {{building}}; {{it is the}} first and main building of the school. It houses the Science Laboratory, administrative office, clinic, and the 4 faculty rooms. A three-storey orange building was added during the 2014-2015 school year. It houses the Library, TLE laboratory and Computer Laboratory [...] The Computer Laboratory was used for the ICT lessons and hands-on activities of ICT students in Junior and Senior High School. Two buildings, one was started <b>to</b> <b>built</b> <b>last</b> January 2015 a four-storey building with 16 classrooms and the other, four-storey building with 12 classrooms was also started <b>to</b> <b>built</b> <b>last</b> October 2016.

500|$|Some of the University of Bristol's {{buildings}} date to its pre-charter {{days when}} it was University College Bristol. These buildings were designed by Charles Hansom, the younger brother of Joseph Hansom, Joseph being {{the inventor of the}} Hansom Cab. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, Henry Overton Wills. It was requested to the architect George Oatley that the building be <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of Park Street suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic Roger Gill has stated that the building is [...] "remarkable in size" [...] but noted that the [...] "ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking". He goes on to criticise the building as a [...] "sham" [...] and a [...] "folly". The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The Tyndalls Park Estate and Royal Fort House were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.|$|E

2500|$|The fair {{success of}} Scratch the Surface allowed the band to tour worldwide. In 1997, they {{released}} their second {{record on the}} EastWest label, <b>Built</b> <b>to</b> <b>Last.</b> This record had released a number of live staples for the band, including [...] "Us vs. Them," [...] "Busted" [...] and [...] "Good Lookin' Out." [...] Sick of It All toured with Napalm Death and Sepultura during the album cycle. The album also {{marked the end of}} Sick of It All's contractual agreement with EastWest.|$|E
5000|$|Fife Ness was [...] {{home to a}} Coastguard {{station and}} an {{important}} Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouse built in 1975 on project by P. H. Hyslop, warning shipping of the headland and the North Carr shoals. The lighthouse was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> replace the <b>last</b> {{in a series of}} lightvessels that guarded the treacherous rocks, as it had proved impossible to build a permanent lighthouse on the rocks themselves.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{original}} wooden buildings that formed the officers mess survived until December 2009. Having been <b>built</b> in 1938 <b>to</b> <b>last</b> for just 10 years it was converted in the 1960s to a hotel, the Jurby Hotel.

5000|$|Formal {{development}} {{began in}} 1988. The designation {{was changed to}} Mirage 2000D in 1990, with the [...] "D" [...] standing for [...] "Diversifie/Multirole". Initial flight of the Mirage 2000D prototype, a modified Mirage 2000N prototype, was on 19 February 1991. That led to first flight of a production aircraft 31 March 1993 and introduction to service in April 1995. 86 Mirage 2000Ds were <b>built</b> in all <b>to</b> <b>last</b> delivery in 2001.|$|R
2500|$|The {{buildings}} on the site were extensive and included three airship sheds that were [...] high and could {{be seen on the}} horizon for miles as the land was flat. There were also two [...] high chimneys as well as stores, workshops and administration areas together with barracks. Unlike most sites constructed for use during the war, which were of an easily removed nature, the buildings at the base were <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> and were heavy concrete and brickwork. The main entrance had two concrete pillars adorned with elaborate globes mounted at the top.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} one of the first to adopt steam-powered technology. [...] By the late 1890s, the company had over fifty steam engines {{producing}} power at their mine location, with additional engines at their mill and smelter locations. In 1899, according to the Commissioner of Mineral Statistics, Calumet and Hecla produced [...] "as much power as is now being generated by the great electric plant at Niagara Falls." [...] The plant at the surface was the largest and most efficient in tha nation, and was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> until the lode was exhausted.|$|E
2500|$|Though their 1989 {{debut album}} Blood, Sweat and No Tears was a {{moderate}} success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until later albums. After {{the release of}} their second album Just Look Around in 1992, East West Records saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All's third and major label debut album, Scratch the Surface, was released in 1994 to critical acclaim, and included the singles [...] "Scratch the Surface" [...] and [...] "Step Down" [...] (the video for the latter single would also be featured in the 1995 Beavis and Butt-head episode [...] "Premature Evacuation"). Their 1997 follow-up <b>Built</b> <b>to</b> <b>Last</b> was also highly acclaimed. Despite the success of <b>Built</b> <b>to</b> <b>Last,</b> Sick of It All was dropped from East West and signed to Fat Wreck Chords in 1998, who released the band's next three albums before being dropped from the label in 2005, when they signed to Abacus Records, a subsidiary of Century Media. This label released their eighth studio album Death to Tyrants in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band's next three albums). Sick of It All's latest album, The Last Act of Defiance, was released on September 30, 2014.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, the GWR began a {{modernisation}} programme to {{the earlier}} locomotives, rebuilding them to provide greater availability and more tractive effort. This {{would allow them to}} undertake their original mixed-traffic duties on a wider selection of routes, as well as banking. The 3100 class were to be rebuilt as the 3500 class, with Standard Class 4 boilers at 225psi replacing the original Standard Class 2 at 200psi, and using coupled wheels of 5 feet 3 inches diameter, which in combination took tractive effort up to 31,170 pounds. Only five engines were rebuilt pre the onset of World War II. The last of the large prairie locomotives constructed were 4140 <b>to</b> 4179, <b>built</b> <b>to</b> the <b>last</b> GWR design by British Railways at Swindon.|$|R

She was finally struck from the Navy register on 1 July 1972.|$|R
50|$|With the Lower Rhône project completed, CNR {{turned its}} {{attention}} to the Haut-Rhône (Upper Rhône), and built four hydropower dams in the 1980s: Sault-Brénaz, Brégnier-Cordon, Belley-Brens and Chautagne. It also drew up plans for the high-capacity Rhine-Rhône Waterway, along {{the route of the}} existing Canal du Rhône au Rhin, but this project was abandoned in 1997. In the period 2005-2010, navigation locks of small barge dimensions (40 by 6 m) were <b>built</b> <b>to</b> bypass the <b>last</b> two, forming a navigable waterway network with Lake Bourget, through the Canal de Savières.|$|R
2500|$|Part {{of the set}} for Seabiscuit was set in Tijuana {{during the}} Prohibition era, Oppewall and her staff {{consulting}} vintage postcards {{in order to create}} the set; she said this part of the film was especially difficult to research because, [...] "A Tijuana Historical Society didn't exactly exist back then." [...] She also built a replica of the ranch owned by Charles S. Howard, the owner of the racehorse Seabiscuit, out of fir planks. Actor Jeff Bridges, who played Howard, was so impressed with the set that he made an unsuccessful attempt to buy it and have it shipped to his property in Montana, despite Oppewall's assurances that it was just a set and was not <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last.</b> In a similar episode, the owners of the Santa Anita racetrack were so impressed with her design for a tote board that they wanted to keep it.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Britain and Ireland, {{simplicity}} and functionality prevailed in building styles. Castles, such as Alnwick Castle, Caernarfon Castle and Stirling Castle served military purpose and their battlements and turrets were practical solutions to medieval warfare. Under the feudal system that dominated Britain, {{fitness for purpose}} characterised domestic structures, particularly for the lower classes. For many, houses were [...] "dark, primitive structures {{of one or two}} rooms, usually with crude timber frames, low walls and thatched roofs. They weren't <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last.</b> And they didn't". Although primarily homes, manor houses of the Late Middle Ages, were designed with achieving respect and maintaining status through their hospitality and lordship rather than the grandeur of their buildings. In the Kingdom of England, Perpendicular style gained preference for civic and church structures throughout much of the Middle Ages. King's College Chapel in Cambridge, which started in 1446 and was completed in 1515, marks the period of transition between Perpendicular and Tudor style architecture.|$|E
2500|$|Like Peters and Waterman {{a decade}} earlier, James Collins and Jerry Porras spent years {{conducting}} empirical research on what makes great companies. Six {{years of research}} uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a core ideology that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In <b>Built</b> <b>To</b> <b>Last</b> (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure. In 2000 Collins coined the term [...] "built to flip" [...] to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized {{the concept of the}} BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).|$|E
50|$|In June 1535, John was {{appointed}} overseer of Vilnius Mint when it temporarily reopened during the Muscovite-Lithuanian War. In March 1536, Queen Bona Sforza, who disliked John, {{managed to get}} John removed from Vilnius to the Diocese of Poznań. He died there just two years later but, according <b>to</b> his <b>last</b> will, he was buried in Vilnius Cathedral. A new chapel, known as the Chapel of Bishops or Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, was <b>built</b> according <b>to</b> his <b>last</b> will around 1548. His tomb monument of Pińczów limestone was ordered by his brother Sigismund Augustus in 1556. It was designed by Giovanni Maria Mosca also known as Padovano, but did not survive.|$|R
5000|$|Conrad {{returned}} to Lowestoft and on 11 July 1878 {{signed on to}} a coastal coal schooner, the Skimmer of the Sea. He won popularity with the crew by bearing the cost of entertainment and treats, not paid out of his shilling-a-month ordinary seaman's earnings (the lowest permissible) but out of his uncle's allowance, 160 times higher. [...] "In that craft I began to learn English from East Coast chaps, each <b>built</b> as though <b>to</b> <b>last</b> for ever, and coloured like a Christmas card." [...] Having made three voyages to Newcastle upon Tyne and back in the Skimmer, after only 73 days, on 23 September, Conrad left the schooner.|$|R
50|$|The {{colonnade}} {{consists of}} three sections that were built separately {{over the course of}} the second and third century CE. The western stretch of the colonnade is the oldest and started at the West Gate near the Funerary Temple. The eastern section stretched from the Monumental Arch in the center of the town to the entrance of the Temple of Bel. The middle section was <b>built</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> connect the two separate colonnades. It met the western stretch at the Great Tetrapylon, and the eastern stretch at the Monumental Arch.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1971, with a deal for a solo album in hand and only two songs completed, Weir and Barlow began to write {{together}} for the first time. The twosome hammered out such enduring songs as [...] "Cassidy", [...] "Mexicali Blues" [...] and [...] "Black-Throated Wind", all three of which would remain in the repertoires of the Grateful Dead and of Weir's varied solo projects for years to come. Other songs to emerge from the Weir-Barlow collaboration include [...] "Looks Like Rain", [...] "Let It Grow", [...] "Money Money (Finance Blues)", [...] "Lazy Lightnin'/Supplication", [...] "The Music Never Stopped", [...] "Estimated Prophet", [...] "Heaven Help the Fool", [...] "Salt Lake City", [...] "I Need a Miracle", [...] "Lost Sailor", [...] "Saint of Circumstance", [...] "Hell in a Bucket", [...] "Throwing Stones", [...] "My Brother Esau" [...] and [...] "Picasso Moon". In 1979, Barlow began collaborating with Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland, a partnership that culminated in four songs on 1989's <b>Built</b> <b>to</b> <b>Last.</b> He also wrote one song ("The Devil I Know") with Vince Welnick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chiefs! Our road is not <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> a {{thousand}} years, {{yet in a}} sense it is. When a road is once built, it is a strange thing how it collects traffic, how every year, as it goes on, {{more and more people}} are found to walk thereon and others are raised up to repair and perpetuate it and keep it alive; so that perhaps even this road of ours may, from reparation to reparation, continue to exist and be useful hundreds and hundreds of years after we are mingled in the dust. And it is my hope that our far-away descendants may remember and bless those who laboured for them to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|Stonebridge lay in {{the center}} of a fertile valley {{surrounded}} by pink cliffs. It must have been a very old town, certainly far older than Bluff or Monticello, though smaller, and evidently it had been <b>built</b> <b>to</b> <b>last.</b> There was one main street, very wide, that divided the town and was crossed at right angles by a stream spanned by a small natural stone bridge. A line of poplar-trees shaded each foot-path. The little log cabins and stone houses and cottages were half hidden in foliage now tinted with autumn colors. Toward the center of the town the houses and stores and shops fronted upon the street and along one side of a green square, or plaza. Here were situated several edifices, the most prominent of which was a church built of wood, whitewashed, and remarkable, according to Withers, for the fact that not a nail had been used in its construction. Beyond the church was a large, low structure of stone, with a split-shingle roof, and evidently this was the town hall.|$|E
