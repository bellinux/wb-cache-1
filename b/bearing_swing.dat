50|$|The house {{structure}} {{contains the}} operator's compartment, engine compartment, hydraulic pump and distribution components. The house structure {{is attached to}} the top of the undercarriage via a <b>swing</b> <b>bearing.</b> The house, along with the workgroup, is able to rotate or slew upon the undercarriage without limit due to a hydraulic distribution valve which supplies oil to the undercarriage components.|$|R
40|$|The motion {{characteristics}} of a slipper bearing in the swash plate type piston pump and motor have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. The motion of the slipper bearing has been measured by means of eddy current displacement sensors. The mathematical model of the slipper bearing has been indicated considering asperity contacts of surface roughness, comparing experimental results. It is found that (1) the numerical calculation results correspond to experimental ones, (2) the slipper <b>bearing</b> may <b>swing</b> at the same cycle as rotation of the swash plate, (3) {{the motion of the}} slipper bearing in pumping action differs greatly from that in motoring action, and (4) the friction phenomena between the cylinder and the piston, and on the spherical bearing affect on the motion of the slipper bearing...|$|R
40|$|Porch <b>swing</b> <b>bearing</b> for {{the linear}} {{motion of the}} mirror in Michelson {{interferometer}} for mid-infrared low resolution Fourier transform spectrometer was studied experimentally using the modulation depth of the collimated laser beam. The mirror tilting {{was measured to be}} lower than 5 μrad over 3 [*]mm mirror travel using two different bearings assemblies. Additionally, the manufacturing tolerances of the bearing type were proved to be loose enough not to limit the interferometer application. These demonstrate that the porch swing without any adjustment mechanisms provides the sufficient motion linearity...|$|R
40|$|Conventional knee-ankle-foot orthoses (KAFOs) or leg braces {{lock the}} knee in full {{extension}} and therefore {{do not permit}} a natural gait pattern. A new electro-mechanical dynamic knee-ankle-foot orthosis (DKAFO) that incorporates a new dynamic knee joint (DKJ) was {{designed to provide a}} more natural gait for people with knee extensor muscle weakness. The DKAFO inhibits knee flexion while allowing knee extension during weight <b>bearing.</b> During <b>swing</b> or other non-weight bearing activities, the DKAFO allows free knee motion. A prototype knee joint was mechanically tested to determine the moment at failure, loading behaviour, and device safety. Quantitative kinematic gait analysis of three able-bodied subjects and three KAFO users showed that walking with the DKAFO had a minimal effect on normal gait. The DKAFO offered increased knee motion in swing and a reduction in gait abnormalities for some subjects with disabilities. Future efforts will be made to modify the design to increase the factor of safety, and reduce DKJ dimensions...|$|R
50|$|The sixth Aerocar (N4345F) {{is painted}} red with silver wings. It {{was the final}} flying car effort by Moulton Taylor. The vehicle began life {{as one of the}} {{original}} Aerocars, but Taylor bought it back from a customer after it had been damaged in an accident {{on the ground in the}} 1960s. From there, he considerably re-built it as the Aerocar III, replacing the original cabin with a sleeker, more streamlined front wheel drive one (although it still fell far short of the sporty lines that Taylor had originally wanted to give it). The automotive unit weighed 1,100 lbs and was powered by a 140 hp Lycoming O-320. The trailer wheels for the wings in towed configuration were deployable from a compartment on the outside of each wing leading edge. The propeller driveshaft contains fine ball <b>bearings</b> that <b>swing</b> outward with centrifugal force, creating stiffness and dampening. Taylor was able to attract some interest from Ford, but ultimately, no production resulted. The single prototype is now displayed at Seattle's Museum of Flight, where it is displayed wearing registration N100D.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1913, the GIBC has renovated and {{expanded}} the Toll Bridge. It also performed major repairs {{to the bridge}} after freighters struck a large section of the span in 1965 and again in 1992. The GIBC replaced the bridge deck in 1986, built a new central <b>swing</b> <b>bearing</b> in 1994, and opened a toll plaza in Riverview in 2004. Funding for the improvements and normal maintenance of the bridge is generated from the user fee toll charged by the GIBC. The one-way toll for crossing the bridge is $2.50 (if cash is used), or $2.00 (if a [...] "Bridge Pass" [...] is used). The GIBC has received numerous awards praising its maintenance projects for the Toll Bridge from Michigan-based and national infrastructure and engineering {{organizations such as the}} American Society of Civil Engineers, American Consulting Engineers Council, and Consulting Engineers Council of Michigan.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{based on}} the {{classical}} Archard adhesion wear theory, a three-dimensional finite element model was established, {{with the aim of}} simulating the failure process of self-lubricating spherical plain <b>bearings</b> in the <b>swinging</b> wear condition. The results show that the self-lubricating spherical plain bearings go through two different stages during the wear process, namely, initial wear stage and stable wear stage. Because the large contact points wear out during the initial wear stage, the maximum contact pressure decreases as the test period increases. The relatively larger wear depth region shows elliptical distribution, and the maximum distribution appears in the central contact area. The wear depth reaches 0.974 mm after swinging 25, 000 times. PTFE fibers, which possess a good friction performance but poor abrasion resistance, abundantly exist on the friction surfaces of the fabric liner. Consequently, the friction torque during the initial wear stage is slightly smaller than the friction torque during the stable wear stage; however, the wear rate during the initial wear stage is high. The reliability and effectiveness of the finite element model are verified by experiment. The developed finite element model can be used for the analysis of the wear mechanisms of bearings and the prediction of the service life of bearings.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to develop a method for easy {{assembly}} of the bearing in the housing by standardized way. The assembly of bearing should take place on the atomized set up. Based on this method a assembly setup was constructed which enables to assembly of the shaft with bearing of different models of jaw crusher. First tests were done with manual alignment and it shows that with proper alignment shaft assembly is very easy operation and also safe. Results of those tests show that the developed system provides as good or better results than the manual assembly method by placing on wooden block and aligns by using jacking. The alignment process itself runs automatically. The results are reliable, independent form the user and reproducible. Furthermore the whole assembling of the bearings on a shaft should be automated without to interrupt the process of mounting in order to fatigue for assembler and misalignment in bearing. the assembly of the shaft with <b>bearing</b> in the <b>swing</b> jaw is very critical as well important so it needs attention because any mistake can cause the failuare of the system which result in breakdown and also the bearing failure which is the highest cost element. so the propose system eliminate the manual alignment and the safety issue and also the problem of incorrect assembly of the bearing in jaw by aligning the jaw bore and then only pushing the shaft in straight line so there is no shock load on the bearing which may result the misplacement and misalignment of thr roller in the bearing housin...|$|R
40|$|The {{interferometer}} for {{low resolution}} portable Fourier Transform middle infrared spectrometer {{was developed and}} studied experimentally. The final aim was a concept for a commercial prototype. Because of the portability, the interferometer should be compact sized and insensitive to the external temperature variations and mechanical vibrations. To minimise the size and manufacturing costs, Michelson interferometer based on plane mirrors and porch <b>swing</b> <b>bearing</b> was selected and no dynamic alignment system was applied. The driving motor was a linear voice coil actuator to avoid mechanical contact of the moving parts. The driving capability for low mirror driving velocities required by the photoacoustic detectors was studied. In total, four versions of such an interferometer were built and experimentally studied. The thermal stability during the external temperature variations and the alignment stability over the mirror travel were measured using the modulation depth of the wide diameter laser beam. Method for estimating the mirror tilt angle from the modulation depth was developed to take account the effect from the non-uniform intensity distribution of the laser beam. The spectrometer stability was finally studied also using the infrared radiation. The latest interferometer was assembled for the middle infrared spectrometer with spectral range from 750 cm− 1 to 4500 cm− 1. The interferometer size was (197 × 95 × 79) mm 3 with the beam diameter of 25 mm. The alignment stability as the change of the tilt angle over the mirror travel of 3 mm was 5 μrad, which decreases the modulation depth only about 0. 7 percent in infrared at 3000 cm− 1. During the temperature raise, the modulation depth at 3000 cm− 1 changed about 1... 2 percentage units per Celsius over short term and even less than 0. 2 percentage units per Celsius over the total temperature raise of 30 °C. The unapodised spectral resolution was 4 cm− 1 limited by the aperture size. The best achieved {{signal to noise ratio}} was about 38 000 : 1 with commercially available DLaTGS detector. Although the vibration sensitivity requires still improving, the interferometer performed, as a whole, very well and could be further developed to conform all the requirements of the portable and stable spectrometer...|$|R
