25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{may occur}} at birth or develop in early life. Risk factors include family history, certain swaddling practices, and <b>breech</b> <b>birth.</b> If one identical twin is affected, {{there is a}} 40% risk the other will also be affected. Screening all babies for the condition by physical examination is recommended. Ultrasonography may also be useful.|$|E
25|$|Caesarean section, {{also known}} as C-section or {{caesarean}} delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies. A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, <b>breech</b> <b>birth,</b> problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the most}} notable {{passages}} in the Zuo zhuan describe succession crises, which {{seem to have been}} fairly common in China during the Spring and Autumn period. [...] These crises often involved the [...] "tangled affections" [...] of the various rulers, and are described in a dramatic and vivid manner that gives insight into the life of the aristocratic elite in the China of the mid-1st millennium. [...] The best known of these stories is that of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, who ruled the State of Zheng from 743 to 701. [...] Duke Zhuang was born [...] "in a manner that startled" [...] his mother (probably <b>breech</b> <b>birth),</b> which caused her to later seek to persuade her husband to name Duke Zhuang's younger brother as the heir apparent instead of him. [...] The story ends with eventual reconciliation between mother and sonexemplifying the traditional Chinese virtues of both [...] "ritual propriety" [...] (lǐ) and [...] "filial piety" [...] (xiào)which has made it consistently popular with readers over the centuries.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the later}} stages of pregnancy, the cervix {{may already have}} opened up to 1-3 cm (or more in rarer circumstances), but during labor, {{repeated}} uterine contractions lead to further widening of the cervix to about 6 centimeters. From that point, pressure from the presenting part (head in vertex births or bottom in <b>breech</b> <b>births),</b> along with uterine contractions, will dilate the cervix to 10 centimeters, which is [...] "complete." [...] Cervical dilation is accompanied by effacement, the thinning of the cervix.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, Hollier et al. [19] found a high {{frequency}} of complications during pregnancy and delivery in their small retrospective study of 11 patients, and Ho et al. [18] found {{higher rates of}} assisted <b>breech</b> <b>births,</b> instrumental deliveries and cesarean sections, which led them to conclude that birth trauma {{appears to be the}} main etiological factor in CMT. Suzuki et al. [17] suggested that stretching of the SCM muscle during delivery may be a direct cause of CMT. In our population only a few cases experienced moderate birth trauma: mainly those delivered with vacuum extraction. In general, most of the studies [17 – 19] had only examined fetal presentation and delivery mode, lacking more specific information from obstetric and neonatal medical records.|$|R

In her midwife work she utilized herbs and prenatal massage to deliver <b>breech</b> <b>births.</b> Lucero received payment for her work, including vegetables and food. She served as a midwife until the age of 80 and, dying at the age of 104, she attributed her long life to her Catholic faith.|$|R
500|$|Frederick {{proposed}} to Victoria in 1855, {{when she was}} 14 years old. The betrothal of the young couple was announced on May 19, 1857 at Buckingham Palace and the Prussian Court, and their marriage took place on 25 January 1858 in the Chapel Royal of St. James's Palace, London. To mark the occasion, Frederick was promoted to Major-General in the Prussian army. Although it was an arranged marriage, the newlyweds were compatible from the start and their marriage was a loving one; Victoria too had received a liberal education and shared her husband's views. Of the two, Victoria was the dominant one in the relationship. The couple often resided at the Crown Prince's Palace and had eight children: Wilhelm in 1859, Charlotte in 1860, Henry in 1862, Sigismund in 1864, Victoria in 1866, Waldemar in 1868, Sophia in 1870 and Margaret in 1872. Sigismund {{died at the age}} of 2 and Waldemar at age 11, and their eldest son, Wilhelm, suffered from a withered armprobably due to his difficult and dangerous <b>breech</b> <b>birth,</b> although it could have also resulted from a mild case of cerebral palsy. Wilhelm, who became emperor after Frederick's death, shared none of his parent's liberal ideas; his mother viewed him as a [...] "complete Prussian". This difference in ideology created a rift between Wilhelm and his parents, and relations between them were strained throughout their lives.|$|E

30|$|Of the {{children}} born at AUH, 19 were borne by nulliparous women and three by multiparous women. One was assigned with unknown parity. Two pregnancies were gemelli, {{and one of}} the twin pregnancies was conceived by IVF. Six women had their birth induced, five with prostaglandin and one with artificial rupture of the membranes, and a total of ten women received syntocinon to augment labor. In total, 17 children were in vertex presentation, two in unspecified cephalic presentation and four in breech presentation. Five children were delivered by cesarean section. Of those born vaginally, five children were delivered by vacuum extraction, and two children were assisted vaginal <b>breech</b> <b>births.</b> The second stage of labor for the vaginal births was on average 32  min, ranging from 4 to 105  min.|$|R
40|$|Objective: A large trial {{published}} in 2000 concluded that planned vaginal delivery of term <b>breech</b> <b>births</b> {{is associated with}} high neonatal risks. Because the obstetric practices in that study differed from those in Countries where planned vaginal delivery is still common, we conducted an observational prospective study to describe neonatal Outcome according to the planned mode of delivery for term <b>breech</b> <b>births</b> in 2 such countries. Study design: Observational prospective study with an intent-to-treat analysis to compare the groups for which cesarean and vaginal deliveries were planned. Associations between the outcome and planned mode of delivery were controlled for confounding by multivariate analysis. The main outcome measure was a variable that combined fetal and neonatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity. The study Population consisted of 8105 pregnant women delivering singleton fetuses in breech presentation at term in 138 French and 36 Belgian maternity units. Results: Cesarean delivery was planned for 5579 women (68. 8 %) and vaginal delivery for 2526 (31. 2 %). Of the women with planned vaginal deliveries, 1796 delivered vaginally (71. 0 %). The rate of the combined neonatal outcome measure was low in the overall population (1. 59 %; 95 %, Cl [1. 33 - 1. 89]) and in the planned vaginal delivery group (1. 60 %; 95 % CI [1. 14 - 2. 17]). It {{did not differ significantly}} between the planned vaginal and cesarean delivery groups (unadjusted odds ratio 1. 10, 95 % CI [0. 75 - 1. 61]), even after controlling for confounding variables (adjusted odds ratio 1. 40, 95 % CI [0. 89 - 2. 23]). Conclusion: In places where planned vaginal delivery is a common practice and when strict criteria are met before and during labor, planned vaginal delivery of singleton fetuses in breech presentation at term remains a safe option that can be offered to women.

50|$|A midwife is a {{professional}} in midwifery, specializing in pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum, women's sexual and reproductive health (including annual gynecological exams, family planning, menopausal care and others), and newborn care.They are also educated and trained to recognise the variations of normal progress of labor, and understand {{how to deal with}} deviations from normal. They may intervene in high risk situations such as <b>breech</b> <b>births,</b> twin births and births where the baby is in a posterior position, using non-invasive techniques. When a pregnant woman requires care beyond the midwife's scope of practice, they refer women to obstetricians or perinatologists who are medical specialists in complications related to pregnancy and birth, including surgical and instrumental deliveries. In many parts of the world, these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care, and in yet other countries many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives.|$|R
2500|$|Though vaginal {{birth is}} {{possible}} for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal <b>breech</b> <b>birth.</b> The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section {{as studies have shown}} increased risks of morbidity and mortality for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal <b>breech</b> <b>birth</b> for this reason. [...] As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.|$|E

40|$|Background Vaginal breech {{delivery}} can be {{a difficult}} obstetric procedure. The well-known Term Breech Trial concluded that planned elective caesarean section at term was safer for the babies than planned vaginal birth. This resulted in widespread adoption of protocols favouring planned caesarean section for breech presentation.
