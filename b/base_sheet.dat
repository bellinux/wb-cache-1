40|$|Graphene <b>based</b> <b>sheets</b> have stimulated great {{interest}} {{due to their}} superior mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. A general visualization method that allows quick observation of these single atomic layers would be highly desirable as it can greatly facilitate sample evaluation and manipulation, and provide immediate feedback to improve synthesis and processing strategies. Here we report that graphene <b>based</b> <b>sheets</b> can be made highly visible under a fluorescence microscope by quenching the emission from a dye coating, which can be conveniently removed afterwards by rinsing without disrupting the sheets. Current imaging techniques for graphene <b>based</b> <b>sheets</b> rely {{on the use of}} special substrates. In contrast, the fluorescence quenching mechanism is no longer limited by the types of substrates. Graphene, reduced graphene oxide, or even graphene oxide sheets deposited on arbitrary substrates can now be readily visualized by eye with good contrast for layer counting. Direct observation of suspended sheets in solution was also demonstrated. The fluorescence quenching microscopy offers unprecedented imaging flexibility and could become a general tool for characterizing graphene based materials. Comment: J. Am. Chem.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this research}} is to explore two separate approaches for improving the growth of microalgae that can be potentially used for producing fuels and chemicals. One approach was to use optical light filters, which selectivity filter natural light allowing certain wavelengths into the culture systems. The other study is to use an algal growth system with different bio-renewable materials being used as attachment materials. Both studies demonstrated increased biomass productivity {{and the ability to}} scale-up. In {{the first part of the}} study, the research involving the use of optical light filters for microalgal growth in different cultivation systems included flask culture systems, flat panel photobioreactors, and rotating algal biofilm (RAB) systems. The optical light filters allow a specific range of wavelengths to pass through, while reflecting harmful wavelengths such as UV and IR. Two thin film light filters were fabricated for this research. One light filter allows both red and blue wavelengths to penetrate through (termed as blue filter) while the other allows the penetration of wavelengths in the red spectrum (termed as red-filter). Both filters resulted in increased biomass productivities when microalgae were grown in the flat panel photobioreactors and the RAB systems. When the blue filter was used for the culture, the biomass productivity increased 31. 9 % in flat panel photobioreactors and 99. 8 % in RAB systems; while the red filter resulted in an increase of 34. 1 % in the continuous operation of the flat panel photobioreactor. These results provide evidence that the use of these filters have the ability to enhance algal yield. The second part of this study used different bio-renewable materials as an attachment substrate for algal growth. An initial test was performed to screen the material that can result in the highest amount of attached biomass. It was found that the soy protein <b>based</b> <b>sheet</b> showed the greatest amount of algal attachment. Compared to the suspended cell growth of the control, the biomass productivity from the soy protein <b>based</b> <b>sheets</b> increased by 294 %. However, significant deterioration was observed from the soy protein <b>based</b> <b>sheet</b> after 20 days. To alleviate the dissolving of materials and enhance the integrity, poly-lactic acid was integrated into the soy protein <b>based</b> <b>sheet.</b> After this integration the attachment material displayed a significant amount of rigidity allowing for a longer duration of experimentation. However, the productivity from the PLA integrated soy protein <b>based</b> <b>sheet</b> displayed a certain degree of decreasing biomass yield compared to the 100 % soy protein <b>based</b> <b>sheet.</b> Collectively, the PLA integrated sheet still demonstrated adequate performance in terms of cell growth improvement and material longevity. In summary, this study shows that the use of the optical light filters and bio-renewable <b>based</b> <b>sheets</b> for attached algal growth are two viable approaches for enhancing algal growth performance. However, these two approaches need to be further optimized in order to be implemented at a large scale...|$|R

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} effect of twonewbase doping profiles on the base transit time of a GaAs npn heterojunction bipolar transistor. The doping in a region close to the collector is reduced either by a doping grade or a stepwise reduction.

By focusing these doping changes adjacent to the collector, the amount of low-doped base material and the resulting increase in <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> resistance can be minimized. For both a step change in doping or graded doping change a 10 % decrease in base transittime is achieved while only causing a 4 % increase in <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> resistance.

40|$|Print quality {{demands for}} coated papers are {{steadily}} growing, and achieving coating uniformity {{is crucial for}} high image sharpness, colour fidelity, and print uniformity. Coating uniformity may {{be divided into two}} scales: coating thickness uniformity and coating microstructure uniformity, the latter of which includes pigment, pore and binder distributions within the coating layer. This thesis concerns the investigation of both types of coating uniformity by using an approach of quantitative microscopy. First, coating thickness uniformity was analysed by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of paper cross sections, and the relationships between local coating thickness variations and the variations of underlying <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> structures were determined. Special attention was given to the effect of length scales on the coating thickness vs. <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> structure relationships. The experimental results showed that coating thickness had a strong correlation with surface height (profile) of <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> at a small length scale. However, at a large length scale, it was mass density of <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> (formation) that had the strongest correlation with coating thickness. This result explains well the discrepancies found in the literature for the relationship between coating thickness variation and <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> structure variations. The total variance of coating thickness, however, was dominated by the surface height variation in the small scale, which explained around 50 % of the variation. Autocorrelation analyses were further performed for the same data set. The autocorrelation functions showed a close resemblance of the one for a random shot process with a correlation length in the order of fibre width. All these results suggest that coating thickness variations are the result of random deposition of particles with the correlation length determined by the <b>base</b> <b>sheet</b> surface textures, such as fibre width. In order to obtain fundamental understandings of the random deposition processes on a rough surface, such as in paper, a generic particle deposition model was developed, and systematic analyses were performed for the effects of particle size, coat weight (average number of particles), levelling, and system size on coating thickness variation. The results showed that coating thickness variation 3 grows with coat weight, but beyond a certain coat weight, it reaches a plateau value. A scaling analysis yielded a universal relationship between coating thickness variation and the above mentioned variables. The correlation length of coating thickness was found to be determined by average coat weight and the state of underlying surfaces. For a rough surface at relatively low coat weight, the correlation length was typically in the range of fibre width, as was also observed experimentally. Non-uniformities within the coating layer, such as porosity variations and binder distributions, are investigated by using a newly developed method: field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) in combination with argon ion beam milling technique. The combination of these two techniques produced extremely high quality images with very few artefacts, which are particularly suited for quantitative analyses of coating structures. A new evaluation method was also developed by using marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS) of the secondary electron images (SEI). The high resolution imaging revealed that binder enrichment, a long disputed subject in the area, is present in a thin layer of a 500 nm thickness both at the coating surface and at the base sheet/coating interface. It was also found that the binders almost exclusively fill up the small pores, whereas the larger pores are mainly empty or depleted of binder...|$|E
