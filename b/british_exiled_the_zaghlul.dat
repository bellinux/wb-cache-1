5000|$|The French Rite {{is intimately}} {{linked to the}} birth of Freemasonry in France and was founded in France in 1786. [...] <b>British</b> <b>exiles</b> brought <b>the</b> Modern rite to France and this was little by little passed onto the French Rite. Though this hybrid form is no longer known as the French Rite, it {{sometimes}} takes that name to distinguish it from the Scottish Rites from which it was initially formed. In order to guarantee that French Freemasonry would have a national dimension, the Grand Orient de France organised the standardisation of [...] "Modern" [...] hexagonal (or French, from the perceived shape of the country) rites from 1782 onwards, and in 1785 the model was fixed for the first three degrees in a [...] "blue lodge", which showed a strong English influence in contrast to the Scottish Rites. However, it was only in 1801 that the Grand Orient de France printed the rules of this rite under the title Régulateur du Maçon, containing several additions and amendments to the former version, which had circulated from lodge to lodge in discrete manuscript form. The Rite underwent several further reforms, and in 1858 the [...] "Murat French Rite" [...] (returning to the foundations of the Constitutions of Anderson without making lasting change to the rite) was imposed.|$|R
25|$|Saad <b>Zaghlul</b> and <b>the</b> Wafd Party led the Egyptian {{nationalist}} movement. The Wafd was {{the first}} organised mass party in Egypt.

This proved to be the final straw for many and in protest Egyptian society rose to demonstrate against the British in what was the country's first modern Revolution.|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on {{interpretation}} of poetry of Czech authors in <b>British</b> <b>exile</b> during World War II. While examining individual collections, the poems are viewed {{in the context of}} simultaneous domestic poetry in the 30 ?s and 40 ?s of the 20 th century. The main aim of the thesis is to catch the experience of a lyrical subject in <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> background. Another important part of this thesis is also a chapter which is dealing with cultural background in <b>British</b> <b>exile,</b> since this element, understandably, influenced the life of Czechoslovakian emigrants and our artists. Contemporary anthologies which were published in <b>British</b> <b>exile</b> during World War II are analysed in this chapter, as well. Another topic which is mentioned briefly in the thesis is the historical context which is closely connected with the later artists? departure and their works...|$|R

50|$|In April-May 1941, Greece was {{overrun by}} German forces, {{and the country}} was {{occupied}} by the Germans, the Italians and the Bulgarians. Soon, resistance movements began to emerge, the principal one being the National Liberation Front (Greek: Εθνικό Απελευθερωτικό Μέτωπο, Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo, EAM). On 9 September, the National Republican Greek League was founded with funding from <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> proclaiming <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> and completely unaware Plastiras as its president. On the same day however, Pyromaglou left for Greece as Plastiras' representative. After arriving in Athens on September 23, he quickly established contact with officers and politicians.

5|$|Hoping {{to extend}} the Continental System and choke off British trade with the European mainland, Napoleon invaded Iberia and {{declared}} his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, featured extensive guerrilla warfare, and ended in victory for the Allies. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. Unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, the Russians routinely violated the Continental System and enticed Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major invasion of Russia {{in the summer of}} 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the collapse of the Grand Army and the destruction of Russian cities, and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. The Allies then invaded France and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was <b>exiled</b> to <b>the</b> island of Elba near Rome and the Bourbons were restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>exiled</b> him to <b>the</b> remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.|$|R

5000|$|During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Lala Chunnamal {{emerged as}} one of the wealthiest men in Delhi, having astutely read which way the wind was blowing, and made a vast fortune {{supplying}} provisions to the British. He had also refused a request for a loan from Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar himself. Having refused the Emperor, he had left the city overnight after having previously sent much of his wealth out of the city secretly. After the hostilities ended, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> ordered <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> (forcible removal) of all Muslims from the city of Delhi. At this time, Lala Chunnamal made another fortune by purchasing the properties of the departing nobility at throwaway prices. These events were viewed with dismay by the cultured gentry of the city, and the poet Mirza Ghalib specifically mentioned the name of Lala Chunnamal while lamenting that men of low birth and less honour, like Chunnamal, were crowing and exulting in their glittering [...] "illuminated mansions," [...] while honourable men of old and noble families were [...] "sifting the dirt" [...] after being trampled down by the British.|$|R
5000|$|During her brother's reign, Yaa Asantewaa saw the Ashanti Confederacy {{go through}} a series of events that {{threatened}} its future, including civil war from 1883 to 1888.

When <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>exiled</b> him to <b>the</b> Seychelles in 1896, along with the King of Asante Prempeh I {{and other members of the}} Asante government, Yaa Asantewaa became regent of the Ejisu-Juaben district. After the deportation of PrempehI, the British governor-general of the Gold Coast, Frederick Hodgson, demanded the Golden Stool, the symbol of the Asante nation. This request led to a secret meeting of the remaining members of the Asante government at Kumasi, to discuss how to secure the return of their king. There was a disagreement among those present on how to go about this. Yaa Asantewaa, who was present at this meeting, stood and addressed the members of the council with these now-famous words: [...] Now I have seen that some of you fear to go forward to fight for our king. If it were the brave days of Osei Tutu, Okomfo Anokye and Opuku Ware I, chiefs would not sit down to see their king taken without firing a shot. No white man could have dared to speak to the Chief of Asante in the way the governor spoke to you chiefs this morning. Is it true that the bravery of Asante is no more? I cannot believe it. It cannot be! I must say this: if you, the men of Asante, will not go forward, then we will. I shall call upon my fellow women. We will fight the white men. We will fight till the last of us falls on the battlefield.|$|R
