5|$|Upper {{secondary}} education or framhaldsskóli (lit. “continued school”), follows lower {{secondary education}}. These schools are {{also known as}} gymnasia in English. It is not compulsory, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> who has had their compulsory education {{has the right to}} upper secondary education. The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in vocational courses. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 2007. Like all other schools in Iceland, upper secondary schools are mixed sex.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E

5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> denies finding any space cash.|$|E
5|$|The telethon's {{talent pool}} becomes {{so low that}} Leslie is forced to flip a coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they could talk about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E
5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack.

5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

The infamous Bakaro arms markets has been closed.

25|$|The first {{effective}} labor {{organization that}} was more than regional in membership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The Knights believed in the unity of the interests of all producing groups and sought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> who could be truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of all producers led to explosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of Terence V. Powderly they championed a variety of causes, sometimes through political or cooperative ventures.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E

At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, <b>but</b> <b>everyone</b> agrees that this is the best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets.|$|E

The Gardeners were with Poirot the entire time. Rosamund was seen reading at Sunny Ledge (above Pixy Cove) by Emily and Patrick. Rev.

Earlier in the day, Miss Brewster was nearly hit on the head by an empty bottle tossed {{from one of the}} bedroom windows, so Poirot asks the chambermaid if she has observed a bottle missing.
