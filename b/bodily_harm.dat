5|$|The {{remaining}} twelve defendants {{pleaded not}} guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> with intent and conspiracy to riot. On 7 December 1992 David Bowen and Mark Azzopardi escaped from the prison van transferring them from HM Prison Hull to the court. Azzopardi was recaptured, before escaping from the court on 17 February 1993 along with five of the other defendants.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{scientific}} achievements {{in the field of}} forensic medical examination and physics have been elucidated in the article. The aim of the research was the search and development of the latest lazer polarimetric criteria of diagnostics of intravital and postmortem changes of biological tissues and media of a human being to solve the questions of forensic medicine science and practice, specifically determination of the prescription of death coming at its different causes, time of hematoma forming, intravital formation of <b>bodily</b> <b>harms</b> and diagnostics of myocardial ischemia. Investigation of biological tissues (samples of the skin, skeletal and cardiac muscles, brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen and small intestine) and hematomas of the organs (brain, liver, kidneys, spleen) by lazer polarimetric methods with the subsequent statistical processing of the results were conducted during the research. The result of the scientists'work has become studying and mastering a number of physical methods, successfully and effectively used, to realize the purpose which was set: lazer statistical polarimetry of postmortem pictures of the native tissue sections of the cadavers; polarizational mapping of postmortem pictures of the native tissue sections of the cadavers; elements of Muller's matrix, Stoks polarimetry of postmortem pictures of the native tissue sections of the cadavers; methods of polarizational matrix; a number of methods of spectral phasometry of lazer pictures, statistical analysis of coordinate distribution of a degree of depolarization and phase displacements, statistical, correlative and fractal approaches in analysis of lazer pictures of biological tissues and organism media. A number of peculiarities and appropriatenesses of change of lazer beam properties as a result of passing through biological tissue has been established and schemes of studying different types of tissues have been founded when carrying out and numerical investigations.

40|$|History and Objectives: Accidents {{are major}} medical {{problems}} and predication of such events is important preventive measures. It {{is the most}} important factor for mortality and morbidity among individuals under the age of 45. The aim of the present study is to understand epidemiology basis of such events in order to prevent them. Materials and Methods: Existing data at the Ali-Ebn Abitable Emergency Center of Rafsanjan was taken and 200 such records taken randomly were the basis of the present study. Results: 73. 8 of accidents victims were male and 72 were under 30 years of age. Fall in from high altitude (40. 5), motor vehicle related accidents (25. 8) and injuries due to foreign objects (17. 2) were the most prevalent type of accidents. Youngest age group (16 Â± 4) were involved with sports related accidents and the oldest age group (28 Â± 31) were injured by animals. Head injuries (53), other body injuries (36) and multiple <b>bodily</b> <b>harms</b> (6. 1) were the most prevalent type of body injuries. 72. 3 of patients were treated at out patient clinic, 27. 3 were hospitalized and 0. 4 died from injuries. Head injuries were the most probable cause mortality and morbidity. Conclusion: High rate injuries at younger age especially, motor vehicle related accidents, falling from high altitude and head injuries demand offering education of motor vehicle laws and regulation and taking into consideration of safety points in order to prevent falling from altitude.

40|$|Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. BACKGROUND: Recent {{research}} shows that by age 5, children form rigid social hierarchies, with some children consistently subordinated, and then later, bullied. Further, several studies suggest that enduring mental and physical harm follow. It is time to analyze the health burdens posed by early social dominance and to consider the ethical implications of ongoing socially caused harms. METHODS: First, we reviewed research demonstrating the health impact of early childhood subordination. Second, we used philosophical conceptions of children's rights and social justice to consider whether children {{have a right to}} protection and who has an obligation to protect them from social harms. RESULTS: Collectively, recent studies show that early subordination is instantiated biologically, increasing lifetime physical and mental health problems. The pervasive, and enduring nature of these harms leads us to argue that children {{have a right to be}} protected. Further, society has a role responsibility to protect children because society conscripts children into schools. Society 's promise to parents that schools will be fiduciaries entails an obligation to safeguard each child's right to a reasonably open future. Importantly, this role responsibility holds independently of bearing any causal responsibility for the harm. This new argument based on protecting from harm is much stronger than previous equality of opportunity arguments, and applies broadly to other social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Social institutions have a role responsibility to protect children that is not dependent on playing a causal role in the harm. Children's rights to protection from social harms can be as strong as their rights to protection from direct <b>bodily</b> <b>harms...</b>|$|R

The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid <b>bodily</b> <b>harm,</b> partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

2500|$|Genocide is the {{deliberate}} and systematic destruction, {{in whole or}} in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious or national group. The term was coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin. It is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) of 1948 as [...] "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, {{in whole or in}} part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious <b>bodily</b> or mental <b>harm</b> to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [...] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group." ...|$|R
