5|$|The BOK Tower, built {{during this}} period, is the 2nd tallest {{building}} in Oklahoma {{and the surrounding}} states of Missouri, New Mexico, Arkansas, and Kansas. Tulsa also has the third-, and fourth-tallest buildings in the state, including the Cityplex Tower, which is located in South Tulsa across from Oral Roberts University, far from downtown. One of the area's unique architectural complexes, Oral Roberts University, is built in a Post-Modern Futuristic style, incorporating <b>bright</b> <b>gold</b> structures with sharp, jetting edges and clear geometric shapes. The BOK Center, Tulsa's new arena, incorporates many of the city's most prominent themes, including Native American, art deco, and contemporary architectural styles. Intended to be an architectural icon, the building was designed by César Pelli, {{the architect of the}} Petronas Towers in Malaysia.|$|E

500|$|Twelve {{years after}} its release, Dylan said: [...] "The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on {{individual}} bands in the Blonde on Blonde album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and <b>bright</b> <b>gold,</b> with whatever that conjures up." [...] For critics, the double album {{was seen as the}} last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The three albums of this period—Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited both released in 1965, and Blonde on Blonde from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before." [...] Mike Marqusee has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as [...] "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." [...] For Patrick Humphries, [...] "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde." ...|$|E

It {{was announced}} for a September release in early June 2015. On December 18, 2015, Nina Sky announced <b>Brightest</b> <b>Gold</b> as their third studio album instead of an extended play, with a planned release in 2016. In November 2014, they announced tracks for the album. They also signed to an independent record label Tommy Boy Entertainment, LLC which will release the album.

5000|$|<b>Brightest</b> <b>Gold</b> {{was first}} {{announced}} on June 1, 2015 as an extended play (EP) for September 2015 independent release, the day its lead single [...] "Forever" [...] was released.

During {{the performance of the}} first segment and its follow up, [...] "Natalie", which was a [...] "hyperkinetically catchy" [...] "booty-shaker", a giant screen behind Mars displayed flashed images and sounds of wild animals such as panthers, gorillas and parrots, who flapped their wings in slow motion. Taking a moment to invite the audience to dance and sing along with him to the Motown and soul-funk [...] "Treasure", a giant disco ball descended from the roof reflecting dozens of <b>bright</b> <b>gold</b> lights and multi-colored laser lights flashed. The crowd responded enthusiastically to the music. The show also included several covers of songs by other artists mashed up with Mars' tracks. A cover of [...] "Money (That's What I Want)" [...] was mashed up with [...] "Billionaire" [...] and [...] "I Need a Dollar" [...] as Mars and his band [...] "gyrating" [...] with the fans. Afterwards, the stage would be colored with red, yellow and green lights during the [...] "reggae jam" [...] performance of [...] "Show Me". He then performed a [...] "90's-R homage" [...] along with [...] "demure sexual come-ons" [...] by covering Soul For Real's [...] "Candy Rain" [...] and Ginuwine's [...] "Pony". The latter was blended into the singer's [...] "Our First Time". In the latter's medleys, Mars would sing R. Kelly's [...] "Ignition (Remix)" [...] and Sister Nancy's [...] "Bam Bam". These covers would vary upon concert and could also include Ghost Town DJs’ [...] "My Boo, Aaliyah’s [...] "Rock the Boat", [...] "Every Little Step" [...] by Bobby Brown, Mad Cobra's [...] "Flex" [...] and Lloyd’s [...] "Secret Admirer". [...] "Marry You", the following track on the setlist, showed [...] "the pleading doo-wop accents". In some venues it was preceded by The Desires' [...] "Let It Please Be You".|$|E

5000|$|... "Old {{gold and}} blue", the {{official}} University colors, were {{selected by the}} upperclassmen of 1890 from the West Virginia state seal. While the official school colors are old gold and blue, a <b>brighter</b> <b>gold</b> is used in official university logos and merchandise. This change in color scheme is often cited {{for the lack of}} a universal standard for colors during the 19th century when the university's colors were selected. Additionally, the <b>brighter</b> <b>gold</b> is argued to create a more intimidating environment for sporting events. The university accepts [...] "gold and blue" [...] for the color scheme, but states clearly that the colors are not [...] "blue and gold", to distinguish West Virginia from its rival, the University of Pittsburgh.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{changes in}} season two {{included}} a slight redesign (again by Donald Lee Feld, still credited as [...] "Donfeld") of Wonder Woman's uniform. The bustier was more flexible, featured less gold metal in the eagle wings {{in favor of}} red cloth background, and was cut lower to highlight Carter's décolletage and cleavage. The star-spangled bottoms were cut higher in the thighs, {{with the number of}} stars reduced, stopping below her hips, and rearranged in a more symmetrical starburst pattern. [...] The bracelets changed from dull silver-grey to <b>bright</b> <b>gold,</b> and were noticeably smaller and thinner. Her tiara, appearing unchanged when on Wonder Woman's head, would flatten to become a boomerang, and its ruby star functioned as a communications link to Paradise Island and her mother the queen.|$|E
2500|$|LSU's Tiger Stadium uniquely sports [...] "H" [...] style (or [...] "offset") goal posts, {{as opposed}} to the more modern [...] "Y" [...] ("slingshot" [...] or [...] "tuning fork") style used by other schools today, {{although}} they are not the true [...] "H" [...] goal posts which were once ubiquitous on American football fields, since the posts are behind the uprights and connected to the uprights by curved bars. This [...] "H" [...] style allows the team to run through the goal post in the north end zone when entering the field. Tiger Stadium is one of only three Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) schools college stadiums in the nation who still uses the H style goal posts. The only other FBS stadiums that use goalposts with two posts all season are Doak Campbell Stadium at Florida State and Martin Stadium at Washington State. Many other schools use the two post goals during rivalry games only to prevent them from being torn down in victory, a real safety concern in recent years. They received special permission from the NCAA prior to the November 20, 1993 game against Tulane in conjunction with LSU's football centennial; NCAA rules have since changed to permit the use of two uprights full-time. These goal posts remained intact for the four New Orleans Saints games held in 2005, with dispensation from the NFL. Under NFL rules in place since 1967, goalposts for NFL games must be slingshot style and <b>bright</b> <b>gold</b> in color. Tiger Stadium's goalposts are white with the then-NFL-standard 30-foot uprights (the NFL raised the height of the uprights to 35 feet for 2014). Many schools' uprights are the NCAA-minimum 20 feet high. (LSU used the NFL-style goalposts from 1985 through the first four home games of 1993).|$|E
2500|$|Mazda {{introduced}} the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a {{limited production run}} based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. There were two [...] "series" [...] of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series {{can be found on}} the exterior- the earlier [...] "Series I" [...] cars had a black [...] "Mazda" [...] logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all [...] "Series II" [...] cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the <b>bright</b> <b>gold</b> rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floormats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or [...] "bra"), and an aluminum under pan.|$|E
