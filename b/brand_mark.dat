500|$|A new logo {{was created}} for all of Beckham's {{commercial}} ventures {{in order to create}} a [...] "uniform visual identity" [...] for the brand. The mark, which was created by Alasdhair Willis, features the David Beckham name in the Replica Pro font, with a circular hole [...] "punched out of the script". The hole represents a football and a lens or viewfinder, which can [...] "spotlight a product detail or visual flourish on various marketing materials". Willis stated that the major challenge when creating the brand identity for Beckham was: [...] "How do you convey through a <b>brand</b> <b>mark</b> the sheer diversity of the David Beckham world?". He expanded his comment, stating that the identity needed to represent [...] "the future of the man as well as being true to his core DNA as one of the world's most respected and talented sportsmen. The identity needed to deliver against all these elements and at the same time be cool, relevant, desirable, versatile and accessible". Fuller added that the brand should also be aspirational, optimistic and inclusive.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{historically}} recorded samovar-makers in Russia {{were the}} Lisitsyn brothers, Ivan Fyodorovich and Nazar Fyodorovich. From their childhood {{they were engaged}} in metalworking at the brass factory of their father, Fyodor Ivanovich Lisitsyn. In 1778 they made a samovar, and the same year Nazar Lisitsyn registered the first samovar-making factory in Russia. They {{may not have been}} the inventors of the samovar, but they were the first documented samovar-makers, and their various and beautiful samovar designs became very influential throughout the later history of samovar-making. These and other early producers lived in Tula, a city known for its metalworkers and arms-makers. Since the 18th century Tula has been also the main center of Russian samovar production, with tul'sky samovar being the <b>brand</b> <b>mark</b> of the city. A Russian saying equivalent to [...] "carrying coal to Newcastle" [...] is [...] "to travel to Tula with one's own samovar". By the 19th century samovars were already a common feature of Russian tea culture. They were produced in large numbers and exported to Central Asia and other regions.|$|E
