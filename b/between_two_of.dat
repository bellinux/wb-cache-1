5|$|Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert {{eventually}} won the lawsuit, but {{his actions}} and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership {{had been so}} profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, climbers {{found three}} {{buildings}} open {{on one side}} on Licancabur. They {{were built in the}} pirca style, where stones are fitted together without mortar. A woodpile was found <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the buildings, which were described as two dwellings and a fireplace. Wood was also scattered around its crater. With the summit's panoramic view, which includes Calama and pass routes from Argentina, Licancabur may have been a watchtower for the Atacamenos. Its watchtower function may have been coordinated with fortresses in the area such as Lasana, Turi and a settlement identified in 1955 at Quebrada de Chaxas (northwest of the volcano). The settlement at Licancabur had a central courtyard, surrounded by buildings, and ceramics found there resemble these of Pukará de Quitor and Toconao Oriente. A tambo reportedly existed at the volcano.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the rebellion, the Despensers enriched themselves on the forfeited estates of the rebels, and Hugh Despenser the elder was created Earl of Winchester in May 1322. Also Arundel, who was now one of the king's principal supporters, was richly rewarded. After the capture of Roger Mortimer in 1322, he received the forfeited Mortimer lordship of Chirk in Wales. He was also trusted with important offices: he became Chief Justiciar of North and South Wales in 1323, and in 1325 he was made Warden of the Welsh Marches, responsible for the array in Wales. He also extended his influence through marriage alliances; in 1325 he secured marriages <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> his daughters and the sons and heirs of two of Lancaster's main allies: the deceased earls of Hereford and Warwick.|$|E

5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, {{a year after the}} FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

Oregon later went on to play in the BCS National Championship game, and the defeat was Stanford's only one of the season. The loss dropped Stanford to No. 16 in the polls, but the team rebounded the following week to defeat USC on a last-second field goal, 37–35.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} US2, one mile (1.6km) south of Engadine and crosses the Canadian National Railway line before {{entering}} town. In Engadine, M-117 meets the western terminus of H-40 which runs on Hiawatha Trail. The trunkline passes a small pond {{in town and}} some farm fields north of Engadine. The terrain transitions to forest as the highway crosses into Luce County. The route angles slightly to the northeast to avoid Kaks Lake south of M-28 near Newberry.

5|$|The opening {{match was}} another chapter in a long-running storyline <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> AAA's top Mini-Estrellas, Mascarita Sagrada and Espectrito, a storyline that {{actually}} predated {{the creation of}} AAA in 1992. The tecnico Sagrada and the rudo Espectrito had been booked as rivals {{from the beginning of}} Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) Mini-Estrella division, as established by Antonio Peña when he worked for CMLL. Mascarita Sagrada defeated Espectrito in the tournament to determine the first-ever CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion in what was one of the early highlights of their storyline feud. When Peña decided to break away from CMLL to create AAA, {{a large part of the}} Mini-Estrellas division left with him, including the champion Mascarita Sagrada and Espectrito, vacating the championship in the process. In AAA Peña got the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission to sanction the creation of the Mexican National Mini-Estrella Championship, a title that Espectrito won by defeating Mascarita Sagrada in the finals of a tournament.|$|E
