5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E

5|$|Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Line, {{which opened}} in January 2017, is entirely in Manhattan. It runs under Second Avenue from 65th Street to 105th Street, with {{stations}} at 72nd Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street. It is double-tracked along its entire length, with tracks in parallel tubes <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> tunnel boring machines. Each station's platforms sit between these tracks. North of 96th Street, both tracks continue as storage tracks until they end at 105th Street.|$|E
5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> the lack of activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who {{was waiting for her}} husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E

5|$|Hawks's {{military}} {{records were}} {{destroyed in the}} 1973 Military Archive Fire, so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the University of California in Berkeley where he was trained to be a squadron commander in the air force. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed {{by the appearance of}} the celebrity that they promoted him to flight instructor and sent him to Texas to teach new recruits. <b>Bored</b> <b>by</b> this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer {{during the first half of}} 1918 and was eventually sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Armistice was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a Second Lieutenant without having seen active duty.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's {{second year}} at the {{university}} he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals. Darwin was rather <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> Robert Jameson's natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between Neptunism and Plutonism. He learned the classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, {{one of the largest}} museums in Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Paradoxically, {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is {{increasingly}} being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.|$|E

5|$|Villeneuve started {{competitive}} {{driving in}} local drag-racing events, entering his road car, a modified 1967 Ford Mustang. He was soon <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> this {{and entered the}} Jim Russell Racing School at Le Circuit Mont Tremblant to gain a racing licence. He then had a very successful season in Quebec regional Formula Ford, running his own two-year-old car and winning seven of the ten races he entered. The next year he progressed to Formula Atlantic, competing there for four years, running his own car again {{for one of those}} seasons. He won his first Atlantic race in 1975 at Gimli Motosport Park in heavy rain. In 1976, teamed with Chris Harrison's Ecurie Canada and factory March race engineer Ray Wardell, he dominated the season by winning {{all but one of the}} races and taking the US and Canadian titles. He won the Canadian championship again in 1977.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> {{the manner in which}} they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of hiatus concretions separating them from other types {{is that they}} were often encrusted by marine organisms including bryozoans, echinoderms and tube worms in the Paleozoic (e.g., Wilson 1985) and bryozoans, oysters and tube worms in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (e.g., Taylor and Wilson 2001). Hiatus concretions are also often significantly <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> worms and bivalves (Taylor and Wilson 2001).|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{attending the}} execution of this first order were such {{that they are not}} easily understood by present-day mechanics.

25|$|The spoiled and jaded Duchess Josiana, the illegitimate {{daughter}} of King James II, is <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> the dull routine of court. Her fiancé, David Dirry-Moir, {{to whom she}} has been engaged since infancy, tells the Duchess that the only cure for her boredom is Gwynplaine. Josiana attends one of Gwynplaine's performances, and is aroused by the combination of his virile grace and his facial deformity. Gwynplaine is aroused by Josiana's physical beauty and haughty demeanor. Later, {{an agent of the}} royal court arrives at the caravan and compels Gwynplaine to follow him. Gwynplaine is ushered to a dungeon in London, where a physician named Hardquannone is being tortured to death. Hardquannone recognizes Gwynplaine, and identifies him as the boy whose abduction and disfigurement Hardquannone arranged twenty-three years earlier. A flashback relates the doctor's story.|$|E
25|$|A second {{engine shaft}} (known as the Lucy Engine Shaft) was begun in 1871 from the Lucy Tongue Level, and in 1874 work {{began on the}} 20Fathom Level (also known as No.1Level). A {{hydraulic}} winding engine and a water pump were installed {{at the top of}} the shaft in 1875. Over time this shaft was deepened to the 40Fathom Level (or No.2Level), and in 1890 to the 60Fathom Level. This shaft was sunk in the hard footwall rock west of the vein, and proved to be very hard work. Compressed air rock drills and dynamite were used for the first time at the mine. Before this, all shot holes had been <b>bored</b> <b>by</b> hand and charged with gunpowder. The 40Fathom Level was the first to encounter the Middle Ore Shoot, where the most solid galena ever seen in the Greenside Vein was found, though at greater depths this ore shoot was variable in its quality.|$|E
