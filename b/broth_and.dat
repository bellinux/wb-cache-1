The rice is layered over a thin markook bread known as farasheeh, smothered in ghee and topped with stuffed chicken or lamb. The meal is eaten with green peppers and lemon sauce.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat <b>broth</b> <b>and</b> seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E

25|$|Lapsha (noodle soup) {{was adopted}} by Russians from Tatars, and after some {{transformation}} became widespread in Russia. It comes in three variations: chicken, mushroom, and milk.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{clinical}} microbiology laboratories have isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the unusual aminoglycoside disk diffusion result of resistance to both amikacin and gentamicin but susceptibility to tobramycin (ArGrTs). A total of 39 isolates of P. aeruginosa reported to have this resistance pattern were retested by the standard National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards disk diffusion procedure; 30 strains (77 %) were confirmed to be ArGrTs. These 30 isolates were further examined for susceptibility to those aminoglycosides by agar dilution <b>and</b> <b>broth</b> micro- <b>and</b> macrodilution methods. Only 27, 27, and 23 % of the isolates appeared to be ArGrTs by agar, <b>broth</b> microdilution, <b>and</b> <b>broth</b> macrodilution testing, respectively. Most of the remaining isolates were resistant to all three aminoglycosides when tested by <b>broth</b> dilution <b>and</b> resistant only to gentamicin when tested by agar dilution. The percentages of strains resistant to any particular aminoglycoside by agar dilution, <b>broth</b> microdilution, <b>and</b> <b>broth</b> macrodilution, respectively, were 43, 80, and 70 for amikacin, 97, 93, and 100 for gentamicin, 100, 100, and 100 for netilmicin, 30, 87, and 93 for sisomicin, and 13, 57, and 50 for tobramycin. These results indicate that strains showing the unusual aminoglycoside antibiogram are less susceptible to aminoglycosides in general and should probably be considered borderline resistant to all aminoglycosides. The efficacy of aminoglycosides {{in the treatment of}} infections produced by these strains is unknown...|$|R
40|$|The fungus, {{tentatively}} {{identified as}} Lagenidium, which attacks the nauplii to postlarval stages of P. monodon, {{has recently been}} isolated and cultured from infected larvae under laboratory conditions, using several kinds of agars <b>and</b> <b>broths.</b> Growth of the colonies {{was found to be}} faster in the <b>broths</b> <b>and</b> in the Sabouraud agar ghan in the othr media.

Every morning, travelling cart of bubur ayam vendors are often found regularly frequenting residential area to sell their wares in the neighbourhood.

25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket <b>broth</b> <b>and</b> the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E

It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened with sour cream. , or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper.
