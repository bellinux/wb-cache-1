5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal <b>beliefs</b> or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his <b>beliefs</b> and respected the <b>beliefs</b> of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian <b>beliefs.</b> However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those <b>beliefs</b> in major speeches.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>belief</b> {{change has been}} an active area in {{philosophy}} and AI. In recent years two special cases of <b>belief</b> change, <b>belief</b> revision and <b>belief</b> update, have been studied in detail. <b>Belief</b> revision and update are clearly not the only possible notions of <b>belief</b> change. In this paper we investigate properties {{of a range of}} possible <b>belief</b> change operations. We start with an abstract notion of a <b>belief</b> change system and provide a logical language that describes <b>belief</b> change in such systems. We then consider several reasonable properties one can impose on such systems and characterize them axiomatically. We show that both <b>belief</b> revision and update fit into our classification. As a consequence, we get both a semantic and an axiomatic (proof-theoretic) characterization of <b>belief</b> revision and update (as well as some <b>belief</b> change operations that generalize them), in one natural framework. 1 Introduction The study of <b>belief</b> change has been an active area in philosophy and in artifici [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper aims {{to extend}} the AGM theory of <b>belief</b> {{revision}} to accommodate infinitary <b>belief</b> change. We generalize the AGM theory both in axiomatization and modeling. We show that most properties of the AGM <b>belief</b> change operations are preserved by the generalized operations whereas the infinitary <b>belief</b> change operations have their special properties. We prove that the extended axiomatic system for the generalized <b>belief</b> change operators with a Limit Postulate properly specifies infinite <b>belief</b> change. This framework forms a base for first-order <b>belief</b> revision and the theory of revising a <b>belief</b> state by a <b>belief</b> state...|$|R

5|$|The <b>beliefs</b> of {{the general}} public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious <b>beliefs</b> and how conservative such religious <b>beliefs</b> are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Belief</b> merging is {{concerned}} with the integration of several (mutually inconsistent) <b>belief</b> bases such that a coherent <b>belief</b> base is developed. Various <b>belief</b> merging models have been developed to address this problem. These models often consist of two key functions, namely: negotiation, and weakening. A negotiation function finds the weakest <b>belief</b> bases among the available <b>belief</b> bases, and then the selected <b>belief</b> bases concede based on a weakening function. This process is iteratively repeated until a consistent <b>belief</b> base is developed. In this paper, we extend the current <b>belief</b> merging models by introducing the extended <b>belief</b> game model. The extended <b>belief</b> game model operates over a subjective <b>belief</b> profile, which consists of <b>belief</b> bases with subjectively annotated formulae. The subjective information attached to each formula en-ables the proposed model to prioritize the formulae in the merging process. We provide several instantiations of the model by introducing suitable functions. Furthermore, We formally investi-gate how the outcome of a collaborative modeling process can be obtained as a solution of the extended <b>belief</b> game model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{features}} of <b>belief</b> change when agents have to consider information received from other agents. We focus on <b>belief</b> change operators when agents have to process messages about a static world. We propose to consider agents' <b>belief</b> state {{as a set of}} pairs #belief, origin of the belief# combined with a preference relation over the agents embedded in the multi-agent system. The <b>belief</b> revision procedure for handling received messages is a safe base revision procedure where messages are considered in their syntactic form. According to the reliability of the sources of the conflicting <b>belief,</b> agents remove the less reliable <b>belief</b> in order to handle the received message. Notice that the less reliable source can be the sender of the message itself. In order not to loose precious information conflicting <b>belief</b> are not removed but considered as potential <b>belief.</b> As the agent changes its <b>belief,</b> potential <b>belief</b> is reconsidered and may be reinstated as current <b>belief.</b> In a similar way, messages can concern statements that should not be believed, called disbelief. As <b>belief,</b> disbelief can become potential. These di#erent kinds of <b>belief</b> enables us to propose a new semantics for a modal based language for describing (dis) <b>belief.</b> Agents may handle sequences of messages since the proposed <b>belief</b> change operators handle iterated <b>belief</b> change...|$|R

40|$|Most {{existing}} formalizations treat <b>belief</b> {{change as}} a single step process, and ignore several problems that become important when a theory, or <b>belief</b> state, is revised over several steps.

To demonstrate that such a formalization is indeed possible, we develop a framework which uses the language of PJ-default logic to represent a <b>belief</b> state, and which enables the effects of a <b>belief</b> change step to presist by propagating <b>belief</b> constraints. <b>Belief</b> change in this framework maps one <b>belief</b> state to another, where each <b>belief</b> state is a collection of theories given by the set of extensions of the PJ-default theory representing that <b>belief</b> state. <b>Belief</b> constraints {{do not need to be}} separately recorded; they are encoded as clearly identifiable components of a PJ-default theory.
