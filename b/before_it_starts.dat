5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} interruption(s) to Team 2's innings, either <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts,</b> during, {{or it is}} cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2's target score from the initial target set {{at the end of}} Team 1's innings, in {{proportion}} to the reduction in Team 2's resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.|$|E
25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swivelling its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses to attach a dragline, then springs onto the prey.|$|E

25|$|The driverless tractor {{is part of}} a move to {{increase}} automation in farming. Other such autonomous technologies currently utilized in farming include automatic milking and automatic strawberry pickers. Developing such a technology is difficult. In order for it to be successful, the tractor must be able to follow deterministic tasks (a task that is defined <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts,</b> such as a path to follow on a field), have reactive behavior (the ability to react to an unknown situation such as an obstacle in the way), and have reflexive responses (making a decision without hesitation or time consuming calculations such as changing the steering angle if necessary). Ultimately, the tractor should imitate a human in its ability to observe spatial position and make decisions such as speed.|$|E

2500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{stated that}} the fourth season risked {{predictability}} by returning to a successful formula of storytelling, but he nonetheless preferred those episodes to those of season three. Maureen Ryan reviewed the fourth season positively. She praised the addition of Lincoln Potter (played by Ray McKinnon), comparing the character's quality to that of Breaking Bads antagonist, Gustavo Fring. The A.V. Club called the fourth season more [...] "focused" [...] and [...] "operatic". A.V. Club reviewer Zack Handlen was fond of the season but felt disappointed with the finale, saying it featured a [...] "lousy case of dictated convenience, of an arbitrary and unbelievable reveal used to shift characters around to where the writers {{want them to be}} for next season, as opposed to where they might land organically." [...] However, the review did praise Charlie Hunnam's performance in the finale. TIME said the fourth season was the strongest since season two, but the show needed to end sooner rather than later. TIME also agreed that the finale's contrivances were sometimes too visible, stating [...] "it's the principle: you can only turn up alive at your own funeral so many times <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> to lose its impact." ...|$|E
