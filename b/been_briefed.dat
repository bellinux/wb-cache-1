As there were no places there where it could have landed, the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Following her election, Collins {{donated the}} surplus $242,000 from her {{campaign}} coffers {{to the state}} Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party– at an annual salary of $59,900– the state press charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted that Governor Collins had not <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> {{on the details of}} her husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued as many of the appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield– a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier– Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.|$|E

25|$|Although {{research}} {{continued at}} the SCL in the passive detection of infrared emitted from heated aircraft engines, Blair {{became convinced that}} practical detection systems would involve reflected radio signals.

In December 1930, representatives of the SCL had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> at the NRL on the beat-interference phenomena that they were investigating, and in 1932, an NRL report on radio interference for target-detection was passed on to the Army. It does not appear, however, that any of this information was used by Blair.|$|E

25|$|According to the United States government, {{the crew}} {{incorrectly}} identified the Iranian Airbus A300 as an attacking F-14A Tomcat fighter, a plane {{made in the}} United States and operated at that time by only two forces worldwide, the United States Navy and the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force. While the Iranian F-14s had been supplied by manufacturer Grumman in an air-to-air configuration only in the 1970s, the crew of Vincennes had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> when entering the region that the Iranian F-14s carried unguided bombs as well as Maverick missiles and unguided rockets. The Vincennes crew made ten attempts to contact {{the crew of the}} flight on military and civilian radio frequencies, but received no response. The International Civil Aviation Organization said that the flight crew should have been monitoring the civilian frequency.|$|E
25|$|Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not {{indicate}} when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but when he spoke {{in front of the}} people he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and {{it was clear that the}} supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him. Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius to tell a story about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‘double-dealing.’ He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him. Cicero gave an account in some letters to his fiend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Junior that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches). Vettius did not mention Curio. He implicated other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> on what to say during the night. The men he mentioned had not cast any suspicion. Cicero noted that it was thought that this was a set up and that the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.|$|E

500|$|Cholmondeley was {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who had been seconded to MI5, Britain's domestic counter-intelligence and security service. He had been appointed as {{the secretary of the}} Twenty Committee, a small inter-service, inter-departmental intelligence team in charge of double agents (which gained its name from the Roman numeral XX (twenty), a visual pun on the phrase [...] "double cross"). In November 1942 the Twenty Committee turned down Cholmondeley's plan as being unworkable, but thought there may have been some potential in the idea. As there was a naval connection to the plan, John Masterman, the chairman of the committee, assigned Ewen Montagu, the naval representative, to work with Cholmondeley to develop the plan further. Montagu – a peacetime lawyer and King's Counsel who had volunteered at the outbreak of the war – worked under Godfrey at the Naval Intelligence Division, where he ran NID 17(M), the sub-branch which handled counter-espionage work. Godfrey had also appointed Montagu to oversee all naval deception involving double agents. As part of his duties, Montagu had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> on the need for deception operations to aid the Allied war aims in a forthcoming invasion operation in the Mediterranean.|$|E

[...] "F" [...] was followed the next day by [...] "Soldier E", a junior SAS officer who was directly responsible for the soldiers who carried out the shootings. After the officers, the inquest heard from Soldiers [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C", and [...] "D", the SAS soldiers who shot McCann, Savage, and Farrell. The SAS personnel all told the coroner that they had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> to expect the would-be bombers to be in possession of a remote detonator, and that they had been told that Savage's car definitely contained a bomb. Each soldier testified that the IRA team made movements which the soldiers believed to be threatening, and this prompted the soldiers to open fire. McGrory asked about the SAS's policy on lethal force during cross-examination; he asked [...] "D" [...] about allegations that Savage was shot while on the ground, something [...] "D" [...] strenuously denied. McGrory asked [...] "D" [...] if he had intended to continue shooting Savage until he was dead, to which [...] "D" [...] replied in the affirmative.|$|E
500|$|During {{a routine}} press event, journalists, who had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> by Schmidt, {{questioned}} Krupinski and his deputy Karl Heinz Franke about Rudel. In this interview, the generals compared Rudel's {{past as a}} Nazi and Neo-Nazi supporter to the career of prominent Social Democrat leader Herbert Wehner, {{who had been a}} member of the German Communist Party in the 1930s, and who had lived in Moscow during World War II, where he was allegedly involved in NKVD operations. Calling Wehner an extremist, they described Rudel as an honorable man, who [...] "hadn't stolen the family silver or anything else". When these remarks became public, the Federal Minister of Defense Georg Leber, complying with §50 of the [...] (Military law), ordered the generals into early retirement as of 1 November 1976. Leber, however, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), was heavily criticized for his actions by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) opposition, and the scandal contributed to the minister's retirement in early 1978. On 3 February 1977, the German Bundestag debated the scandal and its consequences. The Rudel Scandal subsequently triggered a military-tradition discussion, which the Federal Minister of Defense Hans Apel ended with the introduction of [...] "Guidelines for Understanding and Cultivating Tradition" [...] on 20 September 1982.|$|E

500|$|Montagu was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 {{for his part}} in Operation Mincemeat; for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley {{was appointed}} a Member of the Order in 1948. Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel Operation Heartbreak (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans. The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat. Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote The Man Who Never Was (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful. He was also careful to obscure [...] "the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception... with Mincemeat being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper". In 1977 Montagu published Beyond Top Secret U, his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations.|$|E
500|$|After being {{released}} from supporting the Okinawa campaign, XXIBomber Command conducted an intensive firebombing campaign against Japan's main cities from mid-May. A force of 472 B-29s struck Nagoya by day on 13May and destroyed [...] of the city. The Japanese mounted a strong defense that downed two Superfortresses and damaged another 64; another eight B-29s were lost to other causes. The Americans claimed 18 Japanese fighter [...] "kills" [...] as well as another 30 [...] "probables" [...] and 16 damaged. Nagoya was attacked again by 457 B-29s {{on the night of}} 16May, and the resulting fires destroyed [...] of the city. Japanese defenses were much weaker by night, and the three bombers lost in this attack crashed due to mechanical problems. The two raids on Nagoya killed 3,866 Japanese and rendered another 472,701 homeless. On 19May, 318 B-29s conducted an unsuccessful precision bombing raid on the Tachikawa Aircraft Company. XXIBomber Command made further large-scale firebombing attacks against Tokyo on the nights of 23 and 25May. In the first of these raids 520 B-29s destroyed [...] of southern Tokyo with 17 aircraft lost and 69 damaged. The second attack involved 502 B-29s and destroyed [...] of the city's central area, including the headquarters of several key government ministries and much of the Tokyo Imperial Palace; the bomber crews had <b>been</b> <b>briefed</b> to not target the palace as the US Government did not want to risk killing Emperor Hirohito. The Japanese defenses were relatively successful on this occasion, and 26 Superfortresses were shot down and another 100 damaged. By the end of these raids just over half (50.8percent) of Tokyo had been destroyed and the city was removed from XXIBomber Command's target list. The Command's last major raid of May was a daylight incendiary attack on Yokohama on 29May conducted by 517 B-29s escorted by 101 P-51s. This force was intercepted by 150 A6M Zero fighters, sparking an intense air battle in which five B-29s were shot down and another 175 damaged. In return, the P-51 pilots claimed 26 [...] "kills" [...] and 23 [...] "probables" [...] for the loss of three fighters. The 454 B-29s that reached Yokohama struck the city's main business district and destroyed [...] of buildings; over 1000 Japanese were killed. Overall, the attacks in May destroyed [...] of buildings, which was equivalent to one seventh of Japan's total urban area. The Minister of Home Affairs, Iwao Yamazaki, concluded after these raids that Japan's civil defense arrangements were [...] "considered to be futile".|$|E
