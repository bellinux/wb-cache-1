5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest.

The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General <b>Board</b> <b>that</b> the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfied {{with city}} politics, and in {{financial}} difficulty {{due to his}} failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on November 10, 1978.

Liberal Supervisors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} end the 6-5 split on the <b>Board</b> <b>that</b> blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.|$|E
5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian <b>board</b> <b>that</b> he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E

5|$|In January 2014, hedge fund, activist {{investor}} and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper {{reduce its}} cash reserves and cut costs, before Kheradpir was officially appointed. That February, Juniper {{reached an agreement}} with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its <b>board.</b> <b>That</b> April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses. In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer. An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford {{was named}} captain of a Victorian side made of up of {{promising}} youngsters, {{to play against}} Tasmania at the MCG on 2–5 February 1923. In this, only his third first-class match, Ponsford broke the world record for the highest individual innings score at that level {{on the final day}} of the match, scoring 429runs and batting for nearly eight hours. Along the way, he broke Armstrong's record for the highest score for Victoria (250), before surpassing former England captain Archie MacLaren's world record individual score of 424. The team score of 1,059 was also a new record for a first-class innings—an impromptu paint job was needed to show the score on a <b>board</b> <b>that</b> was not designed to display a four-figure total.|$|E

5|$|Though {{a strong}} {{governor}} with many successes, Clements {{was not able}} to enact his full legislative agenda. In 1948, his proposal to create a centralized <b>board</b> <b>that</b> governed all Kentucky colleges failed in the General Assembly. In both the 1948 and 1950 legislative sessions, Clements failed to convince the General Assembly to regulate strip mining. He also failed in his attempts to establish statewide pension and civil service programs, and was unable to enact a merit system for state employees. Attempts to fund a veterans' bonus passed the two houses of the General Assembly in different forms and were unable to be reconciled.|$|E
5|$|With {{the first}} vessel approved, the General Board {{attempted}} to secure two, or possibly {{three of the}} 5"/51-cal. guns in November, but the Bureau of Construction and Repair informed the <b>board</b> <b>that</b> only two guns would fit in the existing hull design. A third gun placed aft would be {{too close to the}} rudder, and the hull could not support the recoil from the gun. A substitution of the larger guns would also necessitate a reduction in the ammunition allotment, from 350rounds per gun to 250. Ultimately, the Ashville class emerged as incremental improvements over Sacramento.|$|E

40|$|How does gender-balance {{affect the}} working of boards of directors? I examine <b>boards</b> <b>that</b> have been {{required}} for two decades to be relatively gender-balanced: boards of business companies in which the Israeli government holds a substantial equity interest. I construct a novel database based on the detailed minutes of 402 board- and board-committee meetings of eleven such companies. I find <b>that</b> <b>boards</b> <b>that</b> had critical masses {{of at least three}} directors of each gender in attendance, and particularly of three women, were approximately twice as likely both to request further information and to take an initiative, compared to <b>boards</b> <b>that</b> did not have such critical masses. A 2 SLS model confirms these results. Consistent with these findings, the ROE and net profit margin of these type of companies is significantly larger in companies that have at least three women directors. In addition, <b>boards</b> <b>that</b> included a critical mass of women directors were more likely to experience CEO turnover when firm performance was weak. At the level of the individual directors, both men and women directors were more active when at least three women directors were in attendance. 1 Harvard University and Northeastern University...|$|R
