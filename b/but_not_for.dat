5|$|Henry VIII {{personally}} {{devised a}} plan to form at least thirteen new dioceses so that most counties had one based on a former monastery (or more than one), though this scheme was only partly carried out.

In 1961, Baker appeared in the controversial independent film Something Wild, directed by her then-husband Jack Garfein, playing a traumatized rape victim. She went on to star in several critically acclaimed Westerns throughout the 1960s, such as The Big Country (1958), How the West Was Won (1962), and Cheyenne Autumn (1964).|$|E

5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E

Lomax attempts to alert his superiors, but when he meets the Commissioner of Police, he notices that he, too, is sporting the V-shaped mark; the aliens have taken control of the government.|$|E

5|$|There {{was still}} enough mining {{to keep the}} railroads busy, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> long. In 1897 the Midland went bankrupt. It {{continued}} operating, and a new company formed under the same name to take over. In 1919 Smuggler Mine, the city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. Its tracks and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E
5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{fewer than the}} 32,000 received for the semi-finals. The allocation was enough for the 21,000 Stoke City season ticket holders, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> Manchester City's 36,000 season ticket holders. Consequently, some supporters felt aggrieved {{at the lack of}} tickets, including Stoke City chairman Peter Coates who expressed his disappointment and suggested an allocation in the region of 30,000 for both clubs. Ticket prices for the final exceeded £100 for the first time. The most expensive tickets cost £115, an increase of 22percent on the previous season. The cheapest tickets available at £45, up £5 from 2010.|$|E

5|$|Conscription for the Army, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> {{civilian}} industry, {{had been}} brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{successive}} offensives of early August, exact Canadian casualties for Operation Tractable {{are not known}} but losses during Totalize and Tractable are put at 5,500 men. German casualties during Operation Tractable are also uncertain; approximate figures can be found for casualties within the Falaise Pocket <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the Canadian operations during Tractable. After the Falaise Pocket, the German 7th Army was severely depleted, having lost from 50,000–200,000 men, over 200 tanks, 1,000 guns and 5,000 other vehicles. In the fighting around Hill262, the Germans lost 2,000 men killed, 5,000 taken prisoner, 55 tanks, 44 guns and 152 armoured vehicles. Polish casualties for Operation Tractable (until 22 August) are 1,441 men, of whom 325 were killed (including 21 officers), 1,002 were wounded (35 officers) and 114 missing, which includes 263 men lost before the Chambois and Ormel actions from 14–18 August.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Turning Point, Styles and Sting {{argued over}} Sting assaulting Styles at Hard Justice. On the October30 episode of Impact!, newly made {{co-owner}} of TNA Mick Foley advertised Sting defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Styles at Turning Point. Sting retained the title at the event. Sting and Styles fought again at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on December7, {{this time in}} an Eight Man Tag Team Match pitting The Main Event Mafia (Sting, Nash, Steiner, and Booker T) against The TNA Front Line (Styles, Joe, Brother Devon, and Brother Ray) for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The Main Event Mafia won the match, thus Sting retained the championship {{for a second time}} against Styles. Sting and Styles fought one last time for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> several months. They clashed one final time at the 2009 Bound for Glory event on October18. At that event, Styles headed into the bout as the TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Styles defeated Sting to retain the championship at the show.|$|E

5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E
5|$|On {{leaving the}} Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns {{accepted}} {{the post of}} organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year {{there were more than}} two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.|$|E
