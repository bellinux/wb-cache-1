Hamilton viewed his roles of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics.

5|$|The Dude {{finds his}} {{bungalow}} completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged {{him so that}} his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude protests <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father,</b> but Maude tells him {{that he will not}} be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. Having an epiphany, the Dude and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while the Dude explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.|$|E
5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{paleoanthropologist}} Francesco Mallegni conducted DNA {{testing on}} the recently excavated bodies of Ugolino and his children. His analysis {{agrees with the}} remains <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father,</b> his sons and his grandsons. Additional comparison to DNA from modern day members of the Gherardesca family leave Mallegni about 98 percent sure that he has identified the remains correctly. However, the forensic analysis discredits the allegation of cannibalism. Analysis of the rib bones of the Ugolino skeleton reveals traces of magnesium, but no zinc, implying he had consumed no meat {{in the months before}} his death. Ugolino also had few remaining teeth and {{is believed to have been}} in his 70s when he was imprisoned, making it further unlikely that he could have outlived and eaten his descendants in captivity. Additionally, Mallegni notes that the putative Ugolino skull was damaged; perhaps he did not ultimately die of starvation, although malnourishment is evident.|$|E

500|$|On the character's {{transformation}} Dawson told Digital Spy {{that when}} Darren was younger he was [...] "just a horrible child {{and he had}} nothing nice to say about anyone" [...] before Darren matured and softened. Dawson added that {{it was nice to}} see a different side to the character. Dawson later added that the character's change was good as [...] "everyone goes through changes in their life and Darren just hit that time. It was good timing for him". He also explained that his character becoming a father led him to develop and mature further, stating that Darren accepted his responsibilities as a father and [...] "tries hard to be the father that he wants to be". He felt that Darren enjoyed <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> and that it made him feel [...] "complete and like he has a purpose in life, whereas before he was always chasing his tail". Dawson felt that as time went on, Darren became more helpful, sympathetic and more empathetic towards other characters, especially Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Dawson stated, [...] "It's very uncharacteristic but Darren is softening up".

A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies.

The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself.

500|$|The game's {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka, who had previously worked on the main Drakengard series. Two character designs for the protagonist were created for Nier. The developers believed that the Japanese audience would respond more strongly to a younger protagonist, while non-Japanese audiences would prefer an adult Nier character. Other than changing Nier's appearance and modifying a few lines of dialogue to fit with Nier <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> rather than a brother to Yonah, the developers made no changes between the two versions; while it was initially believed that the older Nier was the character's original design, an interview with Yoko clarified that the young Nier was the original vision. Many characters underwent changes during development, and some needed to be cut: there were originally thirteen Grimoires, with all but three being cut: those that remained were Weiss, Noir and Rubrum. Emil's character was derived from a female character named Halua, while Kainé was originally a far more feminine type who hid her violent nature. Yonah's original Japanese name {{was derived from the}} Biblical name Jonah: this could not be taken verbatim into its localized form due to the name being associated with a man, so the name was changed to [...] "Yonah". Kainé's character was made intersexual, since the team felt it fitted in with many other aspects of her gritty backstory. Kainé's status as an intersexual caused some commotion in western territories, which is something the team did not actively intend. Yoko attributed the original suggestion to female staff members working on the game.|$|E
500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I was afraid he would think I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter of your parents getting older and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and all that they encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to the day you die, and being cognizant of the end, you might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>father,</b> as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is a lot that can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E
