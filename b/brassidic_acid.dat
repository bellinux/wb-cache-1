2500|$|Erucic acid is a {{monounsaturated}} omega-9 fatty acid, denoted 22:1Ï‰9. It has {{the formula}} CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)11COOH. It is prevalent in wallflower seed with a reported content of 20 to 54% in high erucic acid rapeseed oil, and 42% in mustard oil. [...] Erucic acid {{is also known}} as cis-13-docosenoic acid and the trans isomer is known as <b>brassidic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

In {{laboratory}} studies of organic aerosol particles reacting with gas-phase oxidants, {{high concentrations of}} rad-icals are often used to study on the timescale of seconds re-actions which may be occurring over days or weeks in the troposphere. Implicit in this approach {{is the assumption that}} radical concentration and time are interchangeable parame-ters, though this has not been established. Here, the kinetics of OH- and Cl-initiated oxidation reactions of model single-component liquid (squalane) and supercooled (<b>brassidic</b> <b>acid</b> and 2 -octyldodecanoic acid) organic aerosols are studied by varying separately the radical concentration and the reaction time. Two separate flow tubes with residence times of 2 and 66 s are used, and [OH] and [Cl] are varied by adjusting ei-ther the laser photolysis fluence or the radical precursor con-centration ([O 3] or [Cl 2], respectively) used to generate th...|$|E

The LCP was chemically synthesized and its nucleic acid binding capacity {{was determined by}} gel electrophoresis. HeLa-EGFP and TH 1080 -EGFP cell lines were transfected with siRNA against enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene using a LCP to investigate the transfection efficiency. An MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cellular toxicity of the LCP vector. Its degradability and stability under acidic conditions were also investigated. The LCP vector possessed high DNA binding capacity. More than 73 % of the cellular fluorescence was inhibited by the LCP-mediated transfection of siRNA against EGFP gene, indicating that vector had high transfection efficiency. Cellular viability was about 95 % at the optimum transfection efficiency of LCP, suggesting that the cellular toxicity of LCP was very low. The LCP was also observed to be degradable; moreover, it could be easily stored at normal temperature. A gene vector used for the transfection of siRNA was successfully fabricated from synthesized LCP. Its numerous excellent properties entitle values for further scientific research. J. Cell.

As a gene vector for small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) transfection, {{the efficiency and}} biosafety of LCP were preliminarily evaluated to investigate its possible application on tumor gene therapy. The toxicity, side-effects, and biosafety of LCP were investigated in animals {{based on the results}} of in vitro experiments. The siRNA against cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) was transfected by LCP to interfere with the COX- 2 expression in nude-transplanted tumors. Hematoxylin and eosin stains, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot were performed to evaluate the efficiency of LCP for siRNA transfection. The animal toxicity experiment showed that a high concentration of LCP had a low toxic effect on animals and did not induce allergic or pyrogenic reactions. The results from the in vivo transfection indicated that LCP could efficiently transfect siRNA and silence the target gene expression. The LCP gene vector for siRNA transfection is highly efficient during in vivo transfection and had low toxicity. From all aspects of tumor gene therapy and basic research, LCP is valuable for scientific research and medical applications. J. Cell. Biochem. 112 : 1329 - 1336, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

It is found that the rates measured by varying the radical concentration and the reaction time are equal only if the precursor concentrations are the same in the two approaches. Further, the rates depend on the concentrations of the precursor species with a Langmuir-type functional form suggesting that O 3 and Cl 2 saturate the surface of the liquid particles. It is believed that the presence of O 3 inhibits the rate of OH reaction, perhaps by reacting with OH radicals or by O 3 or intermediate species blocking surface sites, while Cl 2 enhances the rate of Cl reaction by participating in a radical chain mechanism. These results have important implications for laboratory experiments in which high concentrations of gas-phase oxidants are used to study atmospheric reactions over short timescales and may explain the variability in recent measurements of the reactive uptake of OH on squalane particles in reactor systems used in this and other laboratories...|$|E
