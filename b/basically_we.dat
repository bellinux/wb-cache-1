25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, <b>basically,</b> <b>we</b> managed to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of weeks. We decided to go off and rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just a totally different feeling.|$|E
500|$|<b>Basically</b> <b>we</b> {{were having}} a laugh {{at a lot of}} the {{different}} articles that were appearing at that time in different magazines and papers, and they were talking about 'Pop Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie' and, you know, with every different release of a single they'd say 'What Kylie is it now?' and it was just becoming a joke. So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and said we should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E
500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. <b>Basically,</b> <b>we</b> [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] resembles ballads sung by Whitney Houston. Spence D. of IGN {{wrote that the}} song was {{inspired}} by Aretha Franklin's work since [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] consists of several variations in gutturals and octave range. The lyrics of [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song [...] "sounds {{a lot like a}} statement of independence". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable—and that, in fact, her new man will be arriving momentarily." [...] Hermansen said that [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] is a song that [...] "people {{from all walks of life}} can enjoy". Beyoncé said that the song is [...] "a little honest", and, [...] "... <b>basically</b> <b>we</b> can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that.

500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and train robber. During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror. <b>Basically,</b> <b>we</b> just want people to care about this character and what happens to him — and I can't think of a first-person shooter that's really made us do that yet." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, <b>basically.</b> <b>We</b> have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love."

500|$|Nagy set the {{adaptation}} {{several years later}} than the time in which the novel is set, so [...] "the dawn of the Eisenhower administration {{and the rise of}} HUAC could be front and center". One of the challenges of adapting the novel was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint whereby the narrator [...] "sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head" [...] and Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive of the narrative structure, considering [...] "there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel", adding that she was [...] "overwhelmed by the task of {{trying to come up with}} the visual equivalent for it structurally." [...] Nagy decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as [...] "the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her [...] "to be seen moving from objects to people", which Nagy likened to Highsmith as Therese is a [...] "clear stand-in" [...] for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, [...] "I started taking pictures of people because my friend says I have to be more interested in humans", as the epitome of Highsmith: [...] "that ability to step outside of life and comment on it before participating in it". For the character of Carol, Nagy took inspiration from the silhouette and underpinning of Grace Kelly's character in Rear Window (1954). Nagy had freedom in [...] "inventing a life for , for whom, <b>basically,</b> <b>we</b> knew the outline of what was going on." [...] Once Nagy was able to dig into and understand the inner life of Carol, her motivations given the circumstances, then the character became easy to write. Nagy aimed to [...] "focus on the nature of what it's like to fall in love from two points of view", and show the characters [...] "just behaving ... not inhabiting positions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Island Records {{then brought}} in Lenny Kaye, [...] "who {{made a few}} suggestions... 'Some of them were a bit odd' David recalls, 'like his calypso/reggae version of [...] "Trick of the Light"' Rob: 'A bit odd! <b>Basically</b> <b>we</b> just shot them down in flames'". Nevertheless Kaye felt that the Triffids and their {{material}} were impressive enough and {{that they did not}} need his help. Eventually Gil Norton who had worked on their 1986 album, Born Sandy Devotional, was brought back to re-record Calenture. The album was released in November 1987 by White/Hot Records for the Australian market and by Island Records for Europe, United Kingdom, and United States.|$|E

Singer and guitarist Michael Poulsen said of the chemistry between Caggiano {{and the rest of the}} band [...] "The collaboration with Rob in the studio was so inspiring and in good spirit that we the decided to keep him. <b>Basically</b> <b>we</b> went into the studio as a three piece and came out as a whole band!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to being}} removed from an active music scene, the two MC's {{were free to}} develop their most {{idiosyncratic}} tendencies musically. According to Weston, the group's lyrical style stemmed from the two {{not being able to}} listen to New York hip hop on the radio in Virginia. Weston stated that [...] "except for Brand Nubian, we weren't influenced by {{what was going on in}} New York. <b>Basically</b> <b>we</b> wanted to be different and we wanted to be dope like Brand Nubian... So instead of saying, 'I got a lot of balls,' we'd say, 'I got more nuts than a Baby Ruth.'" [...] Hines also felt being away from the environment helped their personal artistic growth. [...] "We just wasn't exposed to that many styles at the time, so it helped us form our own." [...] Hines and Weston would make up gibberish words, adding -iggity after many of them, which would eventually become their signature. The group also had a tendency to weave many pop culture references into their rhymes.|$|E
2500|$|News {{about the}} Bibles {{had reached the}} Al Jezeera network, which had {{broadcast}} {{a story about the}} possibility that American troops were violating anti-proselytization rules. The report included video footage of U.S. Army Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) Gary Hensley telling soldiers that they had a responsibility to [...] "hunt people for Jesus": [...] "The special forces guys—they hunt men <b>basically.</b> <b>We</b> do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down.... Get the hound of heaven after them, so we get them into the kingdom. That's what we do, that's our business." [...] The footage shows a discussion between soldiers and their chaplain discussing how the Bibles might be distributed without violating the military's general order against proselytization, [...] "although they don't arrive at any clear plan." [...] When a reporter from Al Jazeera brought up the issue of using the Bibles to proselytize Afghans during a May 4, 2009, Pentagon news conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen stated that [...] "from the United States military's perspective," [...] it is [...] "not our position to ever push any specific kind of religion.
