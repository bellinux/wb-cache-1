40|$|The along-scan radiometric {{gradient}} causes severe interpretation {{problems in}} Landsat images of tropical forests.

40|$|After {{studying}} this chapter, {{you should be}} able to • Design modules and classes with high cohesion and low coupling. • Understand the need for information hiding. • Describe the software engineering implications of inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding. • Distinguish among generalization, aggregation, and association. • Discuss the object-oriented paradigm in greater depth than before. Some of the more lurid computer magazines seem to suggest that the object-oriented paradigm was a sudden, dramatic new discovery of the mid- 1980 s, a revolutionary alternative to the then-popular classical paradigm. That is not the case. Instead, the theory of modularity underwent steady progress during the 1970 s and the 1980 s, and objects were simply an evolutionary development within the theory of modularity (<b>but</b> see <b>Just</b> <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> You Wanted to Know Box 7. 1). This chapter describes objects within the context of modularity. This approach is taken because it is extremely difficult to use objects correctly without understanding why the object-oriented paradigm is superior to the classical paradigm. And, to do that, it is necessary to appreciate that an object is merely the next logical step in the body of knowledge that begins with the concept of a module. 7. 1 What Is a Module? 166 When a large product consists of a single monolithic block of code, maintenance is a nightmare.

60|$|Now {{philosophers}} {{after my}} Utopian pattern, who find the ultimate significance in life in individuality, novelty and the undefined, {{would not only}} regard the poietic element {{as the most important}} in human society, but would perceive quite clearly the impossibility of its organisation. This, indeed, is simply the application to the moral and intellectual fabric of the principles already applied in discussing the State control of reproduction (in Chapter the Sixth, section 2). <b>But</b> <b>just</b> as <b>in</b> the <b>case</b> of births it was possible for the State to frame limiting conditions within which individuality plays more freely than in the void, so the founders of this modern Utopia believed it possible to define conditions under which every individual born with poietic gifts should be enabled and encouraged to give them a full development, in art, philosophy, invention, or discovery. Certain general conditions presented themselves as obviously reasonable:--to give every citizen as good an education as he or she could acquire, for example; to so frame it that the directed educational process would never at any period occupy the whole available time of the learner, but would provide throughout a marginal free leisure with opportunities for developing idiosyncrasies, and to ensure by the expedient of a minimum wage for a specified amount of work, that leisure and opportunity did not cease throughout life.|$|R
60|$|All life, whether organic or inorganic, consists, as we know, in {{a change}} from a state of simple {{homogeneity}} to one of complex heterogeneity. The process is apparently the same in a nebula or a brachiopod, although much more intricate in the latter. The immediate force which works this change, the life principle of things, is, <b>in</b> the <b>case</b> of organic beings, a subtle something which we call spontaneous variation. What this mysterious impulse may be is beyond our present powers of recognition. As yet, the ultimates of all things lie hidden in the womb of the vast unknown. <b>But</b> <b>just</b> as <b>in</b> the <b>case</b> of a man we can tell what organs are vital, though we are ignorant what the vital spark may be, so in our great cosmical laws we can say in what their power resides, though we know not really what they are. Whether mind be but a sublimated form of matter, or, what amounts to the same thing, matter a menial kind of mind, or whether, which seems less likely, it be a something incomparable with substance, of one thing we are sure, the same laws of heredity govern both. In each a like chain of continuity leads from the present to the dim past, a connecting clue which we can follow backward in imagination. Now what spontaneous variation is to the material organism, imagination, apparently, is to the mental one. Just as spontaneous variation is constantly pushing the animal or the plant to push out, as a vine its tendrils, in all directions, while natural conditions are as constantly exercising over it a sort of unconscious pruning power, so imagination is ever at work urging man's mind out and on, while the sentiment of the community, commonly called common sense, which simply means the point already reached by the average, is as steadily tending to keep it at its own level. The environment helps, <b>in</b> the one <b>case</b> as <b>in</b> the other, to the shaping of the development. Purely physical in the first, it is both physical and psychical in the second, the two reacting on each other. But <b>in</b> either <b>case</b> {{it is only a}} constraining condition, not the divine impulse itself. Precisely, then, as in the organism, this subtle spirit checked in one direction finds a way to advance in another, and produces in consequence among an originally similar set of bodies a gradual separation into species which grow wider with time, so in brain evolution a like force for like reasons tends inevitably to an ever-increasing individualization.|$|R

40|$|Dust {{and metal}} {{deposition}} are of important significance {{as an indicator}} of local air quality. However, their vertical deposition characteristics at greater heights are not well known. Settling dust samples were collected at four heights and at both sides of a 40 meters high building next to a busy urban road in Budapest, Hungary. In this study, concentrations and monthly deposition rates of nine elements are (Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr, Zn) evaluated. The study site can be characterized by average settling dust load showing a slight seasonal variation. Highest contamination was found for Cu, Pb and Zn. The sources of these metals could be the traffic and the weathering of materials of the built environment. The enrichment of these metals is generally the highest at the road-side of the building and at lower sampling heights, but Pb and Zn may show strong enrichment even at 33 m and at the low-traffic side of the building. This is generally the highest in the dry and windy periods suggesting the dominance of the resuspension of urban soil and road dust in the metal deposition. The vertical dust and metal deposition patterns mostly correspond to the supposed air-flow model <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> of highest chance of resuspension a special model is needed to clearly describe the deposition patterns.

40|$|INTRODUCTION This paper {{looks at}} the {{development}} of Stated Preference (SP) techniques in transport. It {{is a mix of}} history, review, and explanation of key techniques and arguments. It attempts to avoid controversy. All those mentioned have played a part in the development or understanding of the techniques available today. With respect for these efforts we need to identify promising areas for the development of improved methods for the future. In large measure, this paper reports what was written at the different stages of development of SP methods. Extensive quotes are included. While nothing that is now seen as plainly wrong has been left unremarlted, there has not been any intention to critically assess each contribution. On some matters the jury is still out, whilst more generally it is true to say that SP design is a compromise which inevitably involves accepting some deficiencies to gain other benefits. This paper arises out of an EPSRC fimded project into Stated Preference design, and so the review concentrates on design matters. Naturally, problems with estimation using SP data have implications for the design of SP experiments, and so some attention is given to estimation where this is thought relevant. By compressing so much into such a small space, the paper will be heavy going for many readers. Do not despair. It is strongly recommended that no more than a single subsection be attempted at a sitting. Thanks to those who have helped, particularly with the arduous typing, and apologies to those whose work I have left out, misrepresented or maligned or whose name I have misspelt etc. Having taken two years to get this far, the thought of a further revision is too horrific to contemplate at the moment, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> I would be happy to receive comments, corrections, typos, improvements to references, additional references etc. Enjoy...|$|E

6000|$|The {{spirit of}} those agents {{will be fully}} comprehended from {{a state of the}} {{proceedings}} before Mr. Rouse and Council, on the complaint of a Mr. Cree, an English free merchant at Dacca, who had been twice treated in the same injurious manner by the agents of Mr. Hurst, the Commercial Chief at that place. On his complaint to the board of the seizure of the goods, and imprisonment of his agents, Mr. Hurst was called upon for an explanation. In return he informed them that he had sent to one of the villages to inquire concerning the matter of fact alleged. The impartial person sent to make this inquiry was the very man accused of the oppressions into which he was sent to examine. The answer of Mr. Hurst is in an high and determined tone. He does not deny that there are some instances of abuse of power. [...] "But I ask," [...] says he, [...] "what authority can guard against the conduct of individuals? but that a single instance cannot be brought of a general depravity." [...] Your Committee have reason to believe these coercive measures to have been very general, though employed according to the degree of resistance opposed to the monopoly; for we find at one time the whole trade of the Dutch involved in the general servitude. But it appears very extraordinary that nothing but the actual proof of a general abuse could affect a practice the very principle of which tends to make the coercion as general as the trade. Mr. Hurst's reflection concerning the abuse of authority is <b>just,</b> <b>but</b> <b>in</b> this <b>case</b> it is altogether inapplicable; because the complaint was not of the abuse, but of the use of authority in matters of trade, which ought to have been free. He throws out a variety of invidious reflections against the Council, as if they wanted zeal for the Company's service; his justification of his practices, and his declaration of his resolution to persevere in them, are firm and determined,--asserting the right and policy of such restraints, and laying down a rule for his conduct at the factory, which, he says, will give no cause of just complaint to private traders. He adds, [...] "I have no doubt but that they have hitherto provided investments, and it cannot turn to my interest to preclude them now, though I must ever think it my duty to combat the private views of individuals who set themselves up as competitors under that very body under whose license and indulgence only they can derive their privilege of trade: all I contend for is the same influence my employers have ever had."

40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Well {{it finally}} happened. I’ve {{run out of}} ink- This will be a short letter honey, because I’m {{going to the movies}} in a second to see “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”. Sorry that I didn’t write {{yesterday}} but Charlotte cut school + was here all day until I went to Bobbies. Didn’t get home until quarter to eleven + so didn’t write. Nothing very interesting happened. Bobbies on the train going to New York now. Her train leaves at two. Golly, I wish I were going to leave today to see you- she’s not too excited. Guess she can’t believe it. Excuse the time elapsing. Just went to the movies or rather come back from there. Saw “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”. That was some picture. It sure made me realize there’s a war on. They should have more of the actual fighting pictures and some of the training films that the Army sees. It would make people think a lot more. But whenever they show things, the worst side of the war, all the bloody killing + wounded, people are so queer. They get the attitude of why waste our time with this. I can’t understand it. Lately they’ve been showing the pictures of the wounded men and every time someone is sure to ask why they bore “us” with this. More + more people are reacting that way. Can’t understand it. Woody wants me to come down tonight. I really don’t want to at all because I don’t feel like talking to anyone. But I’ve been postponing it for so long I guess I’ll have to. I’d much rather stay home and write you. Wait a sec. I’m going to look for some ink. Don’t know if this will work for long. My ink was all dried up + so I put some water on it. Hope it holds out til tomorrow. We’re having lousy weather again- now it’s raining today! Well, there’s one consolation about that – it washed a lot of the snow away. Last night was awful. It rained and froze as soon as it hit the ground- It was just like skating to move. We slid out of Bobbie’s house. You should have seen Daddy going down Bobbie’s steps. He just sat down and slid. Got a little damp but got down safely. Gee, darling, {{are you going to be}} able to live off the post? What’s this about you’re going to transition at Spence Field? Will you be going to transition? I thought we’d go right to Texas. Oh, not that it makes much difference. One place is just as good as the other as long as we can be together. But how long will the transition be? Will you be able to get any time off after we’re married for a honeymoon? Oh, where are we going if we go? Gee, honey, it’s not very much longer now. Wonder what it will be like to be married to a flier. Hope that you’ll be able to live with me wherever we are. Rex is licking my nose. Everything around here is always so calm and peaceful when I’m writing you. Daddy thinks that he can get a tube for my radio. Hope so. But you can sing to me. That reminds me, darling, how about it. You never did sing. I must do something about that. Happy George Washington’s Birthday. They’re playing “My Ideal”- you sure are! Ever since that first night we went out together I knew you were the only one for me. Oh, the King Cole trio is playing almost. Anyway he said they would. It’s the Ballrooms + you know those commercials – Oh, “It’s Only a Paper Moon”- Golly, that remind me of you so much. I miss you so, honey, whenever I hear songs that we heard together I get so lonesome. Songs mean so much. They bring back more memories than anything else. Was lying down but can’t write that way. There wasn’t any mail delivery. Holidays are awful. Do you miss letters as much as I do when they don’t come. This week went pretty fast. Not half fast enough though. Well, seventeen more days. Tomorrow it will only be sixteen and the next day fifteen and then two weeks- Golly, in a way time has gone real fast but in another way it seems years and years. Gee, darling, everyone keeps wanting to know if I’m excited but it doesn’t’ seem near and I’m not. But one reason is that you’re not here- whenever you call, I get excited and it seems more real. Now it’s more like a wonderful dream. Honey, how many announcements do you want printed? Can you make a list sometime? We have to order them soon- they’ll probably get them all ready except for your name. You’re such a problem- Lieutenant Wm. Judson Clark. That sounds real nice. You’re going to make a wonderful officer. Can hardly wait to see you in an officer’s uniform. I’ll bet you look sharp. You’re so handsome anyhow, honey. I’m so glad that your hair is curly. You look adorable when you wake up in the morning. When your hair is all curly and you’re half asleep. Oh, everytime they showed Van Johnson asleep it reminded me of you. He sleeps somewhat the same way you do. Except you look so much cuter than he does. Whether you’re asleep or awake. Know what? I love you. You’re without doubt the most wonderful man in the world, the best flier and if I keep this up, you’ll be the most conceited. But I love you so, honey. Gee, honey, will you have to study at night the way he did? I hope not. I wonder how often you’ll have to fly nights. What do they do to you in transition? What is that for? What do you learn? Will you fly twin engines there? Honey, I wish we were married and together now. It is so ling since the last time you were home. Golly, Christmas might be a thousand years ago. It certainly seems it. I just want to be with you again more than anything else in the world. Oh, that reminds me, Woody go a letter from Sweetie yesterday and he said he thought they were cutting his leave and that he probably wouldn’t be able to come up to see her in March. That’s getting out of it nicely but it certainly wouldn’t foo me- I don’t know how Woody could fall for his line. Guess because she wants to. It’s funny how people believe what they want to. If I were a what am I saying, if I were Woody or someone Steve had handed a lite to, I’m sure I’d see through it right away. Anyway I’ve always believed about ¼ of what a fellow says. That’s the safest way and the only practical thing I’ve ever done. Gee, honey, next time I see Bobbie I’ll be Mrs. Clark. You’ll be an officer, too. Wonder what Ace will be. Oh, honey, what will we do when you get a leave? Will we go home or what and if we do go home where will we stay. If we stay at either your house or my house where would we sleep? I was thinking about that. When you get a leave where would we go. I can think of more problems can’t I? Ricky is at the Nisar’s now. Last night they called Bobbie so that Ricky could say goodnight. She got so excited. It was the first time he talked over the phone. She was so cute. Yelling that she could hear him breathing. You’d think she’d left him there about ten months ago. Wonder where Bobbie is now. She’s on her way anyway. Wish we were. Bobbie shipped her big suitcase and had a rickety old one that was ready to give up + collapse any minute. Then she had a shoebox of sandwiches. Can’t you see her, all she needed was pigtails and a big ribbon. We’re going to be much worse. Mother doesn’t want me to ship the bag because she’s sure something will happen to them. Well, the three bags of mine, my hat box, a box with my wedding dress, another box with my veil, mother’s suitcase, Daddy’s suitcase, Mom’s suitcase, some stuff of yours that she’s bringing. Hilda’s suitcase and all of us are going to fit into a tiny drawing room for two people- that should be good- besides that we’re going to bring something to eat, too. How we’ll do it is beyond me- oh, well, that’s a minor detail. Gee, darling, I miss you so. I sure wish these seventeen days would hurry. Everyone says they will but they’re not getting married. How do you feel, honey, are you getting excited? Golly, you’ll be getting your wings and married on the same day. I hope you’ll be able to remember our anniversary. Oh, honey, in case you haven’t answered it, would you wear an identification bracelet if I got it for you. I’d like to give you one for graduation but I know how you feel about the one you have now. Well? And if you’ll wear another one, would you rather have silver or gold? And if you wait, what in the name of heave can I give you? Answer that, please. Honey, I love you so. I’m so lonesome without you. It seems a million years since we were together. It won’t be much longer now. How many hours do you have now, honey? Have you finished your night cross countries? When do you start your instruments or have you already? How many hours of instruments do you have to have? Hope that you aren’t working to hard, honey. I know how awfully hard it is for you to write but you’ve been wonderful. You’ve been really better than I have. I certainly appreciate your letters, honey, and they’ve all been marvelous. I hope we’re not apart for long ever. Never can say what I want to in a letter. I suppose that you know that Kenneth had pnomonia [sic]. Can’t spell it- But he’s much better now. Sat up for three hours yesterday. Didn’t want to tell you until someone else did because I really don’t know very much about it. Anyway now that he’s better I guess someone has told you. That reminds me if you’re ever sick or anything, promise me you’ll tell me + not try to keep it from me? I’d rather you told me than hearing someone else say something. Of course you’ll probably never be ill <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>case.</b> Well, honey, just returned from Woody’s. Sorry but it’s late. Wish I could write more but it’s late now. I love you so much, my darling. What a night! It’s so foggy that we couldn’t see ten feet ahead of us Daddy almost drove up two trees. Golly we couldn’t even see the road. I love you so, honey, I’ll never be able to tell you how much but anyway I’ll keep trying. Golly darling 17 more days. I miss you more and more. Hope these seventeen days go real fast. I’ll write tomorrow again, honey, I love you so. You say “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” didn’t you, honey? Gee, it was good. Anything with men in reminds me of you. I love you so, honey. Goodnight for now. I adore you, honey. You’ll have all my love- Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
