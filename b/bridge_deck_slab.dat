40|$|While the {{expansive}} corrosion of steel reinforcement {{is a major}} concern in reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs,</b> the non-corrosive fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bars provide an excellent alternative reinforcement. This thesis investigates the behaviour of restrained concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with different types and ratios of FRP reinforcing bars under static loading conditions. The research includes two different phases; experimental and theoretical investigations. In the experimental phase, nine full-scale <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> 3000 -mm long × 2500 -mm wide × 200 -mm deep were constructed and tested to failure. Five <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> were reinforced with glass FRP bars, two <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> were reinforced with carbon FRP bars, one <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> was reinforced with steel bars, and the last <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> was constructed without any reinforcement (plain concrete). The <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> were supported on two steel girders spaced at 2000 -mm centre-to-centre and were subjected to a monotonic single concentrated load over a contact area of 600 mm x 250 mm to simulate the foot print of a sustained truck wheel load (87. 5 kN - CL- 625 Truck) acting on the centre of each slab. The experimental results were presented in terms of cracking, deflection, strains in concrete and reinforcement, ultimate capacity and mode of failure. It was observed that the mode of failure for all reinforced <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> was punching shear with carrying capacities of {{more than three times the}} design factored load specified by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). It was also concluded that the maximum measured crack widths and deflections at service load level were below the allowable code limits. The theoretical phase has two parts. The first part includes developing a finite element model (FEM) to analyze and predict the behaviour of <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with FRP reinforcement. The efficiency and accuracy of the computer model was verified by comparing its results to the experimental results. Then the FEM was used to conduct a parametric study on the most important parameters that are known to affect the behaviour of the <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> In addition the finite element program was used to analyze a typical concrete bridge reinforced with GFRP bars. The second part of the theoretical phase includes developing a new punching shear model to predict the punching shear capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> The proposed model can predict with good accuracy the punching capacity of FRP-reinforced <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> as well as FRP-reinforced two way slabs.

The effects of the relative thickness between the overlay and slab(to/ts) and relative elastic modulus(Eo/Es) were evaluated for constant typical values for Es = 27. 5 GPa and ts = 200 mm. Three Eo/Es ratios were considered; 0. 5, 0. 75,and 1. 0. For each Eo/Es ratio,three to/ts ratios were considered; 0. 281, 0. 375,and 0. 45 corre-sponding to overlay thicknesses of 55, 75,and 90 mm. It was found that the shrinkage-induced shear and normal bond stresses in-crease as Eo/Es ratio increases and as to/ts ratio increases. The FEA results agreed with modified Fowler 2 ̆ 7 s guidelines results in terms of the general trend,but the estimated bond stresses by the FEA were significantly higher.

This experimental program was primarily undertaken to examine the corrosion process in reinforced concrete repair, which has different characteristics as compared with corrosion in new construction. The program was designed to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} how certain restoration strategies may lead to problems of electrochemical incompatibility and result in ineffective corrosion mitigation. Fifteen specimens, 1 m by 1 m by 0. 2 m, were cast to represent a section of a deteriorating reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab.</b> The central portion was uniquely designed to simulate the deterioration caused by corrosion activity in a <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab.</b> After initiating corrosion using wetting and drying cycles with 15 % salt solution, each specimen was subjected to a unique restoration strategy.

In addition, the results from the electrochemical testing revealed sharp differences in the corrosion behaviour of the different restoration strategies. However, the physical evidence of minimal corrosion for all four specimens that were demolished {{at the end of the}} testing period, reveals a discrepancy with the electrochemical testing results...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} 70 years, corrosion-induced {{deterioration}} of bridge concrete decks {{has resulted in}} replacement and repair of the deck and a serious need for finding alternative design strategies that would substantially reduce susceptibility of the concrete deck to corrosive environments and the subsequent maintenance cost as well. One alternative is to replace the reinforcing or prestressing steel in concrete with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bars, which are corrosion-resistant, and {{have a very high}} strength-to- weight ratio. FRP bars can be used as either non-prestressed or prestressed reinforcement. Despite ongoing research mostly focused on prestressed and non-prestressed FRP reinforced concrete beams, less attention has been focused on the structural performance of bridge deck slabs with actual dimensions, boundary conditions, and structural details. Clear understanding of the structural performance and failure mechanism of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> as well as constructability issues are not achievable unless full-scale tests are conducted. The main objective of this research is to establish a design methodology that can be applied to designing a bridge deck system prestressed and reinforced with aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP) bars under service and ultimate loads. The research approach of this investigation consists of conducting an experimental study on a full-scale <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> including two precast concrete panels prestressed and reinforced with AFRP bars perpendicular to, and parallel to the traffic direction, respectively. The precast panels are connected via a cast-in-place seam (wet joint). In order to gain clearer insight and valid interpretation of the structural performance, the components of the bridge deck are separately tested as well. This includes flexural and shear tests of the cast-in-place panel-to-panel seam, flexural tests of an 1830 mm long strip prestressed with AFRP bars representing the bridge deck section perpendicular to the traffic direction, and flexural tests of an 1830 mm long strip reinforced with AFRP bars representing the bridge deck section parallel to the traffic direction. Once the flexural capacity of the strips and panel-to-panel seam is known, the load capacity of the bridge deck and the corresponding failure mechanism can be better analyzed. Yield line theory, commonly used for analysis and design of steel reinforced concrete slabs, is employed and modified to perform the failure load analysis of the deck slab in spite of the linear and brittle behavior of AFRP bars. Tensile characteristics of AFRP bars are experimentally investigated in {{the first phase of the}} project to provide a reliable data set for analytical and experimental studies of the bridge deck system in subsequent steps. Other than the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab,</b> this research presents development of a comprehensive computational model for analysis and design of a bridge girder in composite action with the deck slab. To compute the maximum deflection, rational equations based on studying the curvature distribution are derived herein for both prestressed and non-prestressed FRP reinforced concrete beams. The existing deflection equations are typically empirically-derived formulae, which were originally calibrated for steel reinforced concrete beams and hence not suitable for FRP case as the FRP bars have lower modulus of elasticity compared to conventional steel. Consequently, from this research, the structural performance of an AFRP concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> with full-depth precast prestressed panels is studied and an applicable method for design and failure load analysis is established. Moreover, for FRP reinforced and prestressed concrete beams, two rational deflection equations are developed for suitable design office implementation...|$|E

Different end stiffening arrangements were considered, including the presence of PL- 3 barriers walls (recently renamed to TL- 5) as well as the concrete curb supporting intermittent steel posts carrying the bridge railing. The barrier length changed from 3 to 12 m, while the cantilever length ranged from 1. 0 to 3. 75 m.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{empirical}} deck design method has increased its acceptance due to the economic advantages that it presents when compared to its counterpart, the traditional method.

40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} has {{the potential}} to significantly reduce the life cycle cost of concrete structures. The ability for concrete to undergo autogenous self-healing is largely dependent upon the width of the cracks in the material. Shape memory polymers (SMP) can be used to close cracks in concrete and produce a compressive stress across crack faces, enhancing the load recovery associated with this healing process. Previous proof of concept studies used commercially available SMP strips to close cracks within small scale mortar beams. Within this thesis, specifically manufactured high shrinkage polymer samples are refined and tested. An SMP tendon system is developed which is capable of activation via electrical heating. This system is incorporated into structural concrete beam samples with and without steel reinforcement. Crack closure is successfully achieved and the system’s performance assessed with suggestions for future development. Enhanced autogenous healing of structural concrete using SMP strips is confirmed by comparing the mechanical load recovery of samples cured for one, three and six months. The SMP tendons are applied at full-scale, alongside three other self-healing techniques investigated as part of the Materials 4 Life project, to assess their performance in the field.

Core samples were examined and used as test samples, for the Alkali-Silica reactivity test samples, as well as the compressive strength test, the Chloride Ion test, and the freeze thaw testing which was performed on two sets of 12 concrete core samples that were taken from different locations in the project. These locations are the representations of the age of the concrete. Thus, the age difference between the samples’ two sets is four decades. Testing was performed on prisms cut from cores. ASTM C- 666 procedure (A) was applied using an automatic test system [6]. It was suggested that a plan for renovation of this project should be performed after the analysis is undertaken to assess the conditions estimating the remaining life of the concrete in this project [15]...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} research {{investigation was}} conducted {{to evaluate the use}} of Stay-in-Place Metal Forms (SIPMFs) in construction of concrete bridge decks. The objectives of this research project were to establish the state-of-the-practice for use and performance of SIPMFs for bridge decks, to evaluate the field performance of bridge decks with and without SIPMFs, and to investigate the behavior of environmentally conditioned large-scale laboratory bridge deck specimens with and without SIPMFs. A survey was developed and administered to all DOTs to examine the state-of-the-practice of using SIPMFs for concrete bridge deck construction. Additionally, a field investigation {{was conducted to}} evaluate the performance of existing concrete bridge decks constructed with and without SIPMFs. This field investigation included visual inspection of 10 bridge decks and laboratory investigation of full-depth cores obtained from the inspected bridge decks. The cores were investigated using visual inspection, compressive strength tests, and ultrasonic tests. A laboratory durability investigation was conducted on 24 large-scale <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> specimens with and without SIPMF. Four specimens were used as control specimens, and the remaining 20 specimens were subjected to either freeze/thaw exposure and repeated load cycles or salt-water exposure and repeated load cycles. All specimens were constructed using epoxy-coated steel reinforcing. At various stages before, during, and after the environmental exposures, ultrasonic pulse-echo testing was used to determine the quality of contact between the SIPMFs and concrete for specimens with SIPMFs. Furthermore, after the completion of the environmental exposure, ultrasonic through-transmission testing was used to assess the condition of the concrete for all specimens. Overall, a statistical bias was present in the results of the survey as a function of climate region. Apparent equivalency of deck performance was observed using field inspection as well as visual inspection, compressive strength, and pulse-velocity profiles of the cores. Small changes in the performance of bridge deck specimens with and without SIPMF were measured during the structural and ultrasonic laboratory test programs...|$|E
40|$|Bridge deck slabs {{are one of}} {{the most}} corrosion-vulnerable bridge {{components}} due to the direct exposure to de-icing chemicals and severe weathering conditions. The use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) as reinforcement for bridge deck slabs is a promising solution to corrosion-related problems. Recently, glass FRP (GFRP) bars have been widely used as internal reinforcement for concrete bridge deck slabs since they are less expensive compared to the other kinds of FRPs (Carbon and Aramid). Since bridge deck slabs directly sustain repeated moving wheel loads, they {{are one of the}} most bridge elements susceptible to fatigue failure. However, the performance of FRP-reinforced concrete elements subjected to cyclic fatigue loading, which is a critical design limit for bridge decks, has not been fully explored. This research is designed to investigate, analytically and experimentally, the fatigue behaviour and fatigue life of concrete bridge deck slabs reinforced with glass FRP bars. The experimental program includes construction and testing of ten full-size deck slabs. The test parameters include reinforcement type, reinforcement ratio in the bottom and top layers, and the scheme of fatigue loading. The experimental program was carried out in two phases each with five deck slab prototypes. The first phase investigated the behaviour of deck slabs under accelerated, variable amplitude, fatigue loads till failure. The second phase investigated the behaviour of test prototypes, loaded till failure, under monotonic loading conditions preceded by a specified number of fatigue load cycles representing different life-time loadings. Phase two helped to verify the residual static capacity as well as the performance and durability of the GFRP reinforcement under service loading conditions. The analytical study was conducted in two parts. The first part included developing a new fatigue life model, P-N curve, to predict the fatigue life of such slabs. This model was extended to evaluate equivalent damage relationships between different wheel load cycles and amplitudes. It was also used to calculate the fatigue damage accumulated to a bridge deck along its service life. The second part of the analytical study included finite element modeling (FEM) to analyze and predict the behaviour of bridge decks under static and cyclic fatigue loads. The FEM was carried out using commercially available software, ANACAP. The analytical model was verified against the test results and then was used to investigate the effect of different parameters such as concrete compressive strength and wheel loads in tandem on the fatigue performance of such structural elements. Results are presented in terms of deflections, strains in concrete and GFRP bars, mode of failure and crack widths at different levels of cyclic loading. The results showed the superior fatigue performance and longer fatigue life of concrete bridge deck slabs reinforced with glass FRP composite bars. The proposed fatigue life model and equivalent damage rules are in good agreement with test results. The FEM was able to predict the behaviour of FRP-reinforced concrete bridge decks with high accuracy. Based on the performed experimental and analytical study, useful conclusions and recommendations for <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> design were provided...|$|E
40|$|Increasing traffic {{loads and}} changes in code {{provisions}} lead to deficits in shear and flexural capacity of many existing highway bridges. Therefore, {{a large number of}} structures are expected to require refurbishment and strengthening in the future. This projection is based on the current condition of many older road bridges. Different strengthening methods for bridges exist to extend their service life, all having specific advantages and disadvantages. By applying a thin layer of carbon textile-reinforced mortar (CTRM) to <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> and the webs of pre-stressed concrete bridges, the fatigue and ultimate strength of these members can be increased significantly. The CTRM layer is a combination of a corrosion resistant carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabric and an efficient mortar.

40|$|Synopsis: The {{punching}} shear capacity of concrete slabs reinforced with three-dimensional fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) double-layer reinforcement cages composed of glass fiber-reinforced pultruded grating elements {{has been investigated}} using full-scale experimental tests {{and a number of}} different analytical models. Test specimens were full-scale prototype <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> with varying end restraint and support conditions, differing dimensions, and two different FRP bar fiber lay-ups. The tests results were compared with the {{punching shear}} models in ACI 318, ACI 440, Eurocode 2, BS 8110, CEB-FIB MC 90, JSCE, and a number of models proposed in the literature specifically for FRP reinforced slabs. Based on this investigation a new empirical model has been developed to predict the punching shear capacity of double layer grids having either restrained or simply supported edges and including an overlapping splice. The model is shown to give reasonably good predictions for both simply supported and restrained slabs...|$|R
