5|$|Once {{the fair}} idea was conceived, several sites were {{considered}}. Among the sites considered within Seattle were Duwamish Head in West Seattle; Fort Lawton (now Discovery Park) in the Magnolia neighborhood; and First Hill—even closer to Downtown than the site finally selected, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> densely developed. Two sites {{south of the}} city proper were considered—Midway, near Des Moines, and the Army Depot in Auburn—as was a site east of the city on the south shore of Lake Sammamish.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> monumental.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{somewhat}} controversial {{argument is}} that evolution in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural proteins (such as enzymes), control embryonic development. In turn, these regulatory genes {{turn out to be}} based on a very old set of highly conserved genes which Carroll nicknames the toolkit. Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that toolkit genes such as Hox must have evolved before the Cambrian radiation which created most of the animal body plans that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> often by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same signal may be given at a different time in development, in {{a different part of the}} embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.|$|E

25|$|Looking up {{data in a}} trie {{is faster}} in the worst case, O(m) time (where m is {{the length of a}} search string), {{compared}} to an imperfect hash table. An imperfect hash table can have key collisions. A key collision is the hash function mapping of different keys to the same position in a hash table. The worst-case lookup speed in an imperfect hash table is O(N) time, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> typically is O(1), with O(m) time spent evaluating the hash.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysler 4-wheel {{disc brake}} system was {{more complex and}} {{expensive}} than Crosley's, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the enemy}} is forced to attack the {{defensive}} trenches with conventional infantry assault (as during World War I) {{at the cost of}} terrible losses, without assistance of armored forces or line-of-sight firing guns. Because of the possibility of redeployment, significantly less manpower is required than the Maginot-like defenses. The semi-mobile engagement also psychologically preferable than the claustrophobic feeling of Maginot-like bunkers in long term. This type of defensive line required 5-10 times less manpower and concrete per kilometer than the Maginot or Siegfried line with equal (or more) effectiveness, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> imagination is required from the builders because every part of the line were inevitably unique design adapted to local conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Melba {{embarked}} on an affair with Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans. They were seen frequently together in London, which excited some gossip, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> suspicion arose when Melba travelled across Europe to St Petersburg to sing for Tsar Nicholas II: the Duke followed closely behind her, and they were spotted together in Paris, Brussels, Vienna and St Petersburg. Armstrong filed divorce proceedings {{on the grounds of}} Melba's adultery, naming the Duke as co-respondent; he was eventually persuaded to drop the case, but the Duke decided that a two-year African safari (without Melba) would be appropriate. He and Melba did not resume their relationship. In {{the first years of the}} decade, Melba appeared in the leading European opera houses, including Milan, Berlin and Vienna.|$|E
25|$|Another form of skin cancer, {{malignant}} melanoma, is {{much less}} common <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> dangerous, being lethal in about 15–20 {{percent of the cases}} diagnosed. The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet exposure is not yet fully understood, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved. Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to estimate the effect of ozone depletion on melanoma incidence. One study showed that a 10 percent increase in UVB radiation was associated with a 19 percent increase in melanomas for men and 16 percent for women. A study of people in Punta Arenas, at the southern tip of Chile, showed a 56 percent increase in melanoma and a 46 percent increase in nonmelanoma skin cancer over a period of seven years, along with decreased ozone and increased UVB levels.|$|E

500|$|Among Lennon's biographers, Ben Urish and Kenneth Bielen view [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] as [...] "a chiding though {{positive}} {{message for}} humanity", while Jon Wiener praises Lennon's [...] "rich, deep voice" [...] on a recording where {{the sound is}} [...] "irresistible". Philip Norman describes the song as [...] "similar to 'Cold Turkey' in tempo <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> relaxed and humorous", adding that Spector's production gave Lennon's voice [...] "a taut expressiveness it had not had since 'Norwegian Wood'".

500|$|Joyce's {{method of}} stream of consciousness, {{literary}} allusions and free dream associations was {{pushed to the}} limit in Finnegans Wake, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> extensive than that used by Lewis Carroll in Jabberwocky. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the Wake of Ulysses as his [...] "usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles" [...] to the Wake itself. However, readers {{have been able to}} reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.|$|E
500|$|Shego (voiced by Nicole Sullivan): Kim's primary {{combatant}} {{and most}} dangerous opponent; a supervillain with the superhuman {{ability to generate}} powerful green energy blasts from her hands. Shego is Drakken's sarcastic – <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> intelligent – sidekick, who openly mocks the scientist {{with little regard for}} his seniority. The character finds herself making up for Drakken's incompetence on multiple occasions. Originally the lone female member of a team of superheroes known as Team Go alongside her four brothers, Shego eventually makes a full conversion to villainy after ultimately growing attracted to the evil she once fought against (in addition to finding her brothers annoying). Smart, athletic and attractive, Shego is essentially a [...] "dark reflection" [...] of Kim, as well as the only character the heroine truly has reason to fear, although the two archrivals share a mutal respect for each other at the same time.|$|E

500|$|A {{waterspout}} {{is defined}} by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish [...] "fair weather" [...] waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea. In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous. In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.|$|E
500|$|Declaring {{the song}} Gaga's [...] "most stirring" [...] release, Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound called the track: [...] "a {{sweeping}} and intensely powerful number— it's {{not just any}} ordinary pop song". Christopher Tapley from Variety praised both Gaga and Warren's songwriting, describing it as: [...] "something of an anthem for the cause... It {{is one of the}} strongest contenders in this year's race for best original song [...] <b>But</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> than that, it is a rally cry for a movement." [...] Lisa Wright wrote in NME that the song is: [...] "a somber piano ballad befitting of the topic with lyrics that depict the frustration of being told to pick yourself up and carry on by people who couldn't possibly understand your situation." [...] Idolator's Robbie Daw claimed that the [...] "powerful, unsettling" [...] visuals were complimented by a [...] "strong vocal performance" [...] from Gaga. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone called it an [...] "evocative track", which highlighted Gaga's vocals and believed it to be [...] "a perfect follow-up to [...] with Tony Bennett". Spanos added that [...] " [...] following [...] critical and commercial miss with most recent album Artpop and help break Warren's losing streak at the show." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in the early 2000s, Moffat refused to even mention Chalk, joking that he might get attacked in the street. The first series received criticism from some teachers and teaching unions, who criticised the representation of their professions. Letters were printed in specialist publications such as the Education Guardian. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelled Chalk as [...] "perverse" [...] and [...] "vapid", and its leader called upon the show to be axed. [...] Teachers, according to the Daily Record, complained that the show portrayed teachers as [...] "mentally unstable", and deterred people from entering the profession. John Grillo, who played Mr Carkdale, recalls that he was appearing in a West End play {{at the time he}} was auditioning for the role; a fellow actor in the play was meant to be auditioning for Chalk but, having been a deputy head teacher earlier in his career, was so disgusted by the material that he refused to attend. The unions' derision actually inspired The Timess [...] Matthew Bond to like the show. However, despite identifying [...] "genuine humour" [...] such as Slatt's rant against French teachers, Bond's review is largely critical. He concedes, [...] "the teaching organisations, you see, are half right. Slatt has no credible basis in the teaching profession, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> importantly he has no credible basis in the human race. And what we don't believe in, we rarely find funny." ...|$|E
