5|$|Brazilian {{weightlifter}} Fabrício Mafra {{lost his}} bronze {{medal in the}} men's 105 kg competition. He tested positive for abnormal levels of testosterone, and Damian Abbiate, the competitor from Argentina, received the medal in his place. Colombian cyclist Libardo Niño Corridor, who won a silver medal in the men's individual road time trial, {{tested positive for the}} banned substance erythropoietin (EPO), and consequently the silver medal went to Matias Medici of Argentina and the bronze medal to Dominique Rollin of Canada. Nicaraguan baseball player Pedro Wilder Rayo Rojas tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid <b>boldenone,</b> and lost his bronze medal from the men's baseball competition, but his teammates kept their medals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Boldenone,</b> {{also known}} as Δ1-testosterone, is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and the 1(2)-dehydrogenated analogue of testosterone. <b>Boldenone</b> itself has never been marketed; as a pharmaceutical drug, it is used as <b>boldenone</b> undecylenate, the undecylenate ester.|$|E

25|$|<b>Boldenone</b> {{is among}} the {{substances}} banned by Major League Baseball, {{as well as most}} other major athletic organizations. Los Angeles Angels minor league outfielder Reynaldo Ruiz in September 2010 and Philadelphia Phillies minor league pitcher San Lazaro Solano in January 2011 each received a 50-game suspension for the 2011 season as a result of testing positive for a metabolite of <b>boldenone.</b> Jenrry Mejia, formerly of the New York Mets, was suspended in July 2015 when he tested positive for <b>boldenone</b> and stanozolol, and in February 2016 he again tested positive for boldenone; this marked Mejia's third positive test for a performance-enhancing drug, for which he received the first PED-related lifetime ban in MLB history. Abraham Almonte was suspended for 80 games before the 2016 season after testing positive for <b>boldenone.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Boldenone,</b> {{also known}} as Δ1-testosterone, 1-dehydrotestosterone, or androsta-1,4-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically testosterone with a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions.|$|E
25|$|Leading horse trainer Gai Waterhouse {{was fined}} $10,000 after being found guilty on May 15, 2008 of {{presenting}} a horse to the races with a prohibited substance in its system. Her horse Perfectly Poised {{was found to}} have traces of the banned substance <b>boldenone</b> in its system after finishing second at Canterbury in April 2007.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. <b>Boldenone</b> undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, <b>boldenone</b> (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{activity}} of <b>boldenone</b> is mainly anabolic, {{with a low}} androgenic potency. <b>Boldenone</b> will increase nitrogen retention, protein synthesis, increases appetite and stimulates the release of erythropoietin in the kidneys. <b>Boldenone</b> was synthesized {{in an attempt to}} create a long-acting injectable methandrostenolone (Dianabol), for androgen deficiency disorders. <b>Boldenone</b> acts similar to methandrostenolone with fewer adverse androgenic effects.

2500|$|<b>Boldenone</b> is {{marketed as}} {{veterinary}} drug as <b>boldenone</b> undecylenate (a derivative of <b>Boldenone)</b> under the following brand names: [...] Boldebal H, Equipoise, and Sybolin.
