5|$|In February 2015, UBS {{announced}} {{to be investigated}} {{by the federal government}} over new charges stating that UBS facilitated tax evasion by its U.S. clients. The focus of the investigation lies on the possible sale of <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds,</b> a type of unregistered security that provides anonymity to the owner. UBS announced that it was cooperating with the investigators.|$|E
5|$|The investigation, {{which was}} {{launched}} in January 2015, also aims to determine whether <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> were provided as investment vehicles to UBS clients before the expiration of its 2009 deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The agreement lapsed in October 2010. Should UBS have violated the agreement, {{the federal government can}} make new allegations against UBS on charges stemming from the violation. In such a case, prosecutors would likely ask for significant fines and for UBS to be put under regulatory oversight.|$|E
5|$|The British {{response}} to the bombing came on 30July, when the division carried out Operation Shark. Believing that the bombers were being sheltered in Tel Aviv, every dwelling and building was searched {{for members of the}} Lehi and Irgun, and the population questioned. During the operation, a cordon surrounded the city and a curfew was imposed on its inhabitants. To allow the population to buy food and other essentials, the curfew was lifted for two hours every second day, {{until the end of the}} operation. The division's three parachute brigades were each given one quarter of the city to cordon and search while the fourth quarter was the responsibility of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, attached to the division for the operation. Over four days each brigade questioned around 100,000 people, and 787 were detained for further questioning. During the searches, five arms dumps were found, containing four machine guns, twenty-three mortars, 176 rifles and pistols, and 127,000 round of ammunition. Also found were £50,000 of forged <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds,</b> forging equipment and a large amount of explosives.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bearer</b> <b>bond</b> is a bond or debt {{security}} issued by a business entity {{such as a}} corporation, or a government. As a bearer instrument, it differs from the more common types of investment securities {{in that it is}} unregistered [...] - [...] no records are kept of the owner, or the transactions involving ownership. Whoever physically holds the paper on which the bond is issued owns the instrument. This is useful for investors who wish to retain anonymity. Recovery of the value of a <b>bearer</b> <b>bond</b> in the event of its loss, theft, or destruction is usually impossible. Some relief is possible in the case of United States public debt.|$|R

2500|$|Bearer bond is an {{official}} certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, {{the person who}} has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. <b>Bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> are very risky because they can be lost or stolen.

2500|$|The Belgium {{securities}} tax {{applies to}} certain transactions concluded or executed in Belgium through a professional intermediary, {{to the extent}} that they relate to public funds, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin. The [...] "tax on stock exchange transactions" [...] is not due upon subscription of new securities (primary market transactions). Both buyers and sellers are subject to the tax. The tax rate varies in accordance with the type of transactions. A 0.09% tax (subject to a maximum of €1.300 per transaction) is charged for distributing shares of investment companies, certificates of contractual investment funds, bonds of the Belgian public debt or the public debt of foreign states, nominative or <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds,</b> certificates of bonds, etc. A 1.32% tax (subject to a maximum of €4.000 per transaction) is charged for accumulating shares of investment companies and 0.27% (subject to a maximum of €1.600 per transaction) for any other securities (such as shares). Transactions made for its own account by non-resident taxpayers and by some financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, organizations for financing pensions (OFPs) or collective investment are exempted from the tax.|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{history of}} the Continental dollar is constructed from original sources and tested against evidence on prices and exchange rates. The Continental dollar was a zero-interest <b>bearer</b> <b>bond,</b> not a pure fiat currency. The public was promised redemption at face value in specie at fixed future dates. When time-discounting (rational bond pricing) is separated from depreciation, little depreciation occurred before 1779. In 1779, and again in 1780, Congress passed ex post facto laws altering Continental-dollar maturity dates. Because these new dates were not fiscally feasible, Congress’ commitment to the Continental dollar lost credibility. Depreciation and collapse followed shortly thereafter. ...|$|R

Assuming, therefore, that Germany is not able to provide any appreciable surplus towards Reparation before 1921, she will have to find a sum of $375,000,000 annually from 1921 to 1925, and $900,000,000 annually thereafter.[113] ...|$|E

The Raam differs from other complementary currencies because its {{focus is on the}} export of products rather than improving local circulation to benefit the lives of local people. According to the Minister of Finance for the Global Country of World Peace, the Raam [...] "could be used" [...] for agricultural projects in developing nations. [...] CATO Institute currency expert James Dorn expressed doubt about the viability of the plan, suggesting that other economic approaches would be a better way to establish a network of collective farms.

On the basis of my estimate of $40,000,000,000 for the total liability, which {{is more likely to be}} criticized as being too low than as being too high, the amount of this balance will be $15,000,000,000.

40|$|Many {{official}} {{groups have}} endorsed the wider use by emerging market borrowers of contract clauses which {{allow for a}} qualified majority of bondholders to restructure repayment terms {{in the event of}} financial distress. Some have argued that such clauses will be associated with moral hazard and increased borrowing costs. This paper addresses this question empirically using primary and secondary market yields and finds no evidence that the presence of collective action clauses increases yields for either higher- or lower-rated issuers. By implication, the perceived benefits from easier restructuring are at least as large as any costs from increased moral hazard.
