50|$|The Land Use {{report is}} Beyond Zero Emissions' plan to slash GHG {{emissions}} in the land use sector by analysing each component of Australia's agriculture, herding and forestry activities which together emit more than 50% of Australia's CO2-e when calculated as GWP20 rather than GWP100. The plan identifies several simple changes that together would achieve net zero emissions within 10 years : 1. Restoring 13% - i.e. 55 million hectares - of Australia’s most exposed cleared land at an opportunity cost of approximately $5.3 billion per year, adding to income diversity for regional businesses. 2. Cease clearing and re-clearing land for agriculture. 3. Reduce excessive emissions from beef through improved management across the industry. 4. Sequester 7,500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> of the eucalyptus forests of south-east Australia. In addition, the plan finds that expanding revegetation activities beyond 13% would result in net carbon capture.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the park is owed to the {{conservation}} efforts of artists. Canadian Group of Seven artist A. Y. Jackson was so alarmed by the prospect that Trout Lake (now O.S.A. Lake) {{was about to be}} logged that he petitioned the Provincial government of the day to have it preserved. His letter was received by William Finlayson, then the Minister of Lands and Forests, resulting in a successful conclusion. The lake was taken into trust by the Ontario Society of Artists and its name was changed to O.S.A. Lake. Jackson's efforts were rewarded with the naming of a lake after him on his 90th birthday. The hills and lakes in the Killarney area became a popular place for painting and sketching and over the years several other members of the Group of Seven worked there including Franklin Carmichael, Arthur Lismer and A. J. Casson. In 1959 the Killarney Park area was set aside as a wilderness preserve. In 1962 Highway 637 opened, connecting the north shore of Georgian Bay {{all the way from the}} town of Killarney to the Trans-Canada Highway. Finally in 1964, with the help of lobbying efforts by the Group of Seven, 4000 sq mi of Georgian Bay shoreline were set aside as a wilderness reserve, and Killarney became a provincial park.The park has experienced some challenges that threaten the health of its delicate local ecosystems. Owing in large part to its proximity to Sudbury with its nickel mines and smelters, local lakes were damaged by acid rain. Pollution caused by the smelting activities associated with nickel mining between the 1940s and the 1970s, caused many of Killarney's lakes to become acidified, resulting in the loss of fish species, algae and aquatic plant life in many of the lakes. This damage was especially severe in the quartzite areas. Legislation passed in the 1970s forced the industry to improve its emissions standards. Since then, sulphur emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent. To date, water quality has improved in some lakes to pre-pollution levels, while in other lakes the slow process of <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> continues. More recently, the lakes have been under threat from non-indigenous invasive species such as the Bythotrephes longimanus (a.k.a. spiny water flea), which threaten local species.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT 12 This paper {{deals with}} the 20 -year (1988 - 2008) record of macroinvertebrate {{sampling}} from the UK’s 13 Acid Waters Monitoring Network. At 12 of the 22 sites a significant temporal trend in the 14 macroinvertebrate community is now evident. Indices of acidification suggest <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> at 15 five of the 11 streams sites and at five of the lakes. All 10 sites indicating <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> from 16 acidification also showed an increase in acid-neutralising capacity (ANC), although a further seven 17 sites showed chemical (ANC) recovery but no evident <b>biological</b> <b>recovery.</b> On a site-by-site basis 18 eight (four streams and four lakes) of the 20 sites investigated had significant relationships between 19 biotic indices of acidification and chemical measures of acidity, the latter explaining between 30 % 20 and 72 % of the biotic variation.

40|$|Most {{proteins}} and large polypeptides have hydrophobic regions at their surface.

The food web was highly interconnected and reticulate, especially in years when species richness was low, and subsidized by external inputs of detritus. Among the primary consumers, generalist herbivore– detritivores maintained feeding links with the scant algal resources, which appeared insufficient to support viable populations of specialist grazers.

Application of the method to excreta and chyme samples of four feeding trials with turkeys, chickens, pullets, and roosters confirmed DON- 3 -sulfate as the major DON metabolite in all poultry species studied. Analogously to DON- 3 -sulfate, DOM- 3 -sulfate was formed after oral administration of DOM both in turkeys and in chickens. In addition, pullets and roosters metabolized DON into DOM- 3 -sulfate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of dredging intensity on the physical and <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> times of the seabed following marine aggregate dredging. Two areas of seabed, previously subject to, respectively, relatively high and lower levels of dredging intensity, were identified on the Hastings Shingle Bank. Two reference areas were also selected for comparative purposes. All four sites were monitored annually over the period 2001 – 2004, using a combination of acoustic, video and grab sampling techniques. Since the site was last dredged in 1996, this was intended to provide a sequence of data 5 – 8 years after cessation of dredging. However, an unexpected resumption of dredging within the high intensity site, during 2002 and 2003, allowed an additional assessment of the immediate effects and aftermath of renewed dredging at the seabed. The early stages of recovery could then be assessed after dredging ceased in 2003. Results from both dredged sites provide a useful insight into the early and latter stages of physical and <b>biological</b> <b>recovery.</b> A comparison of recent and historic dredge track features provided evidence of track erosion. However, tracks were still visible 8 years after the cessation of dredging. Within the high dredging intensity site, recolonisation was relatively rapid after the cessation of dredging in 2003. Rather than indicating a full recovery, we suggest that this initial ‘colonization community’ may enter a transition phase before eventually reaching equilibrium. This hypothesis is supported by results from the low intensity site, where <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> was judged to have taken 7 years. Further monitoring is needed in order to test this. An alternative explanation is that the rapid recovery may be explained by the settlement of large numbers of Sabellaria spinulosa.

40|$|Summary 1.  Although European streams are now {{recovering}} chemically from acidification, <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> is limited. One {{hypothesis is}} that continuing acid episodes restrict acid-sensitive species in recovering locations either through direct toxicity or by affecting ecological processes. Here, we test this hypothesis by assessing the effects of episodic acid exposure on the breakdown and macroinvertebrate colonisation of oak (Quercus robur) litter. 2.  Over 83 days, acid episodes of 4 days’ duration were simulated by repeatedly transplanting litter bags of contrasting mesh size between replicate acidic and circumneutral streams around Llyn Brianne (Wales, U. K.). Results were compared against controls from circumneutral streams and circumneutral transplants, while invertebrates colonising litter were compared with adjacent assemblages. 3.  Breakdown was retarded significantly by repeated acid exposure in comparison with circumneutral transplants, but only in litter to which invertebrates had access. Overall breakdown was also significantly slower in fine-mesh than in coarse-mesh bags. 4.  Plecopteran shredders were the major invertebrate colonists of litter, along with smaller numbers of grazers and predators. However, acid exposure eliminated or suppressed acid-sensitive families, resulting in an overall composition converging on that in acid streams. 5.  The rapid loss of sensitive invertebrates from acid-exposed litter supports the hypothesis that acid episodes suppress <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> from acidification through direct physiological effects. However, our litter breakdown data indicate that (i) some effects of acid episodes could be mediated through litter processing; and (ii) episodic acidification could disrupt litter breakdown through effects on invertebrate composition or activity.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two themes {{concerning}} the anthropogenic impacts on Finnish lakes {{during the past}} 150 years. The effects of pulp mill discharges, municipal wastewaters and diffuse loading on the ecosystems of large lakes were studied from macroinvertebrate samples and from short-core paleolimnological samples. The response of benthic invertebrates to acidification and the patterns of recovery were studied from the littoral macrozoobenthos of acid-sensitive headwater lakes. The long-term responses of lacustrine chironomids to the changing degree of acidification were studied from paleolimnological samples. Based on the {{physical and chemical properties}} and biological remains in the sediment, several developmental phases were distinguished in the ecological status of the loaded lakes. These phases differed from each other on the basis of changing ecological disturbance affecting the lake ecosystems. The sediment profiles covered the time from the pre-industrial phase to the phase of severe pollution and, later on, to the phase of recovery. The lakes exposed to point loading from industrial and municipal sources revealed recent <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> patterns, while the lakes suffering from diffuse loading still revealed an ongoing eutrophication process. The study of acidic headwater lakes revealed many acid-sensitive benthic taxa, but also taxa tolerant of acidification. Recent chemical recovery was accompanied by a slight <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> in the most acidified lakes. Sedimentary chironomid assemblages of acidified lakes revealed only slight changes during the past centuries. Possible future trends and threats to the <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> of loaded lakes are discussed.

40|$|Hemophilia B is a {{bleeding}} disorder caused by deficiency in blood clotting factor IX (FIX). FIX circulates as a 55 – 57 kDa inactive precursor of the serine protease, FIXa. Activation {{results in the}} release of the activation peptide to generate an amino terminal light chain of Mr∼ 18, 000 and a carboxyl terminal heavy chain of Mr∼ 28, 000 linked by a disulfide bridge. The light chain consists of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid rich gla domain, followed by two epidermal growth factor-like domains. The gla domain contains several low affinity divalent metal ion binding sites and primarily gives FIX its metal-dependent conformation. The heavy chain contains the catalytic domain, conferring proteolytic activity to FIXa. The biosynthesis of recombinant human FIX in the milk of transgenic pigs (tg-rhFIX) at 3 ̆e 100 units coagulation activity per ml creates several major subpopulations that differ primarily in the content of γ-carboxyglutamic acid. Using a final purification step of size exclusion chromatography with saturating [Ca 2 +], we generated three distinctive subpopulation pools of tg-rhFIX based on gla content: low gla (3 ̆c 6), 3 ̆e 6 gla and high gla (3 ̆e 9 gla). Each pool exhibited different biological and structural characteristics. Biological activity and FIXa content increased for higher gla pools. Binding to metal-dependent monoclonal antibodies and phospholipid also increased for higher gla pools. ^ Recent pharmacokinetic studies with tg-rhFIX show differences in the <b>biological</b> <b>recoveries</b> of the three pools while antigen recoveries are similar. We hypothesize that the three pools undergo proteolytic degradation differently. In vitro treatment by plasmin of tg-rhFIX with varied gla exhibited contrasting degradation in the presence of calcium or EDTA.

While Factor IXα retains procoagulation activity, Factor IXγ has its putative exosite for FX binding disrupted thereby rendering it inactive.

Unfortunately, for many reasons, collecting geofluids poses a number of challenges, from formation contamination by drilling to maintainingintegrity during recovery from depths. Not only are there substantial engineering issues in retrieval of a representative sample, but there is often the practical reality that fluid sampling {{is just one of}} many activities planned for deep boreholes. The U-tube geochemical sampling system presents a new paradigm for deep borehole fluid sampling. Because the system is small, its ability to integrate withother measurement systems and technologies opens up numerous possibilities for multifunctional integrated wellbore completions. Todate, the U-tube has been successfully deployed at four different field sites, each with a different deployment modality, at depths from 260 m to 2 km. While the U-tube has proven to be highly versatile, these installations have resulted in data that provide additional insights for improving future U-tube deployments...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant {{proteins}} and enzymes {{are commonly used}} {{in many areas of}} our life, such as diagnostics, industry and medicine, due to heterologous synthesis in prokaryotic expression systems. However, a high expression level of foreign protein in bacteria cells results in formation of inactive and insoluble aggregates – inclusion bodies. Reactivation of aggregated proteins is a complex and time-consuming process. Every protein requires experimental optimization of the process conditions. The choice of the refolding method depends on the type of recombinant protein and its physical, chemical and <b>biological</b> properties. <b>Recovery</b> of the activity of proteins accumulated in inclusion bodies can be divided into 4 steps: 1) inclusion bodies isolation, 2) solubilization of aggregates, 3) renaturation, 4) purification of catalytically active molecules. Efficiency of the refolding process depends on many physical factors and chemical and biological agents. The above parameters determine the time of the folding and prevent protein aggregation. They also assist the folding and have an influence on the solubility and stability of native molecules. To date, dilution, dialysis and chromatography are the most often used methods for protein refolding. ...|$|R
