25|$|In {{addition}} to Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), Arc-fault circuit interrupter devices (AFCI) are equally important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc-faults resulting from damage in <b>branch</b> <b>circuit</b> wiring {{as well as}} extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets. By detecting hazardous arc-faults and responding by interrupting power, AFCIs helps {{reduce the likelihood of}} the home's electrical system being an ignition source of a fire. Dual Function AFCI/GFCI devices offer both electrical fire prevention and shock prevention in one device making them a solution for many rooms in the home, especially when replacing an existing standard receptacle or existing ungrounded receptacle.|$|E

[...] This saves a homeowner a trip to the breaker panel should the device trip. [...] Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles can be used on any wiring system, regardless of the panel. When installed as the first receptacle on a <b>branch</b> <b>circuit,</b> AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire <b>branch</b> <b>circuit.</b> They also provide parallel arc protection for the <b>branch</b> <b>circuit</b> starting at the AFCI receptacle.|$|E

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems bolted short-circuits are rare and the fault usually involves arcing and burning; mostly the limit value of minimum short-circuit depends really on arcing-fault. In AC low voltage systems, the paper examines the arcing-fault <b>branch</b> <b>circuits</b> as weak points. Different protection measures are available against the arc-faults. A first measure that can guarantee a probabilistic protection is {{allowed by the}} adoption of overcurrent protective devices (OCPD), optimizing {{the design of the}} structure of the system and/or the coordination of protection. A well known complete protection is allowed by adopting are-fault circuit interrupters (AFCI) for the protection of <b>branch</b> <b>circuits.</b> The authors suggest a new complete protection allowed wiring the <b>branch</b> <b>circuits,</b> including particularly extension cords, with special power cables, protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPD). The suggested design for single-core or multi-core power cables is that each insulated core has a concentric conductor shield.

2500|$|When {{supplying}} a <b>branch</b> <b>circuit</b> {{with more}} than one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a [...] "common trip" [...] breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common trip breakers are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including major appliances or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common trip breakers are typically used to supply three-phase electric power to large motors or further distribution boards.|$|E
50|$|The alternators had {{rotating}} armatures with 216 radial 4 inch slots {{formed into}} the perimeter. Each slot holds two insulated 3 1/2 foot rectangular inductive bars of related phase, an {{inner circle of}} 216 bars and an outside circle of 216 bars. The induction bars are twice bent into offsets in the same direction. The middle of the bar has a straight section 3 feet long, {{to get from the}} front of the rotor to the back. The inner circle of bars is connected to the outer circle by small conductive jumper blocks on the front and back of the rotor. The rotor's three phases are connected to six <b>branch</b> <b>circuits.</b> Each of the six <b>branch</b> <b>circuits</b> make their way three times progressively around the rotor in right hand flattened spirals.|$|R
50|$|A problem arises if the {{electricity}} supply is upgraded, by adding new generation capacity or by adding cross-connections.

2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated <b>branch</b> <b>circuit).</b> The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer the following advantages over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the saw blade mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved dust collection due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a dust collection port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications. Where some {{of the advantages of}} a cabinet saw are desired in a home shop application, so-called [...] "hybrid" [...] saws have emerged to address this need.|$|E

50|$|For smaller <b>branch</b> <b>circuits</b> {{with solid}} wires (15A/20A circuits) typical {{connections}} of an electrical wire to an electrical device are usually made by wrapping the wire around a screw on the device, also called a terminal, and then tightening the screw.

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault usually involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damages and all other insulation stresses like: -mobile <b>circuits,</b> -no fixed <b>branch</b> <b>circuits,</b> -electric appliances cords, -extensions.
