5|$|To {{help keep}} the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making the building appear oversized. Besides the sunscreens, Plexiglas {{was used in the}} <b>board</b> <b>room,</b> in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities, these rooms where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor. These fitting are also in the former <b>board</b> <b>room,</b> which is located in a 'commanding' position on the fifth floor, overlooking the river below.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a <b>board</b> <b>room</b> of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on <b>boarding</b> and <b>rooming</b> establishes {{the important role}} of boarding in the housing market. <b>Boarding</b> and <b>rooming</b> have traditionally provided temporary, inexpensive accommodation for those who have come to the city to seek employment. The {{first half of the twentieth}} century was a period of dramatic economic and social change and yet there is no study of boarding during this period. This is a study of the declining incidence of <b>boarding</b> and <b>rooming</b> in Hamilton during the period 1900 to 1948. There is a dramatic decline in <b>boarding</b> and <b>rooming</b> during the first fifteen years of the twentieth century. Rates remain low during the 1920 's with a slight resurgence seen during the Great Depression and the Second World War...|$|R
