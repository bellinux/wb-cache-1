40|$|Abstract. Demand {{forecasting}} {{with regard}} to stock control is a central issue of inventory management. Serious difficulties arise for intermittent demands, that is, if there are slow-moving items demanded only sporadically. Prevalent methods then usually perform poorly as they do not properly take the stochastic nature of intermittent demand patterns into account. They often rely on theoretically unfounded heuristic assumptions and apply inappropriate deterministic smoothing techniques. We overcome these weaknesses by means of systematically built and validated stochastic models that properly fit to real (industrial) data. Initially, no assumptions are made but statistical methods are invoked for model fitting. Reasonable model classes are found by summary statistics and correlation analysis. Specific models are obtained by parameter estimation and validated by goodness-of-fit tests. Finally, based on the stochastic models, stock control strategies are proposed to facilitate service levels guarantees in terms of probability bounds for <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> ...|$|E

It is a readiness-based model that seeks to determine the depths of items of a weapon system which minimize the system's Mean Supply Response Time subject to budget constraint. The model incorporates both a batch procurement and batch repair of the items. Required inputs to this model are the specified values of each. Basic {{to the development of}} this model are the derivations of formulas for the probability of <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> at any instant of time and the expected number of backorders at any instant of time. Formulas for these measures are presented for the assumptions of both Poisson and Normal demand during the aggregate lead time. The model also needs a formula for the safety stock. Therefore approximate formulas for safety stock have been derived {{through the use of a}} simulation model of the repairable inventory management process. Finally, because the batch procurement and repair quantities are required inputs to the proposed model, formulas for approximate least cost values have been derived as part of a study of possible candidate values for these inputs.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{there are}} {{biomedical}} drugs for managing diabetes mellitus, some patients with diabetes use traditional medicine. The {{aim of the}} study was to explore why patients with diabetes use traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Methods The study was conducted in Iganga and Bugiri districts in Eastern Uganda using four focus group discussions (FGDs) with patients with diabetes; two with female patients and two with male patients, thirteen key informant interviews (KIIs); nine with health workers working with patients with diabetes and four with herbalists. FGDs and KIIs focused on what respondents perceived as reasons for patients with diabetes taking traditional medicine. Analysis was done using content analysis. Results Reasons for taking traditional medicine included finding difficulties accessing hospitals, diabetic drugs <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock,</b> traditional medicine being acceptable and available within community, as well as being supplied in big quantities. Others were traditional medicine being cheaper than biomedical treatment and payment for it being done in installments. Traditional medicine was also more convenient to take and was marketed aggressively by the herbalists. Influence of family and friends as well as traditional healers contributed to use of traditional medicine. Conclusions Possibilities of putting diabetic drugs at facilities closer to patients need to be considered and health facilities should have a constant supply of diabetic drugs. Community members need to be sensitized on the proper treatment for diabetes mellitus and on the dangers of taking traditional medicine. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Only a {{small amount}} of {{research}} has focused on the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and geographic access to prescription medications at community pharmacies in North America and Europe. To examine the relationship between a community’s socio-economic context and its residents’ geographic access to common medications in pharmacies, we hypothesized that differences are present in access to pharmacies across communities with different socio-economic environments, and in availability of commonly prescribed medications within pharmacies located in communities with different socio-economic status. Methods We visited 408 pharmacies located in 168 socio-economically diverse communities to assess the availability of commonly prescribed medications. We collected the following information at each pharmacy visited: hours of operation, pharmacy type, in-store medication availability, and the cash price of the 13 most commonly prescribed medications. We calculated descriptive statistics for the sample and fitted a series of hierarchical linear models to test our hypothesis that the in-stock availability of medications differs by the socio-economic conditions of the community. This was accomplished by modeling medication availability in pharmacies on the socio-economic factors operating at the community level in a socio-economically devise urban area. Results Pharmacies in poor communities had significantly higher odds of medications <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock,</b> OR= 1. 24, 95 % CI [1. 02, 1. 52]. There was also a significant difference in density of smaller, independent pharmacies with very limited stock and hours of operation, and larger, chain pharmacies in poor communities as compared to the middle and low-poverty communities. Conclusions The findings suggest that geographic access to a neighborhood pharmacy, the type of pharmacy, and availability of commonly prescribed medications varies significantly across communities. In extreme cases, entire communities could be deemed “medication deserts” because geographic access to pharmacies and the availability of the most prescribed medications within them were very poor. To our knowledge, this study is first to report on the relationship between SES and geographic access to medications using small area econometric analysis techniques. Our findings should be reasonably generalizable to other urban areas in North America and Europe and suggest that more research is required to better understand the relationship of socio-economic environments and access to medications to develop strategies to achieve equitable medication access. </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary Background: Medication is {{the major}} weapon for {{successful}} prevention and treatment of illnesses in modern societies. This makes access to effective medicines and their rational use fundamental to the provision of universal access to adequate health care, satisfying health-related human rights and attaining health-related Millennium Development Goals. However, {{lack of access to}} essential medicines is a major cause of loss of lives in developing countries. Almost 1. 7 billion people; 30 % of the world population lack regular access to essential medicines, and in Africa this figure goes over 50 %. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> essential medicines is one of the barriers of access to essential medicines in developing countries including Malawi. Commonly, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> situations <b>of</b> essential medicines occur at the health centres level. The consequences <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> situations <b>of</b> essential medicines include prolonged suffering of people, loss of both family and government income and more painfully loss of lives due to preventable and treatable diseases. This study, conducted in eight health centres in Lilongwe district in Malawi, addresses the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> situations <b>of</b> essential medicines in the distribution system at the health centre level. Objectives: The main objective {{of the study was to}} find the magnitude of essential medicines shortage and identify factors that could explain the shortage at health centre level in Lilongwe district, Malawi. Methods: The study was retrospective and cross sectional using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Reviews of essential medicines and patient records were done in eight health centres with eight selected essential medicines as markers. Relevant newspaper articles were also reviewed. In addition, structured and informal interviews with relevant personnel were conducted. Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel and the Software Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). Results: The study confirms that essential medicines shortage is a major public health problem at health centre level in Lilongwe district, Malawi. Retrospectively, the eight medicines were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> for 34. 2 % (7, 141 days) of the total observation period of 20, 880 days. In other words, on average the eight index medicines were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> for 123. 2 days (34. 2 %) of Malawi s financial year 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The cross sectional findings confirmed that the eight index medicines were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> in 43 (67. 2 %) <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 64 assessments. The <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> situations <b>of</b> the essential medicines varied more than 3 -fold among the health centres, from 5. 3 % in health centre number 7 to 18. 3 % in health centre number 6 and 7 times among the medicines, from 3. 3 % for pyrimethamine + sulfadoxine to 23. 1 % for benzyl penicillin. The study identified a low number of normal deliveries received by the health centres, increased frequency and long duration <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> situations, the number of days some medicines were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and low catchment population as predictors of the number of days the medicines were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> In addition, lack of training and supervision for health workers managing essential medicines, poor ability by the Regional Medical Stores (RMS) to supply requested amounts of medicines and theft were found to be other possible factors that could contribute to the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> situations. Oral medicines were better provided than the injectable medicines. The average utilisation difference between the stock cards and the patient records was 65. 9 %. This means that of the total amount of medicines received by the health centres, only 1 / 3 were recorded in the patients records. The discrepancies between the stock cards and the patient records were substantial for amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Conclusions: The findings suggest that access to essential medicines is a major public health problem in Lilongwe district health centres. With this situation, it is difficult for the district to contribute effectively towards attaining the universal access to adequate health care, satisfying the health-related human rights and attaining the health-related Millennium Development Goals. It is important that interventions to improve access to essential medicines are implemented if the district is to improve the quality of care in the health centres and contribute positively towards the health related Millennium Development Goals...|$|R

In 2015, LVCT Health conducted a study aimed at assessing the quality of HIV-related services offered to child survivors of sexual violence in public health facilities. Materials and methods: A qualitative data collection approach was utilized. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with 31 providers. Quantitative methods included a retrospective review of 164 records of child survivors of rape who had accessed services 6 {{months prior to the}} commencement of the study. SPSS Version 22 was used in the descriptive analysis of the medical records. Client exit interviews and observation data were analyzed using MS Excel. In-depth interviews were analyzed using a thematic analytical approach. Results: Twenty-seven percent (n= 164) survivors were documented to have received the first dose of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Providers did not conduct HIV pre- and posttest counseling for the survivors. There were no longitudinal follow-up mechanisms to ensure child survivors initiated on PEP adhered to the treatment plan. Less than 30 % of survivors returned to the facility for PEP adherence counseling and follow-up HIV testing. Twenty providers cited capacity gaps in undertaking HIV risk assessment for child survivors. Limited availability of PEP is a barrier to HIV prevention, as most departments only offer services between 8 am and 5 pm. HIV tests were only available on weekdays before 5 pm. PEP <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> remains a barrier to HIV prevention. Conclusion: Existing post-rape care services are not adequately structured to facilitate delivery of quality HIV-related services to child survivors. Health provider capacity in the management of children remains weak due to lack of skill-based training on the dynamics of responding to the needs of child survivors. There is a need for standard operating procedures and training modules on the prevention of HIV in the context of child sexual abuse.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of BagIt {{was to develop}} a web application to help consumers get the right product at the best price. The average consumer will price check all major retailers when purchasing an electrical appliance. This includes checking retailers sites individually and calling into different stores one by one. Customers often struggle to get the correct advice from sales assistants due to high staff turnover in stores, commission and stores <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> on certain products but still wanting to make a sale. BagIt quickly retrieves product information with a quick scan of a QR Code. This takes the ease out of manually searching for products, and allows for ease of comparison of product specs. I thought of the idea of BagIt while working part time as a rep for Dyson. I was placed in different stores and at different events most weeks and I quickly picked up on issues for consumers and retailers. In my case, I was only responsible for Dyson products in store. Dyson regulate their prices so all retailers will usually have the same price for Dyson. However consumers, including myself, usually have very little trust in sales staff. I regularly encountered customers falling in love with a product, spending on average 10 minutes asking everything they can think of and trying it out. They will then leave to check if the neighbouring stores have the product for cheaper, as they simply didn’t believe all stores will have it for the same price. When they arrive at the last store and discover the price is the same they will usually purchase it there. While the customer has reasurance that they could not have gotten their product for cheaper it is a long process that can be shortened through the BagIt application. Ensuring the customer saves time and the retailer who spends the most time looking after the customer gets the sale. In the case of products that are not regulated I noticed that all the major electronic retailers will price match their competitors if they have a lower price. Retailers would rather drop their price by a few euro than lose out on a sale. However in most cases the prices were kept the same across all retailers. When one retailer lowers their prices, others usually follow the same day. As well as price comparison, BagIt retrieves product specifications with a simple scan or search. Retailers locations are displayed {{at the bottom of the}} results page using Google Maps API. This gives the capability of checking both the best price and the closest retailer who stocks the product in the one place. BagIt can also be accessed on a mobile device and thus used in store. Before deciding to purchase an item, customers can very easily and conveniently check if another store nearby has the same product for a better price, All without leaving the first store or their home...|$|E
