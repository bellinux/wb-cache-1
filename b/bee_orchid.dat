5|$|Seven {{plants are}} {{protected}} by a regional scale: common spotted orchid, man orchid, <b>bee</b> <b>orchid,</b> zigzag clover, liquorice milkvetch, narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and wood forget-me-not.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} the <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, <b>bee</b> <b>orchid,</b> lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
50|$|There are waymarked boardwalk trails {{through the}} dunes where marsh and <b>bee</b> <b>orchids</b> flower {{during the early}} summer.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife {{including}} dragonflies, kingfishers and otters {{have been}} identified within the nature reserve. There is also a notable cluster of <b>Bee</b> <b>Orchids</b> (Ophrys apifera) within the reserve.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} woodland, a pond, scrub and grassland. Flora include blackthorns, hawthorns and <b>bee</b> <b>orchids,</b> there are birds such as blackcaps and willow warblers, and common blue and meadow brown butterflies.|$|R
5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{species to}} be found in the area include Swedish pouchwort (Calypogeia suecica), a {{bryophyte}} last found in Aghahoorin near Boho in 1961, <b>bee</b> <b>orchid,</b> (Ophrys apifera), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), marsh helleborine, (Epipactis palustris) and bird's-nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis) located in proximity to Boho Caves.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} to be the furthest north in England that chalk {{milkwort}} is found. Other species found include Horseshoe Vetch, yellow-wort, Autumn Gentian, and common thyme. There are also Pyramidal and <b>Bee</b> <b>Orchids.</b>|$|R
50|$|This was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} gardens of Gunton Old Hall, which was demolished in 1963. There are trees such as lime, oak and copper beech, a pond and green winged and <b>bee</b> <b>orchids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Danish {{zoologist}} Johan Christian Fabricius described Apis cerana, {{also known}} as the Eastern or Asian honey bee, in 1793. The genus name Apis is Latin for “bee.” The Asiatic honey bee is of the Apidae family, one of the most diverse families of bees, including common honey <b>bees,</b> carpenter <b>bees,</b> <b>orchid</b> <b>bees,</b> bumblebees, cuckoo bees, and even stingless bees.|$|R
25|$|Some {{plant species}} co-evolved with a {{particular}} pollinator species, such as the <b>bee</b> <b>orchid.</b> The species is almost exclusively self-pollinating in its northern ranges, but is pollinated by the solitary bee Eucera in the Mediterranean area. The plant attracts these insects by producing a scent that mimics {{the scent of the}} female bee. In addition, the lip acts as a decoy, as the male bee confuses it with a female that is visiting a pink flower. Pollen transfer occurs during the ensuing pseudocopulation.|$|E
25|$|Common {{species of}} tree include oak, ash, sycamore, alder, blackthorn, hawthorn, beech and birch. Less common (but plentiful) are wild cherry and Scots pine (also called red deal). Elm is now far less common, {{due to the}} devastating effects of Dutch elm disease. Gorse (or furze) is very common. A {{priority}} habitat in Wexford is the grey dune, on which many native wild flora grow, including <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> and pyramidal orchid. Despite the designation of much of this habitat as a Special Area of Conservation, it remains threatened by destruction for agricultural intensification. There is very little natural forest in the county. Most natural trees and vegetation grow on hedgerows.|$|E
500|$|The SSSI is {{designated}} as a Special Protection Area for birds because its variety of coastal habitats give it year-round importance {{for a number of}} species. The breeding colonies of Sandwich terns and little terns, especially those at Blakeney and Scolt Head Island, are of [...] European importance, and the coast is of national significance for common terns, pied avocets and reed bed specialists like western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The SSSI also holds large numbers of wintering ducks and geese, the endangered water vole, and scarce species like natterjack toad, starlet sea anemone, lesser centaury, sea barley and <b>bee</b> <b>orchid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Apinae are the {{subfamily}} {{that includes}} the majority of bees in the family Apidae. It includes the familiar [...] "corbiculate" [...] (pollen basket) bees — bumblebees, honey <b>bees,</b> <b>orchid</b> <b>bees,</b> stingless bees, and the extinct genus Euglossopteryx. It also includes {{all but two of}} the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae.|$|R
50|$|Apidae is {{the largest}} family within the {{superfamily}} Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes {{some of the most}} commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter <b>bees,</b> <b>orchid</b> <b>bees,</b> cuckoo bees, {{and a number of other}} less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops.|$|R
50|$|Eufriesea is a genus of euglossine <b>bees.</b> Like all <b>orchid</b> <b>bees,</b> {{they are}} {{restricted}} to the Neotropics.|$|R
500|$|The site {{consists}} of [...] of reserve, of which part is landscaped {{and can be}} visited by the public. At Slimbridge is the largest collection of wildfowl species in the world, and wild birds mingle with these in the enclosures. Some of the captive birds form part of international breeding programmes. The reserve includes a mixture of pastureland, much of which gets flooded in winter, lagoons, reed beds and salt marshes besides the Severn Estuary. Many wildfowl visit the site including greater white-fronted geese, spoonbills, avocets and even common cranes, the latter being birds that were originally bred here and later released on the Somerset Levels. There are also some rare species of plant on the reserve including the grass-poly (Lythrum hyssopifolia) and the wasp orchid, {{a variant of the}} <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> (Ophrys apifera).|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} April 1860, Darwin {{discussed}} {{insect pollination}} with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the <b>bee</b> <b>orchid.</b> Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to The Gardeners' Chronicle asking for readers' observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from Orchis morio and Orchis mascula plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray {{that he had been}} [...] "so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle", and made similar enquiries of other experts.|$|E
500|$|While the <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> showed {{adaptation}} for self-fertilisation, its mechanism also enabled occasional cross-fertilisation, {{creating the}} biological diversity that Darwin felt {{was needed for}} vigorous survival, {{which could not be}} provided by self-fertilisation. As an example of [...] "how beautifully everything is contrived", Darwin described how he had found that in Spiranthes flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen. At Torquay he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers, starting {{at the bottom of the}} spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers. He speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires, the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen. A bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee, then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant, and fertilise them. By this co-ordinated process, the bee would add [...] "to her store of honey" [...] while perpetuating the flowers [...] "which will yield honey to future generations of bees".|$|E
50|$|Gunton Warren is {{a coastal}} site which has sand dunes, shingle, lowland heath and cliff slopes. Birds include rare {{migrants}} including icterines and yellow-browed warblers. Corton Woods has mature trees and diverse flora such as lesser celandine, <b>bee</b> <b>orchids</b> and common spotted orchids.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{wet and dry}} meadows on {{the bank}} of the River Chelmer, which are grazed to restore them to their {{previous}} state. There are grassland plants such as saxifrage, <b>bee</b> <b>orchids</b> and yellow oat-grass. Tawny owls and sparrowhawks hunt in the meadows and ancient hedgerows.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{this site}} is ancient {{woodland}} of hornbeam, oak and silver birch, with an understorey which is mainly hazel and hawthorn. The other part is younger woodland which has wildflower glades with orchids such as broad-leaved helleborines, <b>bee</b> <b>orchids</b> and common spotted orchids. There are fauna such as slowworms and grass snakes.|$|R
2500|$|The dunes at Poppit Sands are {{important}} for wildlife, especially unusual plants such as the <b>bee</b> <b>orchid.</b> [...] National Park staff manage over 20 hectares (50 acres) of dune, marsh and grazing land here, {{and one of its}} projects is to turn the willow scrub behind the dunes back to a reed bed.|$|E
50|$|Diuris laxiflora, {{commonly}} called the banded <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> or <b>bee</b> <b>orchid</b> is {{a species of}} orchid which is endemic to Western Australia. It is a small orchid, common within its range and about {{half the size of}} the common donkey orchid, Diuris corymbosa.|$|E

5000|$|Stingless bees, {{sometimes}} called stingless honey bees or simply meliponines, {{are a large}} group of bees (about 500 species), comprising the tribe Meliponini (or subtribe Meliponina according to other authors). They belong in the family Apidae, and are closely related to common honey <b>bees,</b> carpenter <b>bees,</b> <b>orchid</b> <b>bees,</b> and bumblebees. Meliponines have stingers, but they are highly reduced and cannot be used for defense, though these bees exhibit other defensive behaviors and mechanisms. Meliponines are not the only type of [...] "stingless" [...] bee; all male bees and many female bees of several other families, such as Andrenidae, also cannot sting.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Male <b>orchid</b> <b>bees</b> collect volatiles, {{from both}} floral and non-floral sources, that they expose as phero-mone analogues (perfumes) during {{courtship}} display. The chemical profile of these perfumes, which includes terpenes and aromatic compounds, is both species-specific and divergent among closely related lineages. Thus, fragrance composition {{is thought to}} play an important role in prezygotic reproductive isolation in euglossine <b>bees.</b> How-ever, because <b>orchid</b> <b>bees</b> acquire fragrances entirely from exogenous sources, the chemical composition of male perfumes is prone to variation due to environmental heterogeneity across habitats.
