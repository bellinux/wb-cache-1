25|$|Old-style typefaces {{date back}} to 1465, shortly after Johannes Gutenberg's {{adoption}} of the movable type printing press. Early printers in Italy created types that broke with Gutenberg's blackletter printing, creating upright and later italic styles inspired by Renaissance calligraphy. Old-style serif fonts have remained popular for setting body text because of their organic appearance and excellent readability on rough <b>book</b> <b>paper.</b> The increasing interest in early printing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw {{a return to the}} designs of Renaissance printers and typefounders, many of whose names and designs are still used today.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Plimpton {{attended}} preseason {{training with}} the Detroit Lions of the National Football League {{as a backup}} quarterback, and ran a few plays in an intrasquad scrimmage. These events were recalled in his best-known <b>book</b> <b>Paper</b> Lion, which was later adapted into a feature film starring Alan Alda, released in 1968. Plimpton revisited pro football in 1971, this time joining the Baltimore Colts and seeing action in an exhibition game against his previous team, the Lions. These experiences served {{as the basis of}} another football book, Mad Ducks and Bears, although much of the book dealt with the off-field escapades of football friends such as Alex Karras and Bobby Layne. Another sports book, Open Net, saw him train as an ice hockey goalie with the Boston Bruins, even playing part of a National Hockey League preseason game.|$|E

60|$|Those {{who live}} in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the {{seclusion}} of schools or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be suddenly {{and for a long}} while dropped out of the memory of their friends, the denizens of a freer world. Unaccountably, perhaps, and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercourse--some congeries of rather exciting little circumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem to be the quickening than the suspension of communication--there falls a stilly pause, a wordless silence, a long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire and unexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the visit, formerly periodical, ceases to occur; the <b>book,</b> <b>paper,</b> or other token that indicated remembrance, comes no more.|$|E
