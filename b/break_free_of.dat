5|$|Founded in 1962, Tatsunoko Production {{celebrated their}} 40th year of {{animated}} film production by releasing Karas in 2005, their first production being Space Ace in 1965. Keiichi Sato {{joined the company}} as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life-sized dark hero to the management. He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project. Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time, and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show. The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas apart from its contemporaries. Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team's lack of experience in this area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and <b>break</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> restrictions influenced by traditional animation production.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters {{are perhaps the most}} famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can <b>break</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects.|$|E

However, during {{the second day of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to <b>break</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help.

However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E
