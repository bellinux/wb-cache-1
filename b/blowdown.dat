25|$|The plant {{utilizes}} non-contact {{cooling water}} from the Rock River, situated 2 miles (3.2km) to the west. The water used {{in the process of}} generating electricity is cooled in the station's two cooling towers and recirculated via the plant's <b>blowdown</b> line back into the Rock River. Other water, from Byron's Radioactive Waste Treatment system, is transferred to the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST), where it is analyzed and sampled for contamination. Once it passes through analysis, the water is discharged down the <b>blowdown</b> line into the river.|$|E

5000|$|Several fires burned {{large areas}} south of Cranberry Lake. The <b>blowdowns</b> of 1950 and 1995 did {{considerably}} more damage. South of the St. Lawrence County Line {{was owned by}} William Seward Webb, and was never commercially lumbered; this area was sold to New York State in 1896. It holds the largest unlogged tract anywhere in the Eastern United States. It has been considerably damaged by both <b>blowdowns,</b> including {{over half of the}} esker at Five Ponds. The old growth pine and red spruce stand on the esker between Big Five, Little Five and Big Shallow, Little Shallow and Washbowl ponds is an example of this virgin timber.|$|R

25|$|Any {{aircraft}} rudder {{is subject}} to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder, as on American Airlines Flight 587 (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, {{but it is more}} important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by rudder travel limiter. The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its <b>blowdown</b> limit; it is achieved when the force from the air or <b>blowdown</b> equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.|$|E

25|$|In February 2006, Exelon {{reported}} elevated tritium {{levels in}} the groundwater beneath the site. Tritium levels were elevated in two of six test wells, according to an Exelon release in February which noted that tritium concentrations of 86,000pCi/L were detected in standing water in underground concrete vaults along the plant's <b>blowdown</b> line. The company stated that the levels posed no risk to public or employee safety. The report coincided with ongoing tritium concerns at the Exelon-owned Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station near Braceville, Illinois. In September, elevated tritium levels were found at Byron in three monitoring wells adjacent to vacuum breaker vaults along the <b>blowdown</b> line. Two of the areas with elevated tritium {{were found in the}} shallow portions of the Galena-Platteville Aquifer, while the third location contained elevated tritium levels {{at the bottom of the}} same aquifer. None of the September levels exceeded the 20,000 pCi/L U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standard.|$|E
25|$|The explosion's {{effect on}} the trees near the {{hypocentre}} of the explosion was replicated during atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s, and {{was similar to the}} effects of the conventional Operation <b>Blowdown.</b> These effects are caused by the blast wave produced by large explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, while trees farther away are knocked over because the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.|$|E

500|$|In July 1948, she {{was renamed}} again, to her final name: Lynandi. She had a {{relatively}} uneventful few years, until 1954, {{when she had}} an accident which ended her career. On 14 January 1954, she was fishing off Old Head of Kinsale under her skipper W G King when her boiler developed problems. She was forced to <b>blowdown</b> her boiler and as a result, lost power. The steam trawler Inverforth began to tow her back to Milford, but two days and [...] later, during heavy weather, the tow parted and two attempts to reconnect it failed. She {{was in danger of}} drifting onto St Ann's Head, [...] distant. The Angle lifeboat and the tug Empire Rosa launched from Pembroke Dock but were unable to reach the trawler, which {{was in the middle of}} [...] waves. Inverforth and another trawler, the Thomas Booth (M274) stayed close, however, and allowed Lynandi to keep her bearings. The storm abated through the morning, and by 11 am the Empire Rosa had returned and was able to connect a tow line. By 4:15 pm, the Lynandi was safely back in Milford harbour. Her skipper commended the actions of both his own crew and those crews who assisted, and praised the seaworthiness of his ship, saying [...] "Although out of control, she proved a perfect sea ship and throughout the night never shipped a drop of water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous {{return of condensate}} to the boiler, losses due to <b>blowdown</b> and leakages {{have to be made}} up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|E

50|$|The trail begins {{just past}} the Rainbow Falls Trailhead on Cherokee Orchard Road, and slowly ascends Piney Mountain, topping out at an {{overlook}} on the mountain's northern slopes (the overlook's elevation is roughly 3,000 feet/914 meters).

50|$|Bottom <b>blowdown</b> piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom <b>blowdown</b> piping must be of a {{diameter}} large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom <b>blowdown</b> to a blowoff tank where the <b>blowdown</b> can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the <b>blowdown</b> entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier <b>blowdown</b> events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom <b>blowdown</b> valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the <b>blowdown</b> valve. The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. Bottom <b>blowdown</b> valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{response}} of the mainstem channel of North Fork Caspar Creek to recent logging is examined by time trends in bed load yield, scour and fill at resurveyed cross sections, and the volume and fine-sediment content of pools. Companion papers report that recent logging has increased streamflow {{during the summer and}} moderate winter rainfall events, and <b>blowdowns</b> from buffer strips have contributed more large woody debris. Changes in bed load yield were not detected despite a strong correlation between total scour and fill and annual effective discharge, perhaps because changes in stormflows were modest. The strongest responses are an increase in sediment storage and pool volume, particularly in the downstream portion of the channel along a buffer zone, where large woody debris (LWD) inputs are high. The association of high sediment storage and pool volume with large inputs of LWD is consistent with previous experiments in other watersheds. This suggests that improved habitat conditions after recent <b>blowdowns</b> will be followed in future decades by less favorable conditions as present LWD decays and input rates from depleted riparia...|$|R
