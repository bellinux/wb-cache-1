50|$|Space permitting, the {{terminus}} may be {{a purpose}} built run-around <b>Bus</b> <b>turnout,</b> which allows the bus to change direction simply by entering and leaving the turnout. Often the infrastructure for this remains from a previous tram or trolleybus system.|$|E
50|$|In the {{simplest}} case, a <b>bus</b> <b>turnout</b> type of bus stop is extended, and buses can lay over {{away from the}} stop if necessary. In locations where buses cannot remain stationary for long, nearby but separate bus stands may be provided where other bus parking is not conveniently located.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{bus stops}} {{may simply be}} placed on the {{sidewalk}} next to the roadway, although they can also be placed to facilitate use of a busway. More complex installations can include construction of a <b>bus</b> <b>turnout</b> or a bus bulb, for traffic management reasons, although use of a bus lane can make these unnecessary. Several bus stops may be grouped together to facilitate easy transfer between routes. These may be arranged in a simple row along the street, or in parallel or diagonal rows of multiple stops. Groups of bus stops may be integral to transportation hubs. With extra facilities such as a waiting room or ticket office, outside groupings of bus stops can be classed as a rudimentary bus station.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1994, {{as part of}} the Royal Route, Ujazdów Avenue was {{included}} in Poland's official national List of Historical Monuments by President Lech Wałęsa. [...] In 2009, Ujazdów Avenue underwent a complete renovation, with the planting of new trees, the complete reconstruction of sidewalks, <b>bus</b> <b>turnouts,</b> and creating bike paths for the route.|$|R
50|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{is served by}} King County Metro service on routes 216, 219 and 269, connecting the area to Sammamish, Redmond, Issaquah and Downtown Seattle. King County Metro also operates two carpool/vanpool park and rides in Klahanie. The neighborhood was bypassed by Metro bus service because of its low densities in the early 1990s, despite the construction of <b>bus</b> <b>turnouts</b> and other infrastructure in anticipation of service.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bus</b> <b>turnout,</b> bus pullout, bus bay, bus lay-by (UK), or {{off-line}} {{bus stop}} is a designated {{spot on the}} side of a road where buses or trams may pull out of the flow of traffic to pick up and drop off passengers. It is often indented into the sidewalk or other pedestrian area. A bus bay is, in a way, the opposite of a bus bulb. With a bus bulb, the point is to save the bus the time needed to merge out of and back into moving traffic, at the cost of temporarily blocking that traffic while making a stop. With a bus bay, the goal is to not block traffic while the bus is stopped, but at the cost of the time necessary to merge back into flowing traffic. Bus bays, therefore, will generally produce longer dwell times than bus bulbs.|$|E
40|$|Running, Los Angeles, 1982, Hollywood Freeway (101) {{northbound}} under Western Avenue (<b>bus</b> <b>turnout),</b> Hollywood. People running, {{their forms}} sparingly defined with calligraphic lines. Repainted in 1988 and 1990, due to graffiti. Nova color acrylic, 18 ' 6 " x 110 ', by Mark Bowerman and Jo Bowerman.

50|$|An {{early use}} of a BBS (originally called a BOS or bus on {{shoulder}} lane) is in Mountainside. Unlike most towns along Route 22, zoning in Mountainside {{does not allow for}} much commercial development adjacent to the freeway. For a 1 mi stretch in the town, the eastbound shoulder on the arterial road can be used by peak hour buses and allows for queue jumping. In 2009, NJDOT funded construction of two <b>bus</b> <b>turnouts</b> along the road in nearby Union In 2012, NJDOT regulated the BBS as an exclusive bus lane from 6 to 7:30am.|$|R
50|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} University Avenue, the Provo Orem MAX {{will continue}} east on University Parkway in shared lanes and will cross Canyon Road before passing by {{the northern edge}} of the BYU campus and the southern side of the LaVell Edwards Stadium. Just east of the stadium it will arrive at the LaVell Edwards Stadium stop at about 350 East. The stations for this stop will be located on the sides of University Parkway, directly north of the Larry H. Miller baseball field and immediately east of the signalized intersection with the events parking lot access. Since there are no dedicated lanes along this portion of the route, <b>bus</b> <b>turnouts</b> will be included for this stop. From this stop it will continue east on University Parkway. At about 850 East it will reach the next (yet unnamed) stop. This stop will have two stations on both sides of University Parkway. A new crosswalk with a traffic light will be constructed that will continue straight north across University Parkway from the existing sidewalk (pedestrian path) that runs along {{the east side of the}} Harmon Building. The southbound stop (heading east) will be just east of the crosswalk and the northbound stop (heading west) will be west of the crosswalk and the current parking lot access (which is anticipated to become the new main entrance to the Missionary Training Center). Since there are still no dedicated lanes along this portion of the route, <b>bus</b> <b>turnouts</b> will be also included for this stop.|$|R
50|$|NJ Transit Bus Operations routes 114 and 117 provide {{service to}} the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan in New York City while routes 65 and 66 travel to Downtown Newark, all making local stops at points in {{proximate}} communities. An early use of bus rapid transit in New Jersey, a BBS (bus bypass shoulder, originally called a BOS or bus on shoulder lane) has been in operation for many years. Unlike most municipalities along Route 22, zoning in Mountainside {{does not allow for}} much commercial development adjacent to the freeway. For a one-mile stretch in the town, the eastbound shoulder on the arterial road can be used for peak hour buses. In 2012, NJDOT regulated the BBS as an exclusive bus lane from 6 to 7:30am. In 2009, NJDOT funded construction of two <b>bus</b> <b>turnouts</b> along the road in nearby Union.|$|R
