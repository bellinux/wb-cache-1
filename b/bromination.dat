5|$|Organobromides are {{typically}} produced by additive or substitutive <b>bromination</b> of other organic precursors. Bromine {{itself can be}} used, but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used, such as N-bromosuccinimide. The principal reactions for organobromides include dehydrobromination, Grignard reactions, reductive coupling, and nucleophilic substitution.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in <b>bromination</b> reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). <b>Bromination</b> often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E

5000|$|This {{reaction}} mechanism was proposed by Roberts and Kimball in 1937. With it they explained the observed stereospecific trans-additions in <b>brominations</b> of maleic acid and fumaric acid. Maleic acid with a cis-double bond forms the dibromide as {{a mixture of}} enantiomers: ...|$|R
50|$|Roberts and Kimball in 1937 already {{accounted}} {{for the fact that}} <b>brominations</b> with the maleate ion resulted in cis-addition driven by repulsion between the negatively charged carboxylic acid anions being stronger than halonium ion formation. In alkenes such as anetholes and stilbenes the substituents are able to stabilize the carbocation by donating electrons {{at the expense of the}} halonium ion.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than <b>bromination</b> or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the <b>bromination</b> at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though {{it can be made}} by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride. Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic <b>bromination</b> by Br+.|$|E

For the elucidation of the reaction mechanism, toluene, which acts as a scavenger for the predominantly formed radicalic bromine, was added to the irradiation samples. Under the conditions mentioned, <b>brominations</b> occuring in the aromatic nucleus must have taken place by an electrophilic substitution. The non statistical formation of the position isomeric radioactive labelled compounds is due to different activation entropies of the reactive positions in the molecule.

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years there has been a huge {{increase}} in development and applications of organocatalysis in which the catalyst acts as a nucleophile. Amidines and guanidines are often only thought of as strong organic bases however, a number of small molecules containing basic functional groups have been shown to act as efficient nucleophilic catalysts. This tutorial review highlights the use of amidine, guanidine, and related isothiourea catalysts in organic synthesis, as well as the evidence for the nucleophilic nature of these catalysts. The most common application of these catalysts to date has been in acyl transfer reactions, although the application of these catalysts towards other reactions is an increasing area of interest. In this respect, amidine and guanidine derived catalysts {{have been shown to be}} effective in catalysing aldol reactions, Morita-Baylis-Hillman reactions, conjugate additions, carbonylations, methylations, silylations, and <b>brominations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative <b>brominations</b> and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The coordination chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|R
40|$|Different {{solid phase}} {{modifications}} were studied {{in order to}} develop new and simple routes for pharmaceutically interesting highly substituted carboxyindoles. A convenient method for the preparation of 5 -substituted 2 -carboxyindoles and three novel direct functionalization methods for carboxyindoles were developed during this study. 5 -Nitro- 2 -carboxyindole was synthesized easily in three steps from commercially available inexpensive 4 -nitro-aniline. Through attachment of this template to solid phase followed by reduction, reductive amination, N-alkylation and cleavage, a small library of differently substituted carboxyindoles were obtained. Solid phase <b>brominations</b> were studied followed by palladium catalyzed Suzuki-coupling. This technology offers an efficient and selective method to introduce bromine and a new C-C-bond to 3 -position of polymer bound 2 -carboxyindoles. Formylation studies were also succesfull. By utilizing Vilsmeier formylation a new C-C-bond was obtained direcly and selectively at the 3 -position of polymer bound 2 -carboxyindoles. In solid phase metalation studies of 5 -carboxyindoles a 4 -position functionalization was achieved in 80  % regioselectivity.

In [bmim][Br], alkynes stereospecifically gave the anty addition products, the reactions following a second-order rate law. In [bmim][PF 6], mixtures of syn and anti addition products were obtained, and the reaction followed a second- or third-order rate law, depending {{on the structure of}} the alkyne and the concentration of Br 2. The data obtained for the reactions in [bmim][Br] are interpreted {{on the basis of a}} mechanism involving a product- and a rate-determining nucleophilic attack by bromide on the alkyne-Br 2 Π complex. The data relating to the electrophilic addition in [bmim][PF 6] are explained in terms of the initial 1 : 1 alkyne-Br 2 Π complex, the ionisation of which, probably catalysed either by a second halogen molecule or by the imidazolium cation, gives a bromirenium (or β-bromovynil cation) Br- or [Br 3]- intermediate. Such intermediates then collapse to give the corresponding dibromo adduct(s). The kinetic constants and the activation parameters for the reaction in [bmim][Br] are compared with those relating to the second-order reaction of the same alkynes with tetrabutylammonium tribromide ([NBu 4][Br 3]) in 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE). On the basis of the kinetic data, a significant role for solvent viscosity in determining the reaction rate may be envisaged...|$|R
25|$|In electrophilic {{aromatic}} substitution reactions, naphthalene reacts {{more readily}} than benzene. For example, chlorination and <b>bromination</b> of naphthalene proceeds without a catalyst to give 1-chloronaphthalene and 1-bromonaphthalene, respectively. Likewise, whereas both benzene and naphthalene can be alkylated using Friedel–Crafts reactions, naphthalene can also be easily alkylated by reaction with alkenes or alcohols, using sulfuric or phosphoric acid catalysts.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the nitration and sulfonation, the direct <b>bromination</b> and chlorination of pyridine proceed well. The reaction of pyridine with molecular bromine in sulfuric acid at 130°C readily produced 3-bromopyridine. The yield is lower for 3-chloropyridine upon chlorination with molecular chlorine {{in the presence of}} aluminium chloride at 100°C. Both 2-bromopyridine and 2-chloropyridine can be produced by direct reaction with halogen with a palladium(II) chloride catalyst.|$|E

The allylic and benzylic radical intermediates formed during this reaction are more stable than other carbon radicals and the major products are allylic and benzylic bromides. This is also called the Wohl–Ziegler reaction.|$|E

25|$|It {{once was}} a popular solvent in organic chemistry, but, because of its adverse health effects, it is rarely used today. It is {{sometimes}} useful as a solvent for infrared spectroscopy, {{because there are no}} significant absorption bands > 1600cm−1. Because carbon tetrachloride does not have any hydrogen atoms, it was historically used in proton NMR spectroscopy. In addition to being toxic, its dissolving power is low. Its use has been largely superseded by deuterated solvents. Use of carbon tetrachloride in determination of oil has been replaced by various other solvents, such as tetrachloroethylene. Because it has no C-H bonds, carbon tetrachloride does not easily undergo free-radical reactions. It is a useful solvent for halogenations either by the elemental halogen or by a halogenation reagent such as N-bromosuccinimide (these conditions are known as Wohl-Ziegler <b>Bromination).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of NanoPutian’s lower body begins with nitroaniline {{as a starting}} material. Addition of Br2 in acetic acid places two equivalents of bromine on the benzene ring. NH2 is an electron donating group, and NO2 is an electron withdrawing group, which both direct <b>bromination</b> to the meta position relative to the NO2 substituent. Addition of NaNO2, H2SO4, and EtOH removes the NH2 substituent. The Lewis acid SnCl2, a reducing agent in THF/EtOH solvent, replaces NO2 with NH2, which is subsequently replaced by iodine upon the addition of NaNO2, H2SO4, and KI to yield 3,5-dibromoiodobenzene. In this step, the Sandmeyer reaction converts the primary amino group (NH2) to a diazonium leaving group (N2), which is subsequently replaced by iodine. Iodine serves as an excellent coupling partner for the attachment of the stomach, which is executed through Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene to yield 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene. Attachment of the legs replaces the Br substituents with 1-pentyne through another Sonogashira coupling to produce 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl) benzene. To complete the {{synthesis of}} the lower body, the TMS protecting group is removed by selective deprotection through the addition of K2CO3, MeOH, and CH2Cl2 to yield 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene.|$|E

500|$|Chlorination {{of metals}} with Cl2 usually {{leads to a}} higher {{oxidation}} state than <b>bromination</b> with Br2 when multiple oxidation states are available, such as in MoCl5 and MoBr3.

For instance, zirconium dioxide reacts with chlorine at standard conditions to produce zirconium tetrachloride, and uranium trioxide reacts with hexachloropropene when heated under reflux to give uranium tetrachloride. The second example also involves a reduction in oxidation state, which can also be achieved by reducing a higher chloride using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent.

500|$|Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated {{version of}} daunorubicin, the {{immediate}} precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. Daunorubicin is more abundantly found {{as a natural}} product because it is produced {{by a number of}} different wild type strains of Streptomyces. In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, Streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of Streptomyces can produce doxorubicin. His group has also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. [...] In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into DXR. By 1999, they produced recombinant dox A, a cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to daunorubicin. This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin-producing strains have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over-expressed dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest, because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225kg per annum. More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the nonliposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from daunorubicin, the process involves electrophilic <b>bromination</b> and multiple steps, and the yield is poor. Since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively.|$|E
