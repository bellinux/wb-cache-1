50|$|The FM Towns {{featured}} video modes {{ranging from}} 320×200 to 720×512 resolutions, with 16 to 32,768 simultaneous colours {{out of a}} possible 4096 to 16.777 million (depending on the video mode); most of these video modes had two memory pages, and it allowed the use of up to 1024 sprites of 16×16 pixels each. It also had a <b>built-in</b> <b>font</b> ROM for the display of kanji characters.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{problem in}} {{existing}} tools {{for the creation}} of user interfaces was the inflexible output. Most of the programs were still using <b>built-in</b> <b>fonts</b> and window sizes, thus making the use of new high resolution graphics hardware adapters nearly unbearable. Even the preference programs on the Workbench were still only using the default fixed-width font.|$|R
50|$|In September 1994 HP {{introduced}} the Color LaserJet, the corporation's first color laser printer. The printer {{had an average}} cost per page of less than 10 cents. The Color LaserJet offered 2 ppm color printing and 10 ppm for black text, 8MB of memory, 45 <b>built-in</b> <b>fonts,</b> a 1,250-sheet paper tray and enhanced PCL 5 with color. It was priced at $7,295.|$|R
5000|$|Hiragino (...) is a {{typeface}} family {{designed by}} JIYUKOBO Ltd. and is sold by Dainippon Screen Mfg. to professionals since 1993. It {{is one of}} the <b>built-in</b> <b>fonts</b> in Mac OS X and iOS. This series includes not only Japanese Mincho (serif), Kaku Gothic (sans-serif), Maru Gothic (round sans-serif), semi-cursive script and kana typefaces, but also a sans-serif typeface for Simplified Chinese.|$|R
50|$|This {{changed to}} some degree with the {{increasing}} popularity of dot matrix printers. The characters on these systems were drawn {{as a series of}} dots, as defined by a font table inside the printer. As they grew in sophistication, dot matrix printers started including several <b>built-in</b> <b>fonts</b> from which the user could select, and some models allowed users to upload their own custom glyphs into the printer.|$|R
50|$|Intellivision {{was also}} the first console to have a {{complete}} <b>built-in</b> character <b>font.</b> While Odyssey² had a limited character font (uppercase alphabet, numerals, and some other characters), Intellivision's system font had complete upper- and lowercase alphabets, numerals, and almost all of the punctuation and symbols found on standard computer keyboards.|$|R
50|$|Early 1980s impact {{printers}} used {{a simple}} form of internal raster image processing, using low-resolution <b>built-in</b> bitmap <b>fonts</b> to render raw character data sent from the computer, and only capable of storing enough dot matrix data for one printed line {{at a time}}. External raster image processing was possible such as to print a graphical image, but was commonly extremely slow and data was sent one line {{at a time to}} the impact printer.|$|R
5000|$|Glyphs [...] "•", [...] "◦" [...] {{and their}} {{reversed}} variants [...] "◘", [...] "◙" [...] became available in text mode since early IBM PCs with MDA-CGA-EGA graphic adapters, because <b>built-in</b> screen <b>fonts</b> contained such forms at code points 7-10. These were not true characters because such points {{belong to the}} C0 control codes range; therefore, these glyphs required a special way {{to be placed on}} the screen (see code page 437 for discussion).|$|R

It does not need any installation or access as administrator and suitable to carry in portable media (like USB drives). It has a <b>built-in</b> 'automatic virtual <b>font</b> installer'.The size of portable edition {{is lower than the}} standard edition. The portable edition is also free for any personal or commercial use.|$|R
25|$|Within text strings, {{characters}} are shown using character codes (integers) that map to glyphs {{in the current}} font using an encoding. There {{are a number of}} predefined encodings, including WinAnsi, MacRoman, and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the Windows and Macintosh operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the <b>font's</b> <b>built-in</b> encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts). The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.|$|R
