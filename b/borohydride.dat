BET and statistical thickness methods were used to characterize the support surface properties, and SEM micrographs gave {{a better understanding of the}} preparation techniques. It has been observed by TPD volumetric measurements that the confinement of the reactive <b>borohydrides</b> on the nanoporous supports leads to a lower dehydrogenation temperature compared to unsupported <b>borohydrides.</b> Moreover, a further decrease of the dehydrogenation temperature has been observed by increasing the specific surface area of the support and the pores volume and by using the prepared mixtures instead of pure materials. The dehydrogenation process seems to be favoured by the heterogeneous nucleation on the graphite surface of decomposition products or intermediate phases from melted liquid <b>borohydrides...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{reactivity}} of NaBH4 {{can be enhanced}} or augmented {{by a variety of}} compounds. Oxidation with iodine in tetrahydrofuran gives the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex, which can reduce carboxylic acids. Likewise, the NaBH4-MeOH system, formed by the addition of methanol to sodium <b>borohydride</b> in refluxing THF, reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols. Mixing water or an alcohol with the <b>borohydride</b> converts some of it into unstable hydride ester, which is more efficient at reduction, but the reductant will eventually decompose spontaneously to give hydrogen gas and borates. The same reaction can run also intramolecularly: an α-ketoester converts into a diol, since the alcohol produced will attack the <b>borohydride</b> to produce an ester of the <b>borohydride,</b> which then reduces the neighboring ester. The combination of NaBH4 with carboxylic acids results in the formation of acyloxyborohydride species. These can perform a variety of reductions not normally associated with <b>borohydride</b> chemistry, such as alcohols to hydrocarbons and nitriles to primary amines.|$|E

In situ and ex situ NMR results for LC mixed with mesoporous scaffolds indicate that LiBH_ 4 and Ca(BH_ 4) _ 2 exist as an amorphous mixture inside of the pores after infiltration. Surprisingly, the confinement of the eutectic LC mixture within the mesopores is initiated below the melting temperature, which indicates a certain interaction between the <b>borohydrides</b> and the mesoporous scaffolds. The confined <b>borohydrides</b> remain inside of the pores after cooling.

The crystal and vibrational structures of these borohydrides/composites were characterized using lab-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, with {{particular attention to}} the frequency/width changes of Raman vibrations of different polymorphs of <b>borohydrides.</b> The thermal stability and decomposition pathway of the <b>borohydrides</b> was studied mainly using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, XRD and Raman measurements, whilst the gaseous products during heating were monitored using a mass spectrometry. Hydrogen is the main decomposition gaseous product from all of these compounds, but in some cases a very small amount of diborane release was also detected. These studies suggest that the thermal decomposition of the metal <b>borohydrides</b> occurs via a wide range of reaction pathways, often in several steps, which may involve simultaneous competing reactions. This can include the formation of stable borane intermediates/by-products which largely preclude the possibility of reversibility. Furthermore, the role of diborane in the decomposition and formation of <b>borohydrides,</b> was later studied by heating metal <b>borohydrides</b> (or hydrides) to various temperatures in a gaseous diborane-hydrogen atmosphere; and different types of borane products were observed. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to develop {{reversible}} metal <b>borohydrides</b> with high hydrogen storage capacities and low dehydriding temperature, doping LiBH 4 with various metal halides and hydrides has been conducted. Several metal halides such as TiCl 3, TiF 3, and ZnF 2 effectively reduced the dehydriding temperature through a cation exchange interaction. Some of the halide doped LiBH 4 are partially reversible. The LiBH 4 + 0. 1 TiF 3 desorbed 3. 5 wt % and 8. 5 wt % hydrogen at 150 and 450 °C, respectively, with subsequent reabsorption of 6 wt % hydrogen at 500 °C and 70 bar observed. XRD and NMR analysis of the rehydrided samples confirmed the reformation of LiBH 4. The existence of the (B 12 H 12) − 2 species in dehydrided and rehydrided samples gives insight into the resultant partial reversibility. A number of other halides, MgF 2, MgCl 2, CaCl 2, SrCl 2, and FeCl 3, did not reduce the dehydriding temperature of LiBH 4 significantly. XRD and TGA-RGA analyses indicated that an increasing proportion of halides such as TiCl 3, TiF 3, and ZnCl 2 from 0. 1 to 0. 5 mol makes lithium <b>borohydrides</b> less stable and volatile. Although the less stable <b>borohydrides</b> such as LiBH 4 + 0. 5 TiCl 3, LiBH 4 + 0. 5 TiF 3, and LiBH 4 + 0. 5 ZnCl 2 release hydrogen at room temperature, they are not reversible due to unrecoverable boron loss caused by diborane emission. In most cases, doping that produced less stable <b>borohydrides</b> also reduced the reversible hydrogen uptake. It was also observed that halide doping changed the melting points and reduced air sensitivity of lithium <b>borohydrides...</b>|$|R

40|$|Structural {{investigations}} on mixed-metal <b>borohydrides</b> {{have been}} the subject of powder diffraction since the discovery that hydrogen-release temperatures can be tailored by using more electronegative metals. The lack of producing suitable samples for single crystal X-ray diffraction has defined powder diffraction as the method of choice which, however, is less sensitive to the structural details of the compounds in question. Here we show how to overcome this limitation by developing a flux-assisted single crystal growth procedure to lower the melting point of mixed-metal compounds that are thermally unstable and usually decompose before melting, or are unstable in the melt. We prove the validity of this principle on a member of the recently reported perovskite-type class of <b>borohydrides</b> and show that the defined approach is easily generalized. Interesting structural details are revealed that stand in contrast to the results obtained from samples produced by mechano-chemistry. The differences in lattice instabilities are discussed and put into context with the discovered epitaxial relationships between rocksalt-type ABH 4 and perovskite-type ACa(BH 4) 3 (A = alkaline metal).
