5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>without</b> him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>without</b> free will, {{he argued that the}} possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault {{on the part of the}} agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>without</b> him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E

40|$|Is children’s development, and children’s {{cognitive}} development in particular, {{affected by the}} marital status of their parents? On the face of it, {{this seems to be}} a simple question to which there is an intuitively simple answer— yes. Yet {{the answer to this question}} is anything but simple. The complexity of this question, the policy context that has helped shape a growing body of related research, and the implications of findings for policy and practice are discussed below. The following discussion is based on my remarks during the plenary session of Connecting Marriage Research to Practice, a conference sponsored by The African American Healthy Marriage Initiative. 1 While we can readily observe that children in married-parent families tend to be significantly <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than children raised by single or cohabiting parents, it is more difficult to discern how much <b>better</b> <b>off</b> children <b>without</b> married parents would be if their parents were to marry. An extensive body of research on this topic suggests that marriage would confer benefits on these children, even those within disadvantaged families. The research further suggests that the conduits for these benefits tend to be attributes commonly associated with marriage, such as improved economics and stronger family processes, more so than the marital choice itself. These findings help us understand why marriage matters and provide valuable insights for policy and practice within the Health...|$|R

We estimate the policy's impact on mortality outcomes of children born prior to 2013 and find that it increased the probability of infant deaths in villages near the regulated 'conflict mineral' deposits by at least 143 per cent.

The identifi cation of consumer health outcomes is a priority so that the effectiveness of provider interventions can be described, explained, and predicted. Three assumptions related to the focus on health outcomes are: (1) the effectiveness of interventions varies among health care professionals, (2) knowledge development of the effective-ness of interventions is the responsibility of health care providers, and (3) when effectiveness is compromised, people may be “ <b>better</b> <b>off</b> ” <b>without</b> providers.

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol marks a {{break-through}} {{in global}} warming mitigation policies as it sets legally binding emissions targets for major emitting regions. However, realisation of the Protocol {{depends on the}} clarification of several issues {{one of which is}} the permissible scope of international emissions trading between signatory countries. Unrestricted trade produces hot air when signatory countries whose Kyoto targets are well above their business as usual emissions trade in larger amounts of "abundant" emission rights. Concerns on hot air motivated proposals for caps on emissions trading by the EU. These caps are strictly refused by the USA and other non-European industrialized countries who want to exploit the full efficiency gains from trade. In this paper we show that there are cooling down strategies which can reconcile both positions. International permit trade provides enough efficiency gains to make all signatory countries <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than <b>without</b> permit trade while mitigating hot air. In other words, part of the efficiency gains from free trade could be used to pay for higher abatement targets of signatory countries which assure the same environmental effectiveness as compared to strictly domestic action or restricted permit trade...|$|R
40|$|It can {{be argued}} that just as there are {{different}} kinds of literacy, there are different kinds of illiteracy.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of out‐migration of people from rural {{households}} in a particular setting in Yunnan Province, China, {{and the distribution of}} resources between these households. Household interviews were conducted and based on the data collected households were categorized, based on income, ownership, and consumption, in order to investigate the relationship between migration and household resources. Additionally, number of adult laborers in the households and size of landholdings were included, in the analysis, as factors that influence the distribution of resources between households. The findings from this thesis to a large degree overlaps the findings of Murphy (2002); labor migration affect the distribution of resources between households, as households with migrants have a clear tendency towards being <b>better</b> <b>off.</b> Households <b>without</b> migrants show the opposite tendency and are more often situated in the lowlevel resource categories. However, this thesis finds that, based on Chayanovian‐theory, number of adult laborers distributed between households is the main source of inequalities {{at the time of this}} single‐moment study. Households with many workers have easier access to participate in migration. Additionally, findings show support of the argument that second‐generation migrants are less loyal towards their households than first‐generation migrants and contribute with less remittance back to the household. However, second‐generation migrant households do not seem to be as dependent on receiving these remittances as first‐generation migrant households. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the efficiency}} and distributional impacts of congestion pricing in Vickrey’s (1969) dynamic bottleneck model of congestion, allowing for continuous distributions of values of time and schedule delay. We find that congestion pricing can leave a majority of travellers <b>better</b> <b>off</b> even <b>without</b> returning the toll revenues to them. We also find that the consumer surplus losses or gains from tolling are not strictly monotonic {{in the value of}} time, because they also depend on the value of schedule delays. The greatest losses are not incurred by drivers with the lowest value of time, but by users with an intermediate value of schedule delays and the lowest value of time for that value of schedule delays. For second-best pricing with an untolled alternative, the pattern of distributional effects is quite similar to that for first-best pricing. In contrast with results from prior static models, users who are indifferent between the two alternative routes are not the ones who gain least from this type of second-best pricing. Our results suggest that, in assessing the distributional impacts of road congestion pricing, it is important to take into account both the distribution of the value of time and of the value of schedule delays, as well as the dynamics of departure time choice. # Financial support from TRANSUMO and ERC (AdG Grant # 246969 OPTION) is gratefull...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make ends meet, many poor urban {{households}} in sub-Saharan Africa fall back on farming activities, either within the city boundaries or {{in the rural areas}} from which they come. The central question raised in this article is whether access to farmland influences a household's food situation. The findings come from a study on urban agriculture in Korogocho, one of two slum areas in Nairobi, Kenya, where a survey was conducted in 1994. The results suggest that access to land does {{have a positive impact on}} the welfare situation of urban households, although not necessarily on the food situation as well. Nonetheless, households with access to a rural plot seem to be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than households <b>without</b> access to any land, at least in terms of the overall food situation as perceived by the respondents themselves. In addition, households with access to a rural plot only also seem to be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than those with access to only an urban plot.

There is little empirical evidence, however, {{of the way that}} migration actually helps households in times of shocks.

In 2008, El Salvador experienced food price inflation of 15 %, and the evaluation of Red Solidaria, El Salvador's conditional cash transfer program, shows that height-for-age (HAZ) Z scores among children under 3  years old declined by 0. 2 standard deviations on average.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a relay node that stochastically receives packets from two opposing flows. Whenever opportunities exist, the relay performs network coding to efficiently transmit packets. However, on one hand, {{because of the}} stochastic nature as well as possible asymmetry between the opposing flows, {{it would not be}} possible to always code packets. On the other hand, waiting for a coding opportunity could result in excessive latency, and one may be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> transmitting packets <b>without</b> coding. Thus, one needs to decide at each transmission opportunity whether to transmit a packet uncoded or wait for a future transmission opportunity. To enable us to optimally make that decision, we consider costs for transmission and delay, and formulate our problem as a Markov decision process. We show that the optimal policy is threshold type under a sufficient condition, and we compute it by modeling the resulting system as a Markov chain. Through numerical analysis, we show the effectiveness of the threshold policy in the relay node network as well as in a line network scenario. Further, we compare the threshold policy against a number of simple heuristic policies and identify situations where these policies can be effective.
