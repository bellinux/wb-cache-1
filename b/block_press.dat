40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} tensile {{performance}} of unconfined lap splices in specimens constructed from interlocking compressed earth block (ICEB) units. All lap splice specimens were constructed from hollow ICEB half units with one side grouting channel. ICEB units {{used in this}} research were exclusively produced from the Soeng Thai Model BP 6 <b>block</b> <b>press.</b> The BP 6 <b>block</b> <b>press</b> is currently manufactured in Thailand under the guidance {{and direction of the}} Center of Vocational Building Technologies (CVBT). All ICEB units and grout constructed for this research were created from mix proportions of soil, sand, cement, and water. Rebar bar sizes were restricted to M 10 (# 3) and M 13 (# 4) for all lap splice specimens due to the limited area of the hollow 2 -inch diameter rebar cavity of the ICEB unit. The limited size and strength of the ICEB units also made the use of larger bar diameters impractical. Three ICEB unit types of varying strengths (3. 78 MPa, 7. 81 MPa, and 11. 38 MPa) and three grout types of varying strengths (1. 35 MPa, 7. 47 MPa, and 15. 50 MPa) were developed and used to construct all specimens. The measured ICEB lap splice specimen strengths were compared against the predicted strength calculated from the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC). Findings suggested that the MSJC design equation did not adequately predict the lap splice strength of specimens, particularly for specimens constructed from weaker materials. The measured ICEB lap splice results were used to create a new ICEB lap splice design equation. This paper also investigates the compressive performance of fully grouted ICEB prisms constructed from the range of ICEB unit and grout strengths stated above. Findings suggested that the compressive strength of fully grouted ICEB prisms were exclusively controlled by the compressive strength of the ICEB units used to construct the prism. The strength of the grout had no discernable effect on the strength of the fully grouted prism. A design equation was proposed to calculate prism strengths based on measured strength results of ICEB units...|$|E

Problems faced by farmers in livestock management, especially related {{to the problem of}} feeds. The presence of cattle are expected to increase the income from their farm turned out to be not as expected, due to low productivity. Productivity is low cattle allegedly the result of feeding system that do not meet the nutrient requirements for production. Cows fed only by less of the quantity and quality. Especially in the area of dry land farmingforage availability is highly dependent on the climate cycle, which is the rainy season and dry season. Where the rainy season is usually forage abundance, on the other hand there is trouble in the dry season where was lack of the forage, and usually farmers. using agricultural waste, especially rice straw as the main feed of the cattle.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} diagonal tension (shear) testing to determine factors affecting shear strength of Interlocking Compressed Earth Block (ICEB) panels. This work expands on the current information available about strength properties of ICEB assemblies, which are dry-stacked, as opposed to having mortared beds. Variables such as block strength, grout strength and grouting pattern can influence {{the results of these}} types of tests and are examined in this investigation. To study variables affecting diagonal shear strength, 9 panels were tested, consisting of blocks produced by a manual <b>block</b> <b>press.</b> Strength testing was adopted from common ASTM standards to determine constituent material properties. A modified version of ASTM E 519 test procedure is used to perform diagonal tension testing. Imaging analysis, using a high resolution camera, was run simultaneously during testing to capture displacement histories of select panels. It was determined that both block and grout strength significantly affect the shear strength of ICEB panels. Additionally, vertical grouting and block type also have a strong influence. Imaging analysis results confirm that the dominant failure mode in ICEB panels is bed joint sliding both pre and post peak load, with noticeable displacements at head joint locations on a few panels. Lastly, diagonal cracking along the block face was noticeable on several panels following peak load. Further testing remains to determine other factors affecting shear strength, namely, the application of normal pre-compression loads to the panel...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} soil characteristics, cement content and fibers on the strength and durability of compressed earth blocks (CEBs). This work expands on the available information regarding the constituent properties which affect the compressive and tensile strengths and durability of CEBs. Additionally, little research {{on the subject of}} synthetic fibers and their effect on strength and durability of CEBs is available and this work provides an initial study in this area. To study the effects of fibers, as well as confirm the trends of previous research regarding the effects of clay and cement, 27 unique batches of CEBs were pressed and tested using a Vermeer BP 714 <b>block</b> <b>press.</b> Three different soil types and two fiber types were utilized. The compressive strength, modulus of rupture (MOR), absorption, and durability were measured on over 185 specimens. The strength and absorption tests were adapted from common ASTM International test methods for similar materials, while the durability test was a uniquely developed method to quantify durability by measuring mass loss during drying and wetting cycles. After the testing regimen was completed, a trend between clay content and strength could not be determined. Durability testing suggested that as clay content decreases, durability increases. A linear relationship was found between cement content and strength, which was confirmed during durability testing. The addition of different fibers did not {{have an effect on the}} peak strength of CEBs, although it appears they may decrease the durability. The gross versus net unit strengths of CEBs were examined due to the unique shape of the CEBs utilized. Additionally, a mathematical expression relating the MOR to the compressive strength was developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} obtaining of {{cylinder}} necks by block pressing with the backpressure on an internal surface of preform is presented. The finite element method carries out the calculated analysis of traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure of cylinder necks on tubular preforms in a spherical matrix. Finite shapes of products are defined at traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure. The backpressure usage eliminates fracture of the preform metal at a deforming and heightening of cylinder necks. Force conditions of the preforms forming, the stress-strain state of metal and exact sizes of cylinder necks are calculated. Backpressure operation leads to heightening of intensity of strains and a reinforcement of metal after block pressing. The aforesaid ensures reliability of a screw joint of the <b>block</b> <b>pressed</b> articles with other details. The further explorations of block pressing with a backpressure are necessary to lead in a direction of obtaining of cylinder necks on the hollow articles with a bottom, and also determinations of effect of width of a wall of preform on cylinder necks forming. ?????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ??????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ????????????????. ?????????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????, ??????????-??????????????? ????????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????...|$|R
