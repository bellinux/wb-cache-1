500|$|One {{year after}} the release of their debut, Skunk Anansie {{released}} Stoosh, which was certified gold in several European countries, with a Platinum certification in Italy and also became their second UK album to be certified Platinum, while peaking at number nine on the UK album charts. Stoosh spawned their highest-charting singles, which included [...] "Hedonism (Just <b>Because</b> <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> Good)", which reached the top 20 in several European countries. [...] "Brazen (Weep)" [...] from the same album became their highest-charting UK single, peaking at number 11. European sales for the album stand at two million. Skunk Anansie released Post Orgasmic Chill on Virgin in 1999. The album was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for selling more than 1million units in Europe and the UK. The album was multi-platinum in both Italy and Portugal.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that [...] "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> {{a greater sense of}} responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, {{after eight}} years working in films, when her Warner Bros. {{contract}} expired, Farrell left the studio {{and returned to the}} theater. [...] "There's something more satisfying about working in a play. You get that immediate response from the audience, and you feel that your performance is your own. In pictures, you get frustrated <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you have no power over what you’re doing", Farrell told syndicated columnist Bob Thomas in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E
2500|$|Lee Norris portrays Marvin [...] "Mouth" [...] McFadden, one of Lucas's oldest friends (they {{were both}} {{members of a}} group of {{children}} who played together at the Rivercourt, an outdoor basketball court in Tree Hill). Schwahn spoke of seeing himself in Mouth. Norris said that, during the spring break in his junior year at school, when the pilot for One Tree Hill came up, he drove alone to the casting director and Mark Schwahn. [...] " [...] was easy for me to play because I was this big college basketball fan, and I even wore my college team t-shirt to the audition," [...] said Norris, adding that [...] "at the end of the day, I think Mouth always remains a good guy in his heart and it's absolutely good to play that, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good when you have a character like that on TV. Even if he doesn't always do the right thing, you know it's coming from a good place." [...] Mouth is unlucky in love.|$|E

2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Clive Barker, as {{the writing}} of the Hellraiser script took place {{during the height of the}} A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Halloween film series, his {{intended}} portrayal of Pinhead as an articulate and intelligent character was initially not well received by the producers: some suggested that Pinhead should act more like Freddy Krueger and crack jokes, while others suggested that he be a silent character like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers. Barker insisted that Pinhead's personality be more evocative of Christopher Lee's portrayal of Count Dracula: [...] "Part of the chill of Dracula surely lies in the fact that he is very clearly and articulately aware of what he is doing - <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that this is a penetrating intelligence - and I don’t find dumb things terribly scary - I find intelligence scary, particularly twisted intelligence; it’s one of the reasons why Hannibal Lecter is scary, isn’t it?
