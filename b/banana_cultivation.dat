40|$|ABSTRACT The {{patterns}} of distribution and storage of carbon in managed areas of Atlantic Forest are still poorly understood. In {{order to understand}} the role of these areas in carbon sequestration, it was aimed to characterize the forest structure and estimate the aboveground biomass in harvest areas of juçara fruit (Euterpe edulis Mart.). The study was carried out in altered areas where the management of juçara fruits was introduced at ‘Serra do Mar’ State Park – SP state, Brazil and its surroundings, including the phytophysiognomies Montane and Submontane Atlantic Forest. To represent all the different situations in which management is practiced, eight areas were selected and each one was allocated in a plot of 10 x 100 m divided into subplots of 10 x 10 m, in which all individuals trees were inventoried (trees, juçaras, banana trees and ferns) with DBH (diameter at breast height) > 4. 8 cm. The study areas were characterized as Secondary Forests and as Systems of Banana and Juçara Consortium. The biomass found in the studied plots ranged from 47. 9 to 279. 9 Mg ha - 1. Secondary Forests had higher biomass than Systems of Banana and Juçara Consortium, the trees being responsible for most of this biomass. The management of the fruits of the palm juçara for pulping food represents a sustainable alternative to the illegal extraction of palm heart in the region, diversifying the existing <b>banana</b> <b>cultivations,</b> adding value to forests and increasing carbon storage in areas of Atlantic forest with agroforestry...|$|R

5000|$|While in {{no danger}} of {{outright}} extinction, the most common edible banana cultivar Cavendish (extremely popular in Europe and the Americas) could become unviable for large-scale cultivation in the next 10-20 years. Its predecessor 'Gros Michel', discovered in the 1820s, suffered this fate. Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming. Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what {{much of the world}} considers a [...] "typical banana" [...] are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the <b>banana</b> on monogenetic <b>cultivation</b> driven by short-term commercial motives.|$|R

40|$|There is now good {{evidence}} from current banana distributions and genetic analysis that Papua New Guinea and nearby regions {{have played a}} key role in the domestication of edible Eumusa and Australimusa bananas. Strong support for this also comes from phytoliths in the archaeobotanical record. Seeds have diagnostic phytoliths which can be used to discriminate between the two main sections of edible bananas, the giant banana, Musa ingens, and Ensete. Therefore, the presence of seed phytoliths and their subsequent disappearance from archaeological assemblages can be used to trace processes of domestication leading to parthenocarpy and sterility. Following loss of viable seeds, banana presence can still be documented from phytolith morphotypes from other plant parts, particularly the volcaniform morphotypes from leaves. Nevertheless, according to several pioneer studies, these are more difficult to differentiate unless they occur in regions where certain species or varieties of bananas are not endemic. This paper reviews results from morphometric and morphotypic analyses of Musaceae phytoliths and briefly introduces the ‘New Guinea Banana Project’ which builds upon previous analyses. The morphometric database, combined with a comprehensive set of images, facilitates banana phytolith identification and is another step forward in solving the issues surrounding <b>banana</b> dispersal, <b>cultivation</b> and domestication, especially in the Pacific/New Guinea region...|$|R

40|$|Tropical countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, {{have the}} {{possibility}} of using agricultural lands for growing biomass to produce bio-fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol. This study applies an energy analysis to the production process of anhydrous ethanol obtained from the hydrolysis of starch and cellulosic and hemicellulosic material present in the banana fruit and its residual biomass. Four different production routes were analyzed: acid hydrolysis of amylaceous material (banana pulp and banana fruit) and enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material (flower stalk and banana skin). The analysis considered <b>banana</b> plant <b>cultivation,</b> feedstock transport, hydrolysis, fermentation, distillation, dehydration, residue treatment and utility plant. The best indexes were obtained for amylaceous material for which mass performance varied from 346. 5 L/t to 388. 7 L/t, Net Energy Value (NEV) ranged from 9. 86 MJ/L to 9. 94 MJ/L and the energy ratio was 1. 9 MJ/MJ. For lignocellulosic materials, the figures were less favorable: mass performance varied from 86. 1 to 123. 5 L/t, NEV from 5. 24 10 8. 79 MJ/L and energy ratio from 1. 3 to 1. 6 MJ/MJ. The analysis showed, however, that both processes can be considered energetically feasible. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Panama {{disease of}} banana, {{caused by the}} fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, is a serious {{constraint}} both to the commercial production of <b>banana</b> and <b>cultivation</b> for subsistence agriculture. Previous work has indicated that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense consists of several clonal lineages that may be genetically distant. In this study we tested whether lineages of the Panama disease pathogen have a monophyletic origin by comparing DNA sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. DNA sequences were obtained for translation elongation factor 1 α and the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA genes for F. oxysporum strains from banana, pathogenic strains from other hosts and putatively nonpathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum. Cladograms for the two genes were highly concordant and a partition-homogeneity test indicated the two datasets could be combined. The tree inferred from the combined dataset resolved five lineages corresponding to “F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense” with a large dichotomy between two taxa represented by strains most commonly isolated from bananas with Panama disease. The results also demonstrate that the latter two taxa have significantly different chromosome numbers. F. oxysporum isolates collected as nonpathogenic or pathogenic to other hosts that have very similar or identical elongation factor 1 α and mitochondrial small subunit genotypes as banana pathogens were shown to cause little or no disease on banana. Taken together, these results indicate Panama disease of banana is caused by fungi with independent evolutionary origins...|$|R

60|$|In fact, I {{think there}} can be but {{little doubt that the}} banana is the very oldest product of human tillage. Man, we must remember, is {{essentially}} by origin a tropical animal, and wild tropical fruits must necessarily have formed his earliest food-stuffs. It was among them of course that his first experiments in primitive agriculture would be tried; the little insignificant seeds and berries of cold northern regions would only very slowly be added to his limited stock in husbandry, as circumstances pushed some few outlying colonies northward and ever northward toward the chillier unoccupied regions. Now, of all tropical fruits, the banana is certainly the one that best repays cultivation. It has been calculated that the same area which will produce thirty-three pounds of wheat or ninety-nine pounds of potatoes will produce 4,400 pounds of plantains or <b>bananas.</b> The <b>cultivation</b> of the various varieties in India, China, and the Malay Archipelago dates, says De Candolle, 'from an epoch impossible to realise.' Its diffusion, as that great but very oracular authority remarks, may go back to a period 'contemporary with or even anterior to that of the human races.' What this remarkably illogical sentence may mean I am at a loss to comprehend; perhaps M. de Candolle supposes that the banana was originally cultivated by pre-human gorillas; perhaps he merely intends to say that before men began to separate they sent special messengers on in front of them to diffuse the banana in the different countries they were about to visit. Even legend retains some trace of the extreme antiquity of the species as a cultivated fruit, for Adam and Eve are said to have reclined under the shadow of its branches, whence Linnæus gave to the sort known as the plantain the Latin name of Musa paradisiaca. If a plant was cultivated in Eden by the grand old gardener and his wife, as Lord Tennyson democratically styled them (before his elevation to the peerage), we may fairly conclude that it possesses a very respectable antiquity indeed.|$|R
40|$|Banana {{owing to}} its large size and rapid growth rate require {{relatively}} {{large amount of}} nutrients for higher yield of quality fruits and {{it is estimated that}} 50 tonnes of banana in one hectare removes 320 kg N, 32 kg P 2 O 5 and 925 kg K 2 O every year (Lahav and Turner, 1983). Application of inorganic fertilizers though increases the yield substantially but could not able to sustain the fertility status of the soil (Bharadwaj and Omanwar, 1994) and have caused several undesirable consequences in the fragile soil eco-system, leading to gradual decline in productivity. Considering the present situation of soil quality and environmental security, it is necessary to go for an integrated nutrient management, involving various sources of organic manures, organic cakes and bio-fertilizers besides using chemical fertilizers in <b>banana.</b> In today’s <b>cultivation</b> many commercial organic manures are being used because of their application in lesser volume and also enriched with nutrients. One such commercial organic manure used in the study is Wellgro. Wellgro organic manure is a unique product with a blend of neem and non-timber forest produce and a rich source of nutrients. Hence, this study was under taken to find out the influence of ecofriendly nutrient management practices on yield and quality parameters of banana under irrigated conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), {{belonging}} to the genus Babuvirus, is the most devastating and widespread banana virus. Banana and plantain are major crops in terms of household income and food security in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Despite the large area under <b>banana</b> and plantain <b>cultivation</b> in the country, before this study, the genetic characterization of BBTV isolates had only been undertaken for two provinces. In the study presented here, genetic variation in BBTV was assessed from 52 BBTV isolates collected in five out of 11 provinces in DRC (Bandundu, Bas-Congo, Katanga, Kinshasa and Kasaï Oriental) and in two provinces using sequences previously described in databases. Full genome sequencing of DNA-R components was performed, revealing low genetic variation (98 – 100 % nucleotide identity) among the BBTV isolates detected. The phylogenetic analyses showed that all the DRC isolates were clustered in the South Pacific clade of BBTV. Based on the coding region for the replication initiator protein, haplotype diversity {{was estimated to be}} 0. 944 ± 0. 013, with 30 haplotypes from 68 isolates in DRC. Such diversity shows a haplotype distribution mainly at the sub-regional level in DRC. In addition, the sequence determination from the whole genome of selected isolates confirmed low genetic variation among isolates from seven DRC provinces (97 – 100 % nucleotide identity). This study strengthened the hypothesis of a single BBTV introduction some time ago, followed by the spread of the virus in the country. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
