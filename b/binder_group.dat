40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} non-elastic/elastic abdominal binders on intra-vesical pressure (IVP), physiological functions, and clinical outcomes in laparotomy patients at the perioperative stage. Methods: This prospective study was conducted from May to October 2014 at the Trauma Surgery Department, Daping Hospital, Chongqing, China. Laparotomy patients were randomly divided into non-elastic abdominal <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> (28 patients), and elastic abdominal <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> (29 patients). Binders were applied for 14 days following the operation, or until discharge. Demographic information, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores (prior to the operation, {{on the first day}} after operation, the day IVP measurement was stopped, and one day before discharge), and outcomes were recorded. The IVP was measured before the operation to postoperative day 7. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} the demographic information, outcomes, SOFA or APACHE-II scores between the 2 groups. Initial out-of-bed mobilization occurred earlier in the elastic <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> (3. 2 ± 2. 0 versus 5. 0 ± 3. 7 days, p= 0. 028).

40|$|In this thesis, we are {{concerned}} with the transmission of data over channels with intersymbol interference. We consider input signals which are multiplexed versions of several parallel input signals, with the aim of splitting the input signal spectrum into disparate frequency bands and shaping the input spectrum by adjusting the power on each of the frequency bands. We introduce a multirate signal processing framework for the representation of the channel under these conditions and derive simple equivalents for the channel and the associated processors. Using the equivalent circuits, we derive simple equalization schemes for the channel by drawing from the theory of polynomial matrices. We show that vector equalization can be reduced to a combination of prefiltering, postfiltering and scalar equalization of a few of the parallel input signals. We also discuss several interesting properties of this decomposition. In the case when the channel is corrupted by colored noise, we derive expressions for the optimum prefilters and postfilters with decision feedback equalization that minimize the mean-squared error between the input and the output, given a constraint on the input power. For uncorrelated inputs, the scheme leads to a set of parallel independent scalar channels with the optimum postfilter whitening the noise, which permits the optimal use of trellis codes for data transmission. We apply the scheme to a special channel, viz., the ISDN digital subscriber loop. The main impairments on this channel are intersymbol interference and crosstalk due to adjacent loops in the same <b>binder</b> <b>group.</b> Crosstalk is an especially interesting case of noise since it depends on the signal being transmitted; we assume that all loops in a <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> transmit using the same scheme. We consider two cases of crosstalk noise: when transmission between different loops in a <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> is synchronized, the crosstalk noise is wide-sense cyclostationary, and with a lack of synchronization between loops, the crosstalk noise is wide-sense stationary. We present methods to determine the optimum filters for data transmission and the optimum input power distributions for both these cases. We demonstrate the possibility of data transmission at the T 1 rate, i. e., 1. 544 Mb/s over most loops in the local loop plant. We also find that synchronizing transmission between different loops in a <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> does not get us much; the difference in the throughputs for the cases of cyclostationary crosstalk and wide-sense stationary crosstalk does not seem to justify the effort involved in synchronization...|$|E

30|$|Crosstalk is a {{major problem}} in modern DSL systems such as VDSL. Many {{crosstalk}} cancellation techniques have been proposed to help mitigate crosstalk, but whilst they lead to impressive performance gains, their complexity grows with the square of the number of lines within a <b>binder.</b> In <b>binder</b> <b>groups</b> which can carry up to hundreds of lines, this complexity is outside the scope of current implementation. In this paper, we investigate partial crosstalk cancellation for upstream VDSL. The majority of the detrimental effects of crosstalk are typically limited to a small subset of lines and tones. Furthermore, significant crosstalk is often only seen from neighbouring pairs within the binder configuration. We present a number of algorithms which exploit these properties to reduce the complexity of crosstalk cancellation. These algorithms are shown to achieve the majority of the performance gains of full crosstalk cancellation with significantly reduced run-time complexity.|$|R

We have investigated the synthesis and kinase inhibition of new heteroaryl-substituted diazaspirocyclic compounds that mimic ATP. Versatile syntheses of substituted diazaspirocycles through ring-closing metathesis were demonstrated. Diazaspirocycles directly linked to heteroaromatic hinge binder groups provided ligand efficient inhibitors of multiple kinases, suitable as starting points for further optimization. The binding modes of representative diazaspirocyclic motifs were confirmed by protein crystallography. Selectivity profiles were influenced by the hinge <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> and the interactions of basic nitrogen atoms in the scaffold with acidic side-chains of residues in the ATP pocket.

Methods: The present prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled patients undergoing non-emergency cesarean deliveries in Gonbad-e Kavus, Golestan Province, Iran, between January 22 and October 23, 2015. Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio by blocks of four or six to a control group or to use an abdominal binder after delivery; all patients received routine care. The primary outcomes were visual analog scale-assessed pain, symptom distress scale (SDS) -assessed distress, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Participants and researchers were masked to treatment assignments until after cesarean delivery, and data analysis was unmasked; intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Results: There were 89 patients enrolled in each group, with no differences in baseline pain scores, SDS scores, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels between the groups (all P> 0. 05). Pain and SDS scores were lower in the <b>binder</b> <b>group</b> at all post-baseline time points compared with the control group (all P< 0. 001).

40|$|The antineoplastic {{properties}} of α,β-unsaturated ketones, such as curcumin and related analogs, {{have been investigated}} {{for a number of}} years. Due to the high light sensitivity and the low bioavailability of curcumin and its analogs, there was a need to modify its structural features for clinical usage as a chemotherapeutic candidate. The emphasis on synthetic curcumin analogs which have the 1, 5 -diaryl- 3 -oxo- 1, 4 -pentadienyl pharmacophore (Figure 2 - 1, page 32) and its importance for eliciting antineoplastic activity was made from this laboratory. It was proven that one way these agents exert their activity is through a thiol-alkylating mechanism. In order to increase the cytotoxic activity of these candidate agents, three target compounds containing the 1, 5 -diaryl- 3 -oxo- 1, 4 -pentadienyl pharmacophore were designed by incorporating potential auxiliary <b>binder</b> <b>groups</b> (Figure 2 - 2, page 33). The auxiliary binders may display antineoplastic properties, or they may act only to enhance the bonding at the binding site. The synthesis of the auxiliary binders and the target compounds containing different physicochemical properties was proposed in order to investigate the structural features responsible for enhancing the biological activity. Both auxiliary binders 1 and the target compounds 2 were synthesized successfully mainly through a series of condensation reactions (Schemes 4 - 1 and 4 - 2, pages 61 - 63). Following the synthesis, the biological evaluation was performed including multiple cytotoxicity assays 59 - 61 as well as a multidrug resistance (MDR) -revertant assay 62. The compounds were analyzed via 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and CHN elemental analyses. The biological screening of 1 a, 1 f, and 1 g using four cell lines L 1210, Molt 4 /C 8, CEM, and HeLa cells revealed that they lack cytotoxic activity (IC 50 > 100 μM, Table 4 - 1, page 65), and they might play a role in enhancing the alignment of the target compounds to the receptor. However, other auxiliary binders also displayed very low cytotoxicity (IC 50 > 100 μM) except for 1 h (IC 50 = 61 μM). The target compounds 2 c (13. 3 μM) and 2 d (15. 3 μM) were more potent than 2 b (25. 5 μM) in this assay. 59 These data are presented in Tables 4 - 1 and 4 - 2, pages 65 and 66. The target compounds also displayed anti-metastasis activity towards various non-adherent cancer cells 60 indicated on page 81. Generally, the target compounds 2 b-d have selectively inhibited tumor growth in the micromolar and sub-micromolar range, and the highest potency was displayed by 2 b which inhibited > 50 % of non-adherent tumor cells at 1 μM. Two auxiliary binders inhibited more than 10 % of the tumor cells at 5 μM namely, 1 g (20 %, Jurkat) and 1 j (32. 3 %, DU 145) respectively. These data are presented in Tables 4 - 4 and 4 - 5, pages 69 and 70. The selective cytotoxicity of the target compounds 2 b-d as well as the auxiliary binders 1 were also examined. 61 Some of the auxiliary binders displayed cytotoxic effects at CC 50 30. 44) to cancer cells compared to 2 b and 2 c. Moreover the target compounds 2 b-d have MDR-revertant properties at low and high micromolar concentrations in which the established FAR values were > 1. Compound 2 b reversed the MDR at 50 μM (FAR = 118. 15 at 50 μM) more that standard drug verapamil (FAR = 15. 68). For future directions, selected auxiliary binders will be incorporated to the 1, 5 -diaryl- 3 -oxo- 1, 4 -pentadienyl pharmacophore, and the mechanism of auxiliary binding should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Between 1970 and 1990, a surging Hispanic {{population}} succeeded whites across New York City, {{resulting in}} major increases in both all-minority and multiethnic neighborhoods. Puerto Rican and Dominican flows resulted in transitions to all-minority neighborhoods, whereas South Americans showed a more integrated pattern of settlement. The unique settlement patterns of Hispanic subgroups {{need to be}} understood {{in the context of}} larger political, social, and economic forces operating in the city. In the post- 1990 period, newer Hispanic groups have begun to suc-ceed Puerto Ricans. Thus, earlier patterns of white to Hispanic transitions now have been supple-mented by ethnic succession among Hispanics. The ebb and flow of migrants, both domestic and international, have for centuries shaped and reshaped the character of New York City. From its earli-est days when the Dutch and English struggled for political and economic control, through the nineteenth century when new groups such as Germans and the Irish settled in great numbers, and up through the early twentieth cen-tury with the arrival of southern and eastern Europeans, the city has always been an ever-evolving mix of ethnic <b>groups</b> (<b>Binder</b> and Reimers 1995) ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{moisture}} {{damage in}} plastomeric polymer modified asphalt binder is investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) with chemically functionalized AFM tips. Four different percentages of plastomeric polymers and two antistripping agents such as Kling Beta and Lime {{are used to}} modify a base asphalt <b>binder.</b> Chemical functional <b>groups</b> such as -COOH, -CH 3, -NH 3, and –OH, that are commonly present in plastomeric polymer modified asphalt system, are used to functionalize the AFM tips. The force distance mode of AFM is {{used to measure the}} adhesion forces between a modified asphalt sample surface and the functionalized AFM tips. This enables the measurement of adhesion within an asphalt binder system. It is shown that the adhesion force values in dry sample changed substantially from that in wet conditioned samples. It is evident from this study that plastomeric modification does not help reduce moisture damage in asphalt. The percentage change in adhesion forces due to moisture is about 20 nN for the lime modified samples, and about 50 nN for the Kling Beta modified samples. This indicates that lime is more effective than Kling Beta for reducing moisture damage in plastomeric polymer modified asphalt...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Phosphate binders' {{constituents}} have alkalotic or acidotic {{properties and}} {{may contribute to}} acid base balance in haemodialysis patients. This study aimed to investigate the differential effects of phosphate binders on pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate in End Stage Kidney Disease patients on maintenance haemodialysis. METHODS: Stable out-patients having satellite haemodialysis for at least 3 months were retrospectively studied for 18 months, excluding those with other medical causes for metabolic acidosis. Blood results were censored for inpatient episodes, {{at the time of}} death, renal transplant or dialysis modality change. Multivariable multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used and five <b>groups</b> of phosphate <b>binders</b> were compared: <b>Group</b> A(Calcium (Ca) and/or Aluminium (Al) binders); B(Sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) alone); C(lanthanum carbonate (LC) alone); D(SH and Ca/Al), E(LC and Ca/Al). RESULTS: Of 320 patients, 292 were eligible for analysis with a mean follow-up of 15. 54 (standard deviation, SD 3. 98) months. Similar mean pre-dialysis serum levels of bicarbonate were observed at all 6 month-interval analyses. At 18 (th) months, observed mean serum bicarbonate levels in mmol/L were Group B: 21. 58 (SD 2. 82, P 4. 8 g/day compared with 22. 85 (SD 2. 91) for non-users; P-trend< 0. 001. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphate binders' constituents may contribute to/protect against a predisposition to pre-dialysis metabolic acidosis. This may be dose dependant in patients taking Sevelamer Hydrochloride. Open Acces...|$|R
