He appeared in self-parodying roles, in several episodes of The Goodies {{and on the}} Morecambe and Wise show, and broadcast with Kenneth Horne {{only a few days}} before Horne's death. He had a minor role in the fourth radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and a lead role in the Radio 1 sci-fi BBC/20th Century Fox radio play, Independence Day UK in which amongst other things, Moore fills in as a navigator. He appeared in It's a Celebrity Knockout, Blankety <b>Blank</b> <b>and</b> Face the Music. He appeared on television at least once in a film prop space suit.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli {{returned}} to Syria in 1955, following {{the ouster of}} President Adib al-Shishakli and during the presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, {{at the age of}} 63. Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were <b>blank</b> <b>and</b> two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.|$|E
5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, point <b>blank,</b> <b>and</b> the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E
5000|$|The essay {{includes}} {{an example of}} a man trying to guess the ratio of [...] "blanks" [...] and [...] "prizes" [...] at a lottery. So far the man has watched the lottery draw ten <b>blanks</b> <b>and</b> one prize. Given these data, Bayes showed in detail how to compute the probability that the ratio of blanks to prizes is between 9:1 and 11:1 (the probability is low - about 7.7%). He went on to describe that computation after the man has watched the lottery draw twenty <b>blanks</b> <b>and</b> two prizes, forty <b>blanks</b> <b>and</b> four prizes, and so on. Finally, having drawn 10,000 <b>blanks</b> <b>and</b> 1,000 prizes, the probability reaches about 97%.|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear preprocessors, {{including}} clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping {{have been}} proposed to be employed in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems for mitigating the impulsive noise in power-line communications. In this paper, we propose using a new variant of nonlinear preprocessor, namely, deep clipping, to mitigate the impulsive noise. In contrast to clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping, where one or two thresholds is used to detect if the impulsive noise occurs, and if the impulsive noise occurs how to handle it, deep clipping is characterized by two alternative parameters, namely, a threshold and a depth factor. By optimizing the two parameters, we find that deep clipping achieves better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance than clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping. In addition, we present a mathematical expression for deep clipping and show that the SNR expressions regarding conventional clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping can be easily obtained by using our analytical methods...|$|R
5|$|The President {{is elected}} {{on the basis}} of {{universal}} suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of all votes cast (including <b>blank</b> <b>and</b> spoilt ballots), a runoff election is held. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit of a maximum of two terms in office. The president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the judges of the Constitutional Court. Franjo Tuđman won the first Croatian presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. During his time in office, the constitution adopted in 1990 provided for a semi-presidential system, which was in the coming years further strengthened by laws specifically aimed at providing Tuđman with sweeping powers (e.g. naming and dismissing numerous government officials, confirming county prefects), as his HDZ party held a supermajority in parliament through out the 1990s. After his death in 1999, the constitution was amended and many presidential powers were transferred to parliament, the prime minister and the government. Stjepan Mesić won two consecutive terms, in 2000 and in 2005 and served as president until 2010. Ivo Josipović won the presidential elections held in 2009–2010 and left office in 2015 after losing his reelection bid for a second term. The winner of the most recent presidential elections, held in December 2014 and January 2015, was Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. She succeeded Josipović on 19 February 2015 for a term lasting until 18 February 2020.|$|E

25|$|Filipescu {{was again}} in Bucharest during the {{resumption}} {{of war and the}} period leading up to Germany's surrender. His father had founded Epoca newspaper in 1885, and in September 1918, the son decided to revive the moribund outfit, buying the trademark from its nominal owner, Timoleon Pisani. Filipescu and Constantin Argetoianu identified two financiers, Aristide <b>Blank</b> <b>and</b> Jean Chrissoveloni. In exchange for backing from the latter two, the newspaper owners joined the administration of Marmorosch Blank Bank, alongside Duca, Toma Stelian, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. Blank's involvement would fuel the suspicions of antisemitic groups that the newspaper was a tool of the Jews. While Blank's influence was exaggerated, he did have a say in the editorial policy. For instance, when an article critical of Liviu Rebreanu was slated to appear, the financier convinced Filipescu not to run the story. Instead, in 1919 Epoca published a dossier on Marghiloman's wartime stances.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{discovering}} Apokoliptian {{technology in}} the bunker, Brother Eye opens a Boom Tube and takes its captives to Apokolips, leaving Professor <b>Blank</b> <b>and</b> his grandson behind. After arriving on Apokolips, Darkseid's Parademons engage the OMACs, who begin to assimilate them. Val and Una wander around Apokolips seeking a means to escape as Val fears Brother Eye desires the virus he carries. However, before they can formulate a plan, Una becomes an OMAC. However, Val is mysteriously able to resist assimilation by Brother Eye who decides to kill him instead. Jason Todd saves him and suggesting killing Una as assimilation is apparently irreversible. Val protests this idea and Todd leaves. Brother Eye tries a second assimilation attempt and fails. Instead, it decides to take Val away and perform an autopsy. Brother Eye then removes the Morticoccus virus from Val, who is then saved by Ray Palmer. Apokolips' destruction and Brother Eye's escape frees Una from her transformation into an OMAC. When Solomon sends the Challengers to a recreated Earth-51, Val dies and releases the Morticoccus virus, which infects the entire world. Meanwhile, the Brother Eye of Earth-51 transforms Professor Blank into a modified OMAC with limited free will, enabling him and his grandson Tommy to escape the ruins of Command-D, effectively birthing {{a new version of}} Earth A.D. from the original Kamandi series.|$|E
