5|$|The meatpacking {{district}} was served between 1908 and 1957 <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> Chicago 'L' line with several stops, devoted {{primarily to the}} daily transport of thousands of workers and even tourists to the site. The line was constructed when the City of Chicago forced the removal of surface trackage on 40th Street.|$|E
5|$|The square, massive Norman tower has three-arched belfry {{windows on}} each face, surmounted by corner turrets, and a conically-shaped tower of {{octagonal}} proportions, topped again <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> steeple. The tower was a main viewing {{point for the}} Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) which linked the Paris Observatory with the Royal Greenwich Observatory using trigonometry. Cross-channel sightings were made of signal lights at Dover Castle and Fairlight, East Sussex.|$|E

5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Boston College {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 35-yard line, and Boston College's offense began the first possession of the second half. An incomplete pass by Davis was followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> rush and another incomplete pass, and the Eagles were forced to punt after going three and out. The kick went out of bounds at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and the Hokies' offense had their first possession of the second half. Tech likewise went three and out, then returned {{the ball to the}} Eagles with a punt. The kick went out of bounds, and following the exchange, Boston College's offense started from its 31-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{is located}} in Central and Southeast Europe, {{bordering}} Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the southeast, Montenegro to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected {{to the rest of}} the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.|$|E

5|$|Croatia's {{territory}} covers , {{making it}} the 127th largest country in the world. The physical geography of Croatia is defined by its location—it {{is described as a}} part of Central Europe and Southeast Europe, a part of the Balkans and Mitteleuropa. Croatia borders Bosnia–Herzegovina (for 1,009.1km) and Serbia (for 317.6km) in the east, Slovenia for 667.8km in the west, Hungary for 355.5km in the north and Montenegro for 22.6km and the Adriatic Sea in the south. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the extreme south of Croatia is separated {{from the rest of the}} mainland <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> coastline strip around Neum belonging to Bosnia–Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can be accompanied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, {{was considered to be}} a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The {{upper body}} was covered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> jacket that {{was filled with}} rock salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.|$|E

5|$|Fantastic Light {{began his}} three-year-old season {{with his first}} Group race win in the Sandown Classic Trial. Ridden by Daryll Holland, he took the lead a furlong out and was eased in the closing stages to win <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> head. Speculation that he might develop into a Derby {{contender}} ended in his next race, when he was stepped up to {{one and a half}} miles {{for the first time and}} finished fourth of the five runners in the Lingfield Derby Trial.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|Monsters University premiered on June 5, 2013 at the BFI Southbank in London, England, and was {{released}} on June 21, 2013, in the United States. It was accompanied in theaters <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> film, The Blue Umbrella, directed by Saschka Unseld. The film grossed $744 million against its estimated budget of $200 million. An animated short film titled Party Central, which takes place shortly after the events of Monsters University, premiered in Fall 2013.|$|E

5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> surface interval, {{during which the}} diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then {{be taken into account}} when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can increase the risk of decompression sickness because of the buildup of asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which was followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> run. On third down, Vick prepared {{to throw the}} ball, but {{he was hit by}} Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled. Following the turnover, Dantzler was stopped on a short run then threw two incomplete passes. Rather than again attempt to convert a fourth down, Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28-yard field goal. The kick soared through the uprights, and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 5:45 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
