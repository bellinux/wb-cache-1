The {{fraction}} of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage.</b> If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100 percent {{and there are}} no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.|$|E

The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} correlation between spatial variability of the soil attributes and sugarcane yield as a result of soil topography. To achieve this objective, a test area of 42 ha located at the Sao Joao Sugar Mill, in Araras, in the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, was selected. Sugarcane yield was measured with a yield monitor fitted in a sugarcane harvester and GPS signal. A total of 170 soil samples were taken at regular 50 m grid, at a depth of 0 - 0. 2 m. The area under study was divided into two sites based on topography. The following soil attributes were analysed: organic matter (OM) content, exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), their <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> (%BS), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, clay, silt, total sand and density.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} management of soils with low natural fertility on family {{farms in the}} humid tropics is a great challenge and overcoming {{it would be an}} enormous benefit for the environment and the farmers. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the environmental and agronomic benefits of alley cropping, based on the evaluation of C sequestration, soil quality indicators, and corn yields. Combinations of four legumes were used in alley cropping systems in the following treatments: Clitoria fairchildiana + Cajanus cajan; Acacia mangium + Cajanus cajan; Leucaena leucocephala + Cajanus cajan; Clitoria fairchildiana + Leucaena leucocephala; Leucaena leucocephala + Acacia mangium and a control. Corn was used as a cash crop. The C content was determined in the different compartments of soil organic matter, CEC, available P, <b>base</b> <b>saturation,</b> <b>percentage</b> of water saturation, the period of the root hospitality factor below the critical level and corn yield. It was concluded that alley cropping could substitute the slash and burn system in the humid tropics. The main environmental benefit of alley cropping is the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between C input and output that could sustain up to 10 Mg ha- 1 of C in the litter layer, decreasing atmospheric CO 2 levels. Alley cropping is also beneficial from the agricultural point of view, because it increases base saturation and decreases physical resistance to root penetration in the soil layer 0 - 10 cm, which ensures the increase and sustainability of corn yield...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{physical}} and chemical properties of the surface layers of soil of a slash-and-burn swidden (garden) in a tropical and ever-humid climate region in northwest Malaita Island, Solomon Islands, were investigated. Soil samples were obtained from the same site nearly spanning the entire swidden cycle and from an almost adjacent long fallow forest. The fallow period in the swidden cycle was slightly more than ten years. The soil there was found to be acidic. The changes in physical properties suggest that slight soil compaction of the surface layers occurred during the fallow, and that the soil became softer, and more permeable with increasing fallow length. The changes in the content of organic carbon seem to parallel this change. Both organic carbon and total nitrogen in the topsoil had the lowest value {{in the middle of the}} fallow period. The surface layers accumulated much organic matter during the long fallow period. The levels of available phosphorus, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium, <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> and pH of the topsoil were lowest during the fallow period. On the other hand, effective cation exchange capacity was high in the middle of the fallow period owing to a high value of exchange acidity. Exchangeable calcium was noticeably abundant in both the topsoil and the 15 20 cm soil layer in the long fallow forest. After burning the plant debris, no rise of pH value measured in de-ionized water was recognized. From the preceding results, it can be concluded that some properties of the topsoil in fallows far less than ten years after garden abandonment are less favorable for swiddening even when the beneficial effects of heating and adding ash are taken into account. Furthermore, the present investigation suggests that the ecological characteristics of swiddening in an ever-humid region are substantially different from those in a region with humid and distinctly dry seasons...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1957 Two soils {{representative}} of the coast and three representing the Willamette Valley have been studied for their general chemical characteristics. Exchange capacity and exchangeable cations were determined by the ammonium acetate and the BaClâ-triethanolamine buffer methods. Exchange capacity was also obtained from conductimetric titrations which were run on each soil before and after destroying the organic matter. Potentiometric titrations were run before and after leaching each soil with HCl. Lime requirement was determined by Woodruff's method and also obtained from the pH-lime curves. The two coastal soils, Astoria and Clatsop, have lower pH and base saturation and higher organic matter content and exchange capacity than the Melbourne, Olympic, and Willamette soils from the valley. The Melbourne soil had the highest <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> and Astoria had the lowest. The amount of exchangeable aluminum was also higher in the coastal soils. The amount of exchange capacity contributed to the organic fraction was 65 per cent in the Olympic and Willamette soils and 50 per cent in the other three. The value for exchange capacity by the different methods was in good agreement in the three valley soils {{before and after the}} organic matter was destroyed. In the coastal soils there was no agreement between methods in any case. This would indicate that in the latter two soils, type of clay mineral present may be more of an influence than in the former soils. The potentiometric titration curves showed that the two coastal soils were well buffered and the valley soils were only slightly buffered. After the soils were leached with HCl the Melbourne soil was the only one which indicated a strong acid property. The exchange properties of the soils as affected by additions of lime were studied by incubating the soils for four weeks with added increments of lime. With each added increment of lime the pH increased and exchangeable acidity decreased in each soil. The amount of lime to bring the soils to any given degree of base saturation appeared to be proportional to the magnitude of the exchange capacity and inversely proportional to the degree of base saturation. At any given pH value there was a considerable difference in the degree of base saturation for these soils. This might well be a reflection of the type of minerals present in the different soils. More lime was required to bring the two coastal soils up to pH 6. 5 as indicated by the pH-lime relationship curve than that estimated by the Woodruff method. Consistent results were observed in the three valley soils. This suggests that the buffer solution at pH 7 as recommended by Woodruff was not strong enough to neutralize the acidity in the coastal soils. There was good agreement between the two methods in the determination of the exchangeable bases. The BaClâ-buffer method gave much higher values of exchangeable acidity than did the ammonium acetate method. These values, when converted to tons of calcium carbonate, agree fairly closely with the amount of lime required to bring the soils to pH 7 when added directly to the soil. When lime was added above the saturation point the amount of exchangeable calcium as determined by the ammonium acetate method increased but remained relatively constant for the BaClâ-buffer method. The various analysis seem to indicate that the Astoria and Clatsop soils contain predominantly 2 : 1 type clay minerals while the Olympic and Willamette soils contain predominantly the 1 : 1 type. The Melbourne soil exhibits properties more closely associated with the coastal soils...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Soil acidity {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{limiting}} factors to acid sensitive crop production in the western areas of Oromia Region, Ethiopia. A Greenhouse incubation experiment was employed on soils of three land use systems to assess the effects of six lime rates and two lime particle sizes on acidity related soil chemical properties after incubation for 90 days. Data generated were subjected to analysis of variance using SAS software. The interactions effects between lime rates and soils from different land use systems significantly affected soil pH and exchangeable acidity. However, the three way interactions between lime rates, lime particle sizes and soils from different land use systems on these soil properties were not significantly different. Increasing lime rates for both lime particle sizes relatively increased soil pH and exchangeable bases thereby reducing the magnitude of soil acidity, exchangeable acidity and Al saturation. However, applied liming rates with 100 mesh size were relatively more effective in reducing acidity-related soil properties and increasing soil pH. When considering the average of acid <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> across the lime particle sizes, incubation of 1 1 soil with lime reduced the acid <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> from 9. 8 in the 0 t ha to 0. 8 % at 10 t ha lime rate in the forest land and similarly from 15. 8 to 3. 6 % in grazing and from 54. 7 to 22. 3 % reduction in acid <b>saturation</b> 1 <b>percentage</b> in cultivated land.
