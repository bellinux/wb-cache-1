2500|$|Biotechnology {{has contributed}} to the {{discovery}} and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – <b>biopharmaceutics.</b> Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals (cattle or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost. Biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy. [...] The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the Human Genome Project) has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.|$|E

50|$|In Spain, Pharmacy {{studies can}} be {{accessed}} after completing {{five and a half}} years of University College (with at least 6 months of initiation to Pharmacy Practice).

40|$|A <b>biopharmaceutics</b> and Quality by Design (QbD) {{conference was}} held on June 10 – 12, 2009 in Rockville, Maryland, USA to provide a forum and {{identify}} approaches for enhancing product quality for patient benefit.

Plenary and breakout session discussions evaluated the current state and envisioned a future state that more effectively integrates QbD and <b>biopharmaceutics.</b> Breakout groups discussed the following four topics: Integrating Biopharmaceutical Assessment into the QbD Paradigm, Predictive Statistical Tools, Predictive Mechanistic Tools, and Predictive Analytical Tools. Nine priority areas, further described in this report, were identified for advancing integration of <b>biopharmaceutics</b> and support a more fundamentally based, integrated approach to setting product dissolution/release acceptance criteria.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{transport of}} lamivudine, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, was investigated using the single pass intestinal perfusion technique in male Wistar rats. Single pass intestinal perfusion {{was performed in}} small intestine at a flow rate of 0. 20 ml/min. Lamivudine exhibits a high intestinal permeability over {{the length of the}} small intestine indicative of compounds that are well absorbed. The Peff of lamivudine is in the range of drugs with high intestinal permeability and high fraction of dose absorbed indicating that lamivudine readily crosses the intestine. This also suggests that lamivudine belongs to <b>biopharmaceutics</b> classification system class I and is a good candidate for <b>biopharmaceutics</b> classification system based biowaiver.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{commentary}} is {{to investigate}} the interplay of <b>Biopharmaceutics</b> Classification System (BCS), <b>Biopharmaceutics</b> Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) and Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS). BCS first classified drugs based on permeability and solubility {{for the purpose of}} predicting oral drug absorption. Then BDDCS linked permeability with hepatic metabolism and classified drugs based on metabolism and solubility for the purpose of predicting oral drug disposition. On the other hand, SECS classified drugs based on permeability and protein binding for the purpose of predicting the salivary excretion of drugs. The role of metabolism, rather than permeability, on salivary excretion is investigated and the results are not in agreement with BDDCS. ConclusionThe proposed Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) {{can be used as a}} guide for drug salivary excretion based on permeability (not metabolism) and protein binding...|$|E

40|$|Microencapsulation is a {{technology}} that has shown significant promise in biotherapeutics, and other applications. It has been proven useful in the immobilization of drugs, live mammalian and bacterial cells and other cells, and other <b>biopharmaceutics</b> molecules, {{as it can provide}} material structuration, protection of the enclosed product, and controlled release of the encapsulated contents, all of which can ensure efficient and safe therapeutic effects.

40|$|The <b>Biopharmaceutics</b> Classification System (BCS) is a {{tool that}} was created to {{categorize}} drugs into different groups according to their solubility and permeability characteristics. Through {{a combination of these}} factors and physiological parameters, it is possible to understand the absorption behavior of a drug in the gastrointestinal tract, thus contributing to cost and time reductions in drug development, as well as reducing exposure of human subjects during in vivo trials. Solubility is attained by determining the equilibrium under conditions of physiological pH, while different methods may be employed for evaluating permeability. On the other hand, the intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR), which is defined as the rate of dissolution of a pure substance under constant temperature, pH, and surface area conditions, among others, may present greater correlation to the in vivo dissolution dynamic than the solubility test. The purpose of this work is to discuss the intrinsic dissolution test as a tool for determining the solubility of drugs within the scope of the <b>Biopharmaceutics</b> Classification System (BCS) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Biopharmaceutics</b> Classification System (BCS) was {{developed}} for prediction of in vivo pharmacokinetic performance of drug products from measurements of permeability and solubility. If the permeability criteria changed with metabolism criteria than {{it may be useful}} in predicting overall drug disposition, including routes of drug elimination and the effects of efflux and absorptive transporters on oral drug absorption, importance of food effects, and transporter effects on post absorption systemic drug concentrations following oral and intravenous dosing known as <b>Biopharmaceutics</b> drug disposition classification system (BDDCS). The drugs that have high permeability but poor metabolism are generally hydrophilic molecules with low molecular weight are likely to be absorbed by active transport mechanisms. Suggesting that drugs have extensive metabolism are highly absorbed. BDDCS using elimination criteria may expand the number of Class 1 drugs eligible for a biowaiver of in vivo bioequivalence (BE) studies and provide predictability of drug disposition profiles for Classes 2, 3, and 4 compounds...|$|E
