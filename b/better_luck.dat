5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat <b>better</b> <b>luck</b> with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E
5|$|After {{the primary}} defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from {{sales of the}} Daily News began to decrease. In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper. In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium. In August 1952, Boddy {{announced}} his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a Sunday News. He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, Sheldon F. Sackett. After signing, Smith {{backed out of the}} deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the Daily News was losing over $100,000 a month. McKinnon had no <b>better</b> <b>luck</b> than anyone else in reviving the paper, and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Mirror. Under the sale agreement, the Mirror became the Mirror & Daily News (before again being renamed the Mirror-News) and all Daily News employees lost their jobs. On December 18, 1954, publication of the Daily News ceased.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{tested the}} new Mercedes-Benz W25 at the AVUS track in April, {{and despite his}} injuries—his right leg had healed five shorter than his left, leaving him with a {{noticeable}} limp—he was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team from their first race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union's. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, but made the start for the German Grand Prix at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver Hans Stuck {{on the outside of}} the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had <b>better</b> <b>luck</b> at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59laps, the pain in his leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck's car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the Spanish Grand Prix—he led before Fagioli passed him, much to the anger of Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold position—and first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} attempt of {{purposeful}} espionage against the fortress {{was conducted in}} 1913–14. A former lieutenant in the Danish coastal artillery, A. B.

He and his wife stayed at a boarding house in the city, and had regular correspondence with his employer who stayed in Copenhagen. It was also the correspondence that exposed the attempt, which was not very successful in terms of information gained by the Russians.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between causal attributions and academic achievement, considering attributions by students parents, school level, and gender.

Even tough, poorest achievement students justify, in large percentage, <b>better</b> marks by <b>luck</b> and facility of examinations, as well as low capacity to explain low school classifications. The causal attributions are not related to students´ gender, but male students from parents with low academic certifications tend to justify low school marks by lack of capacity.

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of a layered aperiodic modulation of the couplings on the critical behaviour of the two–dimensional Ising model is studied {{in the case of}} marginal perturbations. The aperiodicity is found to induce anisotropic scaling. The anisotropy exponent z, given by the sum of the surface magnetization scaling dimensions, depends continuously on the modulation amplitude. Thus these systems are scale invariant but not conformally invariant at the critical point. The critical behaviour of quasiperiodic or aperiodic systems is <b>better</b> understood since <b>Luck</b> recently proposed a relevance–irrelevance criterion [1]. As in the Harris criterion for random systems [2], the strength of the fluctuations of the couplings, on a scale given by the correlation length, is of primary importance for the critical behaviour. Thus an aperiodic perturbation can be relevant, marginal or irrelevant, depending on the sign of a crossover exponent involving the correlation length exponent of the unperturbed system ν and the wandering exponent ω which governs the fluctuations of the aperiodic sequence [3]. The criterion explains earlier results (for references see [1]) and has been confirmed in recent works on the layered 2 d Isin...|$|R

60|$|At length it happened, one calm day in {{the latter}} part of summer, that I was {{relaxing}} myself from the toils of severe study by a day's amusement in fishing in those waters which had been the favorite resort of my boyhood. I was in company with several worthy burghers of my native city. Our sport was indifferent; the fish did not bite freely; and we had frequently changed our fishing ground without <b>bettering</b> our <b>luck.</b> We at length anchored close under a ledge of rocky coast, on the eastern side of the island of Manhata. It was a still, warm day. The stream whirled and dimpled by us without a wave or even a ripple, and every thing was so calm and quiet that it was almost startling when the kingfisher would pitch himself from the branch of some dry tree, and after suspending himself for a moment in the air to take his aim, would souse into the smooth water after his prey. While we were lolling in our boat, half drowsy with the warm stillness of the day and the dullness of our sport, one of our party, a worthy alderman, was overtaken by a slumber, and, as he dozed, suffered the sinker of his drop-line to lie upon the bottom of the river. On waking, he found he had caught something of importance, from the weight; on drawing it to the surface, we were much surprised to find a long pistol of very curious and outlandish fashion, which, from its rusted condition, and its stock being worm-eaten and covered with barnacles, appeared to have been a long time under water. The unexpected appearance of this document of warfare occasioned much speculation among my pacific companions. One supposed it to have fallen there during the revolutionary war. Another, from the peculiarity of its fashion, attributed it to the voyagers in the earliest days of the settlement; perchance to the renowned Adrian Block, who explored the Sound and discovered Block Island, since so noted for its cheese. But a third, after regarding it for some time, pronounced it to be of veritable Spanish workmanship.|$|R
2500|$|The Persian king Ardesher advised his lawyers, secretaries, officers, and husbandmen to [...] "marry near {{relatives}} for {{the sympathy}} of kinship is kept alive thereby." [...] The same motivation {{is given in}} ancient Arabic sources referring {{to the practice of}} marriage between paternal cousins prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. The Kitab al-Aghani similarly features the story of Qays ibn Dharih, who was not allowed by his father to marry a beautiful maiden from another tribe because, {{in the words of the}} father felt that as rich and wealthy man he did not want his son to take the side of a stranger. There is the related consideration that a man who grows up with a cousin in the intimate setting of one extended family knows her and so may develop his own liking or love for her. There is also the benefit of knowing the qualities of the spouse: a Syrian proverb reads, [...] "Ill luck which you know is <b>better</b> than good <b>luck</b> with which you get acquainted." [...] Keeping property in the family is a final reason for cousin marriage. One of the earliest examples of this is the five daughters of Zelophehad from ancient Israel (...) who upon inheriting from their father all married their father's brother's sons. The Quranic law dictating that daughters receive a portion of the inheritance appears to have had the effect of increasing cousin marriage rate.|$|R
40|$|We empirically examine two {{competing}} views of CEO pay. In the contracting view, pay {{is used to}} solve an agency problem: the compensation committee optimally chooses pay contracts which give the CEO incentives to maximize shareholder wealth. In the skimming view, pay {{is the result of}} an agency problem: CEOs have managed to capture the pay process so that they set their own pay, constrained somewhat by the availability of cash or by a fear of drawing shareholders' attention. To distinguish these views, we first examine how CEO pay responds to luck, observable shocks to performance beyond the CEO's control. Using several measures of luck, such as changes in oil price for the oil industry, we find substantial pay for luck. Pay responds about as much to a lucky' dollar as to a general dollar. Most importantly, we find that better governed firms pay their CEOs less for luck. Our second test examines how much CEOs are charged for the options they are granted. Since options never appear on balance sheets, they might offer an appealing way to skim. Here again we find a crucial role for governance: CEOs in better governed firms are charged more for the options they are given. These results suggest that both views of CEO pay matter. In poorly governed firms, the skimming view fits <b>better</b> (pay for <b>luck</b> and little charge for options) while in well governed firms, the contracting view fits better (filtering out of luck and charging for options). ...|$|R
