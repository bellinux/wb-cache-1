5|$|A new bus {{rapid transit}} system (BRT) called MetroBus, is {{currently}} under construction across Bristol, as of 2015, to provide a faster and reliable service than buses, improve transport infrastructure and reduce congestion. The MetroBus rapid transit scheme will run on both bus lanes and segregated guided <b>busways</b> on three routes; Ashton Vale to Bristol Temple Meads (AVTM), North Fringe to Hengrove and South Bristol Link (SBL). MetroBus services are expected to start in 2017.|$|E
5|$|When {{plans for}} Runcorn New Town were drawn up, they {{included}} three distinct types of road: local roads, expressways and the Busway. The expressways {{are intended to}} keep all through traffic off the local roads. This system links to the north by the A533 over the Silver Jubilee Bridge to Widnes and Merseyside, to the northeast to Warrington by the A56, to the east to Northwich and north Cheshire by the A533, and to the southeast by the A557 to the M56 and to Frodsham. The M56 links to the M6 and, {{to the north of}} Widnes, the A557 links to the M62. The Busway is a system of roads for use by buses only, and bears no resemblance to guided <b>busways</b> or bus lanes in use elsewhere, as it is a totally separate road system, not running alongside (or down the middle of) existing roads. In addition, there is a network of dedicated cycleways in the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Governor Tom McCall {{appointed}} Goldschmidt to {{what would}} {{be known as the}} Governor's Task Force, which was tasked with exploring regional transportation solutions. Goldschmidt served alongside notable leaders: Glenn Jackson, chair of the board of Portland Power and Light and chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, was considered the state's leading power broker on transportation issues; and Gerard Drummond, a prominent lawyer and lobbyist, was president of Tri-Met's board of directors. The task force considered an unpopular deal that would have funded the construction of the Mount Hood Freeway, which would have bisected southeast Portland. The deal, which would have been 90% funded by the Federal Highway Administration, was rescinded, with first the Multnomah County Commission and, later, Portland City Council reversing their positions and advising against it. Goldschmidt was initially opposed to diverting funds to light rail, instead favoring <b>busways</b> and more suitable local road projects; as the 1981 deadline to reallocate the funds approached, however, light rail became a more attractive prospect. By a process not clearly documented, light rail was included in the final plan. All federal money initially intended for the Mount Hood Freeway ultimately went to other road projects, but the total amount was doubled and the first leg of MAX light rail was approved and ultimately completed in 1986.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the MTA and the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) {{identified}} the M60 {{as a potential}} corridor for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the city's bus rapid transit service. The M60 was identified under studies to improve crosstown service on 125th Street (which like other crosstown bus corridors was noted for slow travel speeds), and under the LaGuardia Airport Access Alternatives Analysis conducted with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to improve bus service to LaGuardia Airport. A separate outside study in 2011 by the Regional Plan Association proposed creating dedicated <b>busways</b> along the Grand Central Parkway to speed up M60 service. That year, studies and community outreach were conducted, and plans to implement the M60 SBS were announced on October 11, 2012. At the time, the M60 was the heaviest used of the four 125th Street crosstown buses. The plan would turn the M60 local into a limited-stop service along 125th Street, {{with the number of}} stops along the corridor reduced from eleven to six. It would add dedicated MTA bus laness and other improvements to speed travel times, and make the fleet entirely articulated and fully equipped with luggage racks.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1970s, {{transportation}} {{had become}} {{a problem in the}} north-east suburbs. The population of the Tea Tree Gully region had increased from 2,500 in 1954 to 35,000 by 1971. A corridor of land along the River Torrens from Adelaide to Modbury, originally purchased for the Modbury Freeway proposed under the MATS plan, {{was the subject of a}} new proposal in 1973 when the State Director-General of Transport suggested building a heavy rail line that would connect the suburb to the Adelaide railway system. A subsequent study, the [...] "North East Adelaide Public Transport Review" [...] (NEAPTR), considered heavy rail, light rail, <b>busways,</b> and freeways, ultimately concluding that a light rail line or busway would be most viable. The state government decided on a light rail proposal to extend the historic Glenelg Tram. The new route was to continue along King William Street beyond what was then the terminus in Victoria Square and weave through the Adelaide Park Lands to the Modbury corridor. The light rail system would connect with feeder buses at stations along the length of the corridor to transfer passengers to suburban routes. New light rail vehicles were to be bought to replace the ageing 1929 H type trams.|$|E
