50|$|Silicone resins {{are partly}} organic in nature with a <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> {{structure}} made of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms {{rather than the}} familiar carbon-to-carbon backbone characteristics of organic polymers. In addition to having at least one oxygen atom bonded to each silicone atom, silicone resins have direct bonds to carbon and therefore also known as polyorganosiloxanes. They have the general formula (R2SiO)n and the physical form (liquid, gel, elastomer or solid) and use varies with molecular weight, structure (linear, branched, caged) and nature of substituent groups (R = alkyl, aryl, H, OH, alkoxy). Aryl substituted silicone resins have greater thermal stability than alkyl substituted silicone resins when polymerised (condensation cure mechanism) at temperatures between ~300 °F (~150 °C) and ~400 °F (~200 °C). Heating above ~600 °F (~ 300 °C) converts all silicone polymers into ceramics since all organic constituents pyrolytically decompose leaving crystalline silicate polymers with the general formula (-SiO2-)n.

The resulting composites were characterised by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA) and water contact angle analyser (WCA). The FTIR spectra of the pure P(3 HB) and P(3 HB) containing graft composites [P(3 HB) -g-BC] showed their strong characteristic bands at 3358 cm− 1, 1721 cm− 1 and 1651 cm− 1, respectively. A homogenous dispersion of P(3 HB) in the <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> of BC was achieved as evident by the SEM micrographs. XRD pattern for P(3 HB) showed distinct peaks at 2 θ values that represent the crystalline nature of P(3 HB). While, in comparison with those of neat P(3 HB), the degree of crystallinity for P(3 HB) -g-BC decreased and this reduction is mainly because of the new cross-linking of P(3 HB) within the <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> that changes the morphology and destroys the crystallites. Laccase-assisted graft composite prepared from P(3 HB) and BC was fairly flexible and strong, judged by the tensile strength (64. 5 MPa), elongations at break (15. 7 %), and Young's modulus (0. 98 GPa) because inherently high strength of BC allowed the mechanical properties of P(3 HB) to improve in the P(3 HB) -g-BC composite.

Poly(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether (MPEO) were grafted onto the backbone through reactions with the cyclic anhydride residues.

DSC investigation indicated that the crystallization number of alkyl carbon atoms of the side chains grafted onto the rigid <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone,</b> poly(p-benzamide) (PBA), is much lower than that of the alkyl carbon atoms of the side chains grafted onto the flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone,</b> poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), implying that the conformational state of the <b>polymer</b> <b>backbones</b> has a strong effect on the side-chain crystallization behavior in comblike polymers.

40|$|According to the American Cancer Society, {{approximately}} 1, 479, 000 {{new cases}} of cancer {{were expected to be}} diagnosed, while 562, 340 Americans were expected to die from cancer in 2009 alone. Even though advances in early diagnosis and therapy {{over the past few decades}} have led to continual decreases in incidence and mortality, cancer remains the second leading cause of death among all Americans. Consequently, further technological development in all areas of cancer detection and treatment are still of great importance not only to the scientific community, but to society itself. To address the shortcomings in current cancer diagnosis and treatment, a novel, highly adaptable, targeted nanoparticle system based on alternating amphiphilic copolymers has been developed having a variety of potential clinical applications. These polymers consist of an alternating copolymer backbone composed of hydrophilic polyethylene glycol- 900 (PEG 900) and dimethyl 5 -hydroxyisophthalate (linker) monomer units. The linker within the <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> has a free hydroxyl group to which a variety of sidechains can be attached, including hydrophobic groups to impart amphiphilicity, targeting ligands, as well as contrast agents for imaging applications. Three major areas of investigation were addressed to develop and evaluate the performance of the proposed amphiphilic alternating copolymers: (1) <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> synthesis, (2) attachment of radioiodine, and (3) targeted delivery in vitro and in vivo. The first step in the production of the alternating amphiphilic copolymers is a chemo-enzymatic condensation polymerization of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dimethyl 5 -hydroxyisophthalate (linker) to produce <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer.</b> Because of their generally low equilibrium constants, condensation polymerizations require effective removal of the condensation byproduct (in this case, methanol) in order to achieve significant increases in molecular weight. The increased viscosities at higher molecular weights not only increase the difficulty of byproduct removal, but may also affect the mixing characteristics as well as the mass transfer of other species in the reaction. The enzymatic polymerization was investigated using both predictive modeling and experiment. The ultimate goal was to increase the molecular weight of the synthesized polymer to allow for increased substitution of the polymer backbone. Key experimental variables were tested in glass flasks typically used in organic synthesis. In these reactions, 4 A molecular sieves had the greatest affect on the <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> molecular weight. In particular, addition of sieves, which can act as sinks for both water and methanol, led to a twofold increase in weight-average molecular weight above that observed previously for the enzymatic polymerization. The Protherm, a novel, thin-film reactor was employed in order to improve methanol mass transfer and mixing within the polymer melt. Three separate reactions in the Protherm produced the highest Mw <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer</b> (approximately 20 kDa). A blade speed of 500 rpm with molecular sieves present was able to achieve this Mw in 48 hr. Two separate models were proposed to describe the polymerization, including a homogeneous kinetic model and a Fick's Law mass transfer model. Significant differences were observed between the experimental results and the predictions of the homogeneous model. The mass transfer modeling, which estimated the increase in reactant and methanol surface concentration relative to the concentration in the bulk, was unable to bridge the gap between experiment and model results. Limited knowledge of key model parameters, including the equilibrium constant and methanol solubility, was one proposed explanation for the observed discrepancy. In order to assess the performance of a nanoparticle delivery system in biological applications, a label that is detectable under a wide range of conditions and concentrations must be present within the molecule. Radioiodine was selected because of its multiple potential applications depending on the selected isotope, including 124 I for positron emission tomography, 131 I for radiotherapy, and 125 I for inexpensive, quantitative research applications. A standard protein-labeling technique was adapted for application to the copolymers in this work. The successful adaptation of this procedure for use with our polymers represented the first demonstration in the field of a nanoparticle-forming polymer that was directly labeled with radioiodine without any additional chemicalalterations or intermediate reactions. The process was characterized using a variety of chromatographic techniques and radiometric measurements to confirmed covalent, stable attachment of iodine in a product with high radiochemical purity. The alternating amphiphilic copolymers were combined with an engineered peptide having an extremely high binding affinity for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a biomarker prevalent in a variety of human cancers. This high-affinity binder, the E 13. 4. 3 peptide, was developed by collaborator Dr. Benjamin Hackel under the guidance of Professor K. Dane Wittrup. A number of polymer design variables were considered, including the targeting ligand density, identity of the hydrophobic sidechain, polymer molecular weight, and length of the spacer connecting the peptide to the backbone. The ligand density and hydrophobic sidechain identity were chosen for study. Initial studies demonstrated selective uptake of E 13. 4. 3 -conjugated polymers into a target-bearing, EGFR-positive human cancer cell line relative to untargeted controls. Preparative gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to create high molecular weight, low polydispersity fractions of <b>backbone</b> <b>polymer.</b> Polymers synthesized from these fractions achieved the greatest increase in selective uptake in vitro with a four- to sixfold increase in uptake for E 13. 4. 3 -conjugated polymers relative to untargeted controls. Animal studies measured the biodistribution, blood circulation, and tumoral accumulation of various polymer formulations. Statistically significant selective tumor accumulation was observed for two different targeted polymers, each having different targeting ligand density and different hydrophobic sidechains. The E 13. 4. 3 -polymers have proven a rich platform for study. Their demonstrated ability to selectively accumulate in targeted tumors combined with their potential use in diagnostic and/or therapeutic clinical applications makes them an attractive option for intensified investigation. by Kevin P.

40|$|Heterogeneous optical {{behavior}} of perylene polyisocyanides, which arises from {{different structures of}} the <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone,</b> is revealed by the combination of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Short nonhelical perylene oligomers exhibit monomer-like fluorescence properties, whereas long helical perylene fiber emission arises from excimer sites after delocation of the excitation along the <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone</b> (see picture) ...|$|R
30|$|Kanemitsu and {{co-workers}} [4, 5] and Furukawa et al. [6] synthesized {{several kinds of}} Si clusters, Si <b>backbone</b> <b>polymers,</b> network polymers, and planar siloxane structures and studied their optical properties to understand the dimensional effects of Si-based nanostructures such as p-Si. In the chain clusters and polymers, sharp PL bands were observed with very small Stokes shifts. On the other hand, following the line of nanostructures with Si clusters, we find that such structures which have generated great interest is the silicon rich oxide (SRO) thin film; this material exhibits optical properties {{in the same manner}} to p-Si, but it is significantly less chemically reactive than p-Si.|$|R
40|$|We have {{simultaneously}} measured, for {{the first}} time, {{the extension of the}} <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone</b> of a side-chain liquid crystalline polymer and the intensity of the 001 Bragg reflection, which gives the smectic order parameter Ψ as a function of temperature in the smectic phase. We have qualitatively demonstrated that the more the smectic phase is ordered, the more the <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone</b> is localized between the mesogenic layers. It is shown that the Landau theory allows us to relate the radius of gyration parallel to the magnetic field of the <b>polymer</b> <b>backbone</b> to the smectic order parameter. We also show that the Renz-Warner theory is suitable at low temperatures...|$|R
