40|$|Drawing on {{data from}} linguistics, {{developmental}} psychology and the neurosciences, we present a computational theory of the acquisition of early grammar by infants. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> the view that language is a mapping between form and meaning, we propose that a theory of language acquisition must be tightly integrated with a theory of the infant's prelinguistic representations. Namely, the infant's task is {{to learn how to}} map the linguistic form in the input to her representations of the corresponding scenes. We have developed a theory of prelinguistic cognition <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>i)</b> <b>what</b> is currently known about the architecture of the brain, and ii) the representational requirements for successful (sensorimotor) behavior in the world. We show how such prelinguistic sensorimotor representations can provide the basis for the acquisition of early grammatical forms, and thereby ground language in the world. Importantly, this is true not only at the lexical level, but also at the grammatical level...|$|R

I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet.

40|$|London Rap {{belongs to}} the {{transnational}} public of hip-hop. As {{a result of the}} birth of the genre of the music-video (in the 1980 s) and the diffusion of music TV channels like MTV (from the 1990 s), hip-hop has become a worldwide public first and foremost because of its visual power. The internet revolution has further expanded the audio-visuality of hip-hop, particularly via the current roles of YouTube and social media. The cognitive change this passage entails, for the younger generations of hip-hoppers, is that the technology of the video has become more commonly used than that of the book to captivate an audience. Yet, as suggested in this thesis, the screen brings to completion the search for visual analogues for words that alphabetic writing, since the birth of philosophy in ancient Greece, developed. If digital audio-visual capitalism declares the crisis of modern nationalism <b>based</b> <b>on</b> print, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call here the “boxing obsession” – the obsession whereby words need to mean things – is still far from being dead. We observe through interviews, lyrics, speech and music-video analysis how London Conscious Rappers ambiguously relate to the boxing obsession with regards to what concerns the imagination of ethnicities. In viewing the “political correctness” of the dominant discourse as the hypocrisy to unmask, the rappers rebel against the effects the boxing obsession produces, such as police brutality, the crypto-racism of media talk, and everyday racist attacks; but in reifying views of “blackness”, “whiteness” and “Islam”, and in attaching them to specific bodies {{on the basis of their}} physical appearance, they struggle to identify the causes. The fieldwork methodology here presented (an “exit from the text”) offers a way for informants and anthropologists to definitively get to grips with the boxing obsession and move forward...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{numerous}} advantages, communications over multicarrier schemes constitute an appealing approach for broadband wireless systems. Especially, the strong penetration of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) into the communications standards has triggered heavy investigation on multicarrier systems, leading to re-consideration of different approaches {{as an alternative}} to OFDM. The goal of the present survey is not only to provide a unified review of waveform design options for multicarrier schemes, but also {{to pave the way for}} the evolution of the multicarrier schemes from the current state of the art to future technologies. In particular, a generalized framework on multicarrier schemes is presented, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> to transmit, <b>i.</b> e., symbols, how to transmit, i. e., filters, and where/when to transmit, i. e., lattice. Capitalizing on this framework, different variations of orthogonal, bi-orthogonal, and nonorthogonal multicarrier schemes are discussed. In addition, filter design for various multicarrier systems is reviewed considering four different design perspectives: energy concentration, rapid decay, spectrum nulling, and channel/hardware characteristics. Subsequently, evaluation tools which may be used to compare different filters in multicarrier schemes are studied. Finally, multicarrier schemes are evaluated from the view of the practical implementation issues, such as lattice adaptation, equalization, synchronization, multiple antennas, and hardware impairments.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{perform and}} compare three {{different}} studies of introductory physics students' epistemological views - their {{views about the}} nature of knowledge and how it is learned. Physics education research (PER) shows that epistemological views affect how students learn, so they are important to understand and diagnose. The first study uses a Likert-scale instrument, adapted from the Maryland Physics Expectation Survey, designed to assess to what extent students see physics knowledge as coherent (rather than piecemeal), conceptual (rather than just formulas), and constructed (rather than absorbed). Using this survey, I documented several results, including that (i) a large lecture class can produce favorable changes in students' epistemological views, at least {{in the context of the}} class, and (ii) teaching a rushed modern physics unit at the end of an introductory sequence can lead to negative epistemological effects. The second study uses the Force Concept Inventory with modified instructions: students indicated both the answer they think a scientist would give and the answer that makes the most sense to them personally. A "split" between these two answers shows that the student does not think she has reconciled her common sense with the formal physics concepts. This study showed that attention to reconciliation in a course allows students to see initially-counterintuitive ideas as making sense. Finally, I did a detailed study of one student by (i) watching video of her in tutorial, where she and three other students answered a structured series of conceptual and quantitative physics questions, (ii) formulating interviews <b>based</b> largely <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> observed in the video, and (iii) interviewing her while the tutorial was still fresh in her head. I repeated this cycle every week for a semester. I found that her tendency to focus on the multiple and ambiguous meanings of words like "force" hampered her ability to reconcile physics concepts with common sense. This last method is time-consuming, but it produces rich data and allows for a fine-grained analysis of individual students. The first two survey methods are best suited for measuring the effect of epistemologically-centered course reforms on large groups of students...|$|R
40|$|This article joins many {{contemporary}} activists and scholars in criticizing and seeking {{alternatives to the}} ongoing neoliberalization of the global political economy. It sets out two main arguments: (1) in order to resist the growing control of capital over the global political economy, one important project is to develop new notions of citizenship that expand the decision-making control of citizens; and (2) Henri Lefebvre's concept of 'the right to the city' is one particularly fertile set of principles <b>on</b> which to <b>base</b> such alternative citizenships because it resists and rethinks both traditional citizenship forms and capitalist social relations. The {{first part of the}} article outlines the context in which Lefebvre's ideas might be pursued by examining the contemporary destabilization of traditional citizenship and its relationship to global political and economic restructuring. The second part of the article develops more specifically the potential of Lefebvrian citizenship by constructing a theoretical sketch of one possible citizenship <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Lefebvre's idea: <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call the right to the global city. The article finishes by suggesting that the right to the city can be extended beyond the urban context. It points toward a new set of more democratic political relationships in which the power of inhabitants to shape the global political economy displaces the power of capital and the nation-state.

It’s <b>based,</b> of course, <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do when I coach other clients, so I’ll try to isolate what it is that’s different about coaching Stars. Who am I talking about? The people I have in mind are in positions such as President, Executive Director, COO, or C-suite jobs. They tend to be late 30 ’s to about 50; about 60 % are men. They are in small or medium sized companies or agencies, or units of larger ones. At earlier times they were called High Potentials, and probably were star-caliber performers then too. They are doing some things extremely well, but not necessarily equally well across the scope of their responsibilities. So, just in these few words I’ve touched on several points about coaching Stars: • Although these folks are very talented, their primary talents {{may not be in}} Leadership. • The organization very much values what they contribute, and doesn’t want to risk losing it; in fact, it wants more of it. • The pressures of a senior executive role can highlight the inevitable tradeoffs in the Star’s overall performance. Describing the Stars The overall picture of Star performers is the one we are all trying to achieve with our executive selection, development and coaching efforts. The picture begins with High Achievement, of course, and goes on to include many desirable behaviors and competencies. I picked up some nice descriptions of Stars at talks by Bob Hogan and Peter Saville. Bob mentioned some behaviors that a Star’s colleagues want to see: • Straight talking, fair, decisive, knowledgeable about the business...|$|R

Two years later, another book on the behavioral revolution in communist studies appeared in print, edited by Roger Kanet.

Ten years are perhaps too short a time span to judge {{the fruits of the}} behavioral revolution.

I begin with a short review of the current split between commnunist area studies and behavioralism. Then I discuss the results of some behavioralist research and examine records of predictions in traditional and behavioralist research on communist society. Next, I contrast theoretical assumptions underlying behavioralist and interpretative methodologies in social research, and finally, I discuss the prospects for hermeneutical study of communist societies. The following analysis draws primarily on the contributions made by political scientists and sociologists-scholars most receptive to the behavioralist appeal. It is hoped that this discussion may be useful lo behavioralist and interpretative researchers working in other branches of Western scholarship on communism...|$|R
