5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But the <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> New Deal, {{coupled with}} continuing congressional {{concern over the}} Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|An {{anticipated}} <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> governing PCs {{failed to}} materialize, as Premier Ed Stelmach extended his party's seat total to 72 from 60. While the Alliance {{finished second in}} eight ridings across the province, they failed to win any seats as Hinman lost his Cardston-Taber-Warner riding by just 39 votes. Running candidates in 61 of the province's 83 ridings, the Alliance took 6.78% of the vote, fourth behind the PCs, Liberals and New Democrats.|$|E
5|$|By 1587, the Catholic <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Protestants {{had become}} a {{campaign}} across Europe. Elizabeth I of England's execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, on 8 February 1587 outraged the Catholic world. Philip II of Spain prepared for an invasion of England. The League took control of much of northern France to secure French ports for his armada.|$|E

And the person to pronounce the sentence is non other than fair-minded and generous Thakur Vikram Singh.|$|R
50|$|The film survives {{only in the}} cut version {{which was}} {{released}} in late 1930 by Warner Brothers. Due to <b>the</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> musicals, <b>the</b> Warner Bros. were forced to cut {{a lot of the}} musical sequences before releasing the film.|$|R

5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{external}} environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Glam metal lost {{mainstream}} {{interest in}} the early 1990s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> genre. A factor in the decline of glam metal was the rise of grunge in the early 1990s, which had a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style. Glam metal has enjoyed a revival since the late 1990s with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, {{as well as the}} retro styling of newer bands including The Darkness from Lowestoft, the United Kingdom, Santa Cruz from Helsinki, Finland, and Steel Panther from Los Angeles, America.|$|E
5000|$|When {{industry}} groups lobbied to weaken regulation and a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> environmental regulations, <b>the</b> so-called wise use movement gained importance and influence. The wise use movement and anti-environmental groups {{were able to}} portray environmentalist as {{out of touch with}} mainstream values. (Larson) ...|$|R
50|$|Allen's firing {{brought a}} {{significant}} <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> Thornburgh from <b>the</b> African-American community and various civil rights groups. Some asserted that Allen {{was held to}} a different standard because of her skin color, gender, or both; others charged that the Governor's actions were politically motivated.|$|R
5000|$|In {{her book}} World on Fire, Yale Law School {{professor}} Amy Chua posits that [...] "when free market democracy is pursued {{in the presence}} of a market-dominant minority, the almost invariable result is backlash. This backlash typically takes one of three forms. The first is a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> markets, targeting <b>the</b> market-dominant minority's wealth. The second is a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> democracy by forces favorable to the market-dominant minority. The third is violence, sometimes genocidal, directed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> market-dominant minority itself.".|$|R
5|$|Saint Anselm {{came out}} of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s with no major {{disturbances}} or riots on campus despite various bomb threats called into campus, often from parties outside the college. Fr. Placidus Riley, O.S.B. successfully led the college through these challenging times. Despite the <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> U.S. military on college campuses nationwide, the presence of a National Guard armory did not result in any major problems. However, in May 1970, final exams for that year were made optional as students showed support for the students of Kent State after the massacre of several unarmed college students protesting the Vietnam War. Students, faculty and members of the monastic community held prayer services and rallies throughout campus after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> socialist Second Republic {{brought about}} the {{democratic}} Third Republic under consecutive presidents Albert Zafy (1991), Ratsiraka (1997) and Marc Ravalomanana (2001), followed by a Fourth Republic under Andry Rajoelina, who {{came to power in}} a 2009 coup d'état. Although Dama performed at political rallies in Paris during the eight-month political standoff following the 2001 presidential elections that brought Ravalomanana to power, Mahaleo as a full group has never sided with any particular politician, instead expressing through their lyrics the social and political views and concerns of the average Malagasy citizen. They tend to promote collective, grassroots action as the best solution to the country's problems, rather than entrusting the work to politicians and international development partners.|$|E
500|$|Gloria Gaynor and {{producers}} Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren won the Best Disco Recording {{award for the}} song [...] "I Will Survive". However, because of a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> disco, <b>the</b> Academy discontinued the category before the 23rd Grammy Awards. In 1998, a similar category, Best Dance Recording, began being awarded to honor vocal or instrumental dance tracks, though there were concerns that the genre would be short-lived much like the disco category.|$|R
5000|$|The 1840s and 1850s saw {{a general}} {{movement}} <b>against</b> lotteries in <b>the</b> United States, partly on moral grounds, and {{partly due to}} a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> legislative corruption. <b>The</b> Indiana constitutional convention of 1851 adopted, with little debate, a clause that [...] "no lottery shall be authorized; nor shall the sale of lottery tickets be allowed".|$|R
5000|$|In a 2014 interview, Richards—still unemployed—speculated {{whether the}} {{developer}} {{was responsible for}} instigating <b>the</b> Internet <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> her. <b>The</b> developer, who was offered a new job [...] "right away", {{said he had not}} engaged with those who sent him messages of support, and had posted a short statement on Hacker News the same night after he was fired saying in part that Richards had [...] "every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position".|$|R
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term, Livingstone {{continued}} {{his support for}} London's bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, playing {{a crucial role in}} securing vital Russian support for the bid. On 6 July 2005, in a ceremony held in Singapore attended by Livingstone, London was announced as the victor, resulting in widespread celebration. The following day, British-born Islamist suicide bombers undertook three attacks on the Underground and another on a bus, killing 52 civilians. Livingstone gave a speech from Singapore denouncing the attackers as terrorists, before immediately returning to London. Informing the BBC that Western foreign policy was largely to blame for the attacks, his response to the situation was widely praised, even by opponents. Fearing an Islamophobic <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> city's Muslim minority, he initiated an advertising campaign to counter this, holding a rally for inter-community unity in Trafalgar Square. A second, failed suicide bombing attack took place on 21 July, and in the aftermath police officers shot dead a Brazilian tourist, Jean Charles de Menezes, whom they mistook for a bomber. Police initially lied about the killing, resulting in widespread condemnation, although Livingstone defended the actions of Metropolitan Police commissioner Ian Blair.|$|E
5000|$|The Mu'tazila {{asserted}} that everything in revelation {{could be found}} through rational means alone. The Mu'tazila were heavily influenced by the Greek philosophy they encountered and began to adopt the the ideas of Plotinus, whose Neoplatonic theology caused an enormous <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> them. <b>The</b> political <b>backlash</b> the Mu'tazila faced, {{as well as the}} challenged brought forth by new schools of theology caused this group to atrophy and decline into irrelevancy. They are no longer considered an Orthodox school of theology by Sunni Muslims.|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} of Kenya has employed {{a wide range}} of strategies to undermine the recently-dismissed prosecutions of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto before the International Criminal Court (ICC). This Article argues that these strategies are part of an integrated <b>backlash</b> campaign <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ICC, one that encompasses seemingly unrelated actions in multiple global, regional and national venues. We identify three overarching themes that connect these diverse measures— politicizing complementarity, regionalizing political opposition, and pairing instances of cooperation and condemnation to diffuse accusations of impunity. By linking its discrete acts of opposition to these three themes, the government ultimately increased the effectiveness of its campaign <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Court. Our findings provide new evidence to analyze others instances of <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> international courts and institutions...|$|R
5000|$|Abolition {{movement}} - The {{addition of}} Mexico's former territories in 1848 {{at the conclusion}} of the Mexican-American War reopened the possibility of the expansion of race-based chattel slavery; the adaptation of the slave system to industrial-style cotton production resulted in increasing dehumanization of black workers and a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> slavery in <b>the</b> northern states; key figures included William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass.|$|R
5|$|From the 1980s {{there was}} a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> statism and {{compressive}} nature of modernist architecture. Instead {{there was a}} move towards a form of post-modernism that looked to a clash of styles with a renewed emphasis on visual aesthetics that invoked classicism. There was also {{a combination of the}} private and the public. This movement against modernism also included renewed influence by the Scots baronial and Mackintosh-inspired designs; these can be seen respectively in the Scandic Crown Hotel (1988–89) in the Old Town in Edinburgh and the National Library Causewayside Building (1985–87, extended 1993–94). The most significant figure in the development of architecture in Scotland from the 1980s was the academic Charles McKean. He was secretary and treasurer of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) from 1979 to 1995. He argued against motorway expansion and the production of grey, colourless monoliths. Early private works influenced by these ideas included the D. & D. Warehouse, Centre Street and the Bank of Pakistan in Sauchiehall Street, both in Glasgow. Public structures included the building to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow (1981) and the Glasgow Sheriff Court (1980–86).|$|E

50|$|In the workplace, another clear {{example of}} the {{applicability}} of expectation states theory is in predicting <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> female leaders in an organization. According to this theory, since women are often ascribed a position of lower status than men, when {{a woman in a}} leadership role exercises authority, expectation states theory predicts {{that there may be a}} <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> her, on <b>the</b> grounds that her power is perceived to be illegitimate. Expectation states theory can be used to explain (and be used as a means to counter) situations such as these.|$|R
