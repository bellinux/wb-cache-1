40|$|The {{empirical}} {{dependence of}} turbulence Prandtl number (Pr) on gradient Richardson number (Ri) is presented, derived {{so as to}} avoid the effects of self-correlation from common variables. Linear power relationships between the underlying variables that constitute both Pr and Ri are derived empirically from flux and profile observations. Pr and Ri are then reconstructed from these power laws, to indicate their interdependence whilst avoiding self-correlation. Data are selected according to the stability range prior to regression, and the process is iterated from neutral to higher stability until error analysis indicates the method is no longer valid. A <b>Butterworth</b> <b>function</b> is fitted to the resulting Pr (- 1) (Ri) regression to give an empirical summary of the analysis. The form suggests that asymptotically Pr (- 1) decreases as Ri (3 / 2). Scatter in the data increases above Ri similar to 1, however, indicating additional constraints to Pr are not captured by Ri alone in this high stability regime. The <b>Butterworth</b> <b>function</b> is analytic for all Ri > 0, and may be included in suitable boundary-layer parameterisation schemes where the turbulent diffusivity for heat is derived from the turbulent diffusivity for momentum...|$|E
40|$|The medical image {{segmentation}} {{is the key}} approach of image processing for brain MRI images. However, due to the visual complex appearance of image structures and the imaging characteristic, it is still challenging to automatically segment brain MRI image. A new multi-stage segmentation method based on superpixel and fuzzy clustering (MSFCM) is proposed to achieve the good brain MRI segmentation results. The MSFCM utilizes the superpixels as the clustering objects instead of pixels, and it can increase the clustering granularity and overcome the influence of noise and bias effectively. In the first stage, the MRI image is parsed into several atomic areas, namely, superpixels, and a further parsing step is adopted for the areas with bigger gray variance over setting threshold. Subsequently, designed fuzzy clustering is carried out to the fuzzy membership of each superpixel, and an iterative broadcast method based on the <b>Butterworth</b> <b>function</b> is used to redefine their classifications. Finally, the segmented image is achieved by merging the superpixels which have the same classification label. The simulated brain database from BrainWeb site {{is used in the}} experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that MSFCM method outperforms the traditional FCM algorithm in terms of segmentation accuracy and stability for MRI image...|$|E
40|$|We give a {{regularity}} {{analysis of}} the <b>Butterworth</b> scaling <b>function</b> and provide various con-structions of frame wavelets via the unitary extension principle. In general, there is no precise regularity estimate for <b>Butterworth</b> scaling <b>function.</b> Here, an optimal estimate of the decay of the Fourier transform of the <b>Butterworth</b> scaling <b>function</b> is given. The regularity of the But-terworth scaling function can then be deduced and hence, the regularity of the corresponding frame wavelets. We also show that the <b>Butterworth</b> scaling <b>function</b> tend to the Shannon scaling <b>function</b> as the <b>Butterworth</b> filter goes to infinity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an active}} {{realization of the}} sixth order current mode <b>Butterworth</b> filter <b>function</b> using low voltage(LV) Multioutput current conveyors (MOCCII) and grounded passive components. The proposed realization is based on cascading an insensitive single input multi output (SIMO) current mode universal biquadratic filter (UBF). The UBF is constructed employing only two MOCCIIs, four grounded components, that lead to simple structure, easy to design and suitable for IC fabrication. The proposed UBF can realize all standard biquadratic responses without any matching conditions and has current outputs at a high impedance terminal, which enable easy cascadablity. An example of eighth order current mode Butterworth filter has been considered. The filter has the advantages of minimum requirement of active and passive component count, low sensitivity, and high performance. The performance of the filter is verified through PSPICE simulation using low supply voltage. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present two {{different}} algorithms {{for the analysis}} and characterisation of limit cycles in fixed-point digital filters. These algorithms allow us to obtain results quite similar to those corresponding to exhaustive search procedures, but taken a considerably lesser time of computation. The good performance of the algorithms can be seen summarised in different tables obtained after analysing in detail several filters corresponding to different structures (state space, ladder and lattice wave digital filters, [...] .) and various approximation <b>functions</b> (<b>Butterworth,</b> Chebyshev [...] .). Key-words: Limit cycles, fixed point, fast algorithms, digital filters. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Three {{synthesis}} {{methods for}} {{the realization of}} the voltage transfer function by means of RC elements and three different active devices are presented. These three devices are a high-gain amplifier, a voltage controlled voltage source (VCVS) and a negative immittance converter (NIC). The VCVS and NIC as well as the high-gain amplifier are realized by an operational amplifier. The properties of the operational amplifier are stated. The matrix representation which describes the electrical behavior of this device is defined. The realizations of VCVS and NIC using an operational amplifier are derived. Synthesis techniques for these network configurations are developed and investigated. Examples are given for each case followed by experimental results. A <b>Butterworth</b> low-pass <b>function</b> is selected for all three synthesis examples. The actual networks are built. The experimental results of actual networks are analyzed and compared with the theoretical results. A general comparison of these three different synthesis methods is discussed in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|A compact highly linear {{microstrip}} dual-mode electronically switchable filter is presented. The {{key characteristics}} of the dual-mode switchable filter are investigated and described. A second order filter design procedure is outlined to facilitate the realisation of <b>Butterworth</b> and Chebyshev <b>functions.</b> The proposed filter was built and tested with NXP pin diode model BAP 65 - 03. The measured and simulated results are in good agreement. The measured insertion loss in the ON state was 3. 0 dB the isolation in the OFF state was 45 dB at the centre frequency.

30|$|Different {{techniques}} {{exist for}} the design of digital filters. Windowing method; in which the ideal impulse response is multiplied by a window function, is the most popular. There are various kinds of window <b>functions</b> (<b>Butterworth,</b> Chebyshev, Kaiser etc.), depending on the requirements on ripples in the passband and stopband, stopband attenuation and the transition width. These various windows limit the infinite length impulse response of ideal filter into a finite window to design an actual response. Furthermore, windowing methods do not allow sufficient control of the frequency response in the various frequency bands and other filter parameters such as transition width. The designer always has to compromise between the design specifications (Antoniou 1993 Antoniou 2005).|$|R
30|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{the study of}} refinable {{functions}} has attracted considerable attention. This {{will be followed by}} a description of the development of refinable functions. Initially, B-splines appeared as a special family of refinable functions, which satisfied the scaling equation in [1]. After that, pseudo-splines of Type I were introduced by Daubechies et al. [2] and Selesnick [3], along with the appearance of pseudo-splines of Type II in [4]. Especially, the properties of them, such as stability, regularity, approximation orders etc., were fully analyzed in [2, 4, 5]. Later, there appeared other refinable functions that had been discovered, for instance, dual pseudo-splines [6, 7], pseudo-box splines [8], Battle-Lemarie refinable functions [9 – 11], <b>Butterworth</b> refinable <b>functions</b> [12, 13], pseudo-Butterworth refinable functions [14], generalized pseudo-Butterworth refinable functions [15], and so on. Notice that almost all contributions above focus on the extensions based upon pseudo-splines. However, we discover that pseudo-Butterworth refinable functions, as an extension of pseudo-splines, lack compact support, although they have exponential decay to compensate the lack. It is natural to consider a new extension of pseudo-splines, which has compact support and exponential decay, in particular, masks of new refinable functions derived from generalized Bernstein polynomials [16] by substitution and summation.|$|R
40|$|Control {{theory has}} {{generally}} been divided into two categories, modern control and classical control. Modern control uses state feedback to alter the pole locations of a given system. Classical control uses pre-compensation to alter the zeroes {{of the system and}} uses output feedback to adjust the poles to bring stability to the system. The drawback is that the application of classical control techniques can be a lengthy, complicated and iterative design process and in the end, classical control techniques still do not give information {{about the state of the}} system. Neoclassical control combines classical control techniques with the state feedback approach of modern control to stabilize the system, eliminate the steady state error, provide relevant internal state information, and reduce the time it takes to design the controller. This thesis explores the application of neoclassical control to discrete-time systems. The mass-spring-damper, magnetic levitation, and ball and beam systems are discretized using the zero-order-hold or the Euler approximation. State-feedback control is used to modify the pole locations for these systems. A discrete-time integrator is put in series to eliminate the steady-state error for a step input. The pre-compensator is also put in series to replace the numerator of the open-loop system with a desired numerator. The unit output-feedback is then used to close the loop. The closed-loop system will have a step response which matches the discrete-time optimal ITAE, Bessel, or <b>Butterworth</b> transfer <b>functions.</b> An observer is added to estimate the state of the plant in this work. The observer is applied to the discrete-time mass-spring-damper, the magnetic levitation, and the ball and beam systems in such a way that the error in the state estimate will be driven to zero within the desired period of time. This will allow the application of this controller to systems when the state is not known or measurable...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{project was}} about design and {{implementation}} of an audio digital equalizer with digital control using computer as the controller. The equalizer had 2 / 3 octave band separation resulting into 15 bands across the entire audio spectrum frequency and with left and right channel with total of 30 bands. The band separation {{was based on the}} well-known standard defined by IEC 61260 / 1260 year 1995, ISO 266 year 1997 and ISO 3 year 1973. This specification also incorporated the filter ± 3 dB bandwidth for each filter band of the equalizer. The hardware to realize the equalizer was a special purpose digital signal processing system from Texas Instruments. The processor for the equalizer was the OMAP 137 {{in the form of a}} development board. This system had several features which were very essential for digital signal processing such as fast central processing unit to process both integer and floating point numbers, embedded analog to digital converter (ADC), digital to analog converter (DAC) and universal asynchronous receiver/ transmitter (UART) to connect to a computer The main part of this equalizer was the bandpass filters to manage the frequency response of the digital equalizer based on the second order <b>Butterworth</b> with transfer <b>function</b> of H(s) = (s 2 + 1) - 1. The transformation of the filter from the analog s-plane into the digital z-plane used the bilinear Z-transform which had been shown to have stable cut-off characteristics across all frequency with different sampling frequency. The filter coefficients were computed and adjusted using sampling frequency of 48 kHz and 16 - bit-ADC. Computation of the filters was implemented in 32 -bit integer formats to expedite the results and ensure there is no overflow and then truncated back into 16 -bit integer to match the capability of the 16 -bit-DAC. All of the 15 channels of the filters were computed in parallel and checked for the characteristics of the filters as an equalizer as opposed to single bandpass filter. DSP system was also checked for the capability to perform all 15 channels of the equalizer and see if the resulting system works as desired. This design approached was for both channels and then tested together to ensure real-time performance for all filters with the sampling rate of 48 kHz. Visual control of the equalizer was via UART port of the system connected to a computer mimicking similar to the view of a graphic equalizer with few added buttons such as bypass, duplicate left-right channel, and undo. The setting can be downloaded into the DSP system and stored permanently so when the equalizer was turned on, it would be at the condition of the last setting. The output of the DSP system was observed and compared using controlled input and then observed to ensure the performance was similar to the calculated value. The final test was to observe the performance for each bandpass filter at each different audio channel with music using auditory observation. The overall system performance was also evaluated using common music and the audio output evaluated and compared with common equalizer and the result was very similar...|$|R
