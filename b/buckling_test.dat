It was followed by design and fabrication of test equipment for strip <b>buckling</b> <b>test.</b> Initial research works was on design the test rig using solidwork software. The fabrication test rig consists of four different <b>buckling</b> <b>test</b> conditions. In this thesis, experimental and numerical investigation was dedicated to both ends fixed.

40|$|Wrinkling {{is one of}} {{the major}} defects in sheet metal {{products}} and may also play a significant role in the wear of the tool. The initiation and growth of wrinkles are influenced by many factors such as stress ratios, mechanical properties of the sheet material, geometry of the workpiece, contact condition, etc. It is difficult to analyze the wrinkling initiation and growth considering all the factors because the effects of the factors are very complex and the wrinkling behavior may show a wide scatter of data even for small deviations of factors. In this study, the bifurcation theory is introduced for the finite element analysis of wrinkling initiation and growth. All the above-mentioned factors are conveniently considered by the finite element method. The wrinkling initiation is found by checking the determinant of the stiffness matrix at each iteration and the wrinkling behavior is analyzed by successive iteration with the perturbed guess along the eigenvector. The effect of magnitude of perturbation on the wrinkling behavior can be avoided by the Newton-type iteration method. The finite element formulation is based on the incremental deformation theory and elastic-plastic material modeling. The finite element analysis is carried out using the continuum-based resultant shell elements considering the anisotropy of the sheet metal. For the verification of the analysis, the postbuckling of columns and circular plates are analyzed by finite element analysis using the bifurcation algorithm introduced in the study, and the results are compared with the exact solutions. In order to investigate the effects of geometry and stress ratio on the wrinkling initiation and growth, a modified Yoshida <b>buckling</b> <b>test</b> is proposed as an improved effective <b>buckling</b> <b>test.</b> In the modified Yoshida <b>buckling</b> <b>test,</b> the dimensions of the sheet specimen are varied to change the stress ratio and the degree of constraint.

Results of the two studies are compared with observed behavior of the test cylinders.

40|$|Complementary {{to recent}} {{studies on the}} {{cross-section}} behavior of elliptical hollow sections, investigations into the member response have also been performed and described in this paper. The first stage of these investigations involved a series of precise column <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> on hot-finished steel elliptical hollow sections. In total, 24 flexural <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> about the minor and major axes were carried out. Specimen sizes and lengths were carefully chosen in order to cover {{a wide range of}} both cross section and member slendernesses. The nondimensional column slenderness of the test specimens varied between 0. 19 and 1. 58. Measurements were taken of specimen geometry, global initial geometric imperfections, and tensile material properties. Key results from the tests including the full load-deformation histories have been presented and discussed. The test results have also been supplemented by 158 numerically generated results, allowing a wider range of geometries to be investigated. Design rules for the member buckling resistance of elliptical hollow section columns have been proposed and verified by means of reliability analysis. The results presented are the first member <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> on elliptical hollow sections, and represent part of the development of comprehensive structural design rules for these sections. ...|$|R
40|$|Above ground liquid {{storage tanks}} have {{suffered}} serious damage during earthquakes. The damage of tanks {{can vary from}} local yielding or buckling of the tank wall, to loss of contents, or to collapse which leads to an unrepairable tank. Considerable work {{has been carried out}} on this problem with varying degree of success. However, the results are largely directed toward response rather than failure prediction. The information on failure mechanisms is very limited. The present work consists of scale model testing, correlation with existing analysis and failure prediction with laboratory verification. The scale model testing incorporates dynamic similarity of the fluid/structure interaction problem. The model study shows that small plastic models can be useful in studying the dynamics and buckling of liquid-filled tanks under ground excitation even though the model does not display complete similitude, The buckling criterion proposed in this study is based upon static considerations and the complex stress field in the shell wall is supplanted by a simple field for which analytical/ experimental results are available. Harmonic <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrate that the static buckling criterion is satisfactory even though the prebuckling stress field is time dependent, The harmonic <b>buckling</b> <b>tests,</b> when correlated with the stresses from a response analysis, also indicate that the buckling is largely dependent upon the n= 1 response, Transient <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> are also carried out and the results show that the linear analysis together with the static buckling criterion gives a good prediction of the failure of a full fluid-filled tank. The test parameters in these <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> include water depth, title angle, thickness of tank wall, top end condition, ground excitation pattern, etc. In addition, <b>buckling</b> <b>tests</b> of unanchored tanks are conducted to study the influence of changing the anchorage of the tank base. An analytical model is suggested to predict the response of an unanchored tank due to overturning moment. The current design criterion of an unanchored tank is also. assessed in this study.

Reduction of structural weight at safe design is one possibility {{to reach this}} objective which is aimed by the following two running research projects: the EC project “COCOMAT” and the ESA study “Probabilistic Aspects of Buckling Knock Down Factors”. These projects develop improved concepts and tools for a fast and reliable simulation of the buckling and the postbuckling behavior of thin-walled structures up to collapse, respectively, which allow the exploitation of considerable reserves in primary fibre composite structures in aerospace applications. For the validation of the concepts and tools, a sound database of experiments is needed which is also performed within these projects.

Comparisons of the experimentally experienced first (skin) buckling loads and collapse torques with finite element analyses predictions were found to be in good agreement for torsion and for axial compression.
