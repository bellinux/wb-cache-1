25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E

[...] He was a stand-up goaltender early in his career, but learned to adopt aspects of the butterfly style after watching them play. [...] Standing only [...] tall, he relied on speed and reflexes to be a successful goaltender in the NHL.|$|E

This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December {{to tell him that}} [...] "many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, as I believe you will have an [...] of.

500|$|Having {{attracted}} the attention of scouts from several clubs whilst playing for local youth team Scole Lads, O'Keefe was invited to train with Norwich City's under-nine team. However, he later signed a youth deal with their East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, joining the club at the age of nine, playing alongside Jordan Rhodes and Ed Upson in the academy during his time at the club. However, he failed to make an appearance for the first team and was released {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season after Ipswich decided against offering him a scholarship, believing that he would be unable to compete physically at under-18 level. O'Keefe later commented on his release [...] "It was disappointing to be released by Ipswich, especially since I had been there from such a young age, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> kept believing in myself".|$|E

500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> said that it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, you have got to do that,' and she was like 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|... and {{according}} to a press release from Universal Motown, the video has received critical acclaim with over twomillion Vevo views. When Robbie Daw of 'Idolator' saw the unfinished version of the video compared it to the earlier works of Janet Jackson saying it had [...] "old-school Janet vibe". Later after seeing the fully finished version {{he said it was}} [...] "a colorful, militant dance-off". The theme, wardrobe, and choreography also drew comparisons to Janet Jackson's [...] "Feedback" [...] video, with HitFix commenting [...] "Rowland even has Janet's singular and straight pony tail." [...] E! Online's Natalie Finn also had praise for the video. She said it [...] "takes the themes of the song: taking charge, owning the floor and staying sexy and feminine throughout..." [...] and [...] "dresses 'em in tight little outfits and turns 'em loose to break hearts and dominate the opposite sex at will." [...] "The music video is great and it might be a must-spin" [...] according to Martin from Above magazine, who praised Rowland's beauty by saying, [...] "I didn't know Kelly was that well-equipped from the back <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> found Kelly more attractive than Beyoncé ...

500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines.

500|$|While {{waiting for}} Lasers to be released, Fiasco {{completed}} another album, titled [...] [...] He was unsure if the Food and Liquor II {{would ever be}} released, though he released the song [...] "Go To Sleep" [...] from the record [...] "out of desperation" [...] to put out new music. He also pursued numerous side projects {{in the midst of}} the delay. [...] In April 2010, Fiasco formed the hip hop collective All City Chess Club along with Pharrell, Asher Roth, B.o.B, The Cool Kids, Charles Hamilton, Blu, Diggy Simmons, Wale, J. Cole, & Dosage. [...] The group has so far made one song, a remix of Fiasco's [...] "I'm Beamin". [...] Additionally, On July 16, 2010, Fiasco released his rock side-project Japanese Cartoon's debut EP In The Jaws of the Lords of Death. Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, [...] "I've always been a fan of all music...Hip hop is just something I actually know how to do <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had aspirations to participate in other forms of music. Once I got to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what am I going to do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap-dancing champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was 15, Zeta-Jones {{dropped out of school}} without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> got the job. I figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.|$|E

500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> like to think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
