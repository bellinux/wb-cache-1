40|$|Abstract—In an {{agent-based}} {{online auction}} system, a bidding agent can automatically place bids {{on behalf of}} a human user according to a user-specified <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy.</b> Current implementations of bidding agents only support a set of simple predefined <b>bidding</b> <b>strategies.</b> In this paper, we introduce a formal <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> model that supports specification of complex <b>bidding</b> <b>strategies</b> for autonomous <b>bidding</b> agents. The formal model is defined as a layered <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> model (LBSM), which can be represented using notations adapted from UML activity diagrams. For real-time and efficient reasoning, the formal model is converted into a rule-based <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> model (RBSM) represented in <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> language (BSL), which can be directly executed by a reasoning module of an autonomous bidding agent. We present an algorithm for converting an LBSM to a rule-based <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> model, and an algorithm to drive the reasoning engine. Finally, we develop a prototype agent-based online auction system using JADE, and demonstrate how layered <b>bidding</b> <b>strategies</b> can be precisely specified, and how our approach may support analysis of impacts on bidding histories by using different <b>bidding</b> <b>strategies</b> in agent-based online auctions.

Additionally, DCA believed that the extremely short window for evaluating the bids and selecting the winning registry operator provided for in the RFP demonstrates that the outcome was predetermined. The RFP gave the evaluators only seven days (five business days) to review the proposals and notify the winner, which is simply not enough time for any meaningful evaluation, particularly considering that the RFP asked for much of the same information as required in the ICANN gTLD application, which is evaluated over a period of six months or more. Moreover, the people who were invited to join the AUC DotAfrica Task Force had numerous conflicts of interest that should have precluded them from being involved in the AUC’s process of choosing the potential registry operator.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A “low-balling {{strategy}} ” by bidding contractors {{has increasingly}} {{been recognized as}} an important issue in public infrastructure procurement. Public works contracts are often imperfect and renegotiated after the contract award. Given the expectation for ex post adjustments, bidders seem motivated {{to take advantage of}} the low-balling strategy. This paper analyzes the endogeneity between the <b>bid</b> <b>strategy</b> and ex post adjustments. Using procurement data on rural road projects in Nepal, it shows that the <b>bid</b> <b>strategy</b> and adjustments are determined endogenously in the system. Anticipating cost and time overruns, firms would likely undercut normal bid prices. Then, ex post contract adjustments actually happen, because of their too aggressive bids. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{competitive}} electricity market, generation companies design <b>bidding</b> <b>strategies</b> {{to maximize their}} individual profits subject to the constraints imposed by bidding rules. For a generation company, obviously, the optimal <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> and hence the potential of exercising market power may be different if different bidding rules are employed.

Based on the widely used stepwise bidding rules, the impacts of different numbers of bidding segments on the <b>bidding</b> <b>strategies</b> of generation companies are investigated. This study is focused on a price-taker generation company in an electricity market. A probabilisic model is used to simulate electricity price in the competitive market environment.

40|$|This paper empirically {{considers}} {{the effect of}} horizontal subcontracting on firm bidding strategies in highway construction auctions.

While the practice of horizontal subcontracting may improve productive efficiency, serving as a horizontal subcontractor softens a firm’s <b>bid</b> <b>strategy,</b> since winning the auction may entail losing subcontracting business. To separately identify the effect of horizontal subcontracting on bid strategies from its correlation with firm costs, I use detailed item-level unit prices charged for the same items by the bidder and the firms to which it supplies those items. Each additional competitor supplied by the firm is estimated to increase its bid by 1. 4 percent, consistent with horizontal subcontracting softening bid strategies. Despite this, the winning bid is virtually identical between auctions with and without horizontal subcontracting. This result, along with the characteristics of firms chosen as horizontal subcontractors, points toward an efficiency motive for cross-supply rather than an attempt to soften competition...|$|E
40|$|The paper readdresses the post-award {{adjustment}} {{problem in}} infrastructure procurement. Cost overruns and project delays {{have long been}} chronic difficulties in implementing infrastructure projects. Too many ex post adjustments not only incur significant adaptation costs to contractors but also undermine efficiency, credibility and predictability of the budget execution. The paper analyzes the case of public road procurement in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is found that if large post-award amendments are anticipated, bidders are likely to reflect them to their bids systematically. Under the perfect foresight assumption, one dollar of anticipated contract adjustment would decrease the <b>bid</b> <b>strategy</b> by 7 cents; the effect seems to be offset largely by the incurred adaptation cost to contractors, which is estimated at 93 cents per one dollar of contract adjustment. Therefore, the ex post adaptation approach is much costly, {{and it may be}} better to formulate the accurate budget on a more solid basis and use the agreed contract as high-powered incentives to contractors.

40|$|US Aerospace Defense Vehicle Manufacturer (UADVM) sells Assembled Complex Equipment to the US Government through multi-year contracts. According to the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA), such {{government}} defense contracts require {{cost and}} pricing data {{as well as}} supporting documentation, known as material substantiation, to justify pricing and supplier selection. In order to comply with these government regulations, UADVM needed to estimate material costs provided by its supply chain, in {{a process known as}} multi-year procurement process. At UADVM, this process involved substantial time, effort, and rework. Through interviews and surveys, total administrative effort to manage the Multi-Year X (MYX) Procurement Process is estimated to be about 41 full-time equivalents (FTEs) per year for three years, translating to an estimated fully loaded cost of $ 17. 3 million. In order to significantly improve the current process, a key area of opportunity is to reduce the complexity of the entire process through 1) reducing the number of inputs, including the number of parts and bids sent out as well as suppliers and price points solicited, and 2) improving the design of the <b>bid</b> <b>strategy,</b> the determination of which parts are bid out to which suppliers, how to group these suppliers and parts into bids, and who should manage these bids in the most efficient and effective manner. Through the analysis of UADVM's MYX data, input reduction can potentially reduce the number of price points solicited by 99. 2 % and the number of interactions, also known as the number of unique combinations between parts, bids, and suppliers, by approximately 94 %. These efforts can be complemented by an improved <b>bid</b> <b>strategy</b> {{through the use of a}} data-driven mixed integer linear programming optimization model, which, in tests on a sub-portion of the data, reduces the number of packages by 43 %. These methods and analyses for complexity reduction can be generalized beyond current applications at UADVM, aerospace companies, and government proposals; they may be applied to any procurement process where multiple parts, suppliers, and bids are involved. by Jerry Kao Chiang.

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{optimizing}} energy bids for a photovoltaic (PV) power producer taking part into a competitive electricity market characterized by financial penalties for generation shortfall and surplus. The optimal <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> depends on the statistics of the PV power generation and on the monetary penalties applied. We show how to tune the <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> {{on the basis of}} the weather forecasts. To this purpose, an optimization procedure is devised to mitigate the risk associated with the intermittent nature of PV generation and maximize the expected profit of the producer. We also investigate an approach to properly take into account the seasonal variation and non stationary nature of PV power generation statistics, by exploiting the knowledge of the amount of energy that the plant can generate under clear-sky conditions. The proposed <b>bidding</b> <b>strategy</b> is validated on a real data set from an Italian PV plant.
