5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{effort was}} focused upon selecting and identifying {{the officers and}} NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for amongst units that had already formed {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and from new recruits. At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham, where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion. Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did not have more than two children of similar ages.|$|E
5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.|$|E

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

25|$|Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic foreign {{minister}} Akaki Chkhenkeli had previously ordered {{the city to}} surrender at first contact with the Ottomans, doing so without the notice of the Armenian members of his coalition government; while not followed, the order threw the defenders into confusion and partly caused the exodus of thousands of civilians {{before and during the}} siege. Independent of this, it was clear to all involved that the Armenians, surrounded, outnumbered, and cut off from relief, could not hold the city indefinitely. As a result, the garrison scrambled for a way to negotiate their way out without having to fight for the city. The Ottomans agreed to let the garrison peacefully exit the city, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would surrender the entire fortress and its armory intact. General Nazarbekov, the Armenian Corps Commander based in Yerevan acting through a French intermediary, agreed to the surrender of the city and its garrison on April 25 1918. At the same time the batteries surrounding the city were occupied and in the evening a regiment from the Ottoman I Caucasian Corps entered into the city and took it under control. The Ottomans obtained 11,000 rifles, 2 million bullets, 67 cannons, and 19 machine guns from the surrender.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transitional}} {{dynamics of the}} Burdett and Mortensen (1998) equilibrium search model. Our exercise provides the first analysis of aggregate dynamics of a popular class of search wage-posting models. We assume that firms offer and commit to time-dependent wage contracts. We show that, when all firms have the same productivity, they post different time-dependent contracts, paying workers a higher value the larger is the initial size of the firm. That is, equilibrium exhibits a Rank-Preserving property. The same property holds in equilibrium when firms have heterogeneous productivity, where more productive firms offer a larger value and employ more workers at all points in time, <b>if</b> (<b>but</b> not <b>only</b> <b>if)</b> <b>they</b> have more employees to begin with.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether adult kidney papillary label-retaining cells (pLRCs) are specialized precursors, we analyzed their transcription profile. Among genes overexpressed in pLRCs, we selected candidate genes to perform qPCR and immunodetection of their encoded proteins.

Post tamoxifen, Zfyve 27 -CreERT 2 marked cells preferentially {{located in the}} upper part of the papilla. These cells were low cycling and did not generate progeny even after long-term observation, thus they did not appear to contribute to kidney homeostasis.
