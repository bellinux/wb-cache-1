40|$|Molecular phylogenetic analysis, {{morphology}} and pathogenicity to {{citrus fruit}} {{were used to}} study two isolates of Elsinoe australis associated with scab-like symptoms on a fruit of Citrus australasica (finger lime) and Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) in Australia. In addition to being associated with finger lime, the isolate from finger lime could cause scab symptoms on C. x aurantium cv. Murcott tangor in pathogenicity tests, but could not cause scab symptoms on the other orange, mandarin, lemon or grapefruit tested. Pathogenicity tests also support previous studies showing the isolate from jojoba could not produce symptoms on fruit of C. natsudaidai.

25|$|If {{an unusual}} <b>black</b> <b>scab</b> (eschar) {{develops}} {{at the site}} of a tick bite, or if there are any other signs of illness occurring within a few weeks of a tick bite (especially 'flu-like' symptoms, fever, generalised skin rash, muscular or joint pain), it is recommended that a doctor be consulted and informed about the tick bite – a Rickettsial infection (Rickettsia australis, or Rickettsia honei) may be the cause. Whilst many such Rickettsial infections are self-limiting, early treatment with antibiotics can prevent longer-term problems in some individuals. Doctors in Australia may also wish to investigate the possibility of a Lyme-like disease, particularly if there is also a 'bullseye' or 'target' shaped skin rash (known as erythema migrans).|$|R

The authors describe an autopsied case of scrub typhus complicated with severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). An 82 -year-old man complained of fever 4 [*]days after climbing a mountain. The patient was admitted to an urban hospital, and meropenem and ceftriaxone were administered. The patient's condition deteriorated and he was transferred to a second hospital. On physical examination, a <b>black</b> <b>scab</b> was found and scrub typhus was suspected.

Rather than primarily supporting black workers or attempting to unite black and white workers (as the IWW had done in the United States), the SAIF sought to establish quotas for whites in well-paying jobs, and fought with defensive strikes when the quotes were broken as employers used (primarily <b>black)</b> <b>scab</b> labour to undermine the more highly-paid white workforce. This stance was exemplified by one of the white miners' slogans, [...] "Workers of the World, Unite and Fight for a White South Africa". The IWW in the United States resoundingly condemned the SAIF's efforts at [...] "white" [...] unionism and compared it to the American Federation of Labor's efforts to maintain a white [...] "labor aristocracy" [...] in the United States.

40|$|Citrus {{exports to}} foreign markets are {{severely}} limited today by fruit diseases. Some of them, like citrus canker, <b>black</b> spot and <b>scab,</b> are quarantine for the markets. For this reason, {{it is important}} to perform strict controls before fruits are exported to avoid the inclusion of citrus affected by them. Nowadays, technical decisions are based on visual diagnosis of human experts, highly dependent on the degree of individual skills. This work presents a model capable of automatic recognize the quarantine diseases. It is based on the combination of a feature selection method and a classifier that has been trained on quarantine illness symptoms. Citrus samples with citrus canker, <b>black</b> spot, <b>scab</b> and other diseases were evaluated. Experimental work was performed on 212 samples of mandarins from a Nova cultivar. The proposed approach achieved a classification rate of quarantine/not-quarantine samples of over 83 % for all classes, even when using a small subset (14) of all the available features (90). The results obtained show that the proposed method can be suitable for helping the task of citrus visual diagnosis, in particular, quarantine diseases recognition in fruits. Fil: Stegmayer, Georgina.

40|$|A 48 -year-old farmer, with {{a history}} of type 2 diabetes, {{hypertension}} and hypercholesterolaemia, presented to the local hospital with fever, malaise and inflamed lesions on his hands and arms. He reported that about 5 weeks before his presentation at hospital, he had grazed his arms while clearing the loading auger on a grain harvester on his property in south-western New South Wales. Within days of the initial injury, pimples appeared at the grazed sites and these developed into larger inflamed lesions over the following weeks. He reported that during this time he scratched one lesion and pus was released. The patient was admitted and commenced on intravenous flucloxacillin with a provisional diagnosis of cellulitis. Cutaneous anthrax was not considered as a diagnosis. Oral erythromycin was added to his treatment the following day. Swabs from the lesions were collected on the day of admission and sent to the local laboratory for routine culture. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, as well as a Bacillus species, which was thought to be a wound contaminant. Two days after admission, a nurse at the hospital noted the appearance of the lesions and discussed the patient with infectious disease control officers in the population health unit. The nurse provided photographs, and the characteristic appearance of the lesions in a farmer from the anthrax belt raised the suspicion of cutaneous anthrax. (Figure) The centres of the lesions were depressed and some had formed <b>black</b> <b>scabs.</b> The surrounding tissue was red and oedematous with extensive swelling. These were noted as characteristic features of cutaneous anthrax eschars. 1 The local laboratory then performed a gram stain of the Bacillus sp. This suggested Bacillus anthracis, and the isolate was forwarded the following day to the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research. The appearance of the lesions in a farmer from an anthrax-prone area and the Gram stain of the organism led to a provisional diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax.

40|$|Plant {{diseases}} must {{be managed}} to successfully and reliably produce crops to meet humanity’s growing food, fiber, feed, and fuel needs. Plant disease management relies on {{many different types}} of tools—from disease-resistant plant varieties and pesticides to cultural and biological strategies. Agricultural Research Service scientists are seeking new methods of managing plant diseases, more efficient means of using older methods, and combinations of these methods. Two of the oldest ways of reducing plant diseases are crop rotation and organic amendments to soil. In Orono, Maine, for example, ARS scientists are evaluating a holistic approach to suppressing soilborne pathogens of potato, including 2 - and 3 -year rotations with barley, ryegrass, canola, and rapeseed. In one study, the regimen reduced the incidence of Rhizoctonia by as much as 50 percent. They also examined the effectiveness of biological soil amendments, such as compost tea (compost steeped in water) and cover crops of winter rye, against various types of <b>scab,</b> <b>black</b> scurf, and other potato diseases. (See story in the next issue.) Historically, heat has been used to rid plants of some pathogens—at temperatures and durations that won’t damage the plants in the process. Indeed, in Fort Pierce, Florida, ARS researchers are evaluating such a method to rid citrus seedlings of the bacterial agent that causes Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as “citrus greening. ” The citrus disease has caused serious economic losses in the “Sunshine State” and in other citrus-growing regions of the world for decades. The disease weakens, and can eventually kill, afflicted trees as well as render their fruit unmarketable...|$|R
40|$|Potato is {{the third}} most {{important}} food crop {{in the world with}} production exceeding 320 million tonnes per year. Major soilborne diseases of concern to the Australian potato industry include common <b>scab,</b> powdery <b>scab,</b> <b>black</b> scurf and the post-harvest disease tuber soft rot. These diseases have negative impacts on the French fry potato processing sector where the cultivar ‘Russet Burbank’ is the most important commercial cultivar used. Common scab is caused by infection of developing tubers with Streptomyces spp. Previous research has developed common scab resistant somaclonal variants of Russet Burbank using a somatic cell-selection breeding technique, with the pathogens toxin (thaxtomin A) used as a positive selective agent. The current study involved determining the breadth and possible mechanism of resistance of these novel variants of Russet Burbank to other important tuber diseases such as powdery scab caused by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea (a protozoan), black scurf caused by Rhizoctonia solani (a fungus), tuber soft rot caused by Pectobacterium atrosepticum and P. carotovorum (both bacteria species). This study also involved measurement of Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea root infection and developing model systems to track infection and provide an early indication of putative controls which may improve management options for powdery scab. A series of glasshouse experiments, field trials and in vitro assays were conducted to challenge five common scab resistant variants of c. v. Russet Burbank against Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea, R. solani, P. atrosepticum and P. caratovorum. Pathogen inoculation techniques, sequential harvest and modified disease assessment methods were followed to evaluate the concurrent resistance level to these pathogens compared to the parent cultivar. Trial results identified three variants expressing tuber resistance to these pathogens, the clone A 380 showed 66...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} of the potato industry for high quality healthy tubers is well established and blemish diseases are therefore of particular concern. In recent years, quantitative molecular diagnostic assays based on real-time PCR {{have been developed for}} many pests and pathogens of potato. These diagnostic assays are now being used as tools to study outstanding questions in the epidemiology of potato diseases including blemish diseases such as <b>black</b> dot, powdery <b>scab</b> and <b>black</b> scurf and storage rots caused by Fusarium spp. Examples of various investigations designed to examine the relative contribution of seed- and soil-borne inoculum in causing disease on progeny tubers and the effect of environmental factors on the incidence and severity of disease are described. To enable real-time PCR diagnostic assays to be used not only for research purposes, but also more directly in the management of potato diseases, diagnostic results must be associated with factors affecting the risk of disease. Therefore, a comprehensive system of soil and seed tuber sampling, testing and disease monitoring has been initiated in a project funded by the British Potato Council to validate these assays and enable results to be translated into disease risk. Some of the techniques employed in this validation, and results of experiments focusing on black dot (Colletotrichum coccodes), are presented. The refinement of a direct soil DNA extraction method and the detection and quantification of target DNA in both seed and progeny tubers are described. Consideration is given to the development of appropriate diagnostic assays, their use in conjunction with relevant and robust sampling techniques and a direct soil DNA extraction method, and the interpretation of results to inform disease risk assessment and control strategies through collaboration with the potato industry. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R
40|$|Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira, Unit of Seed Testing and Organic Production Control is {{responsible}} of the seed potato {{inspection and testing}} in Finland. The seed potato production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The seed potato production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} seed potato is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of basic seed (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The seed potato inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the seed potato production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of seed potato production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the seed potato production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during seed potato certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other seed classes the potato virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified seed potato class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The seed potato companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common <b>scab,</b> <b>black</b> scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the seed potato lot is officially certified and can be marketed as seed potato to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R
