5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E

25|$|I was 25 {{years old}} and {{pursuing}} my doctorate in economics when I was allowed to spend six months of post-graduate studies in Naples, Italy. I read the Western economic textbooks and also the more general work of people like Hayek. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> returned to Czechoslovakia, I had {{an understanding of the}} principles of the market. In 1968, I was glad at the political liberalism of the Dubcek Prague Spring, but was very critical of the Third Way they pursued in economics.|$|E

I was reading about all these other records that I was getting excited about - like Public Enemy using a sampler in the studio - and I just decided I wanted to do a bit of a U-turn." [...] Afterwards, they hired Scottish singer Shirley Manson and began composing together.|$|R

25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
500|$|After his 34th {{birthday}} on August 6, 2003, {{he gave up}} alcohol, caffeine, red meat, {{refined sugar}} and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: [...] "I gave the script to him, then he dropped {{off the face of}} the earth [...] he went through his whole crazy time, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on the Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music." ...|$|E

I wrote the verses first, as well as the melody and the inclusion of several instrumentals. Sometimes I'll have an idea for a lyrics. If I'm collaborating with someone, I'll direct them in the direction that I'm going chord wise, because I get all these melody ideas and then I lose them if I don't have someone really good with the keyboard with me. That's why I tend to collaborate because I lose the ideas <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> figure out the chord. All these melody ideas just go." ...|$|E

500|$|Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University, in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major. He also minored in art, {{and claimed}} that [...] " [...] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt." [...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So we were working on our second issue <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw it. It {{was going to be a}} matter of somehow trying to restage the entire first issue, because it was a very similar coma opening. I made a decision—which I pretty much regret at this point—I said, 'You know what? It's so different , I will probably never hear anything about this.' And I was wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in {{her writing}} career she began {{alternating}} {{the publication of}} an autobiography and a volume of poetry. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> Shall Not Be Moved was published in 1990, she had published five autobiographies, eventually going on to publish seven. [...] Her publisher, [...] Random House, placed the poems in I Shall Not Be Moved in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. [...] Also in the 1994 collection were her four previous collections, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975), And Still I Rise (1978), and Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983). [...] Angelou's publisher placed four poems in a smaller volume entitled [...] Phenomenal Woman in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|The gates {{were opened}} at 11:30am as advertised, {{three and a}} half hours before the match was due to begin, and until 1:00pm the flow of people into the stadium was orderly. By 1:00pm, however, a vast number of people were pouring into the stadium, and after an {{inspection}} by the stadium authorities, the decision was made to close the gates at 1:45pm. [...] Spectator William Rose said later that Olympic Way was [...] "seething with people" [...] and that [...] "the nearer I got to the stadium the worse it got, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got there the turnstiles had been closed". Although the information was relayed to various railway stations, thousands of people continued to arrive and mass outside the gates. [...] Organisation within the stadium was poor, and in his report on the match the correspondent for the Daily Mail described the stewarding as [...] "useless" [...] and stated that officials in and around the stadium [...] "seemed to know nothing". Fans were not directed to any specific area, and the tiers in the lower half of the stadium filled up much faster than those higher up.|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{noted that}} Half-Blood Prince {{contained}} a darker tone {{than the previous}} Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp considered the first half to contain a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending. The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, [...] "lightness [...] slimmer than ever in this darkening series... a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was {{two-thirds of the way}} through". She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London, as it was [...] "brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living character as any other". Christopher Paolini called the darker tone [...] "disquieting" [...] because it was so different from the earlier books. Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was [...] "far darker" [...] but [...] "leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue". She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event. David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the [...] "darkness as a sign of our paranoid times" [...] and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts, as a resemblance to our world.|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
