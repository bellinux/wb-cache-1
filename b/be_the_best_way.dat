After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing Myst and 7th Guest in the mid-1990s, whereupon he decided a first person adventure game would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to tell the manuscript's story.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Turkish Empire {{entered the}} First World War {{on the side}} of the Central Powers on 31 October 1914. The {{stalemate}} of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere, particularly Turkey, could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of winning the war. From February 1915 this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles, but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary. To that end, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton. Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula, which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople, in the hope that would convince the Turks to ask for an armistice.|$|E

5|$|The third {{counter-insurgency}} {{operation in}} Kozara was undertaken {{at the end}} of November 1941 by about 19,000 Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and Germans. The Partisans emerged from the operation without significant losses, though NDH propaganda claimed that the rebels in Kozara were destroyed and that Stojanović had been killed. The Kozara Partisans never repeated the mistake of frontal resistance. When stronger enemy forces advanced toward them, they manoeuvred to position themselves behind the attackers, thus avoiding battles they could not win. The Partisans therefore did not defend villages. During the third counter-insurgency operation, the Ustaše and Germans killed hundreds of Serb civilians in the villages, resulting in a loss of support for the Partisans among the population. Stojanović thought that a significant victory over the enemy would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to restore the lost support.|$|E
5|$|Entering the presidency, Garfield {{had little}} foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine. Blaine, a former protectionist, now agreed with Garfield {{on the need}} to promote freer trade, {{especially}} within the Western Hemisphere. Their reasons were twofold: firstly, Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with Latin America would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to keep Great Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity. Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital, Lima, rejected any settlement that restored the previous status quo. Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar. Garfield also considered enhancing the United States' military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization. In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated. Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference. Naval reform continued under Arthur, if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending {{in the construction of the}} Squadron of Evolution.|$|E

25|$|Factional {{conflict}} dominated Iranian economic politics {{under the}} Ayatollah Khomeini from 1979 to 1989. The two principal factions were a statist-reformist group that favored state {{control of the}} economy and a conservative group that favored the private sector. Both factions claimed Khomeini's support, but by 1987, he clearly had sided with the statist-reformists because he believed state capitalism to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of heading off any threat to Islam. Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989 left the factions without their source of legitimation.|$|E

25|$|There {{are ways}} in which {{autoimmunity}} caused by molecular mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination {{seems to be the}} most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this {{has been shown to be}} ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.|$|E

Along with learning the new Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), Collins received helicopter training, as these were thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to simulate the landing approach of the LM. After the completion of Project Gemini, it was decided to cancel the Apollo 2 flight, since it would just repeat the Apollo 1 flight. In the process of crews being reassigned, Collins was moved to the CMP position on the Apollo 8 prime crew, since his new crew was Borman, Collins and William Anders. Deke Slayton had decided that the CMP should have some spaceflight experience, something that Anders did not have. Three years later, this change would be the reason Collins orbited the Moon while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on its surface.|$|E

25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
