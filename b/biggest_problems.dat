5|$|One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> for filming is the {{environmental}} impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of}} the first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The <b>biggest</b> <b>problems,</b> however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{facing the}} early power {{companies}} was the hourly variable demand.

25|$|The 2012–13 Los Angeles Lakers {{season was}} the 65th {{season of the}} franchise, its 64th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and its 53rd season in Los Angeles. The Lakers {{acquired}} All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, giving them a starting lineup of five All-Stars consisting of Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Metta World Peace, Nash, and Howard, who were expected to contend for the franchise's 17th NBA championship, hoping to tie with their rivals, the Boston Celtics, for the most NBA Championships. Instead, the Lakers struggled {{to qualify for the}} playoffs after changing head coaches and implementing multiple offenses. However, a weak defense and multiple injuries were the team's <b>biggest</b> <b>problems.</b> They exited the playoffs in the first round {{for the first time since}} 2007.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{was that}} the three button Xerox mouse cost over US$400 to build, which was not {{practical}} for a consumer-based personal computer. Apple commissioned Hovey-Kelley Design (which later became IDEO) to assist them with the mouse design, which not only had to be redesigned to cost US$25 instead of US$400, but also needed to be tested with real consumers outside a laboratory setting to learn how people were willing to use it. Hundreds of prototypes later, Apple settled on a single button mouse, {{roughly the size of}} a deck of cards. With the design complete, the operating system was adapted to interface with the single button design using keystrokes in combination with button clicks to recreate some of the features desired from the original Xerox three-button design.|$|E
25|$|William A. Prestre, a Swiss citizen {{living in}} Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{proposed}} using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced {{the military to}} lease an entire island in the Mississippi River to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train {{as many as two}} million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{is the nature}} of the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899 took Hedley to South Africa with 17 Field Company. One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> facing the British {{was the lack of}} suitable maps, so his surveying experience was in demand. He arrived in South Africa in November 1899, he was present at the Relief of Ladysmith, and was Mentioned in Despatches in a despatch dated 30 March 1900, though this was not gazetted until February 1901. The same Gazette carried a further Mention in a despatch dated 9 November 1900. He had been hospitalised earlier in 1900, and was discharged to return to duty in the week ending 18 May 1900. He received a third Mention in September 1901 for service up to April 1901. On 9 July 1901 he left Port Natal on the transport City of Cambridge which was due to arrive at Southampton on 3 August. His obituary in The Times records that he served in the Boer War until 1902, so he may have returned at a later date. In September 1901 it was gazetted that he had received brevet promotion to major for his South African service on 29 November 1900; substantive promotion to that rank came on 18 January 1902. He also received the Queen's South Africa Medal, with six clasps, for his service during the Boer War.|$|E

500|$|Justin Pacheco of The Good 5 Cent Cigar {{compared}} it to [...] "I Don't Believe You", saying, [...] " [...] exemplifies the sappy ballad [...] and would not seem out of place being sung by any other big pop singer.

Patrick Ferrucci of the New Haven Register commented in the album review that [...] "She does get a little wishy-washy though, going from tunes like 'Mean' and 'It's All Your Fault' to 'Please Don't Leave Me' and 'Glitter in the Air'". He also added that the high points of Funhouse were the four tracks produced by Max Martin. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine stated {{that one of the}} <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> in Funhouse was its songwriting, saying, [...] "'Glitter in the Air,' with its emo-esque [...] "You called me sugar" [...] bridge, is overwrought with its clichéd imagery".|$|E
500|$|Dan Casey {{writing for}} Nerdist felt the episode was [...] "the most dramatic, tense hour of {{television}} we’ve seen from" [...] the series, stating that [...] "One of the show’s <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{has been its}} general lack of depth, particularly {{in terms of the}} characters and making them feel like real people rather than glossy superspies with a seemingly endless wellspring of one-liners" [...] and decided that the episode [...] "made significant steps towards fixing this problem, thanks to some wonderful character interactions and an exploration of Fitz/Simmons’ past". James Hunt of Den of Geek said [...] "whether this episode continues the show's upwards trend, that's debatable. It could've been worse, but there wasn't the leap forward that we saw from episode three to four, or four to five. I'll say this for an episode: it was better than I thought a Fitz & Simmons episode would be. That's progress, of a sort." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., criticized the scope and scale of the episode, but praised the character development for Coulson, feeling it brought his character closer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of the comics.|$|E
