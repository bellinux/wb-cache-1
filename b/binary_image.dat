5|$|Data URIs: The actual {{images that}} form the eyes are encoded as data URIs, which allow {{multimedia}} to be embedded in web pages rather than stored as a separate file. Acid2 tests the most common case, where a <b>binary</b> <b>image</b> is base64-encoded into text and then that encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page. Although the IETF published the data URI specification in 1998, they never formally adopted it as a standard. Nonetheless, the HTML 4.01 specification references the data URI scheme, and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers.|$|E
5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a <b>binary</b> <b>image,</b> and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Data hiding is a {{technique}} used to embed a sequence of bits in a host image with small visual deterioration {{and the means to}} extract it afterwards. Reversible data hiding allows, in addition, recovering the original cover-image exactly. Several reversible data hiding techniques have been developed but very few of them are appropriate for <b>binary</b> <b>images.</b> This paper proposes a reversible data hiding technique for <b>binary</b> <b>images.</b> This technique uses the Golomb code to compress prediction errors of low-visibility pixels, using its neighborhood as side information, to obtain the space to store the hidden data. The proposed technique is then used to reversibly authenticate <b>binary</b> <b>images,</b> including texts, drawings and halftones. All <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> we tested could be authenticated using the proposed technique, except unrealistically small or random images.

40|$|As we {{are moving}} to a digital world, digital {{document}} image processing is receiving more and more attention. Digital document <b>images</b> are essentially <b>binary</b> <b>images.</b> In applications related to <b>binary</b> document <b>images,</b> such as data hiding and watermarking in <b>binary</b> <b>images,</b> distortion may be present and {{it is necessary to}} measure the distortion for performance comparison.

In this paper, we present a novel objective distortion measure for <b>binary</b> document <b>images</b> that well correlates to the subjective distortion perception. This measure is based on the reciprocal of distance that is straightforward to calculate. Our results show that the proposed distortion measure matches well with subjective evaluation found on human visual perception. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we explore {{black-and-white}} (two-valued) images. These {{are easier to}} acquire, store, and process than images in which many brightness levels are represented. However, since <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> encode only information about the silhouette of an object, they are useful only in restricted situations. We discuss the conditions that must be satisfied for the successful application of binary image-processing techniques. In this chapter we concentrate on simple geometric properties such as image area, position, and orientation. These quantities are useful in directing the interaction of a mechanical manipulator with a part, for example. Other aspects of <b>binary</b> <b>images,</b> such as methods for iterative modification, are explored in the next chapter. Since images contain {{a great deal of}} information, issues of representation become important. We show that the geometric properties of interest can be computed from projections of <b>binary</b> <b>images.</b> These projections are a great deal easier to store and to process. In much of this chapter we deal with continuous <b>binary</b> <b>images,</b> where a characteristic function is either zero or one at every point in the image plane. This makes the presentation simpler; but when we use a digital computer, the image must be divided into picture cells.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} make image {{analysis}} methods more reliable {{it is important to}} analyse to what extend shape information is preserved during image digitization. Most existing approaches to this problem con-sider topology preservation and are restricted to ideal <b>binary</b> <b>images.</b> We extend these results in two ways. First, we characterize the set of <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> which can be correctly digitized by both regular and irregular sampling grids, such that not only topology is preserved but also the Hausdorff distance between the original image and the reconstruction is bounded. Second, we prove an analogous theorem for gray scale images that arise from blurring of <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> with a certain filter type. These results are steps towards a theory of shape digitization applicable to real optical systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Secret {{data hiding}} in <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> is more {{difficult}} than other formats since <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> require only one bit representation to indicate black and white. This study proposes a new method for data hiding in <b>binary</b> <b>images</b> using optimized bit position to replace a secret bit. This method manipulates blocks, which are sub-divided. The parity bit for a specified block decides whether to change or not, to embed a secret bit. By finding {{the best position to}} insert a secret bit for each divided block, the image quality of the resulting stego-image can be improved, while maintaining low computational complexity. The experimental results show that the proposed method has an improvement with respect to a previous work. Comment: 4 Pages,Implemented in Jav...|$|R
