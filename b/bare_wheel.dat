40|$|We {{present a}} {{versatile}} experimental apparatus for exploring rotational motion through {{the interplay between}} the moment of inertia, torque and rotational kinetic energy. The heart of this experiment uses a 3 D printed wheel along with easily accessible stock components that allow for the adjustment of moment of inertial while keeping the total mass of the wheel constant. The wheel {{can act as a}} massive pulley of variable moment of inertia that allows students to measure the moment of inertia of the <b>bare</b> <b>wheel</b> by applying a constant torque to the system. The wheel {{can also be used to}} explore rotational kinetic energy in the form of races down ramps. The 3 D printed aspect of this wheel allows anyone with access to a 3 D printer to create, explore, and modify this wheel at a low cost allowing for more flexibility and accessibility for student and instructor exploration and modification...|$|E
5000|$|Coupé HF (Tipo 818.140): 1966-67. Competition {{version of}} the coupé {{introduced}} later in 1965, fitted with a tuned {{version of the}} 1,216 cc engine producing [...] at 6,000 rpm. Bodywork was lightened by removing the bumpers, using an aluminium bonnet, doors and boot lid, Plexiglas side and rear windows, and <b>bare</b> steel <b>wheels</b> without hubcaps.|$|R
50|$|One {{technical}} {{feature is the}} Buchli drive, in which the motors drive the driving wheels on one side only via outside gears; {{the other side is}} not driven. As a result, an E 16 has an asymmetric appearance. On one side you can see the Buchli drive, on the other just the <b>bare</b> spoked <b>wheels.</b> The E 16 is the only German locomotive class with Buchli drives.|$|R
60|$|You get to Versailles--as {{the best}} of various ways of transport--by means of a {{contrivance}} something between a train and a street car. It has a little puffing steam-engine and two cars--double deckers--with the top deck open to the air {{and covered with a}} wooden roof on rods. The lower part inside is called the first-class and a seat in it costs ten cents extra. Otherwise nobody would care to ride in it. The engine is a quaint little thing and wears a skirt, painted green, all around it, so that you can just see the tips of its wheels peeping modestly out below. It was a great relief to me to see this engine. It showed {{that there is such a}} thing as French delicacy after all. There are so many sights along the boulevards that bring the carmine blush to the face of the tourist (from the twisting of his neck in trying to avoid seeing them), that it is well to know that the French draw the line somewhere. The sight of the <b>bare</b> <b>wheels</b> of an engine is too much for them.|$|R
500|$|The pre-title {{sequence}} has a {{scene where}} Bond flies a nimble homebuilt Bede BD-5J aircraft through an open hangar. Hollywood stunt pilot and aerial co-ordinator J.W. [...] "Corkey" [...] Fornof, who piloted the aircraft at more than 150 miles per hour, has said, [...] "Today, few directors would consider such a stunt. They'd just whip {{it up in a}} computer lab." [...] Having collapsible wings, the plane was shown hidden in a horse trailer; however, a dummy was used for this shot. Filming inside the hangar was achieved by attaching the aircraft to an old Jaguar car with a steel pole, driving with the roof removed. The second unit were able to add enough obstacles including people and objects inside the hangar to hide the car and the pole and make it look as though Moore was flying inside the base. For the explosion after the mini jet escapes, however, a miniature of the hangar was constructed and filmed up close. The exploding pieces of the hangar were in reality only four inches in length. Bond stole a Mercedes-Benz saloon car at a depot manned by antagonist soldiers, then as he tried to escape drove over barrier spikes which shredded his tyres. So he maneuvered his vehicle's <b>bare</b> <b>wheels</b> onto the rails to pursue the train. During filming, the car had intact tyres in one scene so as to avoid any mishap.|$|R
50|$|The 4900 Series is {{the most}} common Western Star model and {{features}} a 123 in BBC. This is a multi-use truck/tractor which is targeted at a variety of industries. The truck can be built as a tractor with fifth <b>wheel,</b> <b>bare</b> chassis for a bodybuilder to outfit, or a lowered-cab model (Low Max) for auto hauling. The 4900 is available in five configurations including Extreme Duty and Twin Steer.|$|R
50|$|Traditional wooden coaster {{track is}} built on site. It is mounted layer-by-layer to the support structure, bent and {{smoothed}} to the proper shape, and mounted with steel running plates. Prefabricated track, on the other hand, is manufactured in a factory. It is made of many thin layers of wood that are glued together and then laser cut to the exact shape needed. The track is made in 25 ft sections, which have special joints on the ends {{that allow them to}} snap together. This process allows for far higher precision than could never be achieved by hand. In addition, the trains for a prefabricated wooden coaster have wheels with polyurethane treads, just like a steel coaster. In contrast, traditional wooden coaster trains have <b>bare</b> metal <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Late in the Imperial period, the Romans {{might have}} experimented {{with an unusual}} variant {{of the idea that}} called for cataphract-style lancers to sit on a pair or a single horse drawing a [...] "chariot" [...] reduced to a <b>bare</b> axle with <b>wheels,</b> where the blades were only lowered into the {{fighting}} position at the last moment. This would have facilitated manoeuvring before battle. This at least is a reasonable interpretation of the rather enigmatic de Rebus Bellicis section 12-14. (Most probably the dual-horse version was a practical weapon which inspired the single-horse version as an underpowered paper innovation by the armchair author of this text.) ...|$|R
60|$|You know, perhaps, what a toy {{engine is}} like. It has the general {{appearance}} of a railway engine; funnels, buffers, cab, and so forth. All these are very elegant things, no doubt; {{but they do not}} make for lightness, they do not facilitate hill-climbing. Now, sometimes an engine gets its clockwork out of order, and then it is over and done for; but sometimes it is merely the outer semblance that is injured--the funnel bent, the body twisted. You remove the things and, behold! you have <b>bare</b> clockwork on <b>wheels,</b> an apparatus of almost malignant energy, soul without body, a kind of metallic rage. This it was that our junior member instantly knew for a 'lectric, and loved from the moment of its stripping.|$|R
40|$|Impingement of {{grinding}} fluid {{deep into}} grinding zone {{is a challenge}} due to presence of air layer around the grinding wheel. This paper presents experimental observation on air boundary layer formed around a rotating grinding wheel, a rexine-cloth covered grinding wheel and a solid disc. The effect of porous and rough grinding wheel surface towards strengthening air boundary layer has been studied. Modeling {{has been done to}} estimate variation of air pressure within this boundary layer. Out of three different methods of extrapolation done, the most suitable one is suggested. Results obtained using three different wheels are compared. A scraper board is also employed to observe reduction of air pressure. Higher value of air pressure is noted in case of <b>bare</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> than that in other conditions. Use of scraper board along with rexine-covered wheel is found to reduce air pressure to a large extent such that it becomes close to air pressure noted around the solid wheel. It shows the beneficial effect of using scraper board and rexine-pasted wheel to suppress air layer effectively. Correspondingly, grinding fluid is expected to reach deep into the grinding zone thereby rendering better control of grinding temperature, and hence, better grinding performance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the painting}} is suggestive of the Old Testament through {{the presence of the}} prophets in reverential attitudes. In the vault portion of the apse, the Epiphany or Adoration of the Magi is represented, with Mary, Jesus, and the three eastern kings <b>baring</b> gifts. <b>Wheels</b> of fire from Jehovah’s chariot are depicted in the lower register, conforming to Ezekiel’s vision. [...] To the right and left are the archangels Michael and Gabriel holding banners and scrolls with the inscription PETICIVS and POSTVLATIVS. Bordering the central window of the lower zones are two six-winged seraphim, in their hands they hold live coals with tongs which they place in the mouths of two crouching figures. In the left lower zone, there are two tonsured (meaning scalp has been shaved) figures who might be Saints Benedict and Bernard or one of them might be a portrait of a local deacon on account of the realism {{in the face of the}} figure. [...] The theory that these figures are patrons of the church is strengthened by the discovery of similar figures in related frescoes at the monastery of Saint Peter of Berga. The third archangel, Raphael, does not appear with the others in the semidome but in the lower section.|$|R
