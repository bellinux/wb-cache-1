40|$|The study {{looks at}} the rarely studied customs {{brokerage}} activity in the Philippines {{and its role in}} facilitating trade given the ongoing push to modernize <b>customs</b> <b>administration.</b> It analyzes how the customs brokerage profession is being regulated and synthesizes insights on opposing views on the importance of customs brokers in trade facilitation. The results of the study clearly point toward a declining relevance of the customs brokers' services in an environment where <b>customs</b> <b>administration</b> is modernizing, computerization is replacing the traditional, direct interaction of brokers with the Bureau of Customs, and a more transparent <b>customs</b> <b>administration</b> is emerging to efficiently process a significantly growing volume of trade transactions. Understandably, a threatened profession such as brokering mounts resistance in the face of changes. Customs brokers take the Customs Brokers Act of 2004 as their shield against any attempt to dilute or minimize their role in the <b>customs</b> <b>administration</b> process. However, their legalistic stand somewhat collides with the policymakers' attempt to modernize <b>customs</b> <b>administration.</b> A more positive outlook on modernization should trigger among customs brokers a paradigm shift, namely, that a modernized <b>customs</b> <b>administration</b> and trade facilitation process will necessarily create new opportunities for those adept and flexible enough to adjust to changing market conditions. Moreover, it will be more efficient and consistent with trade facilitation to allow traders to use various and modern options for releasing or shipping their goods...|$|R
