Syrian rebels have also shelled al-Hermel previously.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the sea}} otter's {{preferred}} prey species, particularly abalone, clams, and crabs, {{are also}} food sources for humans.

5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E

5|$|John's counter-offensive stalled at {{the siege}} of Wesenberg in 1574, when German and Scottish units of the Swedish army turned against each other. This failure has also <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> on the {{difficulties}} of fighting in the bitter winter conditions, particularly for the infantry. The war in Livonia was a great financial burden for Sweden, {{and by the end}} of 1573, Sweden's German mercenaries were owed 200,000 daler. John gave them the castles of Hapsal, Leal and Lode as security, but when he failed to pay they were sold to Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. The media have <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{storage in}} the Pushkar Lake {{has been reduced}} alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the {{situation}} became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks {{near one of the}} upper ghats, fed by tube wells from ground water sources. While the authorities have <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear exactly why, for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling export licences, granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for the failure of the foreign policy that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne. He was subsequently attainted and beheaded.|$|E

40|$|Extract] Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{we have seen}} 'moral panics' over {{literacy}} education fuelled by the media in the British, Australian, Canadian, and American press (Barron, 2000). 'Moral panics' as a rhetorical strategy promote deficit thinking and construct literacy crises that require expedient political solutions. Too often children <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for poor attention, disruptive behavior or disinterest; parents <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for disorderly family routines and turmoil in the home; teachers <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to teach traditional values and get their students to perform; and teacher educators <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to impart the necessary knowledge to reach children who lack mainstream social values and literacy practices.

5|$|The {{destruction}} of Robinson's Arch {{occurred during the}} events surrounding the Roman sacking of Jerusalem in 70CE. It has traditionally <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> on the Roman legions which destroyed the Temple Mount enclosure and eventually {{set fire to the}} entire city. More recently, this has been attributed to the Zealot factions which had wrested control of the Temple Mount and fortified it prior to its fall. Some of these continued to hold out in Jerusalem's Upper City for a month after the city had been breached by the Romans. By wrecking the overpass, as well as the viaduct at Wilson's Arch to the north, the defenders made access to the Temple platform much more difficult for besieging forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E

Sikorski's Liberator II crashed off Gibraltar almost immediately after take off, with the plane's pilot being the only survivor. The catastrophe, while officially classified as an accident, has led to several conspiracy theories that persist to this day, and often propose that the crash was an assassination, which has variously <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> on the Soviets, British, Nazis or even a dissenting Polish faction. The incident is still described by some historians as mysterious, and since 2008 it has been under an investigation by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, ongoing as of July 2013.|$|E

5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the late}} 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally {{introduced}} into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate {{a wide range of}} water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} did {{not find}} anyone guilty of negligence or misconduct, but Lieutenant Admiral Bär, commander of Nyckeln, and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who had run aground on Äpplet, were never again given a command in the navy. Lieutenant Admiral Hans Clerck, commander of Solen, went through the process unscathed, and was promoted to full Admiral by the King before the commission even presented its verdict. Creutz has quite consistently <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> {{for the loss of}} his ship by historians, and has been described as an incompetent sea officer and sailor who more or less single-handedly brought about the sinking through lack of naval experience. Military historians Lars Ericson Wolke and Olof Sjöblom have attempted to nuance the picture by pointing out that Creutz's task was akin to that of an administrator rather than a military commander. The practical issues of ship maneuvering should have been the responsibility of his subordinates, who had experience in naval matters.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has <b>been</b> <b>blamed</b> on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E
