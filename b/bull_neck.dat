25|$|The Newfoundland shares many traits {{with other}} Mastiffs, {{such as the}} St. Bernard and English Mastiff, {{including}} stout legs, massive heads with very broad snouts, a thick <b>bull</b> <b>neck,</b> and a very sturdy bone structure. In fact, many St. Bernard Dogs have Newfoundland Dog ancestry. Newfoundlands were brought and introduced to the St. Bernard breed in the 18th century when the population was threatened by an epidemic of distemper. They share many characteristics of many mountain dog breeds such as the Great Pyrenees.|$|E
2500|$|MD 587 was {{constructed}} as a macadam road along what was originally <b>Bull</b> <b>Neck</b> Road from MD 150 to Wilson Point in 1934. [...] The state highway was widened {{with a pair}} of [...] wide concrete shoulders around 1940. [...] MD 587's intersection with MD 150 was rebuilt as a directional crossover intersection when MD 150 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through Middle River in 1944. [...] The intersection was converted to a standard three-way intersection when MD 587 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway along its present length in 1964. [...] The state highway's southern terminus was moved north to Dogwood Drive around 1987.|$|E

60|$|Once {{astride the}} <b>bull's</b> <b>neck,</b> I drew my long stone knife and, setting the point {{carefully}} over the brute's spine, drove it home with both hands. At {{the same instant}} I leaped clear of the stumbling animal. Now, no vertebrate can progress far with a knife through his spine, and the thag is no exception to the rule.|$|R

60|$|The revolutionist Nikita {{had pushed}} his way in front of Razumov, and faced him with his big, livid cheeks, his heavy paunch, <b>bull</b> <b>neck,</b> and {{enormous}} hands. Razumov looked at the famous slayer of gendarmes in silent disgust.|$|E
50|$|The first {{historical}} {{traces of}} bull-baiting {{occur in the}} time of the regency of King John. Enraged steers, specially bred for their aggressive nature, were used to test the keenness of dogs. A collar around the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck</b> was fastened to a thick rope about three to five metres long, attached to a hook, then fastened to an embedded stake that turned, allowing the bull to watch its antagonizer.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} they lay quite silent near their prey, {{and then at}} a sign from the ape-man Sheeta sprang upon the great back, burying his strong teeth in the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck.</b> [...] Instantly the brute sprang to his feet with a bellow of pain and rage, {{and at the same}} instant Tarzan rushed in upon his left side with the stone knife, {{striking}} repeatedly behind the shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|According to Cahuilla people, {{who claimed}} to be able to {{communicate}} with bears, one of their men attended a fight at a pueblo in Los Angeles. During {{the first part of the}} fight, the bull kept knocking down the bear, before the man whispered to the bear that it had to defend itself, or else it would be killed. Upon that, the bear fought back, and broke the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck</b> (Ibid, p. 116).|$|R
60|$|The man {{was small}} and rather old, so that the {{brutality}} of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great <b>bull</b> <b>neck</b> set between massive shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Hauptmann Fritz Schneider trudged wearily {{through the}} somber aisles {{of the dark}} forest. Sweat rolled down his bullet head and stood upon his heavy jowls and <b>bull</b> <b>neck.</b> His {{lieutenant}} marched beside him while Underlieutenant von Goss brought up the rear, following {{with a handful of}} askaris the tired and all but exhausted porters whom the black soldiers, following the example of their white officer, encouraged with the sharp points of bayonets and the metal-shod butts of rifles.|$|E
60|$|The new-comer {{was a man}} forty-three {{years of}} age, clean shaven, with a massive head, large engorged eyes, a small {{clear-cut}} nose, and the full <b>bull</b> <b>neck</b> which was the especial mark of his breed. He had entered through the peristyle with a swaggering, rolling gait, as one who walks upon his own ground, and now he stood, his hands upon his hips, looking round him at the bowing slaves, and finally at their master, with a half-humorous expression upon his flushed and brutal face.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} forms of {{traditional}} bullfighting in Portugal, some differing markedly from the version described above. In the Azores, bullfighting is often reminiscent of {{the running of the}} bulls in Pamplona (Spain) in the respect that those most at risk are human beings, not the bulls themselves. The Azorean style involves a group of people vying in a tug-of-war with a young bull by holding fast to a long stout rope tied around the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck.</b> This is called the tourada à corda (bull-on-a-rope 'game').|$|R
50|$|Bulls {{enter the}} {{competition}} area through a gate called the vadi vasal. Typically, participants must only {{hold onto the}} bull's hump, and in some variations they are disqualified if they hold onto the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck,</b> horns or tail. There may be several goals to the game depending on region. In some versions, contestants must either hold the bulls hump for 30 seconds or for 15 m. If the contestant is thrown by the bull or falls, they lose. Some variations only allow for one contestant. If two people grab the hump, then neither person wins.|$|R
50|$|Purbararang {{decided to}} bring Purbasari down by giving her {{impossible}} tasks to do. One day a banteng bull ran amok and began wreaking havoc in the capital city. No man was able to stop it as it destroyed the square and the marketplace. Purbararang sent a messenger to Purbarsari, ordering her to catch the raging bull. Purbasari was distressed; but Lutung Kasarung told her to take a lock of her own hair and put it around the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck.</b> Purbarsari did so, and the bull was instantly tamed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine is Jones," [...] {{replied the}} hunter, and right quickly did he grip the proffered hand. He saw in Rea a giant, {{of whom he}} was but a stunted shadow. Six and {{one-half}} feet Rea stood, with yard-wide shoulders, a hulk of bone and brawn. His ponderous, shaggy head rested on a <b>bull</b> <b>neck.</b> His broad face, with its low forehead, its close-shut mastiff under jaw, its big, opaque eyes, pale and cruel as those of a jaguar, marked him a man of terrible brute force.|$|E
6000|$|General Montero {{had risen}} with a jingle of steel {{scabbard}} and {{a ripple of}} glitter on his gold-embroidered breast; a heavy sword-hilt appeared at his side above {{the edge of the}} table. In this gorgeous uniform, with his <b>bull</b> <b>neck,</b> his hooked nose flattened on the tip upon a blue-black, dyed moustache, he looked like a disguised and sinister vaquero. The drone of his voice had a strangely rasping, soulless ring. He floundered, lowering, through a few vague sentences; then suddenly raising his big head and his voice together, burst out harshly-- ...|$|E
60|$|He strode on, {{breathing}} hard, {{his black}} head and <b>bull</b> <b>neck</b> forward, {{like a man}} winning a walking race. The little priest, amused and interested, had some trouble in trotting beside him. Just before them the trees fell back a little to left and right, and the road swept downwards across a clear, moonlit valley, till it dived again like a rabbit into the wall of another wood. The entrance to the farther forest looked small and round, like the black hole of a remote railway tunnel. But it was within some hundred yards, and gaped like a cavern before Flambeau spoke again.|$|E
5000|$|Vlad was {{not very}} tall, but very stocky and strong, with a cold and terrible appearance, a strong and aquiline nose, swollen nostrils, a thin and reddish face in which the very long eyelashes framed large wide-open green eyes; the bushy black eyebrows made them appear threatening. His face and chin were shaven, but for a moustache. The swollen temples {{increased}} {{the bulk of his}} head. A <b>bull's</b> <b>neck</b> connected withhis head from which black curly locks hung on his wide-shouldered person. Niccolò Modrussa's description of Vlad the Impaler ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{decision}} was barely reached when the bull was upon him with lowered head and erect tail. It {{was an awful}} rush, but Hockins stood like a rock with the cutlass pointed. At the pre-arranged moment he stepped to one side, but instead of letting {{the momentum of the}} animal do the work, he could not resist the impulse to drive the cutlass deeper into the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck.</b> The result was that, though he escaped the creature's horn by a very narrow shave, the cutlass was wrenched violently from his grasp, and he was sent head over heels upon the plain! ...|$|R
60|$|With {{a mighty}} heave I lifted {{him so that}} now we lay side by side. He was groping for a knife--I did not see, but knew it. Near his head a {{sharp-edged}} stone rose in {{the path to the}} height of a man's hand or more. I saw it and bethought me what to do if I could. Again I heaved and as at length he found the knife and stabbed at me, scratching my face, I got his <b>bull's</b> <b>neck</b> upon that stone. Then I loosed my hand and caught him by the hair. Back I pressed his great head, back and back with all my might till something snapped.|$|R
60|$|Equal to {{even this}} emergency, Mr. Dumphy had {{sat in his}} office all the morning, {{resisting}} with the full strength of his aggressive nature any disposition {{on the part of}} his his customers to succumb financially to the unusual weather. Mr. Dumphy's shirt-collar was off; with it seemed to have departed some of his respectability, and he was perhaps, on the whole, a trifle less imposing than he had been. Nevertheless, he was still dominant, in the suggestion of his short <b>bull</b> <b>neck,</b> and two visitors who entered, observing the déshabillé of this great man, felt that it was the proper thing for them to instantly unbutton their own waistcoats and loosen their cravats.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fentolin {{raised to}} his lips and blew softly a little gold whistle which hung from a chain {{attached}} to his waistcoat. Almost immediately the door opened. A man entered, dressed somberly in black, whose bearing and demeanour alike denoted the servant, but whose physique was the physique of a prize-fighter. He was scarcely more than five feet six in height, but his shoulders were extraordinarily broad. He had a short, <b>bull</b> <b>neck</b> and long, mighty arms. His face, with the heavy jaw and small eyes, was the face of the typical fighting man, yet his features seemed to have become disposed by habit into an expression of gentle, almost servile civility.|$|E
60|$|A great pile {{of living}} embers {{diffused}} {{a strong and}} ruddy glow from the arched chimney. Before this straddled Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk, with his skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the comfortable warmth. His dilated shadow cut the room in half; and the firelight only escaped {{on either side of}} his broad person, and in a little pool between his outspread feet. His face had the beery, bruised appearance of the continual drinker's; it was covered with a network of congested veins, purple in ordinary circumstances, but now pale violet, for even {{with his back to the}} fire the cold pinched him on the other side. His cowl had half fallen back, and made a strange excrescence on either side of his <b>bull</b> <b>neck.</b> So he straddled, grumbling, and cut the room in half with the shadow of his portly frame.|$|E
50|$|At this point, the picador stabs {{just behind}} the morrillo, a mound of muscle on the {{fighting}} <b>bull's</b> <b>neck,</b> weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal's first loss of blood. The {{manner in which the}} bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about which side the bull favors. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight. This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance. The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behaviour of a bull; distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves.|$|R
50|$|Each {{bullfight}} {{consists of}} 3 matadors and six bulls; each matador fights 2 bulls. Bullfights consist of 3 tercios, or parts. In the first part, the matador fights with a cape while the bull is provoked by the picador (a helper on horseback {{who holds a}} lance and pricks the muscles in the <b>bulls</b> <b>neck.</b> This is done to lowerer the bulls head so {{it is easier to}} handle The second part consists of placing banderillas or small flags with hooks on the end on the bull's back. Sometimes the matador himself will do this; however, usually it is done by the banderilleros. The purpose of the banderillas is to correct any defects of the bull's charge, such as excessive hooking to one side. During the third round, the matador returns with a cape and sword and kills the bull.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl had}} emerged from the hut, her tears dried and was gazing anxiously toward the south into the jungle where Tarzan had disappeared. Occasionally she cast {{suspicious}} glances {{in the direction of}} the huge shaggy anthropoids about her. How easy it would be for one of those great beasts to enter the boma and slay her. How helpless she was, even with the spear that the white man had left her, she realized as she noted for the thousandth time the massive shoulders, the <b>bull</b> <b>necks,</b> and the great muscles gliding so easily beneath the glossy coats. Never, she thought, had she seen such personifications of brute power as were represented by these mighty bulls. Those huge hands would snap her futile spear as she might snap a match in two, while their lightest blow could crush her into insensibility and death.|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} {{had placed}} a light upon the table, and {{was engaged in}} drawing the curtain of the window. The speakers whom they had heard were two men, who had a pack of cards and some silver money between them, while upon the screen itself the games they had played were scored in chalk. The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of middle age, with large black whiskers, broad cheeks, a coarse wide mouth, and <b>bull</b> <b>neck,</b> which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief. He wore his hat, which was of a brownish-white, and had beside him a thick knotted stick. The other man, whom his companion had called Isaac, was of a more slender figure--stooping, and high in the shoulders--with a very ill-favoured face, and a most sinister and villainous squint.|$|E
60|$|As he {{approached}} me, the man {{certainly did not}} look like a beggar. Poor he might be, judging by his dress. The upper part of him was clothed in an old shooting jacket of velveteen; his legs presented a pair of trousers, once black, now turning brown with age. Both garments were too long for him, and both were kept scrupulously clean. He was a short man, thickly and strongly made. Impenetrable composure appeared on his ugly face. His eyes were sunk deep in his head; his nose had evidently been broken and not successfully mended; his grey hair, when he took off his hat on addressing me, was cut short, and showed his low forehead and his <b>bull</b> <b>neck.</b> An Englishman of the last generation would, as I have since been informed, have set him down as a retired prize-fighter. Thanks to my ignorance of the pugilistic glories of my native country, I was totally at a loss what to make of him.|$|E
6000|$|I twitched softly at my wrists, {{and then}} at my ankles, but {{whichever}} of the two had secured me was no bungler at his work. I could not move either of them an inch. Then I tried to work the handkerchief down over my mouth, but the ruffian beside me raised his knife with such a threatening snarl that I had to desist. I was lying still looking at his <b>bull</b> <b>neck,</b> and wondering whether it would ever be my good fortune to fit it for a cravat, when I heard returning steps coming down the inn passage and up the stair. What word would the villain bring back? If he {{found it impossible to}} kidnap me, he would probably murder me where I lay. For my own part, I was indifferent which it might be, and I looked at the doorway with the contempt and defiance which I longed to put into words. But you can imagine my feelings, my dear friends, when, instead of the tall figure and dark, sneering face of the Capuchin, my eyes fell upon the grey pelisse and huge moustaches of my good little sub-officer, Papilette! ...|$|E

50|$|Bullfighting traces {{its roots}} to prehistoric bull worship and {{sacrifice}} in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean region. The first recorded bullfight {{may be the}} Epic of Gilgamesh, which describes {{a scene in which}} Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought and killed the Bull of Heaven ("The Bull seemed indestructible, for hours they fought, till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull, lured it with his tunic and bright weapons, and Enkidu thrust his sword, deep into the <b>Bull's</b> <b>neck,</b> and killed it"). Bull leaping was portrayed in Crete, and myths related to bulls throughout Greece. The killing of the sacred bull (tauroctony) is the essential central iconic act of Mithras, which was commemorated in the mithraeum wherever Roman soldiers were stationed. The oldest representation of {{what seems to be a}} man facing a bull is on the Celtiberian tombstone from Clunia and the cave painting El toro de hachos, both found in Spain.|$|R
5000|$|Goya's use {{of empty}} space has been {{described}} as an indication of how his work, of all the Old Masters, is closest to the spirit of Modernism. He was to use areas of empty space for dramatic and evocative effect again in his [...] "Black Paintings", notably in The Dog and The Great He-Goat. [...] Hughes, writing on how Goya anticipates a number of the later ideas of European art, remarked in 2004 of the [...] "naked power with which Goya has played off void against solid, black against light, empty space against full." [...] The picture rewards detailed examination, in that much of the subtleties are not at first obvious. For example, the late mayor's shoe {{can be seen in the}} distance protruding from the <b>bull's</b> <b>neck,</b> making the man all the more pathetic a figure against the force and strength of the animal.|$|R
