The national pollution abatement laws that were adopted in the decade after NEPA, however, operate in a very different fashion. They, too, have been very successful in a number of important respects, but have achieved less than we had hoped for because of certain flaws in their design. To analyze these laws for us, I would like to introduce another colleague, Professor Jeffery Miller, who has also travelled in Argentina. In fact, Professor Miller conducted workshops for the delegates at the Constitutional Convention who drafted the amendments to the Constitution of Argentina.

This special issue, which focuses on the USA and Britain, also addresses the following questions: Does the concept of racial hierarchy aid us in illuminating racial inequalities and the differential experiences of groups in Western multiethnic societies such as the USA and Britain? What sorts of criteria are used in arguments about the place of groups along racial hierarchies? What are the political implications of claims made about racial hierarchies...|$|R

40|$|Naturalists and {{scientists}} have been captivated by the diversity of marine larval forms since they were discovered following {{the advent of the}} microscope. Because they often bear little resemblance to adults, larvae were identified initially as new life forms, classified into different groups based on the similarity of their body plans and given new names that <b>are</b> still <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> The radically different body plans and lifestyles of marine larvae and adults have led most investigators historically to study the two phases of complex life cycles in isolation. More recently, important ecological insights have sprung from taking a holistic view of marine life cycles. Meanwhile, the evolutionary (phenotypic and genetic) links among life-history phases remain less appreciated. In this review, our objective is to evaluate the evolutionary links within marine life cycles, and explore their ecological and evolutionary consequences. We provide a brief overview of marine life histories, discuss the phenotypic and genetic links between the two phases of the life cycle and pose challenges to advance our understanding of the evolutionary constraints acting on marine life histories...|$|R
40|$|Chen's book, Asia as Method (Duke University Press, 2010), and his theorization {{on topics}} of de-imperialization, de-colonization, de-cold war, {{as well as}} on foregrounding epistemologies and frames of {{reference}} situated in the diverse contexts in Asia have contributed to empowering scholars and researchers situated not only in Taiwan, but also {{in many parts of the}} world. His critical cultural studies project in linking up scholars both inside and outside of Asia and in putting forward counter-discourses to the binary "the West and the rest" knowledge structures and knowledge production practices has important implications for critical curriculum and education work. My essay review will focus on the implications of his notion of "Asia as Method" and his "strategy of critical syncretism" in exploring and designing critical curriculum and education inquiry that seeks to transform deep-rooted colonial, imperialist, and cold war subjectivities.

40|$|In the interwar {{period in}} Greater London, the new {{arterial}} road system produced a contestation over appearance between {{the forces of}} beautification and vandalism. The Roads of Remembrance Association was determined to beautify the arterial road as a memorial to the fallen of World War I; it jostled for influence with the Roads Beautifying Association and others for the leading role in influencing county councils in their planting schemes. This debate throws further light on the meanings of Englishness between the wars, when a traditional, picturesque interpretation of the rural was set against the modernity of the new roads. Both beauty and modernity were challenged by outside forces. Vandalism by the bored teenagers of London’s new suburbs destroyed memorials placed on the road by still-grieving parents. Most of the attempted beautification was eventually destroyed by uncontrolled ribbon development, leaving a dystopic suburban landscape that <b>is</b> still <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> Intellectual criticism of ribbon development was withering, but failed {{to take into account}} the attraction of modern, electrified houses on the new roads to London’s new lower middle classes...|$|R

His keen interest in education insured the continued funding {{and development of the}} public school system in the state at a time when local agencies were unable to provide adequate monies and the system’s continuation was in grave danger. Martin also maintained his commitment to higher education. Despite financial hard times for the state, Martin supported an extensive building program at Washington State College, a program facilitated by Martin’s respect for and friendship with President E. O. Holland. Martin’s administration also reorganized the state’s highway system providing miles of new and improved roads as well as many new jobs. He also directed the reorganization of the State Highway Patrol. With the end of prohibition the state of Washington secured much needed revenue by organizing and operating the retail liquor business.

40|$|Visible Mind is a {{book about}} why film is so {{important}} to contemporary life, how film affects us psychologically as individuals, and how it affects us culturally as collective social beings. Since its inception, film has been both responsive to historical cultural conditions and reflective of changes in psychological and emotional needs. Arising at the same moment over a century ago, both film and psychoanalysis helped to frame the fragmented experience of modern life in a way that <b>is</b> still <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> Visible Mind pays attention to the historical context of film for what it can tell us about our inner lives, past and present. Christopher Hauke discusses a range of themes from the perspective of film and analytical psychology, these include: The Face, The Shadow, Narrative and Story, Reality in Film, Cinema and the American Psyche, the use of Movies in the Psychotherapy Session and Archetypal themes in popular film. Unique to Visible Mind, six interviews with top film professionals from different departments both unlocks the door {{on the role of the}} unconscious in their creative process, and brings alive the reflexive critical thinking on modernity, postmodernity and Jungian psychology found throughout Visible Mind...|$|R
