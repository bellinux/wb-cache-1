5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
5|$|One {{of their}} {{innovative}} features {{was a relatively}} new kind of bow called the <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E

There has been {{a large body of}} work that assess’ the effect of wave wake wash and recently studies have been undertaken to determine {{the effects of}} <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> on reducing wave wake wash. However, not much research has been published on the effects of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> on the seakeeping performance of catamarans fitted with <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows.</b> This paper presents experimental results that will allow a ship designer to understand the effects of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> on heave, pitch and added resistance in waves.

25|$|Under her {{new owners}} Doric was renamed Royal Odyssey. Before {{entering}} service for Royal Cruise Line, {{she received a}} four-month refit at the Greek shipyards of Perama and Neorion, where her funnel was rebuilt, her topmost deck expanded and a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> added below the waterline. Royal Odyssey entered service for Royal Cruise Line on 25 May 1982, and was used for cruises all around the world, including occasional cruises around the Pacific from Australia.|$|E
25|$|The South African {{project began}} in 1998, {{and was one}} of the {{subjects}} of an article in Popular Mechanics magazine in September of that year. The article discussed the changes to the original design required to produce a safe and economically viable ship, including a welded rather than riveted hull, diesel-electric propulsion in place of steam engines, and a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow.</b> The article concluded that although the various Titanic revival projects would cost $400–$600 million, they could be economically viable.|$|E
25|$|After {{almost a}} decade of {{successful}} operation without icebreaker assistance Tempera and Mastera remain the only double acting tankers operating in the Baltic Sea. While other double acting ships have {{been built in the}} recent years, the tankers operated by Neste Shipping are also the only ones equipped with a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> designed primarily with open water performance in mind — the tankers and container ships built for the Russian Arctic have a more traditional icebreaking bow due to the more severe ice conditions.|$|E

50|$|Some {{explanations}} {{note that}} water flowing over the bulb depresses the ship's bow and keeps it trimmed better. Since {{many of the}} <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> are symmetrical or even angled upwards which would tend to raise the bow further, the improved trim is likely a by-product of the reduced wave action as the vessel approaches hull speed, rather than direct action of water flow over the bulb.|$|R
25|$|The foreship of Mastera is {{designed}} for open water performance with a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> to maximize the hydrodynamic efficiency. The ship is, {{just like any other}} ice-strengthened vessel, also capable of running ahead in light ice conditions. The stern is, however, shaped like an icebreaker's bow, and Mastera {{is designed}} to operate independently in the most severe ice conditions of the Baltic Sea. For this purpose the ship is also equipped with two bridges for navigating in both directions. The ship is served by a crew of 15 to 20 depending on operating conditions during winter and maintenance work during summer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{operational}} and economical advantages to such electrical de-coupling of a ship's propulsion system, {{and it became}} a standard element of cruise ship design in the 1990s, over 30 years after Canberra entered service. However, diesel engine and gas turbine driven alternators are the primary power source for most modern electrically propelled ships. She also had a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow,</b> two sets of stabilizers, and two funnels side-by-side. The lifeboats, which were made from glass fibre, were placed three decks lower than usual for ships of her type, and were recessed into the hull to allow improved view from the passenger decks.|$|E
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather. However, a hydrodynamically efficient <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> greatly increases the ice resistance, making it unsuitable for icebreakers. As a result, the total efficiency of icebreaking ships is 20–40% less than that of good open water vessels of similar size mainly due to the bow form.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls {{were divided}} into {{fourteen}} watertight compartments and had double bottoms that ran for 83percent {{of the length of}} their keels. Both vessels had side bulges and <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows.</b> They were constructed with longitudinal steel frames, and were more than 90percent welded in order to save weight. Nürnberg had a large, blocky forward superstructure, while Leipzigs superstructure resembled that of the preceding Königsberg class. Nürnberg also had a large searchlight platform fitted on the funnel, while Leipzig did not.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method was}} used to compute turbulent flows around U-shaped or smoothly varying <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> using C-grids. The numerical method exhibited good agreement with calculated and experimental pressure coefficients.

The pressure resistance around full bow geometries predicted by viscous flow solvers was higher than the one predicted by potential flow.

40|$|A multiparameter {{conformal}} mapping technique is presented which permits the accurate description of realistic ship sections. The solution of a nonlinear set of equations describing {{the transformation of}} a circle to the arbitrarily shaped section s linearised using a new method which produces a monotonic relationship between coordinates in the physical and reference planes. This feature allows the mapping of reentrant sections such as large <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> and the inclusion of features such as bilge keels and shaft brackets. The assumed form of the {{conformal mapping}} permits asymmetric sections to be represented. The sections can be successfully transformed at different heel angles...|$|R
25|$|The 1982 refit radically {{altered the}} ship's profile, when the {{original}} slim funnels were replaced with a single large one, and the outer decks between the bridge and the funnel were built in. Additionally, a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> was added below the waterline, improving the ship's sea-keeping abilities. During the refit, the ship's livery was also altered, with the new funnel painted in blue and white, while a white decorative ribbon was added to her hull. The exact same livery was maintained as Regent Sun, with the Regency Cruises funnel symbol replacing that of Royal Cruise Line.|$|E
25|$|The {{contract}} for two ships {{was awarded to}} the Finnish state-owned shipbuilding company Valmet and was, at the time, the largest single contract made by a Finnish industrial company at FIM 700 million (US$200 million). Although Valmet had been developing its own barge handling system, {{it was agreed that}} the proven American Seabee concept would be adopted instead of the shipyard's own design due to the relatively short timescale before delivery. The Soviets purchased two sets of drawings from the American owners for US$1 million. However, a number of changes were made to the original design, and as a result the design costs accounted for some 25 percent of the man-hours spent on the project. The work included extensive model testing, which resulted in the adoption of a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> that alone increased the ships' service speed by 0.5 knots.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{consisted of}} retrofitting a <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow,</b> faired {{to the existing}} icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by KaMeWa, to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker to ballast water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated heeling tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to , which substantially increased the ships' deadweight tonnage. Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new incinerator {{to deal with the}} shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the Wärtsilä Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and turbine engines to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built with a much larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|R

Worthwhile reductions in fuel consumption are achievable with bulbs or wedges, dependent upon bulb design, wedge angle, propulsion machinery characteristics, and service speed profile. The <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> tested in wave had no important adverse effect on seakeeping, and particularly slamming behaviour. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient <b>bulbous</b> <b>bow</b> greatly increases the ice resistance. However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode for merchant ships.|$|E

As a result, the ship's cost was $6.2billion. The earlier Nimitz-class ships each cost around $4.5 billion. To lower costs, some new technologies and design features were also incorporated into , the previous carrier, including a redesigned island.|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} of a bulb to a ship's hull increases its overall wetted area. As wetted area increases, so does drag. At greater speeds and in larger vessels it is the bow wave that is the greatest force impeding the vessel's forward motion through the water. For a vessel that is small or spends {{a great deal of}} its time at a slow speed, the increase in drag will not be offset by the benefit in damping bow wave generation. As the wave counter effects are only significant at the vessel's higher range of speed, <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> are not energy efficient when the vessel cruises outside of these ranges, specifically at lower speeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships of}} the class varied {{slightly}} in dimensions. Littorio and Vittorio Veneto were 224.05 m long between perpendiculars and 237.76 m long overall, while Roma and Impero were 240.68 m long overall. All four ships had a draft of 9.6 m and a beam of 32.82 m. Littorio displaced 40724 MT as designed and 45236 MT at full load. Vittorio Veneto displaced 40517 MT and 45029 MT, respectively. Romas displacement increased slightly {{as compared to the}} other ships, to 40992 MT and 45485 MT, respectively. As Impero was not completed, her final displacement is unknown.

40|$|An {{integrated}} CFD {{method is}} described for predicting the total hydrodynamic resistance at model {{as well as}} at full scale of conventional ship forms. The method combines a non-linear potential with a viscous flow solution of the RANS equations. The potential solution is achieved by covering the hull and the free surface with quadrilateral elements while convergence is based on an iterative procedure. A three-block decomposition is introduced to solve the RANS equations in curvilinear co-ordinates and a new conformal mapping technique has been developed to generate grids effectively. To validate the method, experiments have been carried out for a model with three different <b>bulbous</b> <b>bows</b> at the towing tank of NTUA. Computed resistance coefficients for both the models and the 40 : 1 full scale ships are also compared in order to evaluate the fundamental principles of empirical extrapolation methods. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
