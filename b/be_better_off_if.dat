25|$|The {{government}} decision spurred local campaigning {{to establish a}} permanent base in Agder. They argued that Stavanger and Oslo were {{too far away to}} give an adequate coverage of Agder and Telemark. The activism increased rapidly in 1990. Two petitions were established, the one gathering 33,000 signatures. A common petition was written and signed by both county councils, 34 mayors and various organizations. There was also some opposition, based on that the ambulance service would in total <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> the extra funding was used on strengthening the conventional ambulance service.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

Due to the Ratchet effect, the employer would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> both parties {{can agree on}} a multi-period contract without subsequent revisions. Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to multiple activities. These structures imply less ratcheting but {{at the loss of}} comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. Performance evaluation in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.|$|E

Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

Notwithstanding claims {{that the world would}} <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel in the Old Testament, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict, but this is contradicted by {{the fact that many of}} the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.|$|E

Cohen, {{professor}} of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University wrote for The Washington Post that the British Army had [...] "a higher quotient of sophisticated {{leaders who have}} thought hard about the profession of arms" [...] than was found in other armed forces, including the US military, which he believed explained why it [...] "produces generals who write [...] serious, important books" [...] such as the Utility of Force. Cohen wrote that Smith's thesis, {{that the world has}} entered a new era of conflict, is of [...] "central importance" [...] for the United States military, which Cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if Smith was correct. Cohen criticised the book for its limited historical perspective, noting that conventional wars are still fought (for example the Kargil War in 1999) and that several confrontations in Asia threatened to spill over into conventional warfare. Nevertheless, Cohen concluded [...] "Smith has clearly written {{one of the most important}} books on modern warfare in the last decade.

2500|$|The US {{government}} also acquired easement {{rights to the}} western part of the territory, which became the Oklahoma Territory, for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> each family owned its own land. The Dawes Act of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve.

2500|$|A common {{model of}} {{altruism}} and social cooperation is the Prisoner's dilemma.

[...] One {{solution to this problem}} is to introduce the possibility of retaliation by having individuals play the game repeatedly against the same player. [...] In the so-called iterated Prisoner's dilemma, the same two individuals play the prisoner's dilemma over and over. [...] While the Prisoner's dilemma has only two strategies (Cooperate and Defect), the iterated Prisoner's dilemma has a huge number of possible strategies. [...] Since an individual can have different contingency plan for each history and the game may be repeated an indefinite number of times, there may in fact be an infinite number of such contingency plans.|$|E
2500|$|Past {{comments}} {{came back}} to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the Eisenhower administration [...] "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that [...] "sometimes I think this country would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea". That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign {{in the form of}} a Johnson television commercial, as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary, and statements in Tennessee about selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, a large local New Deal employer.|$|E
