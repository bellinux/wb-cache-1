Castrates and ewes of different age groups (1 = 12 months) and breeds were used. From the commercial abattoir, 90 castrates and 110 ewes were used, while 66 castrates and 19 ewes were obtained from the municipal abattoir. Meat samples were obtained to determine meat colour, ultimate pH, temperature, cooking loss and tenderness.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Tirofiban (Aggrastat) is a reversible, nonpeptide {{inhibitor}} of platelet glycoprotein II/IIIa receptors. We {{tested the}} hypothesis that tirofiban preserves platelet number and function and shortens postoperative <b>bleeding</b> <b>times</b> in baboons after cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Four groups were studied: control, n = 12; low-dose tirofiban (0. 1 μg/kg per minute), n = 7; high-dose tirofiban (0. 3 μg/kg per minute), n = 7; and bolus tirofiban (15 μg/kg) followed by 0. 1 μg/kg per minute during cardiopulmonary bypass, n = 7. After heparin, animals were perfused for 60 minutes at 50 ml/kg per minute and 37 ° C with a bubble oxygenator, roller pump, and peripheral cannulation. Hemodynamics, platelet count, platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate, and release of β-thromboglobulin were measured before tirofiban infusion, before heparin, after heparin before bypass, after 5 and 55 minutes of bypass, after protamine, and 60 minutes after protamine. Template <b>bleeding</b> <b>times</b> were measured at the same times except during cardiopulmonary bypass and 120 and 180 minutes after protamine administration. Platelet glycoprotein IIIa antigen was measured in Triton X- 100 washes (Sigma Chemical Company) of the perfusion circuit after bypass. Results: High-dose tirofiban completely prevents platelet loss during cardiopulmonary bypass. β-Thromboglobulin release and sensitivity to adenosine diphosphate are significantly less than control {{at the end of}} bypass in all tirofiban groups.

40|$|AbstractObjective:This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that nitric oxide or nitric oxide and eptifibatide (Integrilin) reversibly inhibit platelet activation and consumption during cardiopulmonary bypass and rapidly restore platelet numbers and function after bypass. Methods: Nitric oxide, a short-acting, reversible platelet inhibitor, was studied with and without eptifibatide, a short-acting, reversible glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, in 21 baboons that underwent 60 minutes of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with peripheral cannulas. A control group, a group that received 80 ppm nitric oxide, and a group that received both nitric oxide and eptifibatide were studied. Blood samples were obtained at several time points to determine platelet count, aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate, and levels of β-thromboglobulin, prothrombin fragment 1. 2, and thrombin-antithrombin complex. Template <b>bleeding</b> <b>times</b> were measured before and at 4 intervals after cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Both nitric oxide and {{the combination of the}} 2 drugs significantly attenuated platelet consumption, improved postbypass function, and reduced plasma β-thromboglobulin release with respect to values in control animals. Both nitric oxide and the combination restored baseline <b>bleeding</b> <b>times</b> 55 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass ended.

Since the mechanism of co-agulation factor XI (FXI) –dependent thrombus growth remains unclear, we investigated the contribution of FXI to thrombus formation in a primate thrombo-sis model. Pretreatment of baboons with a novel anti–human FXI monoclonal anti-body (aXIMab; 2 mg/kg) inhibited plasma FXI by at least 99 % for 10 days, and suppressed thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex and -thromboglobulin (TG) formation measured immediately down-stream from thrombi forming within collagen-coated vascular grafts.
