5|$|Tourism {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the Shinano River basin as {{there are a number}} of attractions in the area. The Shinano River system attracts a number of tourists from across the country for angling and to experience Tsukeba fish shacks which are set up along the river bank and <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> cook fish as they are caught.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP {{was used}} to test a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 was converted to replace the Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E

Outside of North Clymer, the route returns to an eastwest alignment prior to entering the town of Harmony and the village of Panama (intersecting CR33 in the latter) in quick succession. NY474 continues on, passing through the Harmony hamlet of Blockville and the North Harmony community of Ashville before terminating at NY394 {{just west of the}} Lakewood village limits in the town of Busti.|$|E
5|$|Galvis {{struggled}} off {{the field}} after his injury in 2012, noting that he only emerged from the covers of his <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> answer the door for takeout food, namely Chinese food, pizza, and cheesesteaks. Since then, he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries, to which he is apparently susceptible after his first back injury. His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball. Galvis married his wife, Anna, in 2013, and {{is the father of}} two girls named Anastasia and Nicole.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E

The portion of Broad Street between Allen and Main Streets was closed to all traffic in February and was originally scheduled to open on October30. It finally reopened to traffic on December3.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{was born}} in Buda on 7 July 1540. On {{learning}} of his birth, his father, who was on campaign in Transylvania, rode to his soldiers' camp to inform them of the good news.

He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this seems unlikely.|$|E

5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried to get out of <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E

5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a <b>bed,</b> <b>to</b> various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
