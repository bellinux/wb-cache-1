25|$|Healey was {{returned}} unopposed as deputy leader to Foot, {{but the next}} year was challenged by Tony Benn under the new election system, one in which individual members and trades unions voted alongside sitting member of parliament. The contest {{was seen as a}} battle for the soul of the Labour Party, and long debate over the summer of 1981 ended on 27 September with Healey winning by 50.4% to Benn's 49.6%. The narrowness of Healey's majority {{can be attributed to the}} Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) delegation to the Labour Party conference. Ignoring its members, who had shown two-to-one majority support for Healey, it cast the union's <b>block</b> <b>vote</b> (the largest in the union section) for Benn. A significant factor in Benn's narrow loss, however, was the abstention of 20 MPs from the left-wing Tribune Group, which split as a result. Healey attracted just enough support from other unions, constituency parties and Labour MPs to win.|$|E
50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>voting,</b> or {{plurality}} <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> {{is often}} compared with preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> as both systems tend to produce landslide victories for similar candidates. Instead {{of a series}} of checkboxes, preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> uses a preferential ballot. A slate of clones of the top preferred candidate will win every seat under both systems, however in preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> this is instead the instant-runoff winner.|$|R
50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> {{was used}} in the Australian Senate from 1901 to 1948; from 1918, this was {{preferential}} <b>block</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> is a {{majoritarian}} {{voting system}} for electing several representatives {{from a single}} multimember constituency. Unlike the single transferable <b>vote,</b> preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> is not a method for obtaining proportional representation, and instead produces similar results to plurality <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> of which {{it can be seen}} as the instant-runoff version. Under both systems, a single group of like-minded voters can win every seat, making both forms of <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> nonproportional.|$|R
25|$|From the 1870s the Order was {{involved}} in local and general elections, although Rory Sweetman argues that 'the longed-for Protestant <b>block</b> <b>vote</b> ultimately proved unobtainable'. Processions {{seem to have been}} unusual before the late 1870s: the Auckland lodges did not march until 1877 and in most places Orangemen celebrated the Twelfth and 5 November with dinners and concerts. The emergence of Orange parades in New Zealand was probably due to a Catholic revival movement which took place around this time. Although some parades resulted in rioting, Sweetman argues that the Order and its right to march were broadly supported by most New Zealanders, although many felt uneasy about the emergence of sectarianism in the colony. From 1912 to 1925 New Zealand's most famous Orangeman, William Massey, was Prime Minister. During World War I Massey co-led a coalition government with Irish Catholic Joseph Ward. Historian Geoffrey W. Rice maintains that Bill Massey's Orange sympathies were assumed rather than demonstrated.|$|E
500|$|On 14 December 2004, Griffin {{was arrested}} {{at his home in}} Wales, on {{suspicion}} of incitement to racial hatred, over remarks he made about Islam in an undercover BBC documentary titled The Secret Agent. He was questioned at a police station in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before being freed on police bail. He said that the arrest was [...] "an electoral scam to get the Muslim <b>block</b> <b>vote</b> back to the Labour party" [...] and that the Labour government was attempting to influence the results of the following year's general election.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{members of}} the party were unhappy with the {{proposed}} changes and several unions considered using their <b>block</b> <b>vote</b> to kill the motion, {{but in the end}} their leaderships backed down and settled for a new clause declaring the Labour Party a [...] "democratic socialist party". However, Labour had been ascendant in the opinion polls since the Black Wednesday economic fiasco {{a few months after the}} 1992 general election, and the increased lead of the polls under Blair's leadership remained strong in spite of the revolt, and the fact that the economy was growing again and unemployment was falling under Major's Conservative government. Labour's popularity was also helped by the fact that the Conservative government was now divided over Europe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> {{system has}} a number of {{features}} which can make it unrepresentative of the voters' intentions. <b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> regularly produces complete landslide majorities for the group of candidates with the highest level of support. Under <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> a slate of clones of the top-place candidate may win every available seat. A voter does have the option to select candidates of different political stripes if they wish, though.|$|R
50|$|With {{or without}} a {{preferential}} element, <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> systems {{have a number of}} features which can make them unrepresentative of the diversity of voters' intentions. <b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> regularly produces complete landslide majorities for the group of candidates with the highest level of support. Under preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> a slate of clones of the first winning candidate are guaranteed to win every available seat. Although less representative, this does tend to lead to greater agreement among those elected.|$|R

50|$|Partial <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> {{also called}} limited voting, {{functions}} similarly to plurality-at-large voting, however in partial <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> each voter receives fewer votes {{than the number}} of candidates to be elected. This in turn can enable reasonably sized minorities to achieve some representation, as it becomes impossible for a simple plurality to sweep every seat. Partial bloc voting is used for elections to the Gibraltar Parliament, where each voter has 10 votes and 17 seats are open for election; the usual result is that the most popular party wins 10 seats and forms the ruling administration, while the second most popular wins 7 seats and forms the opposition. Partial <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> is also used in the Spanish Senate, where there are 4 seats and each voter receives 3 <b>votes.</b> Historically, partial <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> was used in three- and four-member constituencies in the United Kingdom, where voters received two votes, until multimember constituencies were abolished.|$|R
