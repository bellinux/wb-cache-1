40|$|Active surface {{correction}} of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) primary mirror has been accomplished. The Dish Surface Optimization System (DSOS) {{has been designed}} and built to operate at the CSO, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The DSOS is the only active optics system {{of its kind in}} the world. There are 99 steel rod standoffs that interface the dish panels to its backing structure. Each standoff is now fitted with a heating/cooling assembly. Applying a controlled potential to each of the 99 assemblies adjusts the surface of the dish. Heating elongates and cooling shortens the standoffs, providing the push or pull on the primary’s panel surface. The needed correction for each standoff, for a given elevation, is determined from prior holography measurements of the dish surface.
