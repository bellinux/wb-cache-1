The planar Apollonius problem can <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sphere by an inverse stereographic projection; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar problem are possible besides the common ones described below.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 to <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms.

5|$|Widnes {{continues}} to be an industrial town and its major industry is still the manufacture of chemicals although there has been some diversification in recent years. In 2006 a new freight park, known as the 3MG Mersey Multimodal Gateway, was opened in the West Bank area of the town. This provides a link for freight arriving by road, air or sea to <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rail network. It is expected to create up to 5,000 new jobs.|$|E

5|$|Cole Street and the Cole Street Conservation Precinct at Point Cook Base, RAAF Williams, {{are named}} for Adrian Cole. His decorations were {{held by the}} Naval and Military Club, Melbourne, {{where he had been}} a long-standing member. In July 2009, {{following}} the club's dissolution, the medals were to be auctioned along with other memorabilia. This action was challenged by Cole's family, who argued that his decorations were only on loan to the club, and should be donated to the Australian War Memorial (AWM). As the Supreme Court of Victoria deliberated on the case, the parties involved negotiated a settlement whereby Cole's medals would <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AWM.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Sachsen class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sites of enemy landings.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese surrender, the 27th Battalion ceased {{operations}} and was transported to Torokina, {{where they had}} to wait for shipping to become available for repatriation back to Australia to begin the demobilisation process. This process began in October 1945, albeit slowly, and gradually the battalion's numbers decreased as men were repatriated back to Australia or were transferred to other units for further service. Long service men received priority for discharge, while some men volunteered to <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battalions of the 34th Brigade that were being formed on Morotai Island for service as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Finally, on 1 May 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
