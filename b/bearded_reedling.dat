5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling,</b> together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E

2500|$|Major [...] "wastebin" [...] {{families}} {{such as the}} Old World warblers and Old World babblers {{have turned}} out to be paraphyletic and are being rearranged. Several taxa turned out to represent highly distinct species-poor lineages, so new families had to be established, some of them – like the stitchbird of New Zealand and the Eurasian <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> – monotypic with only one living species. In the Passeri alone, a number of minor lineages will eventually be recognized as distinct superfamilies. For example, the kinglets constitute a single genus with less than 10 species today, but seem to have been among the first perching bird lineages to diverge as the group spread across Eurasia. No particularly close relatives of them have been found among comprehensive studies of the living Passeri, though they might be fairly close to some little-studied tropical Asian groups. Treatment of the nuthatches, wrens, and their closest relatives as a distinct superfamily Certhioidea is increasingly considered justified; the same might eventually apply to the tits and their closest relatives.|$|E
6000|$|Generic Areas.--Having thus {{obtained}} a tolerably {{clear idea of}} the main facts as to the distribution of isolated species, let us now consider those collections of closely-allied species termed genera. What a genus is will be sufficiently understood by a few illustrations. All {{the different kinds of}} dogs, jackals, and wolves belong to the dog genus, Canis; the tiger, lion, leopard, jaguar, and the wild cats, to the cat genus, Felis; the blackbird, song-thrush, missel-thrush, fieldfare, and many others to the thrush genus, Turdus; the crow, rook, raven, and jackdaw, to the crow genus, Corvus; but the magpie belongs to another, though closely-allied genus, Pica, distinguished by the different form and proportions of its wings and tail from all the species of the crow genus. The number of species in a genus varies greatly, from one up to several hundreds. The giraffe, the glutton, the walrus, the <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling,</b> the secretary-bird, and many others, have no close allies, and each forms a genus by itself. The beaver genus, Castor, and the camel genus, Camelus, each consist of two species. On the other hand, the deer genus, Cervus has forty species; the mouse and rat genus, Mus more than a hundred species; and there is about the same number of the thrush genus; while among the lower classes of animals genera are often very extensive, the fine genus Papilio, or swallow-tailed butterflies, containing more than four hundred species; and Cicindela, which includes our native tiger beetles, has about the same number. Many genera of shells are very extensive, and one of them--the genus Helix, including the commonest snails, and ranging all over the world--is probably the most extensive in the animal kingdom, numbering about two thousand described species.[5] ...|$|E

50|$|Benacre NNR {{consists}} of areas of open water lagoons and reed beds along the Suffolk coast including Benacre Broad, Covehithe Broad and Easton Broad and extending {{as far south}} as Reydon. The reserve features extensive reedbeds, woodland and heathland, as well as pits created by gravel extraction. There are over 100 species of breeding birds, including marsh harrier, <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling,</b> water rail, and occasionally bittern. The flora includes seakale, sea holly, and yellow-horned poppy. Reed is farmed commercially for the thatching industry, whilst enabling the <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> to find a habitat.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> (Panurus biarmicus) {{has a few}} {{subspecies}} {{across its}} range, but belongs to the genus Panurus, which current knowledge considers monotypic (the only genus) within the family Panuridae.|$|E
50|$|Breeding species include {{reed and}} sedge warbler and water rail. Wintering species include <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling,</b> snipe, {{redshank}} and bittern. During the migration periods {{significant numbers of}} swallow and sand martin are seen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> (Panurus biarmicus) is a small, sexually dimorphic reed-bed {{passerine}} bird. It {{is frequently}} {{known as the}} bearded tit, due to some similarities to the long-tailed tit, or the bearded parrotbill.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the birds}} {{living in the}} area are the Eurasian Spoonbill, the Montagu's Harrier, the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Reedling,</b> and the Bluethroat. For the winter, hundred {{thousands}} of birds migrate to the area, like the Eurasian Wigeon, the Tundra Swan, and the Barnacle Goose.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> or [...] "bearded tit", an Eurasian species long placed here, is more insectivorous by comparison, {{especially}} in summer.

50|$|Since 1990 (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990), {{molecular}} data {{has been added}} to aid the efforts of discovering the parrotbills' true relationships. As Paradoxornis species are generally elusive and in many cases little-known birds, usually specimens of the <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> which are far more easy to procure were used for the analyses. Often, the entire group was entirely left out of analyses, being small and seemingly insignificant in the large pattern of bird evolution (e.g. Barker et al. 2002, 2004). The <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> tended to appear close to larks in phylogenies based on e.g. DNA-DNA hybridization (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990), or on mtDNA cytochrome b and nDNA c-myc exon 3, RAG-1 and myoglobin intron 2 sequence data (Ericson & Johansson 2003). Placement in a superfamily Sylvioidea which contained birds such as Sylviidae, Timaliidae and long-tailed tits - but not Paridae - was confirmed.|$|E
50|$|Many {{animals are}} adapted {{to living in}} and around reed-beds. These include mammals such as Eurasian otter, European beaver, water vole, Eurasian harvest mouse and water shrew, and birds such as great bittern, purple heron, European spoonbill, water rail (and other rails), purple gallinule, marsh harrier, various warblers (reed warbler, sedge warbler etc.), <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> and reed bunting.|$|E
50|$|There are 214 {{recorded}} {{species of}} birds, 140 {{of them being}} protected as natural rarities. Most of the species are migratory.

50|$|Lake Amik was an {{extremely}} valuable habitat on the migratory routes of waterfowl and other birds, especially white storks and pelicans, and was noted for an isolated breeding population of the African darter. It also supported populations of endemic birds; a possible distinct subspecies of the black francolin (Francolinus francolinus billypayni) and the similarly distinct southern Turkish <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> (Panurus biarmicus kosswigi). A ray-finned fish species Hemigrammocapoeta caudomaculata was only known from Lake Amik, while the cyprinid Jordan himri was found nowhere else in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} of {{international}} importance for migratory, over wintering and breeding wetland birds.

Amongst the breeding species found here are pied avocet, common redshank, common snipe, northern lapwing, water rail, <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling,</b> common tern and garganey. Migrating species include black-tailed godwit, ruff, little stint, curlew sandpiper and whimbrel. Overwintering species include brent goose, dunlin, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian wigeon, merlin, hen harrier, short-eared owl, Eurasian bittern and twite.|$|E
5000|$|Cibois (2003a) {{analyzed}} mtDNA cytochrome b and 12S/16S rRNA {{sequences of}} some Sylvioidea, among them {{several species of}} Paradoxornis but not the <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling.</b> These formed a robust clade closer to the Sylvia typical warblers and some presumed [...] "Old World babblers" [...] such as Chrysomma sinense than to other birds. The puzzle was finally resolved by Alström et al. (2006), who studied mtDNA cytochrome b and nDNA myoglobin intron 2 sequences of {{a wider range of}} Sylvioidea: The <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> was not a parrotbill at all, but forms a distinct lineage on its own, the relationships of which are not entirely resolved at present. The parrotbills' presence in the clade containing Sylvia, on the other hand, necessitates that the Paradoxornithidae are placed in synonymy of the Sylviidae. Cibois (2003b) even suggested that these themselves were to be merged with the remaining Timaliidae and the latter name to be adopted. This has hitherto not been followed and researchers remain equivocal as many taxa in Sylviidae and Timaliidae remain to be tested for their relationships. In any case, it is most likely that the typical warbler-parrotbill group is monophyletic and therefore agrees with the modern requirements for a taxon. Hence, whether to keep or to synonymize it is entirely a matter of philosophy, as the scientific facts would agree with either approach.|$|E
50|$|The Parco dell'Oglio Sud {{is another}} {{regional}} park that {{lies on the}} boundary of the province with the province of Cremona. It was established in 1988 and has an area of about 12,800 hectares. It is a river park that runs along the stretch of the river Oglio which forms the boundary. It lies {{to the south of}} Lake Iseo and the administrative centre is at Calvatone. Birds present in this park include great egret, grey heron, Montagu's harrier, Eurasian scops owl, <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling,</b> woodcock, barred warbler, crested lark, sedge warbler, moustached warbler, little egret, Eurasian hobby and ferruginous duck.|$|E

In the night time sedge warbler and reed warbler are regularly heard, while grasshopper warbler, river warbler, marsh warbler, and great reed warbler are reported now and then. Osprey are regularly seen fishing in the lake. Uncountable numbers of resting species are reported by the lake, including various swans, hawks, eagles, cormorants, and sparrows.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} {{is believed to}} originate from birds escaping from a nearby bird-trader. By 1999, the number of birds in the swamp had grown to {{at least a hundred}} individuals; in December 1998, the parrotbills were also observed in two localities on the Lago di Varese. By the early 21st century, the birds are well-established as resident breeders. They are the only self-sustaining parrotbill population found in Europe, as it was discovered that the <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> (Panurus biarmicus) [...] - [...] long believed to be an aberrant parrotbill [...] - [...] is actually a distinct lineage with no known relatives among the Passerida.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> was {{formerly}} placed with the parrotbills {{in the family}} Paradoxornithidae, after they {{were removed from the}} true tits in the family Paridae. More recent research suggests it is a unique songbird - no other living species seems to be particularly closely related to it. If this is correct, the monotypic family Panuridae must again be recognized. The current genus name, Panurus, is from Ancient Greek panu, [...] "exceedingly", and ουρά, [...] "tail". The specific biarmicus is from [...] "Biarmia", a Latinised form of Bjarmaland formerly part of what is now the Arkhangelsk Oblast area of Russia.|$|E

5000|$|As {{names like}} [...] "bearded tit" [...] imply, their general habitus and acrobatic habits {{resemble}} birds like the long-tailed tits. Together with these and others {{they were at}} some time placed in the titmouse family Paridae. Later studies found no justification to presume a close relationship between all these birds, and consequently the parrotbills and <b>bearded</b> <b>reedling</b> {{were removed from the}} tits and chickadees and placed into a distinct family, Paradoxornithidae. As names like Paradoxornis paradoxus - [...] "puzzling, paradox bird" [...] - suggest, their true relationships were very unclear, although by the latter 20th century they were generally seen as close to Timaliidae ("Old World babblers") and Sylviidae ("Old World warblers").|$|E
