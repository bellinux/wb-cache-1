5|$|Croitoru joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) in 1994, {{where he}} was given the ring name Bruiser Bedlam. According to the storyline, he was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> manager Jim Cornette to help settle Cornette's feud with Bob Armstrong. Bedlam and Cornette {{combined}} for a victory in a two-on-one handicap match over Armstrong at SMW's Blue Grass Brawl II show on April 1. That year, he wrestled many tag team and six-man matches while teaming with Cornette.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the WWF {{reinstated}} its Women's Championship, a {{title that}} had been vacant since 1990, and Miceli was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> the company to revive the women's division. She debuted under the ring name Alundra Blayze, because WWF owner Vince McMahon {{did not want to}} pay Miceli to use the name Madusa, which she had trademarked. She wrestled in a six-woman tournament to crown a new Women's Champion, and in the finals, she pinned Heidi Lee Morgan on December 13 to win the title.|$|E

5|$|Manning Camp Campground is {{the main}} staging area for firefighters, trail-maintenance crews, and {{scientists}} working in the RMD. Their supplies are <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> pack mules that are kept in corrals at the site. Runoff from a nearby spring, the largest in Rincons, provides water for the livestock.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline transport: The ancient Chinese {{made use}} of {{channels}} and pipe systems for public works. The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> a stoneware pipe system.|$|E

5|$|Silver treasures, {{common in}} the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas {{including}} Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often cut into pieces, {{are believed to have}} served as currency units, <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or depositing them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E
5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5000|$|Scholars such as Mufti Abdur-Rahman {{have pointed}} out that the book being <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> {{question}} <b>by</b> Wensick is actually another work by Abu Hanifa called: [...] "Al-Fiqh Al-Absat".|$|R

5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, {{a mass of}} hot and wet air, {{brought by}} the south and western {{maritime}} winds, creates Póvoa de Varzim's characteristic fog covering only the coast and with strong ocean scent <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> the marine layer, which is composed of salt from surf and sea spray, with lesser amounts of iodine from the outlying kelp forests. Sunshine duration values are high, between April and September the mean is always over 217 hours, peaking in July with 308 hours. The gloomiest months are December and January with 124 hours each (1961–1990 data). Solar irradiance is high in the city's beaches, and lower inland and in the northwestern coast. The prevailing northern winds, known as Nortadas, arise in the summer after midday. Strongest wind gusts are felt in the city's sands and only reaching inland in municipalities south of Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E
5|$|In the Klondike stampede, an {{estimated}} 100,000 {{people tried to}} reach the Klondike goldfields, of whom only around 30,000 to 40,000 eventually did. It formed {{the height of the}} Klondike gold rush from the summer of 1897 until the summer of 1898. It began on July 15, 1897 in San Francisco and was spurred further two days later in Seattle, when the first of the early prospectors returned from the Klondike, bringing with them large amounts of gold on the ships Excelsior and Portland. The press reported that a total of $1,139,000 (equivalent to $1,000 million at 2010 prices) had been <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> these ships, although this proved to be an underestimate. The migration of prospectors caught so much attention that it was joined by outfitters, writers and photographers.|$|E

60|$|This sally was {{received}} with laughter and applause, for local feeling {{was very strong}} in Stokebridge, and a storm of jeers and rough chaff were poured upon the bagmen for having been <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> prisoners <b>by</b> a child.|$|R
5|$|Instead Taylor {{ran down}} the Armed Forces, letting go 2,400–2,600 former personnel, {{many of whom were}} Krahn <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> former President Doe, in December 1997 – January 1998, and {{building}} up instead the Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), the Special Operations Division of the Liberian National Police, and the Special Security Service. On November 19, 1999, Taylor named General Kpenkpah Konah as the new Chief of Staff of the AFL (where he would stay until 2006) and John Tarnue as head of the army. Tarnue was later implicated in a land dispute in 1999, while acting as AFL commander.|$|E
5|$|The burgesses, who {{had little}} {{independence}} under the abbey, tried to obtain self-government after {{the dissolution of}} the monasteries. The king ordered Letters Patent to be drawn up granting their requests, but it was not implemented. In 1550 the Liberty of Whitby Strand, except for Hackness, was granted to the Earl of Warwick who in 1551 conveyed it to Sir John York and his wife Anne who sold the lease to the Cholmleys. In the reign of Elizabeth I, Whitby was a small fishing port. In 1635 the owners of the liberty governed the port and town where 24 burgesses had the privilege of buying and selling goods <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> sea. Burgage tenure continued until 1837, when by an Act of Parliament, government of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from [...] "Aelfweard's settlement", with the chapel prefix being added in 1708 to {{distinguish}} it from the adjourning Stone Allerton. The manor was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> 1492 <b>by</b> John Gunthorpe and passed to the Bishop of Wells.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{changes in}} the {{language}} {{and management of the}} province were <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> 1515 <b>by</b> Mahmoud Pasha Elekhani. It is believed that a variant of his name, Elah, was transformed into Iluh and gave the old name to Batman city.|$|R
5000|$|Raisin Bombers (Rosinenbomber) or (in US English) [...] "Candy Bombers" [...] were colloquial terms Berliners {{gave to the}} Western Allied (American and British) {{transport}} aircraft which <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> supplies <b>by</b> airlift to West Berlin during the Soviet Berlin Blockade in 1948/1949.|$|R
5|$|The giraffe {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans, who {{believed}} that it was an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard and called it camelopardalis. The giraffe was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> Julius Caesar in 46 BC and exhibited to the public. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of {{the border between the}} two Koreas and could be crossed in either {{direction}} throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{began in}} November 1959, {{with a series}} of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes following false reports of the murder of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread throughout the country. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a counterattack to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and the Belgians but were thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest, who was <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> the colonial governor. Logiest reestablished law and order, beginning a programme to promote and protect the Hutu elite. The Belgians then replaced many Tutsi chiefs and sub-chiefs with Hutu, consigning King Kigeli V to figurehead status; Kigeli later fled the country. Despite continued anti-Tutsi violence, Belgium organised local elections in mid-1960. Hutu parties gained control of nearly all communes, effectively ending the revolution. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared Rwanda an autonomous republic in 1961, and the country became independent in 1962.|$|E
