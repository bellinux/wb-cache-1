500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> kinds of films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio {{interest}} in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998. [...] "I had never really done something that {{was more of a}} horror film," [...] he explained, [...] "and it's funny, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> kind of movies that I like probably more than any other genre." [...] His {{interest in}} directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It {{was one of the things}} that maybe shaped what I like to do." [...] Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{the speaker}} must {{contemplate}} [...] {{more than just}} the object itself; it is sublime in its greater context. Now, Coleridge's views on the sublime are unique because Coleridge believed that Nature was only occasionally sublime, that is, only in the sky, the sea and the desert, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only objects in nature that are boundless. For this reason, Coleridge's [...] "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" [...] is often considered sublime, though {{it is one of the}} few works in which Coleridge expresses the natural world as being sublime. In most of Coleridge's other works, he focuses on the [...] "metaphysical sublime," [...] which is found in the 'in between's of the world (earth and sea, sky and sea, etc.). But Coleridge didn't demand the sensation of terror or awe within the sight, rather, he focused on the element of infinity.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> sides <b>are</b> {{conventionally}} called White and Black.

50|$|Solutions to {{minimize}} the factors that lead to extinction and risk of extinction often overlap because the factors themselves overlap.

50|$|The median {{household}} income in the United States was $44,389 in 2005, and households making over $75,000 per year made up the top quartile of household incomes. <b>Because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> households generally required to compute the AMT (though only a fraction currently have to pay), some argue that the AMT still hits only the wealthy or the upper middle class. However, some counties, such as Fairfax County, Virginia ($102,460), and some cities, such as San Jose, California ($76,354), have local median incomes that are considerably {{higher than the national}} median, and approach or exceed the typical AMT threshold.|$|E

50|$|The first Gyeongnam International Music Competition {{was held}} in 2003. The {{organizers}} originally wanted different instrument disciplines. The first discipline selected was cello, since Yun was a famed cellist, and he had composed his first concerto for cello in 1975-76. The organizers then selected violin and piano, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> top two disciplines to present the highest quantity of international competitions, and because Yun wrote many works involving those two instruments. They also found that after one cycle of three editions, the winners {{had an opportunity to}} collaborate and play in piano trios.|$|R

After the successful season the next possible step is Continental of World Formula 3 series, lates one of the Formula 2 series or Indy Car type series.

50|$|Residents {{of group}} homes {{usually have a}} disability, such as autism, {{intellectual}} disability, chronic or long-term mental/psychiatric disorder, or physical or even multiple disabilities <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> non-profit and state-regional organizations which began and operated the homes. Some group homes were funded as transitional homes to prepare for independent living (in an apartment or return to family or marriage and employment), and others were viewed as permanent community homes.
