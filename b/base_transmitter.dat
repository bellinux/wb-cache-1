In this paper, a new methodology of mobile positioning integrating both GSM network using signal strengths and GPS readings {{in the light of}} an assisted GPS based approach. The methodology employs an extended Kalman filter approach in which the stochastic errors related to various measurements are appropriately characterized and modeled. The methodology uses Netmonitor software to retrieve network information including signal strength and cell-identities of various <b>base</b> <b>transmitter</b> stations (BTS). The distance from the mobile station (MS) to each BTS is therefore determined using Hata-Okumura radio propagation model. The different distances and the GPS readings are therefore combined in the framework of extended static Kalman filter. Once positioning is achieved, a.

40|$|Wireless power {{transmission}} {{is a method}} of supplying power to small electronic devices {{when there is no}} wired connection. One way to increase the range of these systems is to use a directional transmitting antenna, the problem with this approach is that power can only be transmitted through a narrow beam and directly forward, requiring the transmitter to always be aligned with the sensor node position. The work outlined in this article describes the design and testing of an autonomous radio frequency power transfer system that is capable of rotating the <b>base</b> <b>transmitter</b> to track the position of sensor nodes and transferring power to that sensor node. The system’s base station monitors the node’s energy levels and forms a charge queue to plan charging order and maintain energy levels of the nodes.

Data on possible health effects of EMW in developing countries are rare. This study was conducted to determine the awareness and self-reported health hazards of EMW from the mobile phone BTS in Dhaka city. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 respondents living around BTS in Dhaka city. Data was collected on sociodemographic characteristics, mobile phone use, BTS and EMW awareness, and self-reported health problems. Results. The majority of respondents (92. 7 %) reported to have seen a BTS but only 29. 5 % knows how it works and 74. 5 % had no knowledge about the EMW. 49 % respondents experienced sleeping disturbances while recent episodes of headache or dizziness were reported by 47 % and mood change or anxiety or depression by 41 %. About 22 % complained about other physical or mental symptoms. Conclusion. Awareness about the possible health hazards from EMW of BTS is low among the inhabitants of Dhaka city.

40|$|ABSTRACT There {{is a need}} to {{quantify}} the environ-mental impact of powering macro <b>base</b> <b>transmitter</b> station sites with diesel generators. The energy con-sumption of diesel generators to power base stations for telecommunication networks is a contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents a model for calculating emission generation. The model was used to study the environmental im-pact of macro radio base stations powered by diesel generators using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) - optimization and simulation software tool. The environmental impact of powering base stations with diesel generators was assessed by quantifying the emissions generated in terms of pollution and the impact in terms of environ-mental cost ($ 200 t/yr). From the results of emissions generated from diesel generators and presented in this study [105. 96 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2), 0. 26 tonnes of carbon monoxide (CO), 0. 03 tonnes of un-burned hydrocarbons (UHC), 0. 02 tonnes of particu-late matter (PM), 0. 21 tonnes of sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and 2. 33 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (NOX) ], the use of diesel generators to power GSM base station sites is concluded to have significant environmental impact...|$|E

High capacities were found for full, as well as smaller array configurations, all within 80 % of the fully scattering channel capacity. Correlation model parameters are derived from data. Spatial MIMO channel capacity statistics {{are found to be}} well represented by the separate transmitter and receiver correlation matrices, with a median relative error in capacity of 3 %, in contrast with the 18 % median relative error observed by assuming the antennas to be uncorre-lated. A reduced parameter model, consisting of 4 parameters, has been developed to statistically represent the channel correlation matrices. These correlation matrices are, in turn, used to generate matrices with capacities that are consistent within a few percent of those measured in New York. The spatial channel model reported allows simulations of matrices for arbitrary antenna configurations. These channel matrices may be used to test receiver algorithms in system performance studies. These results may also be used for antenna array design, as the decay of mobile antenna correlation with antenna separation has been reported here. An important finding for the <b>base</b> <b>transmitter</b> array was that the antennas were largely uncorrelated even at antenna separations as small as two wavelengths.

40|$|Photovoltaic cell {{generation}} is the technique which uses photovoltaic cell to convert solar energy into electrical energy. Now a day, the photovoltaic generation is developing increasingly {{fast as a}} renewable energy source. The functioning of a photovoltaic cell as the power generator is equivalent to an electric circuit containing a current generator, diode, series and shunt resistance. This paper presents a modeling and simulation of a photovoltaic system constitutes of a generator photovoltaic (PVG), DC-DC converter (boost chopper) to transfer the maximum power to a <b>base</b> <b>transmitter</b> station. The temperature and irradiance effects on the PVG will be studied, particularly on the variables such as the short circuit current Icc, the open circuit voltage Voc. Depending on the load (BTS, I= 60 A, V= 48 V) profile and climatic factors influencing, {{we can find a}} highly gap between the maximum power supplied by the PVG and that actually transferred to the BTS. A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) based on a boost converter commanded by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used for extracting the maximum power from the PVG. Thus, a real time tracking of the optimal point of functioning is necessary to optimize the efficiency on the system. The modeling and simulation of the system (PVG, boost converter, PWM and MPPT algorithm of Perturbation and Observation P&O) is then made with Matlab/Simulink softwar...|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a system}} with a xed number (K) of remote units and a single <b>base</b> <b>transmitter</b> with time varying (and perhaps correlated) {{connecting}} channels. Data to be transmitted to the remote units arrives according to some random process and is queued according to its destination. The forward link is treated. Power is to be allocated to the K channels in a queue and channel state dependent way to minimize some cost criterion. The modeling and control problem can be quite difficult. The channel time variations (fading) are fast and the bandwidth and data arrival rates are high. Owing {{to the complexity of}} the physical problem and the high speed of both the fading and arrival and service rates, an asymptotic or averaging method is promising. A heavy traffic analysis is done. By heavy traffic, we mean that on the average there is little server idle time and little spare power over the "average" requirements. Heavy traffic analysis has been very helpful in simplifying analysis of both controlled and uncontrolled problems in queueing and communications networks. It tends to eliminate unessential detail and focus on the fundamental issues of scaling and parametric dependencies. To illustrate the scope of the method, a variety of models are considered. The basic model assumes that the channel state is known or can be well estimated and that given the channel state there is a well defined rate of transmission per unit power. Then convergence of the controlled scaled queue lengths is shown. The scaling is different from the usual in heavy traffic work, and the limit Wiener process depends only on the channel state process and not on the [...] ...|$|E
