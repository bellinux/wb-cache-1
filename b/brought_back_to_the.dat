5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to be <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E

He also designed a portable 4 MeV betatron for inspecting dud bombs.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, {{the number}} of {{attendees}} at St. Peter Church began to dwindle. Many of the priests who had served the congregation had been reassigned a few years earlier. In 1908, a popular priest, Father Sacchi, was sent to Mother of Sorrows Church in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Parishioners formed a committee to go speak to the Bishop on Father Sacchi's behalf. Although Father Sacchi {{was not allowed to}} return to St. Peter, Reverend James Vocca, who had also been at St. Peter prior to his reassignment, was <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church.|$|E

The bas relief on her grave marker was created by sculptor Jo Davidson.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{displays}} a 2,400-year-old female Egyptian mummy {{on loan from}} the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. The mummy, which dates to 320 or 330 B.C. in the Ptolemaic era, was discovered in Northern Egypt and <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States by a Dutch Reformed missionary who served there in the early 1700s.

5|$|The zoo {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> zoo to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at the zoo as of March 2010.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{played as}} an inside linebacker {{throughout}} the preseason in 1993, {{but he was}} again cut to the practice squad {{before the start of}} the regular season. He was quickly <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> active roster and recorded five tackles in the Lions' season-opening win against the Toronto Argonauts. Allen saw regular playing time for the first time in his career, playing in fifteen regular season games for the Lions. He played mostly as a middle linebacker, but he briefly replaced Tyrone Jones twice at the outside linebacker position while he was recovering illness and injury. Allen finished the regular season with 67 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. He also recovered a fumble in the Western Semi-Final, but the Lions went on to lose 9–17 to the Stampeders.|$|E
5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E

After being <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farmhouse, Bryce is told to accept that he is mediocre and ordinary. Elsewhere, Black and Watts {{interview}} Roe again, who seems to espouse the same mindset. Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by a fear of failure. Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler {{is nowhere to be}} found.|$|E

5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E
5|$|The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was {{initially}} divided up, with each company {{attached to a}} different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company—assigned to the 25th Brigade—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area {{in an effort to}} prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a costly assault against the Vichy French at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July.|$|E
5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{considered}} {{sending the}} two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans {{to abandon the}} plan. Bremse {{was one of the}} ships interned at Scapa Flow {{under the terms of the}} armistice in November 1918. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for Ernest Cox, though they had to contend with large quantities of oil and the risks of fires and explosions. Having been <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The Palladium cinema {{was opened}} as the Empire in 1913 in a {{building}} which had previously been a brewery. It closed in 1993 and various {{attempts were made to}} turn it into a club and shop, before Wetherspoons announced in January 2015 that they had acquired the site and intended to seek planning and licensing permission to convert it to a pub. The town was left without cinema for almost two decades. Cinema was <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town under the Palladium name in 2012 with a new community cinema at the Town Hall. In 2013, permanent cinema equipment was installed in the building and there are now regular film screenings of both modern and classic films.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies were}} then doused with petrol, {{but they were}} only {{partially}} burned and not buried. A few days later, Voss was <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bunker by the Soviets to identify the partly burned bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Braun, General Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, {{a tributary of the}} nearby Elbe.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{became the}} see {{of the newly}} founded Archbishopric of Dyrrhachium {{in the second half}} of the 18th century. In more recent times the monastery fell into disrepair, and in the 1960s it was closed by Albania's Communist authorities; in 1967 the reliquary with the saint's relics was moved to StMary's Church in Elbasan. The {{dilapidated}} monastery was returned to the Church in the 1990s. The restoration of its church and other buildings was completed in 2005. Since around 1995 the relics have been kept in the Orthodox cathedral of Tirana, the capital of Albania, and are <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monastery only for the saint's feast day.|$|E
