5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl <b>benzoate,</b> and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium <b>benzoate.</b> The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium <b>benzoate,</b> known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering agent is thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E

25|$|The {{major cause}} of benzene in soft drinks is the {{decarboxylation}} of benzoic acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).

40|$|International {{audience}} 13 C NMR {{spectra of}} 37 ortho -, meta - and para -substituted phenyl <b>benzoates,</b> containing substituents in benzoyl and phenyl moiety, 4 ortho -substituted methyl and 5 ethyl <b>benzoates,</b> {{as well as}} 9 alkyl <b>benzoates</b> have been recorded. The influence of the ortho substituents on the carbonyl carbon 13 C NMR chemical shift, δ CO, {{was found to be}} described by a linear multiple regression equation containing the inductive, resonance and steric substituent constants. For all the ortho -substituted esters containing substituents in acyl part as well as phenyl part the substituent–induced reverse inductive effect (ρ I ∠ 0), the normal resonance effect (ρ R ≥ 0), and the negative steric effect (δ ortho ∠ 0) with the E s B were observed. In the case of ortho substituents in phenyl part the resonance effect was negligible. Due to inductive effect the ortho electron-withdrawing substituents showed upfield shift or shielding of the carbonyl carbon, while the electron-donating substituents had an opposite effect. Because of the sterical consequences ortho substituents revealed deshielding effect on the 13 C NMR chemical shift of the carbonyl carbon. For all the meta - and para -substituted esters the reverse substituent-induced inductive and resonance effects (ρ I ∠ 0, ρ R ∠ 0) were found to be significant. In alkyl <b>benzoates</b> the alkyl substituents showed the reverse inductive and steric effects.
