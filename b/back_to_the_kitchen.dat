60|$|Little Joyce piloted Madame Laurin {{home and}} into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> stairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> chamber--a {{proceeding}} {{which would have}} filled Aunt Isabella with horror if she had known. But Madame Laurin {{did not seem to}} mind, and Little Joyce never thought about it at all. It was Little Joyce's awkward, unMarshall-like fashion to go to a place by the shortest way there, even if it was up <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> stairs.|$|R

50|$|The new recruits' {{first trip}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{trenches}} with <b>the</b> veterans, <b>to</b> re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and runs into machine-gun fire. After spending {{several days in}} a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field <b>kitchens</b> <b>to</b> get their rations; each man receives double helpings, {{simply because of the}} number of dead.|$|R

25|$|Journalist Joe Tiernan {{suggested}} that the bombs were activated by Billy Hanna. Sometime before 4.00 p.m., Jackson and Hanna headed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Northern Ireland in the poultry lorry after the latter had given <b>the</b> final instructions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drivers of the car bombs. Upon their return, Jackson and Hanna went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soup <b>kitchen</b> they were running at a Mourneville, Lurgan bingo hall. With the UWC strike in its third day, it was extremely difficult for people throughout Northern Ireland to obtain necessities such as food. Neither man's absence had been noticed by the other helpers.|$|R

Before they can release the Second Doctor and escape the hacienda, however, Shockeye shows up with the unconscious Peri. The Second Doctor feigns unconsciousness while the others hide.|$|R
6000|$|... "At this he got {{up slowly}} from amongst all sorts of rubbish, stiff, hungry, trembling, miserable, and doubtful. 'Can you eat this?' she asked in her soft and timid voice. He must have taken her for a 'gracious lady.' He devoured ferociously, and tears were falling on the crust. Suddenly he dropped the bread, seized her wrist, and {{imprinted}} a kiss on her hand. She was not frightened. Through his forlorn condition she had observed that he was good-looking. She {{shut the door and}} walked <b>back</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Much later on, she told Mrs. Smith, who shuddered at the bare idea of being touched by that creature.|$|R
60|$|They {{had looked}} at each other, and seen each other strange, yet near, very near, like a hawk stooping, swooping, {{dropping}} into a flame of darkness. So she took the candle and they went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E

Von Helsing comes upon the scene and uses a syringe <b>to</b> drug <b>the</b> witch.

Then they go to Von Helsing's cave to pick up some ritual tools in order to exorcise Vardella.|$|R
50|$|The mobile drops {{what appears}} {{at first to}} be a large lump of dough which emerges from behind the boy as a creepy clown-like {{gingerbread}} man named Dan Dan. Dan Dan insists that Hansel eat him and begins driving Hansel crazy with his incessant screaming on the matter. Finally, Hansel takes Dan Dan's head, the one part he refused to eat, and throws him into the wall, shattering Dan Dan <b>to</b> pieces. <b>The</b> witch, by this point, had taken Gretel down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> begin heating <b>the</b> oven <b>to</b> cook Hansel. <b>The</b> witch pulls a chain hanging from her ceiling which causes two long arms <b>to</b> drop from <b>the</b> mobile above Hansel and bring him <b>back</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> so she could begin baking him. Before the witch can shove Hansel into her oven, however, Gretel grabs the fire iron beside the oven and hits the witch in the back with it. Enraged, the witch fights the children in a kung fu-style battle.|$|R
5000|$|He {{wakes up}} <b>to</b> venture <b>back</b> downstairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> though {{when he gets}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door he notices a sprout coming through the keyhole.

Nyle tries <b>to</b> escape; however <b>the</b> dead Mr. Potato Head's spuds spawn veer toward Nyle's face, causing him <b>to</b> fall. <b>The</b> potatoes begin <b>to</b> inhabit his body planting themselves within. After some time Nyle wakes up in a very dark place - the box he originally encountered upon his arrival at [...] "The Taits".

60|$|Dora, {{from the}} kitchen window, saw Ralph {{go out to the}} woodhouse, and she saw him {{returning}} with an arm-load of small sticks. Then she turned her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door, and bent her head over a beefsteak she was preparing for the gridiron.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I can't be in a worse plight than I am already, so I {{will take}} your advice.' And she ran <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and filled her sieve with ashes.

60|$|He ran his eye {{over the}} money, counted it, {{and went to}} the front door. She heard the door open and close, and knew that the silver had been flung into the street.

2500|$|With {{the devices}} armed and each boot laden with its lethal cargo, Hanna then gave <b>the</b> final {{instructions}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drivers {{of the three}} car bombs and they set off on their mission towards Dublin's crowded city centre.

Their absence had not been noticed by the other helpers. [...] Tiernan later interviewed an elderly woman who described Hanna as the [...] "head buck cat" [...] of this food parcel service.|$|R

He also installed a call bell system, with buttons in each room and an annunciator in the back hall. Pope began to see patients in the house during the 1920s and 1930s, when his health began <b>to</b> fail. <b>The</b> small area {{at the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> hall, adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> was configured <b>to</b> include a small hand sink and built-in cabinet for instruments.|$|R
50|$|Turning down several {{teaching}} fellowships, Bogner {{chose to}} go to Europe to explore in person what he had learned in school. According to Bogner, after several trips with his father across the United States, he knew traveling in Europe was {{what he needed to}} learn more about the real people he was going to write about. While his mother encouraged him in this decision, his father basically turned his back on Bogner and refused to offer any financial or emotional support, if Bogner chose to be a writer and traveled in Europe, rather than staying in <b>the</b> United States <b>to</b> further his career as a lawyer, doctor, or professor. <b>To</b> earn <b>the</b> money he needed to follow through on his plan, this meant Bogner went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> doing <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> work he’d done at resorts and restaurants in the Catskill Mountains and at Cape Cod during the summers while in school. At this point, he worked “on the line” as a chef and saucier.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{accordingly}} went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> They {{found that}} Dorothy {{had taken the}} nails away from the fire, and they were now almost cool.

50|$|Smith decides <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> inept Mrs. Omsk by conjuring up Bizetti, a Master Chef, to {{show her}} how to cook. Unable to work in such messy surroundings, Bizetti accepts Smith's offer to tidy up by {{reversing}} <b>the</b> scene <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spotless, organized <b>kitchen</b> before Mrs. Omsk's culinary attempts. Smith's uncanny film-editing magic of replacing the old frozen duck with a better one surprises Mrs. Omsk and excites Bizetti, who cleans the duck, stuffs it and sews it up. As the duck cooks in the oven, Bizetti shows Mrs. Omsk how to fix her husband's favorite dessert, baked apples.|$|R

When you strike the village, land a little {{back of the}} top of the hill, in the woods, out of sight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in the post-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down over your face so they won't know you. Then you go and slip in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and git <b>the</b> pipe, and lay this piece of paper on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table, and put {{something}} on it to hold it, and then slide out and git away, and don't let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody else. Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three hundred miles an hour. You won't have lost more than an hour. You'll start back at 7 or 8 A.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours, arriving at 2 or 3 P.M., Mount Sinai time." ...|$|R
50|$|Terrified by this vision, Matt {{runs out}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{policeman}} (Michael McCusker) and demands his help.
