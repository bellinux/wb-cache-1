40|$|Ceramic {{materials}} {{are widely used}} for high temperature applications. It is still a challenge to produce ceramicceramic or ceramic-metal junctions which are stable at temperatures above 1000 °C using metallic brazes. There are very few solutions for those junctions which are either limited for specific applications or costly. A potential braze for high temperature applications (> 1000 °C) could be a Ta-Ni alloy which we started to develop recently. This paper presents investigations of Ta-Ni alloy with eutectic composition of 38 at% Ta + 62 at% Ni for brazing particularly alumina samples. The melting temperature of the above composition lies at 1395 °C. Specific additives are suitable to promote the wetting of the <b>braze</b> <b>to</b> ceramic materials. Interactions of the metallic braze and the ceramic material influence properties and behavior of the junction as well. Structural features, phase formation during brazing process, mechanical and thermal behavior are investigated in relation to brazing temperature. FESEM, EDX, XRD and thermal analysis methods deliver results about the properties above. Finally a perspective view {{is given to the}} potential of Ta-Ni brazes for ceramic-ceramic or ceramic-metal joining with a look to further work which needs to be done...|$|E

40|$|This report details an {{approach}} to using metal foam heat exchangers inside an integrated thermal management system on a variable cycle engine. The propulsion system of interest is a variable cycle engine with an auxiliary, variable flow rate fan. The feasibility of utilizing an open-celled metallic foam heat exchanger in the ducting between the constant and variable-fans on this variable cycle engine to cool the avionics was explored using an experimental approach. Two heat exchangers, 6. 3 inch width by 6. 3 inch length by 0. 5 inch thickness, were constructed from 20 and 40 pores per inch (PPI) metal foam and tested. Both were constructed using 6061 -T 6 aluminum open-cell metal foam with a relative density of 8 % and brazed using 4047 aluminum <b>braze</b> <b>to</b> 0. 02 inch thick sheet metal made of 6061 -T 6 aluminum. Both models were subjected to internal forced convection using heated air with flow rates of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM). They were also subjected to external forced convection using blowers to supply cooling air to simulate the variable cycle engine’s fans. One duct was supplied with a constant 34 ft/s cooling flow, while the other cooling flow velocity was varied between 0 % and 100 % of this 34 ft/s, in 25 % increments. The temperature and pressure of the flow internal to the metal foam, {{as well as the}} heat exchanger external surface and cold flow temperatures, were recorded. A hot-flow Reynolds number range of 1, 300 to 6, 400 was tested. Results showed expected trends for the hydraulic performance of both heat exchangers. The form factors were 50. 4 and 54. 8 ft^- 1 and the permeabilities were 9. 11 E- 7 and 6. 32 E- 7 ft^ 2 for the 20 and 40 PPI heat exchangers, respectively. Due to a defect {{on one side of the}} 40 PPI heat exchanger, the thermal results are based only on the 20 PPI heat exchanger. While the present study examines a different metal foam heat transfer configuration than most other studies, the metal foam Nusselt numbers were comparable to past studies. In addition, the pumping power required was not excessive and would allow the thermal management system to be realized without an unreasonable energy input. Therefore, a metal foam heat exchanger integrated within the ducting of a variable cycle engine is deemed feasible. The pumping power and thermal resistance were used to create a performance predicting model of the 20 PPI heat exchanger. From this model, the optimized 20 PPI heat exchanger has a hot-flow rate of 10. 5 SCFM. The resulting pumping power and thermal resistance are estimated to be 6. 7 BTU/hr and 0. 036 °R/(BTU/hr), respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{consists}} of 1080 conical tubes, which are furnace brazed themselves, manifolds, and surrounding structural jacket making almost four miles of braze joints. Subsequent furnace braze cycles are performed due to localized braze voids between the coolant tubes. SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the braze process. Poor braze quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser brazing process to provide quality, localized braze joints without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of furnace brazing. Microhardness profiles were used for braze joint property comparison between laser and furnace brazing. The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to furnace brazing based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser braze joint was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good braze joint, the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to braze alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser braze joint has shown that quality braze joint was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>to</b> the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace brazing microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser braze joint comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser brazing. Laser braze joint properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube brazing with high temperature braze alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality braze joints comparing to other localized braze process such as torch, TIG, and MPTA processes. Significant cost savings can be realized particularly with localized braze comparing to a full furnace braze cycle...|$|E

40|$|The use of strain-isolated ceramic coated {{material}} {{to produce an}} AGT 1500 combustor scroll-shaped transition duct which requires no air for film cooling is investigated. The scroll receives the exhaust of the can-style combustor liner and turns it into the annular inlet of the high pressure gas producer turbine nozzle.
