5|$|The <b>bogie</b> {{open doors}} were also {{originally}} top-hung, but converted by the railway at Pilton.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The <b>bogie</b> frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each <b>bogie</b> had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|The 1927 <b>bogie</b> goods vans were {{originally}} fitted with heavy diagonal wooden cross braces at each end, {{but these were}} later replaced with single diagonal angle-iron braces.|$|E
50|$|Both types use {{the same}} <b>bogies</b> as the 701 series EMUs: DT61A motor <b>bogies</b> and TR246A trailer <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DT77 (motored) and TR262 (trailer) bolsterless <b>bogies</b> are {{developed}} from the DT71 and TR255 <b>bogies</b> used on the E233 series EMUs. The end <b>bogies</b> of the Tc driving cars are designated TR262, and the inner <b>bogies</b> of the Tc driving cars are designated TR262A. All the <b>bogies</b> use tread brakes, and the trailer <b>bogies</b> additionally use disc brakes. Wheel diameter is 860 mm, and the distance between wheel centres is 2,100 mm.|$|R
50|$|The trains use bolsterless <b>bogies</b> {{developed}} from those used on earlier E259 series and E657 series trains. Motored <b>bogies</b> with capability for retrofitting anti-oscillation equipment (rear <b>bogies</b> on car 1 and 3) are designated DT81, motored <b>bogies</b> equipped anti-roll devices (cars 2, 5, 7, and 10) are designated DT82, and motor <b>bogies</b> not equipped with either (cars 6 and 11) are designated DT81A. Non-powered (trailer) <b>bogies</b> are designated TR265, and {{are equipped with}} a parking brake and capability for retrofitting anti-oscillation equipment, but those not equipped with a parking brake (rear <b>bogies</b> on cars 4 and 14, and both <b>bogies</b> on car 9) are designated TR265A, and those on car 8, which not equipped with either are designated TR265B.|$|R
5|$|The {{last four}} wheeled open wagons {{were built in}} 1958, but were not {{scrapped}} in large numbers until the 1980s when new <b>bogie</b> wagons replaced them. In 1987 the <b>bogie</b> wagon fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E
5|$|Calthrop {{constructed}} {{the line for}} £35,944, £11,000 less than the original estimate. He had Kitson & Co construct two 2-6-4T locomotives, similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives. Goods rolling stock included four coaches, two <b>bogie</b> open wagons and one <b>bogie</b> van, once again similar to Barsi stock. He also introduced four transporter wagons, designed to transport standard-gauge wagons. Each station on route had a short section of standard-gauge track where the wagons could be placed. The use of transporter wagons eliminated transshipment, and removed the need for large numbers of goods wagons.|$|E
5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury <b>bogie</b> {{stock was}} {{converted}} into electric multiple units. Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric motor cars, although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the extension line.|$|E
50|$|The trains run on bolsterless <b>bogies</b> {{with full}} active suspension. The motored <b>bogies</b> are {{designated}} KD-320, and the trailer <b>bogies</b> are designated KD-320A.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} were {{fitted with}} BR1 <b>bogies</b> which were later replaced with B5 <b>bogies.</b> Later examples were fitted with Commonwealth <b>bogies</b> from new. The cars weighed 39 to 42 tonnes, with the First-class cars weighing one tonne {{less than the}} others, and cars with the fabricated B5 <b>bogies</b> also weighing one tonne less than those with the heavy cast steel Commonwealth <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DT78 (motored) and TR263 (trailer) bolsterless <b>bogies</b> are {{developed}} from the DT77 and TR262 <b>bogies</b> used on the E259 series EMUs, with improvements {{to cope with the}} increased vehicle weight and provide increased snow and cold weather resistance. The end <b>bogies</b> of the Tc driving cars are designated TR263, the inner <b>bogies</b> of the Tc driving cars and the Ts car are designated TR263A, and the <b>bogies</b> on the T1 car are designated TR262B. All the <b>bogies</b> use tread brakes, and the trailer <b>bogies</b> additionally use two disc brakes per axle. Wheel diameter is 860 mm, and the distance between wheel centres is 2,100 mm.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that on some lines variable gauge axles would achieve significant time savings in comparison to <b>bogie</b> exchange. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either retrofitting or replacement of existing bogies.|$|E
5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first <b>bogie</b> of the fourth car.|$|E
5|$|Arcade Fire is a Canadian indie rock band, {{consisting}} of {{husband and wife}} Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, along with Win's younger brother William Butler, Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara. The band's current touring line-up also includes former core member Sarah Neufeld, percussionist Tiwill Duprate and saxophonist Stuart <b>Bogie.</b>|$|E
50|$|The motored {{cars were}} mounted on DT21A coil-spring <b>bogies</b> {{based on the}} <b>bogies</b> used on the 101 series {{commuter}} EMUs. The non-motored trailer cars were mounted on TR62 <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{units were}} {{withdrawn}} in 1959/60 and scrapped, {{being replaced by}} stock that became Class 504. Two <b>bogies</b> survived. These were used as temporary <b>bogies</b> in Bury depot when the <b>bogies</b> of Class 504 units were removed for maintenance. When the depot closed in 1991, the <b>bogies</b> were cut up.|$|R
50|$|The 14-car set {{was mounted}} on a total of 16 bogies: four TR257 trailer <b>bogies</b> (cars 1, 7, 8, 14), six TR258 shared trailer <b>bogies,</b> and six DT73 shared motor <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Bogie</b> {{stock was}} built by Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and at Neasden Works in 1900. This gave a better ride quality, steam heating, {{automatic}} vacuum brakes, electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes. The Bluebell Railway has four 1898–1900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages and a fifth, built at Neasden, is at the London Transport Museum.|$|E
5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury <b>bogie</b> {{stock was}} {{converted}} into multiple units by fitting cabs, control equipment and motors. In 1910, two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. They started work on the Uxbridge-South Harrow shuttle service, being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles were used between Watford and Rickmansworth.|$|E
5|$|KhT-130 flame-throwing tank in the Military Unit No. 05776 in Borzya, Chita Oblast (Russia): {{monument}} (since 1995) with {{an incomplete}} chassis (one track <b>bogie</b> is missing; tracks and driving wheels {{were taken from}} the M3 Stuart American light tank). Before 1990 the vehicle stood in the territory of one of military units of the Soviet 39th Army (located in Mongolia) of the Transbaikal Military District. The single preserved KhT-130 at the present time.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Bradken <b>bogies,</b> {{similar to}} those used under the 500, 600 and 700 series cars, were replaced in 1971 with Commonwealth style <b>bogies.</b> The old <b>bogies</b> were then cascaded to car DC783.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} <b>bogies</b> were {{considered}} for the 117 series before a third was chosen. The high-speed DT24 air spring <b>bogies</b> from the 153 series were considered but passed over, as were the DT21 coil spring trucks, standard at the time. Ultimately, the 117 series was equipped with DT32E <b>bogies</b> on the powered cars and TR69H <b>bogies</b> on the trailers.|$|R
50|$|DT56E <b>bogies</b> {{are used}} on motored cars, and TR241E <b>bogies</b> are used on trailer cars.|$|R
5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one <b>bogie,</b> and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): this tank is {{described}} in many sources as early version of the T-26 mod. 1933. But in reality this is the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps163–16) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank (which can be identified by rivets for mounting of a burning mixture tank, rivets for hinges of a filling hatch {{on the left side}} and a welded drain port on the right side behind a front track <b>bogie)</b> with a mounted riveted turret with a small rear niche from the early BT-5 light tank.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever monoplane {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many design elements that were fairly uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel <b>bogie</b> main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E
50|$|The Kururi Line KiHa E130-100 series sets have DT74A motored <b>bogies</b> and TR259A trailer <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|On a steam locomotive, {{the leading}} and {{trailing}} wheels may be mounted on <b>bogies</b> like pony trucks or Bissel <b>bogies.</b> Articulated locomotives (e.g. Fairlie, Garratt or Mallet locomotives) have power <b>bogies</b> {{similar to those}} on diesel and electric locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Usually, two <b>bogies</b> are {{fitted to}} each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An {{alternate}} configuration often {{is used in}} articulated vehicles, which places the <b>bogies</b> (often Jacobs <b>bogies)</b> under {{the connection between the}} carriages or wagons.|$|R
5|$|The company bought five <b>bogie</b> trams. They {{had pointed}} ends to ease meeting the shorter trams in the city, {{and had a}} low-floor center section, with {{internal}} steps. The body and mechanical equipment was built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, while the electrical components were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke. Capacity was for 40 or 38 seated passengers. In early 1917, Barth was replaced by H. A. Mørk as director. Trial runs of the tramway started on 11 June 1917. It was retrospectively decided by the ministry that the official opening date was 1 July.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and <b>bogie</b> trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was {{the first}} model produced, a total of 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel <b>bogie</b> main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E
50|$|The motor <b>bogies</b> {{were the}} same DT33A <b>bogies</b> as used on the JNR-era 103 series EMUs, and the trailer cars used DT21T <b>bogies</b> {{recovered}} from withdrawn 101 series EMUs. The pantographs were also recovered from withdrawn 101 series EMUs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motor cars}} are mounted on TS-1006 <b>bogies,</b> and the trailer cars are mounted on TS-1007 <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Starting with BF22 to BMF1 in 1961, wagons {{began to}} be fitted with aligned <b>bogies</b> in 1961. This allowed {{operation}} at up to 60 miles per hour, against 50 mph for the diamond-frame <b>bogies</b> fitted to BB and 70 mph for the <b>bogies</b> fitted to the BP. The wagons fitted with aligned <b>bogies</b> were coded BMF, to indicate [...] "medium" [...] size distinct from the [...] "long" [...] wagons outlined below.|$|R
