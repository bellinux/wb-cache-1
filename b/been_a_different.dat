5|$|There's {{got to be}} {{a series}} of {{advantages}} all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.|$|E
5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E

50|$|Multiple {{names for}} {{mutations}} have arisen {{due to the}} use of different names in <b>different</b> locations for <b>a</b> single colour variation. This does not mean that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mutation; it only means it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> name.|$|R

50|$|Traffolyte, {{sometimes}} spelled Traffolite, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{brand name}} for multi-layered phenolic plastic sheets suitable for engraving. Each layer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> colour so engraved letters or shapes would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> colour from the unengraved portions. Thus {{it could be}} used for name tags, labels and signs.|$|R
25|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{also showed}} him {{at high risk}} of atherosclerosis and lactose intolerance, with the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi, possibly making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. A later analysis suggested the sequence may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Borrelia species.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{stated that}} he was looking for dancers who did not look like typical MTV dancers and who knew both American street-dancing and European {{performance}} art. Originally Bowie had hoped to have Édouard Lock of La La La Human Steps be involved in the show, but the group was booked with other commitments. Bowie later lamented that the Tour may have been viewed differently if La La La Human Steps had been involved: [...] "It would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ballgame." [...] La La La Human Steps would provide the choreography for Bowie's next tour, the Sound+Vision Tour of 1990.|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating there might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E

The garden {{is the same}} as of yore, but the house <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> place and Harrington <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> man. And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle, [...] "It was them notorious pigs as did it all." ...|$|R

500|$|Burger's Daughter took Gordimer {{four years}} to write, {{starting}} {{from a handful of}} what she called [...] "very scrappy notes", [...] "half sentences" [...] and [...] "little snatches of dialogue". Collecting information for the novel was difficult because at the time little was known about South African communists. Gordimer relied on clandestine books and documents given to her by confidants, and her own experiences of living in South Africa. Once she got going, she said, writing the book became an [...] "organic process". The Soweto riots in 1976 happened while she was working on the book, and she changed the plot to incorporate the uprising. Gordimer explained that [...] "Rosa would have come back to South Africa; that was inevitable", but [...] "here would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ending". During those four years she also wrote two non-fiction articles to take breaks from working on the novel.|$|E
500|$|Ray Davies' marital {{problems}} {{during this period}} began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was [...] "fucking sick of the whole thing", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness {{as well as his}} depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies [...] "decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the {{chemistry}} between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy. While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics, some reviews negatively {{focused on her}} nationality {{as well as the}} inauthenticity of her accent. James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, [...] "find the right actor…and [...] is undoubtedly brilliant." [...] Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to [...] "sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes. Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person, [...] "not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different".|$|E

500|$|Sean Gregory of Time {{wrote of}} Lin's zero Division I {{scholarship}} offers: [...] " [...] was scrawny, but don't doubt {{that a little}} racial profiling, intentional or otherwise, contributed to his underrecruitment." [...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, it might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> deal"; {{he did not think}} Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but I do think [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I think if I were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
500|$|Goldstone's work {{investigating}} violence {{led directly}} to his being nominated {{to serve as the}} first chief prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda from August 1994 to September 1996. He prosecuted a number of key war crimes suspects, notably the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. On his return to South Africa he took up a seat on the newly established Constitutional Court of South Africa, to which he had been nominated by President Nelson Mandela. [...] In 2009, Goldstone led a fact-finding mission created by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate international human rights and humanitarian law violations related to the Gaza War. The mission concluded that Israel and Hamas had both potentially committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, findings which sparked outrage in Israel and the initiation of a personal campaign against Goldstone. In 2011, in the light of investigations by the Israeli forces which indicated that they had not intentionally targeted civilians as a matter of policy, Goldstone wrote that if evidence which had been available later had been available at the time, the Goldstone Report would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> document.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much {{it might as well have}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{immigration}} {{records in the}} Philippines, someone named Saeed al-Ghamdi visited that country on at least 15 occasions in 2001, entering as a tourist. The last visit ended on August 6. This may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person with the same name, as no other information is available.|$|E
2500|$|Various transcriptions of {{the name}} of Duwa Khan's general appear in Indian records. Amir Khusrau calls him [...] "Kabak" [...] and [...] "Kapak"; Ziauddin Barani calls him [...] "Kunk" [...] and [...] "Gung"; and Isami calls him [...] "Kubak". According to René Grousset, this general was Duwa Khan's son Kebek. However, Kishori Saran Lal {{believes}} that this Kopek must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person, because the Indian chronicles state that he was captured and killed in India.|$|E
2500|$|Carbolic acid {{was soon}} {{commonly}} sold {{under the name}} [...] "creosote", and the scarcity of wood-tar creosote in some places led chemists {{to believe that it}} was the same substance as that described by Reichenbach. In the 1840s, Eugen Freiherr von Gorup-Besanez, after realizing that two samples of substances labelled as creosote were different, started a series of investigations to determine the chemical nature of carbolic acid, leading to a conclusion that it more resembled chlorinated quinones and must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different,</b> entirely unrelated substance.|$|E

2500|$|Records of {{his early}} life are inexact, but he was {{probably}} born in Naples, and was likely a boy singer at St. John Lateran in 1544 and 1545. [...] An [...] "Annibale contralto" [...] is also listed at the same church in 1555 and 1556; since {{it is unlikely that}} a twenty-year-old would have been listed as a contralto, this may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person; alternatively it has been proposed that Annibale was born in the mid-1540s. [...] Stabile himself mentioned that he studied with Palestrina, who was maestro di cappella at St. John Lateran in 1555 and 1556.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on {{the view of the}} letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21 after Elijah had ascended. Some have suggested that the letter was written before Elijah ascended, but only delivered later. The rabbinical Seder Olam explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension. This is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews when dealing with this issue. Others have argued that Elijah was only [...] "caught away" [...] such as Philip in Acts 8:39 John Lightfoot reasoned that it must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Elijah.|$|E
2500|$|Goldstone {{wrote that}} [...] "If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> document." [...] He {{said that the}} lack of Israeli {{cooperation}} had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents that had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures e.g. to discontinue the use of white phosphorus (including as a smokescreen) in or near civilian areas.|$|E
