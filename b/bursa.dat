5|$|In human anatomy, a <b>bursa</b> {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar <b>bursa</b> {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this <b>bursa.</b> Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine <b>bursa,</b> the prepatellar <b>bursa</b> {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E

5|$|The prepatellar <b>bursa</b> and the {{olecranon}} <b>bursa</b> {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
40|$|To {{provide a}} {{comparison}} of the contents of subcutaneous and deep <b>bursae</b> we dissected these structures from unfixed cadavers without apparent joint disease. No free fluid was found within any olecranon or prepatellar <b>bursae</b> (examples of subcutaneous <b>bursae),</b> while viscous fluid was invariably present in the (deep) retrocalcaneal <b>bursae.</b> The hyaluronic acid content of the washings of 5 rectrocalcaneal <b>bursae</b> ranged from 142 to 591 nmol hexosamine (mean = 281 nmol hexosamine). In contrast, the hyaluronic acid content of 4 olecranon <b>bursae</b> was much lower (range 35 - 72 nmol, mean 53 nmol hexosamine), and hyaluronate was not detected in washings from either of 2 prepatellar <b>bursae.</b> The greater hyaluronate content of the retrocalcaneal <b>bursae</b> {{did not appear to be}} due to a greater surface area, since on the basis of calculations made from plaster casts the surface areas of the olecranon and prepatellar <b>bursae</b> were approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, greater than that of the retrocalcaneal <b>bursae.</b> The data suggest that, although hyaluronic acid may lubricate deep <b>bursae,</b> other factors may be more important in reducing friction within superficial <b>bursae...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the <b>bursa,</b> and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the <b>bursa</b> copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E

5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen.

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar <b>bursa</b> {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion.

5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and <b>bursa</b> in American kestrels.|$|E

5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snailâ€™s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the <b>bursa</b> copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooterâ€™s paternity.|$|E
5|$|After these defeats, Andronicus {{was in no}} {{position}} to send substantial forces. In 1320, Andronicus II's grandson, Andronicus III, was disinherited following the death of his father, Michael IX, the Emperor's son and heir apparent. The following year, Andronicus III retaliated by marching on Constantinople and was given Thrace as an appanage. He kept on pressing for his inheritance and, in 1322, was made co-emperor. This culminated in the Byzantine civil war of 1321â€“1328, in which Serbia backed Andronicus II and the Bulgarians backed his grandson. Eventually Andronicus III emerged triumphant on May 23, 1328. As Andronicus III consolidated his hold on Byzantium, the Ottomans succeeded in taking <b>Bursa</b> from the Byzantines in 1326.|$|E
5|$|Despite the odds, {{a sizable}} force had mustered in Europe under his banner, {{defeating}} Murad II's subordinates.

The result was that he incited yet another rebellion in the Ottoman ranks â€” this time supporting Murad II brother's claim, Kucuk Mustafa. The seemingly promising rebellion had its origins in Asia Minor with <b>Bursa</b> coming under siege. After a failed assault on Constantinople, Murad II was forced to turn back his army and defeat Kucuk.

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ivan Alexander in 1371 Ivan Sratsimir broke off ties with Tarnovo and even placed the {{archbishop}} of Vidin {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople to demonstrate his independence.

Only after the fall of Tarnovo in 1393 did his policy become more active and he eventually joined the crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, after the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the Ottomans marched to Vidin and seized it. Ivan Sratsimir was captured and imprisoned in <b>Bursa</b> where he was probably strangled.

40|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) frequently present with pain under their feet. Forefoot <b>bursae</b> can {{give rise to}} such symptoms, but are rarely investigated. The aim of this thesis was to use musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) performed by a podiatrist to evaluate the prevalence and natural history of <b>bursae</b> in the forefoot in RA patients. Once reliability of technique was established, a longitudinal study design was used in which a sample of RA patients (N= 149) and a comparator group (N= 50) of healthy individuals were assessed at baseline. A Diasus MSUS system was used to image the forefeet of all participants to determine prevalence of <b>bursae.</b> 120 patients (98 female, 22 male) with RA (24 seronegative, 93 seropositive, 3 unknown) completed the study at twelve months: mean age 60. 7 (SD 12. 1) years and disease duration 12. 99 (10. 4) years. Results confirmed a high prevalence of forefoot <b>bursae</b> (92. 6 % of patients; mean per individual = 3. 54, range 0 - 9) and that these were often missed by clinical examination.

The findings imply that MSUS detectable <b>bursae</b> in the forefeet are highly prevalent, clinically under-reported and change over time.
