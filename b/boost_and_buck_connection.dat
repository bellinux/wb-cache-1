But to increase the acceptance of fuel cells for off-grid generation, the cost of the energy management system must be greatly reduced. Of the many ways to accomplish this, this paper looks at reducing cost through topology changes and elimination of current sensors. A dual 2. 5 kW non-isolated bidirectional boost converter is designed and analyzed. The various bidirectional boost topologies are compared on cost and ability to meet the specifications. A sensorless average current mode is designed, implemented and verified through testing in a low-cost fixed-point DSP. Both <b>boost</b> <b>and</b> <b>buck</b> modes are accurately modeled and voltage and current controllers are designed for good closed-loop response. The accuracy of the sensorless average current measurement is investigated in both modes of operation. A classical dual-loop controller is implemented in boost mode with the sensorless average current <b>and</b> in <b>buck</b> mode, a dual controller operating in either current or voltage mode is implemented. The design is verified through testing in <b>boost</b> <b>and</b> <b>buck</b> mode <b>and</b> it is shown that the results are acceptable.

The inverter is universal {{in the sense}} that it can be switched between <b>buck,</b> <b>boost,</b> <b>and</b> <b>buck</b> [...] <b>boost</b> configurations by appropriately altering the pulse width modular (PWM) control. Discontinuous current mode (DCM) operation is implemented to facilitate shuffling between configurations during the converter operation. Such flexibility ensures maximum benefit of the <b>buck,</b> <b>boost,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>buck</b> [...] <b>boost</b> operations (e. g., low device stresses, higher efficiency, higher boosting capability, etc.). The PWM is achieved by comparing a high frequency carrier (triangular) waveform with a suitable reference waveform, which is not necessarily sinusoidal, but has a shape specific to the individual configuration and is derived by equating the power fed into the grid with that extracted from the source during each switching cycle. The values of the components (inductors and capacitors) need to be optimized so that DCM is maintained and the required amount of energy is transferred to the grid in all the three configurations during their respective operation. All the design expressions have been derived. A salient feature of this inverter is its compatibility with various types of sources (PV array, fuel cell, etc.) with varying voltage levels and control requirements.
