5000|$|Because of {{the power}} {{required}} to run the heater, OCXOs require more power than oscillators that run at ambient temperature, and the requirement for the heater, thermal mass, and thermal insulation means that they are physically larger. Therefore they are not used in battery powered or miniature applications, such as watches. However, in return, the oven-controlled oscillator achieves the best frequency stability possible from a crystal. The short term frequency stability of OCXOs is typically 1x10−12 over a few seconds, while the long term stability is limited to around 1x10−8 (10 ppb) per year by aging of the crystal. [...] Achieving better performance requires switching to an atomic frequency <b>standard,</b> such as <b>a</b> <b>rubidium</b> <b>standard,</b> caesium standard, or hydrogen maser. Another cheaper alternative is to discipline a crystal oscillator with a GPS time signal, creating a GPS-disciplined oscillator (GPSDO).
