40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the solar gain of a fenestration system is important in analyzing the energy performance of buildings. Recently, models were developed for complex fenestration systems – glazing systems with attachments such as venetian <b>blinds</b> <b>and</b> insect <b>screens.</b> These models use a three-node network for modeling heat transfer at the indoor-side of a glazing system. Empirical expressions based on observation and known limits were originally proposed for the corresponding convection coefficients. To address any ambiguity or error associated with these expressions, a research project is underway to develop techniques for evaluating these convection coefficients more accurately. The {{purpose of the current}} paper is to quantify the sensitivity of the U-value and solar heat gain coefficient of complex fenestration systems to the indoor-side convection coefficients. Configurations comprised of low-e glazings, roller blinds, venetian <b>blinds,</b> drapes <b>and</b> insect <b>screens</b> are examined in design summer and winter conditions using the window analysis software VISION 5. Results show that the presence of an indoor-mounted attachment can significantly change the solar heat gain coefficient of a fenestration system. Nevertheless, the solar heat gain coefficient and the overall heat transfer coefficient are not sensitive to the indoor convection coefficient...|$|R

The degree of protection from flying glass provided by mounting Venetian <b>blinds,</b> insect <b>screens,</b> <b>and</b> 1 / 4 -in. mesh wire netting on the inside of window openings was also determined. The best results seem to indicate that the resistances of different types of glass to an atomic blast are approximately proportional to their strength in supporting static loads. Glass mounted in a rigid frame is less likely to be broken than if mounted in a flexible frame which may be distorted by the blast. Fragments from wire or safety glass are less dangerous to personnel than fragments from other types of glass, and plastic is less likely to break than glass, Commercial types of Venetian <b>blinds</b> <b>and</b> insect <b>screens</b> afforded littie or no protection against flying glass fragments at the distance at which tested; however, a blind with some of the parts reinforced and properly anchored to the window opening would. probably give some protection at a distance of 3 miles from the explosion or if closed, would probably give tull protection against heat waves at 2 miles. Wire netting with 1 / 4 -in. mesh installed on the inside of window openings proved effective in stopping all except very small glass fragments. Lightweight, double- hung, wooden windows with sashes glazed with small panes supported by narrow muntins offer little resistance to an atomic blast.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the most}} common cause of {{hospitalization}} and mortality in many industrialized countries. We analysed the diagnostic accuracy of multi-detector row spiral computed tomography (MDCT) in determining mid- to high-grade coronary artery stenoses (> 50 %). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with suspected CAD were referred to MDCT coronary angiography. Patients with a heart rate above 60 bpm received 20 - 40 mg propranol before the scan. The left main (LM), the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the first diagonal branch (D 1), the right coronary artery (RCA) and the proximal tract of the circumflex artery (LCX) were independently evaluated by two <b>blinded</b> observers <b>and</b> <b>screened</b> for > 50 % stenoses. The mean values of MDCT coronary narrowings assessed by two observers were compared to quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: MDCT correctly detected 95 of 123 coronary lesions (sensitivity 77. 2 %) and absence of stenoses was correctly identified in 388 of 426 segments (specificity 91 %). The sensitivity for the LM, LAD, RCA and the proximal tract of LCX was 100 %, 86. 5 %, 69. 8 % and 80 % respectively. Classification of patients as having 1 -vessel, 2 -vessels, 3 -vessels or left main disease was accurate in 75. 4 % (46 / 61) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: MDCT technology, combined with heart rate control, allows reliable noninvasive detection of hemodynamically significant CAD...|$|R

40|$|Shading {{devices have}} the {{potential}} to reduce peak cooling load and annual energy consumption because they can be used to control solar gain. Thus, the need to model shading devices in a glazing system analysis is important. This thesis deals with various measurement techniques and model development related to solar optics in windows with shading devices. It also considers longwave radiative properties of shading devices via model development and experimentation. The different shading devices examined were roller blinds, insect <b>screens,</b> pleated drapes <b>and</b> venetian <b>blinds.</b> The energy performance of windows with shading devices was modeled using a two step procedure. Solar radiation was considered in the first step by developing a multi-layer solar optical model for glazing/shading systems. This newly developed model is an extension of an existing model for systems of specular glazing layers and includes the effect of layers that create scattered, specifically diffuse, radiation in reflection and/or transmission. Spatially-averaged (effective) optical properties were used to characterise shading layers, including their beam-diffuse split. The multi-layer solar optical model estimates the system solar transmission and absorbed solar components. The absorbed solar components appear as energy source terms in the second step – the heat transfer analysis. The heat transfer analysis involves the formulation of energy balance equations and requires both effective longwave properties and convective heat transfer coefficients as input. The simultaneous solution of the energy balance equations yields the temperature as well as the convective and radiative fluxes. The effective solar optical properties of flat materials like drapery fabrics, roller <b>blinds</b> <b>and</b> insect <b>screens</b> were obtained by developing a new measurement technique. Special sample holders were designed and fabricated to facilitate measurements using an integrating sphere installed in a commercially available spectrophotometer. Semi-empirical models were then developed to quantify the variation of solar optical properties with respect to incidence angle. In turn, effective layer properties of venetian <b>blinds</b> <b>and</b> pleated drapes were modeled using a more fundamental net radiation scheme. The effective longwave properties of flat materials were obtained by taking measurements with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results enabled simple models to be developed relating emittance and longwave transmittance to openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. In turn, effective longwave properties of venetian <b>blinds</b> <b>and</b> pleated drapes were modeled using a net radiation scheme. Convective heat transfer correlations were readily available. Finally, the newly developed models were validated by measuring the solar gain through various shading devices attached to a double glazed window using the National Solar Test Facility (NSTF) solar simulator and solar calorimeter. Solar gain results were also obtained from simulation software that incorporated the models. There was good agreement between the measured and the simulated results thus strengthening confidence in the newly developed models...|$|R

Upon the lawn was a kiosk, a long and many-windowed building, covered with <b>blinds,</b> <b>and</b> further <b>screened</b> by an overhanging roof. The kiosk was built of white and green marble, the ascent to it was by a flight of steps {{the length of the}} building, alternately of white and green marble, and nearly covered with rose-trees. Honain went up these steps alone, and entered the kiosk. After a few minutes he looked out from the <b>blinds</b> <b>and</b> beckoned to Alroy. David advanced, but Honain, fearful of some indiscretion, met him, and said to him in a low whisper between his teeth, 'Remember you are deaf, a mute, and a eunuch.' Alroy could scarcely refrain from smiling, and the Prince of the Captivity and the physician of the Caliph entered the kiosk together. Two women, veiled, and two eunuchs of the guard, received them in an antechamber. And then they passed into a room which ran nearly the whole length of the kiosk, opening on one side to the gardens, and on the other supported by an ivory wall, with niches painted in green fresco, and in each niche a rose-tree. Each niche, also, was covered with an almost invisible golden grate, which confined a nightingale, and made him constant to the rose he loved. At the foot of each niche was a fountain, but, instead of water, each basin was replenished with the purest quicksilver.[31] The roof of the kiosk was of mother-of-pearl inlaid with tortoise-shell; the pavement, a mosaic of rare marbles and precious stones, representing the most delicious fruits and the most beautiful flowers. Over this pavement, a Georgian page flung at intervals refreshing perfumes. At the end of this elegant chamber was a divan of light green silk, embroidered with pearls, and covered with cushions of white satin and gold. Upon one of these cushions, {{in the middle of the}} divan, sat a lady, her eyes fixed in abstraction upon a volume of Persian poetry lying on her knees, one hand playing with a rosary of pearls and emeralds,[32] and the other holding a long gold chain, which imprisoned a white gazelle.|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Web 2. 0 technologies, {{websites}} have evolved from static pages to dynamic, interactive Web-based applications {{with the ability to}} replicate common desktop functionality. However, for <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> visually impaired individuals who rely upon screen readers, Web 2. 0 applications force them to adapt to an inaccessible use model. Many technologies, including WAI-ARIA, AJAX, <b>and</b> improved <b>screen</b> reader support, are rapidly evolving to improve this situation. However, simply combining them does not solve the problems of screen reader users. The main contributions of this paper are two models of interaction for screen reader users, for both traditional websites and Web 2. 0 applications.
