On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
2500|$|In 1598 John Stow had {{commented that}} [...] "if carts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken, {{and the stone}} itself unshaken", and by 1742 it was {{considered}} an obstruction to traffic. The remaining part of the Stone was then moved, with its protective cupola, from {{the south side of}} the street to the north side, where it was first set <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of St Swithin's Church, which had been rebuilt by Christopher Wren after its destruction in the Great Fire. It was moved again in 1798 to the east end of the church's south wall, and finally in the 1820s set in an alcove in the centre of the wall within a solidly built stone frame set on a plinth, with a circular aperture through which the Stone itself could be seen. In 1869 the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society arranged for the installation of a protective iron grille and an explanatory inscription in Latin and English on the church wall above it.|$|E
2500|$|When drunk, Kelly {{would be}} heard singing Irish songs; in this state, she would often become quarrelsome and even abusive to those around her, which earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dark Mary." [...] McCarthy said [...] "she {{was a very}} quiet woman when sober but noisy when in drink." [...] Barnett first met Kelly in April 1887. They agreed to live together on their second meeting the following day. In early 1888 they both moved into 13 Miller's Court, a furnished single room {{at the back of}} 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. It was a single twelve-foot square room, with a bed, three tables and a chair. Above the fireplace hung a print of [...] "The Fisherman's Widow". Kelly's door key was lost, so she bolted and unbolted the door from outside by putting a hand through a broken window <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> A German neighbour, Julia Venturney, claimed Kelly had broken the window when drunk. Barnett worked as a fish porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, but when he fell out of regular employment and tried to earn money as a market porter, Kelly turned to prostitution again. A quarrel ensued over Kelly's sharing of the room with another prostitute whom Barnett knew only as [...] "Julia" [...] and he left on 30 October, more than a week before her death, while continuing to visit Kelly.|$|E
