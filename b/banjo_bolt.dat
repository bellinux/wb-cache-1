5000|$|On 9 January 2012, the inquest {{into his}} death commenced. It was stated {{that after the}} crash a <b>banjo</b> <b>bolt</b> on the bike {{was found to be}} loose, however his {{mechanics}} and race scrutineers maintained that the bolt was tight {{before the start of the}} race and so could not have caused the brake failure which led to the crash. Instead, it was suggested by the scrutineer that brake knock-back was [...] "the only logical explanation". Farquhar doubted that knock back was the cause, stating that he had not experienced it in over 500 races. The following day, coroner John Leckey delivered the verdict, stating [...] "Having carefully considered all the evidence in conjunction with the agreed position of the experts, I am able to conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, the loose <b>banjo</b> <b>bolt</b> was the cause of failure of the front brake." ...|$|E

50|$|The Interceptor had one endemic engine {{issue in}} the V4, {{camshaft}} wear. In 1984, camshaft issues started to arise and owners started to complain. At first Honda did not admit {{that there was a}} problem but after conducting further research, they decided that the camshaft wear was most likely caused by oil flow issues. Valve clearance issues were also suggested as a possible contributory factor. Honda issued a recall on the bikes and added kink-free oil lines and less restrictive <b>banjo</b> <b>bolts.</b> They also made alterations by drilling holes in the cam lobes and capping off the hollow cam's ends. This did not fix the problem, so Honda went back to the drawing board. The first thought was that the issue was heat related, but after further investigation the real problem was discovered - there was too much clearance in the camshaft bearings. Honda fixed this by changing all the camshafts with new components. This fixed the camshaft issues but the reputation of the Honda V4 was already damaged.|$|R
