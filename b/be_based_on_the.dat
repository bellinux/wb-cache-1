5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot would also <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 104 {{rather than the}} Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E

5|$|In the credits, the re-imagined {{series is}} said to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1976 novel by Terry Nation; however, {{there are a number}} of {{differences}} between the series and its source material. In the novel, Jenny Richards survives, whereas her counterpart in the 2008 series, Jenny Collins, does not; this means that Greg Preston and Jenny cannot have a child as the years unfold. Abby Grant still falls in love with Jimmy Garland; however, in the book, he eventually dies from septicaemia.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America {{announced}} that transgender boys {{would be allowed}} to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately.

Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. In 2016, he was rejected from the Boy Scouts for being transgender, but the policy was changed after his story became nationally known.|$|E

When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering {{portrait}} of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly sacked. The Mint did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint {{for the rest of}} his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20µg) required to improve upon the IPK.|$|E
