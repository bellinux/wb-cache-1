50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid {{through the entire}} system, usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes (or the wheel cylinders of drum brakes), but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A <b>brake</b> <b>bleed</b> screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>bleeding</b> is the {{procedure}} performed on hydraulic brake systems whereby the brake lines (the {{pipes and hoses}} containing the brake fluid) are purged of any air bubbles. This is necessary because, while the brake fluid is an incompressible liquid, air bubbles are compressible gas and {{their presence in the}} brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for bleeding are also used for purging, where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid, which is necessary maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>bleeding</b> <b>brakes</b> {{because of}} master {{cylinder}} replacement the master cylinder is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation. Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the master cylinder back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the master cylinder plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|R
50|$|On a {{hydraulic}} vehicle <b>braking</b> systems, the <b>bleed</b> screws (sometimes known as bleed nipples or bleeder valves) are {{located at the}} top of each brake caliper to allow <b>bleeding</b> of the <b>braking</b> system. Whenever service work has been performed on the braking system which might have introduced air into the system (i.e. the hydraulic system has been opened), the air must be bled out. This is necessary for correct operation of the system, because air compresses (as opposed to brake fluid which is not compressible). Air in the system reduces the maximum pressure applied to the brake pistons and can lead to loss of braking ability.|$|R

50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, <b>brake</b> pins and <b>bleed</b> valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the depositâ€™s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
50|$|Charlie {{decides to}} go ahead with his robbery plan. John is {{reluctant}} to do anything about this, but Grace persuades him to save Charlie from trouble. When the money train stops at one of the stations, Charlie enters the train from beneath and drives it to the maintenance ladder, but he can't escape with the money due to the presence of a group of policemen. Meanwhile, John reaches the train and persuades Charlie to drive further to prevent their arrest. Knowing that Patterson will direct his team to trip the train's <b>brakes,</b> the duo <b>bleeds</b> the <b>brakes.</b> Patterson then orders a steel barricade erected to stop the train, but John increases the speed of the money train to its maximum so that it smashes through the barricade. Transit control officer Kowalski declares the money train a runaway and starts clearing tracks, but Patterson diverts the money train onto a track occupied by a passenger train to keep it from having a clear path, putting innocent people at grave risk. The money train rams into the passenger train and then slows down, but speeds up again because it's in full throttle and rams the train again. It repeatedly keeps ramming the passenger train with the increasing risk of derailing it and killing everyone on board.|$|R
