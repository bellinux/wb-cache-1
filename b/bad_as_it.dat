25|$|James Anthony Froude, a {{well-known}} English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule. In 1886, he published Oceana, {{another one of}} Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack {{of exposure to the}} native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions on the benefits of the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black leaders who would strip away whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals; however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies.|$|E

He ended his thoughts on the matter by clearly stating that socialism wasn't communism. He has also noted that even before joining the Socialist Party, he [...] "always promoted a national socialized health plan, antiwar, favored a guaranteed annual income, advocated worker control and elimination of corporate control." ...|$|E

While en route, the Kellys received an erroneous news report that Giffords had died. [...] "The kids, Claudia and Claire, started crying. My mother, she almost screamed. I just walked into the bathroom, and, you know, broke down." [...] Calling family in Tucson, Kelly found out that the report was false and that she was alive and in surgery.

He noticed the similarity between the [...] "legendary" [...] planets of Aldea in the episode and Magrathea in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a reference Handlen considered possibly deliberate. He thought that the child-heavy episode wasn't [...] "as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could've been", and gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] grade. Michelle Erica Green in her review for TrekNation, described [...] "When the Bough Breaks" [...] as [...] "tedious, plodding and didactic" [...] with a [...] "preposterous" [...] ending. She thought that the plot element of ozone damage was not optimal and that the quality of the episode was typical of the first season.|$|E

500|$|While in {{training}} for the Sanitar, Walpole devoted his leisure hours to gaining a reasonable fluency in the Russian language, and to his first full-length work of non-fiction, a literary biography of Joseph Conrad. In the summer of 1915 {{he worked on the}} Austrian-Russian front, assisting at operations in field hospitals and retrieving the dead and wounded from the battlefield. Occasionally he found time to write brief letters home; he told Bennett, [...] "A battle is an amazing mixture of hell and a family picnic – not as frightening as the dentist, but absorbing, sometimes thrilling like football, sometimes dull like church, and sometimes simply physically sickening like bad fish. Burying dead afterwards is worst of all." [...] When disheartened he comforted himself with the thought, [...] "This is not so <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was at Marlow".|$|E

Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like that.

500|$|No {{music video}} was filmed for {{promotion}} of [...] "Nothing Fails". Initially {{it was reported}} by Daily Mirror that Madonna planned to shoot the video in Israel with actor Michael Douglas. According to Polly Graham from the newspaper, Warner Bros. executives {{were concerned about the}} singer's safety in Israel, but Madonna was adamant. [...] "Her record bosses are really worried about it. They are trying to talk her around, but she's having none of it. She has told them it makes sense to shoot it in Israel as the Kabbalah originates from there. Madonna is not particularly bothered about her safety and potential risks. She doesn't think it's as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> seems." [...] Her then husband Guy Ritchie was also facing difficulty with his project, Revolver, which was rejected by Sony Pictures executives since it contained references to Kabbalah, and they asked Ritchie to re-write the script. Since the video itself would have included symbolism from Kabbalah, Madonna ultimately decided to not film the music video. These reports were later refuted by the artist during an interview with San Francisco radio station Alice 97.3, where she explained that no music video would be shot for the single.|$|E
500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is now... {{if ever there was a}} time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E
500|$|In Bad, Jackson's {{concept of}} the predatory lover {{can be seen on}} the rock song [...] "Dirty Diana". The lead single [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" [...] is a {{traditional}} love ballad, while [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] is an anthemic ballad of confession and resolution. [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical individual. He comments the album is more diverse than his previous <b>Bad,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appeals to an urban audience while also attracting the middle class with anthems like [...] "Heal the World". The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like [...] "Jam" [...] and [...] "Remember the Time". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills become a primary theme; [...] "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as the multifaceted love song [...] "In the Closet". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as [...] "Will You Be There", [...] "Heal the World" [...] and [...] "Keep the Faith"; these songs show Jackson opening up about various personal struggles and worries. In the ballad [...] "Gone Too Soon", Jackson gives tribute to his friend Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.|$|E

500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} for my life out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went through me like I was butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the films}} are presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of Gone to Coney Island survives in The Moving Picture World from July 9, 1910. It states: [...] "Kate has been employed {{for a number}} of years as a maid in the home of Mrs. Greene. Her 'young man,' Henry, works down at Coney [...] He induces Kate to leave her place and take a situation as a ticket seller at Luna Park. Kate tries to tell her mistress of her intended departure, but Mrs. Greene is busy and refuses to listen. Mrs. Greene goes out, during her absence, Kate takes French leave, leaving a note saying she is going to Coney Island. Never having visited the Island, Mrs. Greene considers it a jungle place. When she gets Kate's note, she thinks that her duty to immediately start in pursuit of the misguided girl. Not knowing how to get to the island, she appeals to her old friend, Professor Griggs. He also is ignorant of the ways of Coney, but in turn appeals to his friend Casey, a ward politician, who of course knows the Island, and consents to act as their escort. The three set out for Coney and start on their search for Kate. The hunt is almost forgotten in the joys of looping the loop, shooting the chutes and various other diversions of the Island. When they finally find Kate, she is at her post, selling tickets at Luna. She laughs at Mrs. Greene's fears for her safety and announces the fact that she is happily married, and presents the lucky man. In a cool Coney corner, Mrs. Greene confesses that she found Coney wasn't as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was painted, and she is going to revisit it often." ...|$|E

Austria has sent a bullying and humiliating ultimatum to Serbia, who cannot possibly comply with it, and demanded an answer within forty-eight hours-failing which she will march. This means, almost inevitably, that Russia will come to the scene in defence of Serbia and in defiance of Austria, and if so, it is difficult for Germany and France to refrain from lending a hand to one side or the other. So that we are in measurable, or imaginable, distance of a real Armageddon. Happily, {{there seems to be no}} reason why we should be anything more than spectators." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oral {{arguments}} were heard by {{a three-judge panel}} on December 9 in Atlanta. Davis's lawyers again argued that exculpatory affidavits proving Davis innocent had not been examined {{in a court of}} law; they noted the witnesses who had implicated Coles, and that his photo was not included among those shown to witnesses in the case. The Senior Assistant Attorney General argued that, in extraordinary cases, evidence of wrongful conviction could be heard {{at this stage of the}} appeals process, but that in this case the recantation evidence was untrustworthy, and are generally regarded with the [...] "highest suspicion." [...] Multiple courts and boards had also previously declined appeals. During the hearing, judge Joel F. Dubina commented: [...] "As <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would be to execute an innocent man, it's also possible the real guilty person who shot Officer MacPhail is not being prosecuted." [...] Another judge, Stanley Marcus, noted that two of the witnesses had not changed their recollections, and that no DNA evidence was available to categorically clear Davis. After the hearing, Davis's sister, Martina Correia, an active campaigner for her brother stated [...] "This is not family against family. We have no ill will against the MacPhail family. When justice is found for Troy, there will be justice for Officer MacPhail." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a [...] "Jolly Boys Outing" [...] (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: [...] "See, not so bad once you're up!"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is also reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> seems, such as when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, and he replies: [...] "Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion", and when Matthias, the old man who works with the PFJ, dismisses crucifixion as [...] "a doddle" [...] and says being stabbed would be worse. The director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: [...] "Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly." [...] Religious figures later responded by saying that Jones did not seem to understand the meaning of the crucifix symbol or its significance to Christians as a reminder of the suffering and death Christ endured for their sake. The Pythons also argued that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 13% of 15 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.6/10. [...] Contemporary reviews were generally negative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "stale through and through, derived from countless cop-buddy formula thrillers, drenched in violence and devoid {{of so much}} as a whiff of real life." [...] Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This story turns out to be much more mundane than its outrageously clever premise." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the film's imaginative weapons and humor make it an entertaining crowd-pleaser but criticized its cynical violence and lack of moral consciousness. [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post compared it to Hardware and said its influences are more subtle, though it suffers from using too much humor. [...] Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote that the film [...] "isn't as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> has every right to be" [...] and [...] "provides some fun for fans of the genre". Lou Cedrone of The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Apart from the gore, I Come in Peace is an amusing mixture of action, science-fiction and comedy." [...] Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News said that it is a better than usual rip-off of The Terminator with some original ideas. [...] Time Out London wrote, [...] "With an upbeat script and a healthy sense of humour, this is an unashamedly ridiculous affair with moderate ambitions and matching success." ...|$|E
