5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the <b>beluga</b> and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|Though {{cetaceans}} {{have been}} held in captivity in both North America and Europe since the 1860s, the first being a pair of <b>Beluga</b> Whales in the New York City museum, dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine, Florida. It was here that {{it was discovered that}} dolphins could be trained to perform tricks. Recognizing the success of Marine Studios, more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment.|$|E

5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, <b>beluga</b> whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first <b>beluga</b> was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beluga</b> whale {{or white}} whale Delphinapterus leucas (cetuaq, assigarnaq, qecip'atuli in Yup'ik cituaq in Cup'ik, cetuar in Cup'ig) {{is used for}} human and dog food. <b>Beluga</b> {{harvested}} in spring are used primarily for human food, although some are used for dog food. <b>Beluga</b> harvests in the fall usually are lower than in spring. The late fall <b>beluga</b> hunts were used to produce food for the dogs. Parts of the <b>beluga</b> used for human food include the skin, fat, backstrap, and intestines. Backstrap meat is sometimes dried, and <b>beluga</b> skin is sometimes pickled. <b>Beluga</b> products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); flouring and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat. Ways of preserving and using <b>beluga</b> products show local differences between communities and families.|$|E

25|$|Belugas {{are able}} to see within and outside of water, but their vision is {{relatively}} poor when compared to dolphins. Their eyes are especially adapted to seeing under water, although when they {{come into contact with}} the air, the crystalline lens and the cornea adjust to overcome the associated myopia (the range of vision under water is short). A <b>beluga's</b> retina has cones and rods, which also suggests they can see in low light. The presence of cone cells indicates they can see colours, although this suggestion has not been confirmed. Glands located in the medial corner of their eyes secrete an oily, gelatinous substance that lubricates the eye and helps flush out foreign bodies. This substance forms a film that protects the cornea and the conjunctiva from pathogenic organisms.|$|R

In this paper we describe four significant extensions to beluga: 1) we enrich our infrastructure for modelling formal systems with first-class simultaneous substitutions, a key and common concept when reasoning about formal systems 2) we support inductive definitions in our reason-ing language that significantly increases <b>beluga’s</b> expressive power 3) we provide a totality checker that guarantees that recursive programs are well-founded and correspond to inductive proofs 4) we describe an interactive program development environment. Taken together these ex-tensions enable direct and compact mechanizations. To demonstrate bel-uga’s strength and illustrate these new features we develop a weak nor-malization proof using logical relations...|$|R
2500|$|The fins {{retain the}} bony {{vestiges of the}} <b>beluga's</b> {{mammalian}} ancestors, and are firmly bound together by connective tissue. The fins are small {{in relation to the}} size of the body, rounded and oar-shaped, and slightly curled at the tips. These versatile extremities are mainly used as a rudder to control direction, to work in synchrony with the tailfin and for agile movement in shallow waters up to [...] deep. The fins also contain a mechanism for regulating body temperature, as the arteries feeding the fin's muscles are surrounded by veins that dilate or contract to gain or lose heat. The tailfin is flat with two oar-like lobes, it does not have any bones, and is made up of hard, dense, fibrous connective tissue. The tailfin has a distinctive curvature along the lower edge. The longitudinal muscles of the back provide the ascending and descending movement of the tailfin, which has a similar thermoregulation mechanism to the pectoral fins.|$|R
40|$|When verifying that {{compiler}} phases preserve some {{property of}} the compiled program, a major difficulty resides in how to represent and manipulate variable bindings, often imposing extra complexity both on the compiler writer and the verification effort. In this paper, we show how <b>Beluga's</b> dependent contextual types let us use higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) to implement a type-preserving compiler for the simply-typed lambda-calculus, including transformations such as closure conversion and hoisting. Unlike previous implementations, which have to abandon HOAS locally {{in favor of a}} first-order binder representation, we are {{able to take advantage of}} HOAS throughout the compiler pipeline, so that the compiler code stays clean and we do not need extra lemmas about binder manipulation. Our work demonstrates that HOAS encodings offer substantial benefits to certified programming. Scope and type safety of the code transformations are statically guaranteed, and our implementation nicely mirrors the paper proof of type preservation, and can hence be seen as an encoding of the proof which happens to be executable as well...|$|R

25|$|Unlike many {{dolphins}} and whales, {{the seven}} vertebrae {{in the neck}} are not fused together, allowing the animal to turn its head laterally without needing to rotate its body. This gives the head a lateral manoeuvrability that allows an improved field of view and movement and helps in catching prey and evading predators in deep water. The rostrum has about eight to 10 small, blunt, and slightly curved teeth {{on each side of}} the jaw and a total of 36 to 40 teeth. Belugas do not use their teeth to chew, but for catching hold of their prey; they then tear them up and swallow them nearly whole. Belugas only have a single spiracle, which is located on the top of the head behind the melon, and has a muscular covering, allowing it to be completely sealed. Under normal conditions, the spiracle is closed and an animal must contract the muscular covering to open the spiracle. A <b>beluga's</b> thyroid gland is larger than that of terrestrial mammals – weighing three times more than that of a horse – which helps it to maintain a greater metabolism during the summer when it lives in river estuaries. It is the marine cetacean that most frequently develops hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions of the thyroid.|$|R
