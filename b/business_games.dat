25|$|Another {{important}} {{approach used}} in business {{school is the}} use of <b>business</b> <b>games</b> that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many of these approaches throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each of these approaches. A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility is proving to be more and more appealing. Liberal arts colleges in the United States like New England College, Wesleyan University, and Bryn Mawr College are now offering complete online degrees in many business curriculae despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.|$|E

A model of teaching English using <b>business</b> <b>game</b> developed for students whose speciality is connected with information technologies (IT) and information security is analysed in the article. The model is based on task-based learning and interdisciplinary connections of different cycle disciplines: ?English for specific purposes? and ?Information security quality assurance technologies?, thus providing situations that might occur in students? professional life. The <b>business</b> <b>game,</b> which includes simulation of eight business meetings adapted from Agile software development methodologies and project management framework Scrum, was implemented in teaching English for specific purposes to third year students of the institute of physics and technology, National technical university of Ukraine ?Kyiv polytechnic institute?.

5000|$|A {{rapid growth}} in the number of <b>business</b> <b>games</b> {{occurred}} over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some <b>business</b> <b>games</b> available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different <b>business</b> <b>games</b> or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray listed nearly 200 <b>business</b> <b>games</b> of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves [...] provided a description of 228 <b>business</b> <b>games.</b> Faria (1989) mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the USA in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s Faria (1990) {{estimated}} that there were approximately 228 games available in the USA, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using <b>business</b> <b>games.</b> At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games.

Many <b>business</b> <b>games</b> focus on organizational behaviors. Some of these are computer simulations while others are simple designs for play and debriefing.
