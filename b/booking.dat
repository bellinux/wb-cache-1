The different diabetes receptions in Sweden works in different speeds with the development of e-health services such as web-based <b>bookings.</b> The three County Councils Blekinge, Kronoberg and Kalmars opinions about the introduction of web-based <b>bookings</b> were collected through interviews with twelve diabetes nurses from nine receptions. The purpose was to find out what conditions and contradictions that the employees of the receptors had experienced at the time of introduction or when the decision about the introduction was made. The purpose was also to show some tips and advice for receptions that is planning to introduce web-based <b>bookings.</b> The theory Diffusion of Innovations was used to analyze the results based on factors such as the innovations attributes, time for implementation, communication channels that were used and the social systems effect on the implementation. Even though four of the total nine receptions had introduced, or plans on introducing web-based <b>bookings,</b> none of them had actually implemented web-based <b>bookings</b> into a permanent change where the technology is used as planned. The failure to implement web-based <b>bookings</b> could be due to the many contradictions that has been pointed out by the informants. One of the most significant contradictions was the complexity because the majority of the informants considered the technology to be difficult to learn, hard to grasp that web-based <b>bookings</b> was, and hard to understand what it would be used for. This could have been happened {{due to the fact that}} the employees did not have a chance to test or observe the system before the introduction. Another crucial contradiction was the lack of demand of web-based <b>bookings</b> from the receptions patients. This is an interesting result because the informants also described many benefits from the patient's point of view. The results of this study also showed some benefits and tips for a successful implementation. Some good conditions was the physical communication regarding web-based <b>bookings</b> and the introduction, that the managers and management showed support for the change and that the receptions saw a need for web-based <b>bookings</b> and they also considered the technology to have more advantageous than the prior art. The authors also suggest that further studies as to why patients choose not to use e-health services, such as web-based <b>bookings,</b> even though they are available...|$|R
