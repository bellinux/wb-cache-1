50|$|Loaders {{are used}} mainly for loading {{materials}} into trucks, laying pipe, clearing rubble, and digging. A loader {{is not the}} most efficient machine for digging as it cannot dig very deep below the level of its wheels, like a backhoe can. The capacity of a loader bucket can be anywhere from 0.5 to 36 m3 depending upon the size of the machine and its application. The front loader's <b>bucket</b> <b>capacity</b> is generally much bigger than a <b>bucket</b> <b>capacity</b> of a backhoe loader.Unlike most bulldozers, most loaders are wheeled and not tracked, although track loaders are common. They are successful where sharp edged materials in construction debris would damage rubber wheels, or where the ground is soft and muddy. Wheels provide better mobility and speed and do not damage paved roads as much as tracks, but provide less traction.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade various spatial data {{structures}} have been designed and compared against each other, all of them reflecting a dynamic situation with ongoing object insertion and deletion processes. Assuming the frequently occurring situation where the data is known in beforehand and using as performance measure the expected number of data bucket accesses needed to perform a window query, the original dynamic clustering problem turns into a classical optimization problem. For the special case of <b>bucket</b> <b>capacity</b> c b = 2 we present a mapping onto the well-known graph matching problem. For the general case of c b 3 and arbitrary cost functions, the optimization problem is NP-hard.

40|$|The leaky bucket {{controller}} {{has been}} proposed to shape traffic entering an ATM network. Cells arrive at the leaky bucket controller according to a superposition {{of a group of}} heterogeneous Markov modulated sources (modeled by a multidimensional Markov process). The <b>bucket</b> <b>capacity</b> is L tokens. Every time slot the bucket leaks s tokens. If a cell arrives I tokens are added to the bucket unless it overflows. A cells producing an overflow is marked nonconforming and no tokens are added. The proportion of nonconforming cells and the mean time between nonconforming cells are significant for evaluating the performance of the leaky bucket. Such parameters can be approximated by developing a change of measure to transform a recurrent process into a transient one. For this twisted process, the event until overflow is no longer a rare event and can be simulated efficiently. We can now give a formula for calculating the proportion of cells which are nonconforming as well as the mean time between bursts of nonconforming cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} meet the {{challenges}} of the Russian mining industry such as high depreciation of fixed assets, the reproduction of which was mainly due to the intensive use of imported equipment in recent years; the majority equipment produced in the Russian Federation loses the aggregate value of the imported goods ownership, despite the lower initial cost, etc. The efforts should be focused on the development of the high-tech equipment which requires conducting research and development activities to solve these problems. For the purpose of import substitution, it is necessary to increase the mining machinery production volume for openwork. The creation of mining excavators with large <b>bucket</b> <b>capacity</b> requires design and circuitry solutions arguments, and further ergonomic research. In particular, the design and improvement of processes, methods, activity algorithms of the excavator operator as well as those tools and working conditions that directly affect the parameters of the human activity and conditions in the interests of efficiency and productivity in open cast mining.

40|$|Reliability-based {{maintenance}} policies allow {{qualitative and}} quantitative evaluation of system downtimes via revealing main causes of breakdowns and discussing required preventive activities against failures. Application of preventive maintenance {{is especially important for}} mining machineries since production is highly affected from machinery breakdowns. Overburden stripping operations are one of the integral parts in surface coal mine productions. Draglines are extensively utilized in overburden stripping operations and they achieve earthmoving activities with <b>bucket</b> <b>capacities</b> up to 168 m 3. The massive structure and operational severity of these machines increase the importance of performance awareness for individual working components. Research on draglines is rarely observed in the literature and maintenance studies for these earthmovers have been generally ignored. On this basis, this paper offered a comprehensive reliability assessment for two draglines currently operating in the Tunçbilek coal mine and discussed preventive replacement for wear-out components of the draglines considering cost factors...|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} between the descriptions given by Turner and the ITU-T/ATM Forum is that Turner's is specific to traffic policing, whereas the ITU-T/ATM Forum's is applicable to both traffic policing and traffic shaping. Also, Turner does not state that {{the contents of the}} counter should only be affected by conforming packets, and should only be incremented when this would not cause it to exceed a limit, i.e. Turner does not explicitly state that the <b>bucket’s</b> <b>capacity</b> or counter's maximum value is finite. To make Turner’s description clearly aligned with ITU-T, the statement “If the counter exceeds a threshold upon being incremented, the network discards the packet” would have to be changed to something like “If the counter would exceed a threshold to the bucket depth, T + &tau;, upon being incremented, the network discards the packet and the counter is not incremented", i.e. it is only incremented when it is {{less than or equal to}} the limit value, &tau;, or at least T less than the bucket depth in the ITU-T description.|$|R

40|$|Software-defined {{networking}} (SDN) is {{a promising}} network paradigm for future Internet. The centralized controller and simplified switches replace the traditional complex forwarding devices, and make network management convenient. However, the switches in SDN currently have limited ternary {{content addressable memory}} (TCAM) to store specific routing rules from the controller. This bottleneck provokes cyber attacks to overload the switches. Despite existing some countermeasures for such attacks, they are proposed based on simplified attack patterns. In this paper, we review the table-overflow attack using a sophisticated attack pattern. In the attack pattern, attack flows are targeted at their middle hops instead of endpoints. We first define potential targets in the network topology, and then we propose three specific traffic features and a monitoring mechanism to detect and locate the attackers. Further, we propose a mitigation mechanism to limit the attack rate using the token bucket model. With the control of token add rate and <b>bucket</b> <b>capacity,</b> it avoids the table overflow on the victim switch. Extensive simulations in different types of topologies and experiments in our testbed are provided to show the performance of our proposal...|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} {{performed}} {{of the issues}} arising in the e cient processing of spatial queries in large spatial databases. The domain is restricted to line segment databases such as those found in transportation networks and polygonal maps. Three classes of queries are identi ed. Those that deal with the line segments themselves, those that involve both the line segments and the space from which they are drawn (e. g., proximity queries), and those that involve attributes of the line segments. Handling {{the three types of}} queries requires that the line segments be stored implicitly using a bucketing approach on the space from which they are drawn. A number of bucketing approaches are examined and the pmr quadtree is chosen as the most suitable representation. Its storage and execution time requirements are evaluated in the context of nding the nearest line segment toagiven point.

50|$|As can be seen, {{these two}} {{descriptions}} are essentially mirror images of one another: one adds {{something to the}} bucket {{on a regular basis}} and takes something away for conforming packets down to a limit of zero; the other takes away regularly and adds for conforming packets up to a limit of the <b>bucket's</b> <b>capacity.</b> So, is an implementation that adds tokens for a conforming packet and removes them at a fixed rate an implementation of the leaky bucket or of the token bucket? Similarly, which algorithm is used in an implementation that removes water for a conforming packet and adds water at a fixed rate? In fact both are effectively the same, i.e. implementations of both the leaky bucket and token bucket, as these are the same basic algorithm described differently. This explains why, given equivalent parameters, the two algorithms will see exactly the same packets as conforming or nonconforming. The differences in the properties and performance of implementations of the leaky and token bucket algorithms thus result entirely from the differences in the implementations, i.e. they do not stem from differences in the underlying algorithms.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{will explain}} new {{processes}} {{to reduce the}} lost time between order entry and the scheduling of vehicles to the appropriate final assembly lines. Very often, this takes days and weeks. New order management and related systems {{must be able to}} directly process vehicle orders entered by the dealer or, in the future, by the customers themselves, and assign them to suitable plants. This system, which substantially reduces the information flow times, is the "Virtual Order Bank", abbreviated to VOB, representing the central unit of the new order management system. Due to plant capacity constraints the VOB must not accept unlimited numbers of orders. It is necessary to first define the capacity of the final assembly plants and all BTO suppliers and have this data stored in the VOB. This capacity data does not refer to fixed values but to capacity margins indicating minima and maxima, which are adapted for each product every six weeks. Based on these margins in the supply chain, the <b>capacity</b> <b>buckets</b> of the final assembly plants are defined on a daily basis before being assigned to orders arriving in the VOB. Apart from directly booking the <b>capacity</b> <b>buckets,</b> the network also buffers fluctuations in demand, making it more flexible. It is only possible to calculate a reliable delivery date after <b>capacity</b> <b>buckets</b> have been defined and an integrated Available-To-Promise (ATP) process put in place. The chapter will also show processes for capacity management to determine requirements and match them with the capacity available at the relevant companies across multiple levels of the supply chain.
