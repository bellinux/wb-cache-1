40|$|Introduction: Dendritic cells (DCs) {{have been}} {{extensively}} utilised in cancer immunotherapy {{due to their}} central role in immunity. Despite evident CTL reactivity, vaccination with peptide-pulsed DCs rarely achieved clinical benefits. Apoptotic tumour cells (TCs) are promising candidates for DC loading, however the induction of apoptosis in an immunogenic context is a pre-requisite to achieve immunity rather than tolerance. The {{aim of this study}} is to induce an immunogenic cell death in TCs using the synthetic analogue of dsRNA, poly(I:C), to facilitate presentation of antigenic peptides by DCs thereby inducing Th 1 cell and CTL differentiation. Methods: A variety of TC lines were tested for their sensitivity to apoptosis in response to poly(I:C), and IFN-γ was used to sensitise for dsRNA induced cell death. The ability of human monocyte-derived DCs to endocytose such tumour preparations was assessed by flow cytometry. DC maturation and activation was measured by cytokine detection and cell surface phenotyping. The ability of DCs to drive a Thl <b>biased</b> <b>response</b> was determined by cytokine assays and intracellular cytokine staining. The expansion of antigen specific CTLs was investigated by pre-loading of DCs with the well characterised influenza peptide, M 1. Results: Results show that poly(I:C) pulsing can result in apoptosis of some tumour lines which is augmented by IFN-γ (IFN-γ/poly(I:C) pulsing), while ensuring cytosolic delivery of poly(I:C) by a transfection reagent (IFN-γ/poly(I:C) transfection) renders causes apoptosis in all tumour lines. Endocytosis of IFN-γ/poly(I:C) TCs can mature and activate DCs to induce the development of a Th 1 <b>biased</b> <b>response</b> regardless of whether TC apoptosis is induced by pulsing or transfection with poly(I:C). Conclusion: Taken together, the data suggest that poly(I:C) induced tumour cell death may provide DCs with appropriate 'danger signals' which in turn can drive the development of a Thl <b>biased</b> <b>response</b> required for the development of anti-tumour immunity.

I found at least moderate convergence of indices of the same <b>response</b> <b>bias</b> for a given instrument. Individual differences in acquiescence and ERS <b>response</b> <b>biases</b> were found to have some stability, but primarily across instruments with similar rating scales and constructs. I found mixed support for the hypothesis that ARS would be higher in collectivist cultures than in individualist cultures but ARS tended to be higher in Mexico than in the other cultures. ERS was found to be higher on scales with fewer response points compared to scales with higher numbers of response points. Hofstede's Power Distance dimension did not account for cross-cultural differences in ERS.

40|$|<b>Response</b> <b>bias</b> is a {{component}} of decision making that {{can be defined as}} the general willingness to respond a certain way. For example, in recognition memory, one can have a <b>response</b> <b>bias</b> towards responding that a test item has been previously studied, or in reasoning, one can have a <b>response</b> <b>bias</b> towards responding that a conclusion is logically valid. However, not all individuals have the same <b>response</b> <b>bias.</b> Indeed, {{there is some evidence that}} <b>response</b> <b>bias</b> is a stable cognitive trait in memory that differs across individuals (Kantner 2 ̆ 6 Lindsay, 2012, 2014). One predictor of this trait may be cognitive ability, since it appears to predict <b>response</b> <b>bias</b> in memory (Zhu et al., 2010) and in reasoning (e. g., Handley 2 ̆ 6 Trippas, 2015).

Very rapidly, a synthetic glycololipid analogue of this natural molecule was discovered, called KRN 7000. Associated with the CD 1 d protein, this α-galactosylceramide 1 (KRN 7000) interacts with the T-cell antigen receptor to form a ternary complex that yields T helper (Th) 1 and Th 2 responses with opposing effects.

The traditional view of prejudice coheres with models of mental repre-sentations as stored constructs (i. e., things), but recent models of mental representation instead focus on con-textual variation and flexibility (i. e., attitudes as states; Smith, 1998).

On treatment with the toll-like receptor 7 agonist imquimod (IMQ), Trim 32 knockout mice displayed compromised psoriasiform phenotypes and defective T helper type 17 response. Instead, IMQ treatment of Trim 32 knockout mice induced AD-like phenotypes with enhanced skin infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells, elevation of T helper type 2 cytokines/chemokines expression, and reduced expression of filaggrin protein expression. Furthermore, although the induction of phosphorylated Stat 3 and RelA was compromised after IMQ treatment in the knockout mice, phosphorylated Stat 6 was elevated. CC chemokine ligand 20 induction by tumor necrosis factor-α and IL- 17 A was reduced in Trim 32 -deficient keratinocytes, whereas CC chemokine ligand 5 induction by tumor necrosis factor-α and IL- 4 was enhanced.

In this paper we propose indirect techniques for measuring content privacy concerns through surveys, thus hopefully diminishing any emotional response. We present a design for indirect surveys and test the design’s use as (1) a means to measure relative privacy concerns across content types, (2) a tool for predicting unwillingness to share content (a possible indicator of privacy concern), and (3) a gauge for two underlying dimensions of privacy – content importance and the willingness to share content. Our evaluation consists of 3 surveys, taken by 200 users each, in which privacy is never asked about directly, but privacy warnings are issued with increasing escalation in the instructions and individual question-wording. We demonstrate that this escalation results in statistically and practically significant differences in responses to individual questions. In addition, we compare results against a direct privacy survey and show that rankings of privacy concerns are increasingly preserved as privacy language increases in the indirect surveys, thus indicating our mapping of the indirect questions to privacy ratings is accurately reflecting privacy concerns...|$|E
5000|$|These researchers' most {{noteworthy}} {{measurement for}} authoritarianism is the [...] "F-scale", designed to tap {{a set of}} beliefs thought {{to be associated with}} authoritarianism without the need for specific out-groups indicated. Kirscht and Dillehay (1967) outlined several problems with the Berkeley studies, including <b>response</b> <b>bias.</b> <b>Response</b> <b>bias</b> results from the F scale being uniformly worded in a confirming direction. Hence, if one tends to respond in agreement with items, regardless of their content, one is rated as an authoritarian by such a test. Several studies have shown that more variance of the F scale can be explained by <b>response</b> <b>bias</b> than the content of the items (Kirscht & Dillehay, 1967).|$|R

"REBT {{assumes that}} human thinking, emotion, and action {{are not really}} {{separate}} or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much {{of what we call}} emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind — a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind — of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human organisms and seems to work in a kind of closed circuit with a feedback mechanism: First, perception <b>biases</b> <b>response,</b> and then <b>response</b> tends to <b>bias</b> subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent perceptions, and prior <b>responses</b> appear to <b>bias</b> subsequent <b>responses.</b> What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element." ...|$|R
