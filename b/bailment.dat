Malmö FF early expressed their desire to buy the stocks of Peab and Erling Pålsson to reduce rent on the stadium and increase profits. On 27 April 2012, {{it was announced that}} Malmö FF were close to buying the full 25% of stocks owned by Erling Pålsson and 25% of the stocks owned by Peab, increasing their own share to 75% and leaving Peab with a 25% share. On 1 May 2012, Malmö Stad granted the <b>bailment</b> needed for Malmö FF to buy the stocks. The deal, worth 90 million kronor, was finalised on 13 June 2012. The long-term goal for Malmö FF is to buy the remaining 25% of the stocks to fully own Swedbank Stadion.|$|E

25|$|In most legal systems, a {{bank deposit}} {{is not a}} <b>bailment.</b> In other words, the funds {{deposited}} {{are no longer the}} property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a deposit account (a checking or savings account). That deposit account is a liability on the balance sheet of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{results are}} seen in other cases from the time. The two actions were {{regarded}} as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. Trover must involve a wrongful detention of goods which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not. The theory of trespass was that the plaintiff remained {{the owner of the}} chattel, with his possession only interrupted or interfered with, so that when it was tendered back to the plaintiff, he must accept it. The damages must be limited to the loss of use, which could be considerably less than its total value. Trover, which involved lost goods or those placed in a <b>bailment,</b> necessitated full replacement damages. Once the damages were paid, the ownership of the chattel passed to the defendant in trover.|$|E

Liability to the third bailee was not transferable. In later times, lawyers would talk of trover and <b>bailment.</b> In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the detainer rather than the <b>bailment</b> as the gist of the action, where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'"

With respect to each institution, we generally find that in personam relations are governed by flexible default rules; in rem relations are governed by bright-line rules that impose immutable and standardized obligations; intermediate relations, as befits their intermediate level of information costs, feature a type and degree of standardization beyond pure contract but short of pure property...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two years the {{teaching}} of Personal Property Law has undergone a major transformation. At this point in time, {{after the end of the}} transitional 2 year period of the Personal Property Securities Act (PPSA) it is clear that the traditional common law principles now need to be examined in the context of a statute based approach. The PPSA has made significant inroads into the way personal property is dealt with in commercial transactions. Not only has the PPSA impacted on various types of security agreements such as mortgages, charges, and pledges, but it also reaches into areas such as leases, liens and <b>bailments.</b> Probably the most important effect the PPSA has had on the way property ownership is perceived, is the way it has disenfranchised the concept of nemo dat quod non habet. The dilemma for educators is to make sense of these ground breaking developments in a way students can understand. The challenge is to do so in a way that familiarises students with the traditional common law concepts, while teaching them the ground rules and intricacies of the PPSA as they apply to personal property...|$|R
