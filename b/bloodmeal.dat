To determine {{the relative importance}} of various hosts for potential vectors of JE virus, we investigated the host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes in northern Australia and Western Province of Papua New Guinea, with particular attention to pigs, Sus scrofa L. - the main amplifying host of JE virus in South-east Asia. Mosquitoes were collected by CDC light traps baited with dry ice and 1 -octen- 3 -ol, run 16. 00 - 08. 00 hours, mostly set away from human habitations, if possible in places frequented by feral pigs. <b>Bloodmeals</b> of 2569 mosquitoes, representing 15 species, were identified by gel diffusion assay.

Overall, Cx. annulirostris obtained > 94 % of blood meals from mammals, comprising marsupials (37 %), pigs (20 %), dogs (16 %), and cows (11 %), although the proportion feeding {{on each of these}} host types varied between study locations.

Interestingly, < 3 % of Cx. annulirostris had fed on pigs at locations on Badu Island where JEV was detected in multiple pools of mosquitoes in a concurrent study. This suggests that either alternative hosts, such as birds, which comprised 21 % of blood meals identified, or infected mosquitoes immigrating from areas where domestic pigs are housed, may have contributed to transmission at this location.

40|$|Abstract Background Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges are vectors for a {{diversity}} of pathogens including bluetongue virus (BTV) that generate important economic losses. BTV has expanded its range in recent decades, {{probably due to the}} expansion of its main vector and the presence of other autochthonous competent vectors. Although the Canary Islands are still free of bluetongue disease (BTD), Spain and Europe have had to face up to a spread of bluetongue with disastrous consequences. Therefore, it is essential to identify the distribution of biting midges and understand their feeding patterns in areas susceptible to BTD. To that end, we captured biting midges on two farms in the Canary Islands (i) to identify the midge species in question and characterize their COI barcoding region and (ii) to ascertain the source of their <b>bloodmeals</b> using molecular tools. Methods Biting midges were captured using CDC traps baited with a 4 -W blacklight (UV) bulb on Gran Canaria and on Tenerife. Biting midges were quantified and identified according to their wing patterns. A 688 bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene of 20 biting midges (11 from Gran Canaria and 9 from Tenerife) were PCR amplified using the primers LCO 1490 and HCO 2198. Moreover, after selected all available females showing any rest of blood in their abdomen, a nested-PCR approach was used to amplify a fragment of the COI gene from vertebrate DNA contained in <b>bloodmeals.</b> The origin of <b>bloodmeals</b> was identified by comparison with the nucleotide-nucleotide basic alignment search tool (BLAST). Results The morphological identification of 491 female biting midges revealed the presence of a single morphospecies belonging to the Obsoletus group. When sequencing the barcoding region of the 20 females used to check genetic variability, we identified two haplotypes differing in a single base. Comparison analysis using the nucleotide-nucleotide basic alignment search tool (BLAST) showed that both haplotypes belong to Culicoides obsoletus, a potential BTV vector. As well, using molecular tools we identified the feeding sources of 136 biting midges and were able to confirm that C. obsoletus females feed on goats and sheep on both islands. Conclusions These results confirm that the feeding pattern of C. obsoletus is a potentially important factor in BTV transmission to susceptible hosts in case of introduction into the archipelago. Consequently, in the Canary Islands it is essential to maintain vigilance of Culicoides- transmitted viruses such as BTV and the novel Schmallenberg virus. </p...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, concern has arisen that this virus may also pose a biosecurity threat to Australia. West Nile virus is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle between birds and ornithophilic Culex spp. mosquitoes. Since its introduction into the United States in 1999, it {{has been responsible for}} over 11, 000 human cases of neurological disease and over 1, 000 human deaths. In addition, WNV has caused extensive equine and avian mortality. Should an exotic, virulent strain of WNV be introduced into Australia, it may have significant impact on human and animal health. This thesis examines entomological factors which may influence the potential for an exotic, pathogenic strain of WNV to become established in eastern Australia and be maintained in urban transmission cycles. Further, it aims to elucidate the most likely candidate vectors for the maintenance of WNV in natural transmission cycles. Components include: a) laboratory-based vector competence experiments to assess the ability of Australian mosquito species to become infected with and transmit a North American strain of WNV; b) identification of the vertebrate origin of mosquito <b>bloodmeals</b> using serological and molecular assays; c) an evaluation of the efficacy of bird-baited traps for collecting ornithophilic mosquitoes at ground level and in the tree canopy; and d) examination of the prevalence of endemic arboviruses, including Kunjin virus (KUNV; an Australian subtype of WNV) in mosquitoes collected from urban centres of eastern Australia. Vector competence experiments were conducted with field-collected Australian mosquito species. Nineteen species were were exposed to a 1999 New York strain of WNV using an artificial membrane feeding apparatus and transmission was attempted using an in vitro modified capillary tube method. A number of Culex species, including Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex gelidus, demonstrated high vector competence for WNV. Culex annulirostris, the primary KUNV vector, was the most competent vector, displaying transmission rates of  84 %. Other common species, including Aedes vigilax, Aedes procax and Verrallina spp. were less susceptible to infection. Approximately 1, 200 blood engorged mosquitoes were analysed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine host species. Overall, 90 % of <b>bloodmeals</b> from Cx. quinquefasciatus were avian in origin, while 22 % of <b>bloodmeals</b> from Cx. annulirostris were from birds. Molecular assays were further used to determine which bird species were commonly targeted by a selection of ornithophilic mosquito species. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data indicated that most (93 %) avian <b>bloodmeals</b> from Cx. quinquefasciatus were obtained from passerine birds (order Passeriformes). Avian species commonly targeted by Cx. quinquefasciatus included Sphecotheres vieilloti (Australasian figbird; 39 % of total identified), Sturnus tristis (common myna; 19 %) and Philemon buceroides (helmeted friarbird; 17 %). Alternatively, the majority (87 %) of avian <b>bloodmeals</b> identified from Cx. annulirostris were from non-passerine birds, with most <b>bloodmeals</b> obtained from ducks (72 %; family Anatidae). Seven field-based Latin Square trials conducted in Brisbane and Cairns showed that conventional CO 2 -baited CDC traps yielded higher numbers of Culex spp. than novel bird-baited traps, both at ground level and in the tree canopy. In Brisbane, CO 2 -baited CDC traps placed at ground level (approximately 1 m from ground) collected significantly more Cx. annulirostris than those at canopy height (5 - 10 m) during two trials, and more Ae. vigilax and Aedes procax during one trial each. Conversely, in Cairns, CO 2 -baited CDC traps placed in the tree canopy collected significantly more Culex squamosus during two trials, and significantly more Aedeomyia catasticta and Culex cubiculi during one trial each. Consistently low yields of ornithophilic species including Culex australicus and Cx. quinquefasciatus in all traps tested suggests the need to employ alternative trapping measures to target these species in urban areas. Over 1, 800 mosquito pools (comprising over 65, 000 individual mosquitoes collected from urban environments) were tested for evidence of arboviral infection. None of the pools showed evidence of flavivirus infection, but two alphaviruses were isolated from mosquito pools from Cairns. One isolate of Barmah Forest virus was obtained from a pool of 100 Ae. vigilax, and a pool of 89 Verrallina carmenti yielded an isolate of Ross River virus. In addition, an isolate most similar to a newly described bunyavirus, Stretch Lagoon orbivirus, was obtained from a single Aedes alternans collected from Sydney. The outcomes of this thesis demonstrate that a number of Australian mosquito species can become infected with and transmit a virulent strain of WNV, should it be introduced into Australia. Analysis of the host feeding patterns of these potential vectors in urban environments demonstrates that a number of candidate vectors, including Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. annulirostris, readily feed on common bird species. Further, the absence of detectable flavivirus infection in urban mosquito populations shown here suggests that endemic urban flaviviruses would have minimal influence on potential WNV transmission. Notwithstanding other ecological factors that may influence the likelihood of enzootic or epizootic transmission including susceptibility of vertebrate hosts and mechanisms of introduction, the potential establishment of an exotic, virulent strain of WNV in urban areas of Australia is certainly possible given the evidence provided in this thesis...|$|R

One promising approach {{relies on the}} use of traditional plant remedies with insecticidal activities. Methods: In this study, we assessed the effect of blood treated with different doses of NeemAzal (R) (NA, neem seed extract) on mosquitoes (Anopheles coluzzii) and tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis) (i) avidity to feed on the treated blood, (ii) longevity, and (iii) behavioural responses to human and calf odours in dual-choice tests. We also gauged NeemAzal (R) toxicity in mice. Results: In An. coluzzii, the ingestion of NA in <b>bloodmeals</b> offered by membrane feeding resulted in (i) primary antifeedancy; (ii) decreased longevity; and (iii) reduced response to host odours. In G. palpalis gambiensis, NA caused (i) a knock-down effect; (ii) decreased or increased longevity depending on the dose; and (iii) reduced response to host stimuli. In both cases, NA did not affect the anthropophilic rate of activated insects. Overall, the most significant effects were observed with NA treated <b>bloodmeals</b> at a dose of 2000 mu g/ml for mosquitoes and 50 mu g/ml for tsetse flies. Although no mortality in mice was observed after 14 days of follow-up at oral doses of 3. 8, 5. 6, 8. 4 and 12. 7 g/kg, behavioural alterations were noticed at doses above 8 g/kg. Conclusion: This study revealed promising activity of NA on A. coluzzii and G. palpalis gambiensis but additional research is needed to assess field efficacy of neem products to be possibly integrated in vector control programmes...|$|R

The effects on <b>bloodmeal</b> molecular mass, crystallinity, thermal stability, solubility, product color and smell is investigated. 3 [*]wt% PAA is the lowest concentration to sufficiently remove the odor from <b>bloodmeal.</b> Protein molecular mass is unaffected by PAA concentration. The crystallinity decreases from 35 to 31 – 27 % when treated with 1 – 5 [*]wt% PAA.

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (HP) can degrade soluble heme, forming {{yellow or}} colorless degradation products. Thermal treatment during <b>bloodmeal</b> production changes the conformation of oxyhemoglobin trapping heme in hydrophobic protein regions or forms methemoglobin (metHb) heme which catalytically removes HP. As a result, HP can only degrade {{a portion of}} the heme present in <b>bloodmeal</b> leading to poor decoloring. Equilibrium peracetic acid (PAA) solutions can effectively decolor <b>bloodmeal.</b> This work assessed the ability of PAA to decolor <b>bloodmeal</b> and the mechanism by which it occurs. The inability of HP to decolor <b>bloodmeal</b> is determined {{by the fact that it}} is unable to permanently degrade metHb heme, or hydrophobically trapped heme. Addition of organic acids to HP led to significant swelling of the protein chains but also to poorer decoloring and lower HP consumption compared to PAA. This suggested that in the case of PAA solutions, where bleaching was facile, the reason PAA solutions are capable of decoloring <b>bloodmeal</b> was due to the action of the PAA molecule against heme, whereas HP and acetic (ethanoic) acid played only minor roles in total bleaching. The decolored protein powder has reduced odor and whiter color, and is suitable for applications such as bioplastics...|$|E
40|$|During the {{processing}} of Novatein Thermoplastic Protein (NTP), volatile compounds are released which are odourous and potentially harmful. For NTP to be manufactured on a commercial scale the odour that currently arises during production must be minimised. Literature revealed that blood components are thermally unstable under oxidising conditions and in addition, the presence of iron in <b>bloodmeal,</b> may catalyse the formation of various odourous compounds. The objectives of this work were to establish an odour profile for <b>bloodmeal</b> and pre-extruded NTP (PNTP) and {{determine the effect of}} chemically treating <b>bloodmeal</b> on the resulting odour profile. In addition, the potential for NTP to be degraded by composting and effect of prolonged exposure to UV radiation was investigated. It was found that the initial odour of <b>bloodmeal</b> was caused by putrefaction during the storage of whole blood prior to drying as well as the formation of other, less odourous, volatile compounds derived from lipids and proteins during drying. The odour profile of pre-extruded NTP (PNTP) was found to change after chemical treatment of <b>bloodmeal.</b> Chemical treatments successfully minimised or changed the odour of the <b>bloodmeal.</b> Peracetic acid treatment successfully removed the characteristic <b>bloodmeal</b> odour resulting in decolourised <b>bloodmeal</b> with a mild vinegar odour. In general, removing odour from the PNTP could not be achieved without the addition of 10 - 20 wt% activated carbon or greater than 20 wt% natural zeolite. Additionally, for NTP to be marketed as biodegradable as well as bio-derived plastic, it must be shown to degrade in the environment at a rate comparable with cellulose. NTP was found to undergo substantial deterioration and polymer degradation within 12 weeks of composting, for plasticised samples up to 47 % dry mass loss was observed. However, exposure to 12 weeks of ultra-violet radiation, lead to embrittlement of the plastic with very little polymer degradation occurring...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} Chagas disease {{prevention}} are targeted at domestic vector reduction, {{as well as}} control of transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission. Population connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected vectors and hosts, among sylvatic, ecotone and domestic habitats could jeopardize targeted efforts to reduce human exposure. This connectivity was evaluated in a Mexican community with reports of high vector infestation, human infection, and Chagas disease, surrounded by agricultural and natural areas. We surveyed bats, rodents, and triatomines in dry and rainy seasons in three adjacent habitats (domestic, ecotone, sylvatic), and measured T. cruzi prevalence, and host feeding sources of triatomines. Of 12 bat and 7 rodent species, no bat tested positive for T. cruzi, but all rodent species tested positive {{in at least one}} season or habitat. Highest T. cruzi infection prevalence was found in the rodents, Baiomys musculus and Neotoma mexicana. In general, parasite prevalence was not related to habitat or season, although the sylvatic habitat had higher infection prevalence than by chance, during the dry season. Wild and domestic mammals were identified as <b>bloodmeals</b> of T. pallidipennis, with 9 % of individuals having mixed human (4. 8 % single human) and other mammal species in <b>bloodmeals,</b> especially in the dry season; these vectors tested > 50 % positive for T. cruzi. Overall, ecological connectivity is broad across this matrix, based on high rodent community similarity, vector and T. cruzi presence. Cost-effective T. cruzi, vector control strategies and Chagas disease transmission prevention will need to consider continuous potential for parasite movement over the entire landscape. This study provides clear evidence that these strategies will need to include reservoir/host species in at least ecotones, in addition to domestic habitats...|$|R
40|$|The ecology, {{population}} dynamics, {{and malaria}} vector efficiency of #Anopheles gambiae$ and #An. arabiensis$ were studied for 2 yr in a Sahelian village of Senegal. Anophelines were captured at human bait and resting indoors by pyrethrum spray. Mosquitoes {{belonging to the}} #An. gambiae$ complex were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Of 26, 973 females, #An. arabiensis$ represented 79 % of the mosquitoes captured and remained {{in the study area}} longer than #An. gambiae$ after the rains terminated. There were no differences in nocturnal biting cycles or endophagous rates between #An. gambiae$ and #An. arabiensis$. Based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test of <b>bloodmeals,</b> the anthropophilic rate of these 2 vectors were both approximately 60 %, when comparisons were made during the same period. Overall, 18 % of the resting females had patent mixed <b>bloodmeals,</b> mainly human-bovine. The parity rates of #An. gambiae$ and #An. arabiensis$ varied temporally. Despite similar behavior, the #Plasmodium falciparum$ circumsporozoite protein (CSP) rates were different between #An. gambiae$ (4. 1 %) and #An. arabiensis$ (1. 3 %). #P. malariae$ and #P. ovale$ only represented 4 % of the total #Plasmodium$ identified in mosquitoes. Transmission was seasonal, occurring mainly during 4 mo. The CSP entomological inoculation rates were 128 bites per human per year for the 1 st yr and 100 for the 2 nd yr. Because of the combination of a high human biting rate and a low CSP rate, #An. arabiensis$ accounted for 63 % of transmission. Possible origin of differences in CSP rate between #An. gambiae$ and #An. arabiensis$ is discussed in relation to the parity rate, blood feeding frequency, and the hypothesis of genetic factors.

In Zimbabwe, studies were made {{of the effect of}} herd size and composition on individual biting rates by capturing tsetse as they approached and departed from groups of one to 12 cattle. Flies were captured using a ring of electrocuting nets and <b>bloodmeals</b> were analysed using DNA markers to identify which individual cattle were bitten.
