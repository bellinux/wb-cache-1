50|$|Examples {{of drugs}} {{incorporating}} the methoxyamine unit are <b>brasofensine</b> and gemifloxacin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brasofensine</b> {{was made}} [...] "class A" [...] in the UK under the MDA (misuse of drugs act). BF is an {{interesting}} compound {{in so far as}} the semi-synthetic procedure for making it actually uses cocaine as the starting material.|$|E
5000|$|... (+)-CPCA ("nocaine") is the 3R,4S {{piperidine}} stereoisomer of (phenyltropane based) RTI-31. It is non addictive, {{although this}} {{might be due to}} it being a NDRI, not a SNDRI. The β-naphthyl analog of [...] "Nocaine" [...] is a SNDRI though in the case of both the SS and RR enantiomers. Consider the piperidine analogs of <b>brasofensine</b> and tesofensine. These were prepared by NeuroSearch (In Denmark) by the chemists Peter Moldt (2002), and Frank Wätjen (2004-2009). There are four separate isomers to consider (SS, RR, S/R and R/S). This is because there are two chiral carbon sites of asymmetry (means 2 to the power of n isomers to consider where n is the number of chiral carbons). They are therefore a diastereo(iso)meric pair of racemers. With a racemic pair of diastereomers, there is still the question of syn (cis) or anti (trans). In the case of the phenyltropanes, although there are four chiral carbons, there are only eight possible isomers to consider. This is {{based on the fact that}} the compound is bicyclic and therefore does not adhere to the equation given above.|$|E
