[...] cried Nelson, {{snatching}} it up and {{fumbling with}} it in his awkward, one-handed attempt to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals.</b> Lady Hamilton ran to his assistance, but no sooner had {{she glanced at the}} paper inclosed than she burst into a shrill scream, and throwing up her hands and her eyes, she sank backwards in a swoon. I could not but observe, however, that her fall was very carefully executed, and that she was fortunate enough, in spite of her insensibility, to arrange her drapery and attitude into a graceful and classical design. But he, the honest seaman, so incapable of deceit or affectation that he could not suspect it in others, ran madly to the bell, shouting for the maid, the doctor, and the smelling-salts, with incoherent words of grief, and such passionate terms of emotion that my father thought it more discreet to twitch me by the sleeve as a signal that we should steal from the room. There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, {{at the edge of the}} Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.|$|E

50|$|The {{leading case}} of joint authorship in India is Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors. In this case, the {{plaintiff}} {{is the legal}} heir of {{the author of the}} book 'India Wins Freedom'. The defendant is the publisher of said book. The defendant entered into an agreement with one Prof. Humayun Kabir to make contents of the book known to the public. The plaintiff obtained an injunction restraining defendants from breaking seals of covers of the complete book 'India Wins Freedom' and from making its contents known to the public. According to the preface to the said book written by Prof Kabir, Maulana Azad used to describe his experiences in Urdu, on the basis of which a draft in English would be prepared by Prof. Kabir. The court held that active and close intellectual collaboration and cooperation between Maulana Azad implied that Prof. Kabir is a joint author of the book with Maulana Azad. Hence, the defendants were allowed to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> of the covers of the complete book ‚ÄòIndia Wins Freedom‚Äô and make its contents known to the public.|$|E

5000|$|Dark Schneider (noted to {{be named}} after Udo Dirkschneider) is the main protagonist of the series, and is the most {{powerful}} wizard in the series. 15 years prior to the story's beginning, he had an army of thousands of wizards and warriors, led by his adjutants [...] "The Riders of Havoc" [...] (consisting of Arshes Nei, Abigail, Gara, and Kall-Su.) He was defeated by Lars Ul Meta-Licana, the prince of the kingdom Meta-Licana. He escaped death however by using his dark arts to reincarnate himself into the form of a young child. Geo Soto Noto, the head priest of Meta-Licana then sealed Dark Schneider's spirit so it would not resurface in the young boy. After all-out war erupted to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> of Anthrax, the high-priest ordered that Dark Schneider be unleashed into the world once again to conquer it. Dark Schneider's main goal is to take over the world and [...] "have all the women in the world".

40|$|International audienceSubsurface thermal {{measurements}} {{provide a}} valuable tool to map hydrothermal-fluid release zones in active volcanic areas. On the Yasur‚ÄìYenkahe volcanic complex (Tanna Island, Vanuatu archipelago), fumaroles and hot springs abound, signs of upraising heat fluxes associated to a well-developed hydrothermal activity. Combination of high resolution mapping of ground thermal anomalies with geomorphological analysis allows the characterization of the structural relationships between the active Yasur volcano and the Yenkahe resurgent block. A complex system of heat release and hydrothermal fluid circulation below the Yasur‚ÄìYenkahe complex is evidenced. Circulation, though propagating vertically as a whole, is funneled by stratification. Thus, the main thermal fluid released is almost exclusively concentrated along structural limits that <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> induced by the stratified nature of the ground. Three types of medium/high temperature anomalies have been evidenced: (1) broad hydrothermalized areas linked with planar stratification that favor lateral spreading, (2) linear segments that represent active faults, and (3) arcuate segments related to paleo-crater rims. The limit between the Yasur volcano and the Yenkahe resurgent block is characterized by an active fault system accommodating both the rapid uplift of the Yenkahe block and the overloading induced by the volcano weight. In such a setting, faults converge below the cone of Yasur, which acts as a focus for the faults. Evidence of such structures, sometimes hidden in the landscape but detected by thermal measurements, is critical for risk assessment of flank landslides...|$|E
