50|$|The {{officials}} for the United States Postal Service found level ground acreage {{just outside of}} New Brunswick, New Jersey, that would work for a new 24 hour flight field. John R. Hadley Sr. owned the 144 acre farm in Piscataway Township, New Jersey. He leased seventy-seven acres of his farm to the US Postal Service on November 1, 1924. There were certain improvements made by the US government to make it satisfactory. The land was first cleared to make airplane runway strips. Then radio antenna towers were built and field <b>boundary</b> <b>lights</b> installed. There were powerful floodlights and revolving beacons added so it could conduct night flying. It became known as Hadley Field, after {{the name of the}} farmer that owned the property.|$|E
50|$|In mid 1941, the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CM) {{was still}} {{considering}} the airport as an “auxiliary field” according to Earl Bender, airport manager. The plan included a 3500-foot runway and navigation and meteorology stations, but {{would require the}} acquisition of additional 35 acres of land surrounding the airport {{to make it a}} class 3 airport. In July, the County Supervisors agreed to the plan, {{and with the help of}} the City, acquired an additional 5 acres, with $7000 from City and County funds. Those developments cleared the way for the CM to propose the expenditure of roughly $30,000 for runway development field drainage, 51 foot beacon tower, field shed, 51 <b>boundary</b> <b>lights</b> and a 64 by 80 foot hangar to house aircraft, as well as a classroom, office, and workshop space. Work was started in October, 1941, but no details are available on the completion of any of the items.|$|E

There is a bench behind the altar for the priest while the congregation sits on pews which fan out forming a semi-circle around the altar.

50|$|Some general {{physical}} and chemical properties of light and heavy metals are summarised in the table. The comparison should be treated with caution since the terms light metal and heavy metal are not always consistently defined.

40|$|Turn on {{the lights}} Toad Hall at OMG University is {{illuminated}} by a 4 × 4 array of powerful lights. There is a corresponding bank of 4 × 4 switches that are suppose to turn each light off and on. All the lights are currently off and a porter has been sent to turn them on. This should be simple, but the electrics at Toad Hall were recently re-wired by the Acme Electric Company. They are cheap, but they hire ex-comedians. Now when a switch is flipped, all neighboring switches are inadvertently switched too. So, for example, if the current situation is as in the first array and we flip switch (2, 2) then the situation becomes as in the second array. You can interpret 0 as off and 1 as on. To clarify possible confusions, if the switch corresponds to a <b>boundary</b> <b>light,</b> {{then there will be}} fewer than four neighbors.

40|$|Processes at {{boundaries}} of the unsaturated soil water zone were investigated: At the upper boundary evaporation at the soil-atmosphere interface, and at the lower boundary the dynamic capillary fringe. For studying the upper boundary, an evaporation experiment at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale was considered and modelled numerically. A model with a diffusive boundary layer and a 1 D Richards' description including vapour transport fitted well to experimental data. It showed a boundary layer dominated regime in the wet range and a regime where dynamics is controlled by soil hydraulic properties in the dry range. The model could successfully {{be used to determine}} soil hydraulic properties from the corresponding evaporation experiment by inverse modelling using a Monte-Carlo Levenberg-Marquardt approach. For the lower <b>boundary,</b> <b>light</b> transmission and NIR imaging spectroscopy methods were developed and employed to measure the micro- and macroscopic water distribution in response to transient boundary conditions in a semi- 2 D sand medium in a Hele-Shaw cell with high temporal and spacial resolution.

50|$|After being {{considered}} for upgrading in December 1956, the Omak City Council thought that the <b>boundary</b> <b>lighting</b> of what would become known as Omak Airport required improvements, and estimated that the cost would be around $16,000.By March 1957, the improvements were seen as a high priority, {{but all of the}} bids from the seven companies interested in carrying out the work exceeded the estimate. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) was notified, with the city council suggesting that the contract should be awarded to Wenatchee's Regan Electric, who bid $17,672. In addition to the lighting, 14000 ft of electric cables were to be installed, and the work was to be completed within 120 days of signing the contract. A tour sponsored by the Wenatchee Chamber of Commerce was provided to enable aviators to see the improvements being made. The work, which included an aerodrome beacon, was not completed until 1958, and a dedication program was planned for May 1958, jointly organised by two flying clubs and the city council. All of these improvements ultimately cost $18,000.The city council approved an ordinance which made an extra $1,000 available towards their share of the cost, which amounted to 48.28 percent of the total; the remaining 52 percent was paid for by the CAA.|$|R
