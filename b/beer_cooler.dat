50|$|Ugliest Gheenoe: The cult like owners take a vote {{during the}} Big Gheenoe Rally {{and the two}} all time ugliest Gheenoes are nicknamed the brown turd & the black <b>beer</b> <b>cooler.</b> Both vessels are {{currently}} equipped with 40 hp+ Mercs so nobody can see how ugly the boats really are.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} a typical three-bedroom family home. The male quints share a room with bunk beds, the female quints share another room. The kitchen {{contains}} a double wide <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> as a refrigerator, and the basement contains a walk-in freezer, both to store the large amounts of food such a large family requires. The situation may be seen to parallel and parody the old sitcom The Brady Bunch, by highlighting the impracticality of the large family.|$|E
50|$|The final episode covers water: Adam and Karl {{find out}} {{the best way to}} escape from a rip current, and to keep <b>beer</b> <b>cool</b> at a party. The {{audience}} sampled reclaimed water, recycled from Adam's urine and bathwater.|$|R
5|$|A beer {{tower is}} a beer {{dispensing}} device, usually found in bars and pubs, {{that consists of}} a cylinder attached to a <b>beer</b> <b>cooling</b> device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{volunteer}} soldiers from Jefferson Barracks built a saloon {{in the cave}} entrance. In approximately 1910, the cave was leased to Anheuser-Busch to store beer, with the company harvesting ice from the river in the winter to keep the <b>beer</b> <b>cool</b> during the summer.|$|R
50|$|The {{launch vehicle}} {{consisted}} of a weather balloon filled with helium and a styrofoam <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> that hung underneath the balloon. Inside the cooler was a Canon A470 compact camera, hacked using the Canon Hacker’s Development Kit open-source firmware to shoot pictures in five-second intervals. To keep {{the temperature of the}} batteries high enough for the camera to work it was heated by instant hand warmers. In order {{to keep track of the}} vehicle's location a prepaid GPS-equipped cellphone was included.|$|E
50|$|Gardner {{is a small}} mid-west town {{about 60}} mi {{southwest}} of Chicago on Historic U.S. 66. Gardner hosts an annual celebration on the first weekend in May {{in conjunction with the}} Route 66 Red Carpet Corridor. Gardner is known on U.S. 66 for its historic 2-cell jail and the Riviera Restaurant, 1 mi east of town, a prohibition hangout of Al Capone with a <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> located in a basement vault. On June 8, 2010, the Rivera Restaurant was destroyed by a fire that broke out in the basement.|$|E
5000|$|More {{expensive}} {{but more}} universally usable solutions {{are available in}} the form of combi steamers, which combine convection and steam cooking methods into a single device. Instead of water baths, they feature tightly-controlled steam generation systems (not requiring the use of a sealed bag). It is possible to duplicate some effects of sous-vide techniques [...] {{through the use of a}} <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> filled with warm water, checked with an accurate thermometer, and ziploc bags with the air removed to package the food for cooking. However, the heat loss involved in this technique makes it unfeasible for long-term (4+ hours) cooking.|$|E
50|$|With its ale-benches, light {{music and}} huge crowd of visitors, today's Salvator-Ausschank resembles the pole {{marquees}} at the Munich Oktoberfest. On the Nockherberg, beer is not served in usual beer glasses, but in Keferloher, tankards made of robust earthenware. The sturdy tankards keep the <b>beer</b> <b>cool</b> longer and also make ‘undemonstrative’ refilling possible.|$|R
50|$|In the US and Australia, kegs or beer coils {{are usually}} {{kept in a}} bucket of ice and/or water to keep the <b>beer</b> <b>cool.</b> European consumers, when not using a party pump, mainly use inline beer {{chillers}} to pour a beer in an ideal temperature for serving. Those chillers usually also have their own air compressor for keg pressurization.|$|R
50|$|Until 1961, Princeton {{was home}} to a brewery, the Princeton Brewing Company. Until the 1940s, the brewery kept its <b>beer</b> <b>cool</b> in the Vermilion Cave. The cave, which held up to 20 railway cars at a time, was largely {{demolished}} {{to make way for}} the Hope-Princeton Highway, part of the Crowsnest Highway (British Columbia Highway 3).|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Emil Nava and released on 12 September 2014. It was filmed in Los Angeles and London in August 2014. The video begins with both Harris and Newman in separate places in their appropriate houses where they are both on the bed. Newman is watching some models who are seen on a film projector. Meanwhile, the models {{decided to go to}} a nightclub where one girl gets drunk while other models split where they fall into a sink, <b>beer</b> <b>cooler,</b> puddle and finally a tub. The video ends with the models ending up in a river where they are freezing and it shows the sky with the sun in the background.|$|E
5000|$|A TV ad {{showed the}} late Ranger as a ghost {{resuming}} his post and duties, discovering he's dead as his hand {{passes through a}} bottle of Kokanee, remembering [...] "you killed me off!" [...] indignantly, and sourly wished the viewers [...] "good luck" [...] in finding his replacement. Voters chose from a varied choice of candidates: [...] "Ma Ranger", {{the mother of the}} Kokanee Ranger; [...] "Micheal Baystreet" [...] a Gordon Gekko-like TSX day trader; [...] "Cory", a Ski instructor who has skied the Rockies since the '80s and needs some responsibility; [...] "Beer Fridge 2.0", a <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> with a lock; [...] "Glacier and Fresh", a Starsky and Hutchesque buddy duo eager to make their mark by stopping Sasq's crime wave; and [...] "Glacier Goat" [...] a foul mouthed cantankerous goat.|$|E
50|$|The next day, {{the group}} {{goes to the}} beach. Oz meets his high school girlfriend, Heather (Mena Suvari), who is dating a {{cardiologist}} named Ron (Jay Harrington), and Kevin reconnects with Vicky (Tara Reid). The guys have an altercation with Kara's boyfriend, A.J., (Chuck Hittinger) and his friends, which ends with Stifler defecating in their <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> and destroying their jet skis. That night, most of the group go to the falls and find a high school party celebrating Kara's birthday. Finch and Selena reconnect, and they fall in love. Kara gets drunk; Jim drives her home, and she tries to seduce him. They are discovered by John, who simply mistakes Kara for Michelle. Oz, Finch, and Stifler help Jim return Kara to her parents' home, but A.J. spots them. Kevin wakes up hungover next to Vicky and assumes they had sex.|$|E
50|$|The use of cans by craft brewers in the US {{has doubled}} since 2012, with over 500 {{companies}} using cans to package their beverages. Previously {{associated with the}} major brewing corporations, cans are now favored by craft brewers for numerous reasons: canned <b>beer</b> <b>cools</b> more quickly, beer-degrading light does not affect canned beer, canned beer is more portable since less room is required for storage or transportation, and cans have a greater surface area for wraparound designs and decorations.|$|R
50|$|The device {{comes in}} a variety of sizes, most often double to triple the size of {{standard}} beer pitchers that hold around 48-60 fl oz of beer. It is usually a four-foot-tall plastic cylinder attached to a <b>beer</b> <b>cooling</b> device at the bottom. Some beer towers consist of concentric cylinders; the central one is filled with ice which helps keep cool the external one that actually holds the beer. When filled, it holds a total of 133 fl oz of beer.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the 2006 World Cup, Media Markt {{launched}} a campaign, {{claiming to be}} the [...] "best fan supplier" [...] ("Bester Fanausrüster"), with commercials showing international football fans shopping at Media Markt, showing exaggerated stereotypes of the participating countries, and making fun of the Austria team, which did not qualify. This included a French seductress, Dutch fans smoking marijuana in caravans, or a Saudi haggling - to pay more. German fans were portrayed with big bellies, asking for refrigerators to keep their <b>beer</b> <b>cool,</b> rather than {{looking for a new}} TV set.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{wine and}} liquor section, taking up 15000 sq ft of space, has over 10,000 {{varieties}} of liqueurs, spirits, and wine. The store houses a 95 ft <b>beer</b> <b>cooler,</b> which has 35 doors, and a walk-in cigar humidor, which has 900 varieties of cigars. The full service delicatessen takes up 8000 sq ft of space. Items at the delicatessen include caviar, over 1,000 varieties of American and foreign cheeses, crackers, on-site roasted whole bean coffees, condiments, smoked fish, jams, jellies, oils, pastas, pasta sauces, and vinegars. The store offers sandwiches made on-site. The store {{also includes a}} bakery, with bread imported from France. The original Houston store has 21,000 specialty food stock-keeping units (SKU). They account for 11% of the store's sales. Nicole Potenza-Denis of the Specialty Food Magazine said that the Downtown location, which the Rydman family calls the [...] "mothership" [...] store, is [...] "reportedly the largest single wine and liquor store in the world." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{hardcore}} {{match between}} the two J.O.B. Squad members began with Al Snow throwing Bob Holly {{out of the ring}} and hitting him with a chair before throwing him into the crowd. By the first tier of fans Holly managed to reverse things, finding a chair to strike Snow with before blinding him with a fire extinguisher and breaking a glass jar over Snow's head. Snow returned with a blast from the fire extinguisher going through to the backstage area where he was thrown into technical boxes. Holly then found floor tiles to break over Snow's head as well as a <b>beer</b> <b>cooler.</b> Snow managed to escape into the car park, using mop handles to break over Holly's back. The two found their way past the car park onto the banks of the Mississippi River. Snow kicked Holly to the floor and choked him before throwing him into the river, Snow being dragged into the river soon after. Snow escaped the river but Holly chased him, tripping him over to wrap Snow in a chain fence, making it virtually impossible to kick out of the pin fall.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is {{the design of}} a beer tap, in particular portable <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> and dispenser with a built in air compressor which has to comply with demanding constructional, ergonomic and aesthetic requirements. The ultimate goal of the designing process is to facilitate the portability of the dispenser and enhance its looks by creating a new visual style relating to the Czech tradition...|$|E

50|$|Tipton Harriers {{were created}} in September 1910, when {{the members of the}} Tipton branch of Birchfield Harriers {{resolved}} to end their connection and become independent. Soon, over 40 members were meeting and training regularly from a former painters' workshop and store in a loft behind a shop and houses in Waterloo Street. These primitive facilities, sparsely furnished, using two 18 feet square, 8 inches deep <b>beer</b> <b>cooling</b> vats as baths with water heated in an old copper washing boiler, remained the club H.Q. until 1936. The house where the formation took place was demolished in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|Cellar {{currently}} {{owned by}} Peter Armitage and Barb Neis, Portland, Goose Bay, Bonavista Bay. Dimensions are 2 m x 2. 8 m x 1. 65 m high. Access is through hatch in upper level shed. Concrete walls, with concrete floor covered by sawdust and planking. Sawdust on floor of roof for insulation purposes. Roof vent {{on the north}} side. Believed to have been built by Gilbert Ash in the 1920 s {{and has been in}} continuous use. It was rebuilt by John Ash, son of Gilbert Ash, in the late 1990 s. Peter Armitage and Barb Neis bought the property from the Ash family in 2009 and replaced the roof of the cellar in 2010. It is currently used to store cabbage, carrots, potatoes, and paint, and has also been used a <b>beer</b> <b>cooler</b> in the past...|$|E

5000|$|The Prince of Wales pub on Rice Lane, {{which has}} the {{nickname}} of [...] "The Sod House", was given the nickname by King Edward VII, who after making a royal visit to the previously mentioned Zoo, entered the establishment for refreshments, and proclaimed the pub to be a [...] "Sod House" [...] for reasons unknown. An alternative, or perhaps associated, {{explanation is that the}} landlord used clods of earth ("sods") draped over the beer barrels to keep the <b>beer</b> <b>cool.</b> He would water the sods and heat would be drawn from the barrels as the water evaporated.|$|R
25|$|In 1857 {{at the age}} of 18 Busch emigrated {{with three}} of his older {{brothers}} to St. Louis, Missouri which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because he had so many siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father's estate and had to make his own way. Since St. Louis was home to so many German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep <b>beer</b> <b>cool.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Seasonal {{limitations}} on when beer could be brewed {{were already in}} the Bavarian brewing regulations by 1539; in 1553, Albert V decreed a period from 29 September, the feast of St. Michael, to 23 April, the feast of Saint George, for its production. The cool seasons were chosen {{to minimize the risk}} of fire when boiling mashed grain into wort. Numerous conflagrations had occurred, resulting in the prohibition of brewing during the summer months. In response, large breweries dug cellars in the banks of the River Isar to keep their <b>beer</b> <b>cool</b> during storage. [...] "Beer cellars" [...] for consuming beer on premises naturally followed.|$|R
50|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.A beer tower is a beer dispensing device, usually found in bars and pubs, that consists of a cylinder attached to a <b>beer</b> <b>cooling</b> device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} eleven o’clock {{when we arrived}} at Upper Sooro. An officer at once came to the door of his tent, and with that {{hospitality}} which is universal, asked us to come in and sit while our tent was being pitched. We accepted, and he opened for us a bottle of <b>beer,</b> <b>cool,</b> and in excellent condition. Imagine our feelings. Brandy-and-water would have been true hospitality, but beer, where beer is so scarce and so precious as it is here, was a deed which deserves to be recorded in letters of gold. I forbear to name our benefactor. The Samaritan’s name has not descended to us; the widow who bestowed the mite is nameless. Let it be so in the present case. But I shall never cease to think of that bottle of beer with gratitude.|$|R

5|$|The {{temperature}} of a beer has {{an influence on}} a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a <b>beer</b> but <b>cooler</b> temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength pale ale to be served cool, while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature.|$|R
500|$|Lager is <b>cool</b> {{fermented}} <b>beer.</b> Pale lagers are {{the most}} commonly consumed beers in the world. The name [...] "lager" [...] comes from the German [...] "lagern" [...] for [...] "to store", as brewers around Bavaria stored <b>beer</b> in <b>cool</b> cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1856, James Harrison, was {{commissioned}} by a brewery to build a machine that could <b>cool</b> <b>beer.</b> His system was almost immediately {{taken up by the}} brewing industry and was also widely used by meatpacking factories.|$|R
