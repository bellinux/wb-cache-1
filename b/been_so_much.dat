25|$|Here {{the worship}} of the goddess was centred, not for Cyprus alone, but for the whole Aegean world. The Cinyradae, or {{descendants}} of Cinyras, were the chief priests, Greek by name but of Phoenician origin. Their power and authority were very great; {{but it may be}} inferred from certain inscriptions that they were controlled by a senate and an assembly of the people. There was also an oracle here. Few cities have ever <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sung and glorified by the poets. The remains of the vast sanctuary of Aphrodite are still discernible, its circumference marked by huge foundation walls. After its destruction by an earthquake it was rebuilt by Vespasian, on whose coins it is represented, as well as on earlier and later ones, and especially in the style on those of Septimius Severus. From these representations, and from the existing remains, Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, an architect of Copenhagen, has attempted to restore the building.|$|E

500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, there has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> talk about our side {{and a lot of}} pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

[...] "For the more esoteric viewer, it's a milestone episode", said The Ages Farah Farouque. Cameron Adams for the Herald Sun called the episode hilarious, while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert {{felt that it was}} flaccid and cliched. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that the episode [...] "did have its moments" [...] and that the storylines [...] "had their potential, and their share of laughs, but I can't help but feel they both could have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more." [...] He opined that the Kenneth and Tracy story was [...] "more up 30 Rocks style" [...] but that it was a shame that the story could not [...] "quite knock the concept out of the park." [...] Overall, Canning rated [...] "The One with the Cast of Night Court" [...] a 7.9 out of 10. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly reported that the episode fell flat.|$|E

Whedon noted he had decided {{at the end of}} season three to direct an episode in season four after doing some second unit work on [...] "Spacetime" [...] under Kevin Tancharoen. He {{credited}} his brother and series creator Joss Whedon along with Tancharoen, and his [...] "years working with S.H.I.E.L.D.s directors from a showrunning perspective and his close relationship with the cast and crew" [...] for why now was the right time for him to direct an episode. The cast expressed enthusiasm with Whedon directing [...] "Self Control", given he also wrote the episode, with Bennet feeling, [...] "The vision is so clear. There's a lot more room to play, like 'what about this?' and the enthusiasm because he wrote these words, he knows what's coming next. It's <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun."

I get that that's her bit, but... that note is starting to drive me crazy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning also delivered a mixed review of the episode, writing that he laughed [...] "quite a bit" [...] but said it ultimately [...] "felt like it could have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more." [...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, but it could have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire {{did not have to be}} subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure."

500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the variety of content on the album. NME said, [...] "There's a {{creeping}} notion that every musical idea that's ever <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as thought up is on this album." [...] In addition, Random Access Memories is ranked #497 on NMEs list, [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork echoed this sentiment, calling the record [...] "a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast {{and even a few}} pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that [...] "though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more 'human,' the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect." [...] Pitchfork deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. DJ Magazine {{commented on the}} shift in Daft Punk's musical style: [...] "While Daft Punk clearly want to move on and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, it's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, that's what they're best at making." [...] Resident Advisor stated that [...] "it's an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: '70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the album's key guest artists, popularized with Chic." [...] In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record [...] "taps into the wonder and excitement" [...] of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, [...] "Random Access Memories is also Daft Punk's most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E
