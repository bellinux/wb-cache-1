We provide a new proof for the continuity of B in critical weak-Morrey spaces without using auxiliary norms of Besov type neither Kato time-weighted norms. As a byproduct, we reobtain the uniqueness of mild solutions in the class of continuous functions from [0, T) to critical Morrey spaces. Our proof consists in estimates in <b>block</b> <b>spaces</b> (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey Lorentz spaces.

Frame-based features were computed based on an encoding of the global spectral shape using a Discrete Cosine Transform. In most current “standard” methods, trajectory (dynamic) features are determined from frame-based parameters using a fixed time sampling, i. e., fixed block length and fixed <b>block</b> <b>spacing.</b> In this research, new methods are proposed and investigated in which block length and/or <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> are variable.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the sprint start time to the first 10 and to the second 10 meters as a result of alteration of starting block angles and lateral block spacings. One male world class, two female college level, one male and one female high school level sprinters served as subjects. During the test period each subject completed twelve 20 -meter sprints. Sprint starts were made from combinations of 52. 5, 65, and 75 degrees front starting block angle and 60 and 80 degrees rear starting block angle from a 4 inches and a 10 inches lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing.</b> A subjects by treatments analysis of variance indicated a significant difference in time over the first 10 meters {{as a result of the}} alteration of block angle and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> but no significant difference was obtained for the second 10 -meter. Combination of 65 degrees front angle with 60 degrees rear block angle, and 75 degrees front angle with 60 degrees rear block angle were significantly different based on Duncan's new multiple range test. Significant difference in time by the subjects was found for all combinations of block angles for both the first 10 meters distance and for the second 10 meters distance. Based on Duncan's new multiple range test, male subjects performed significantly different than female subjects. A multiple linear regression procedure and a rank order correlation established that a significant difference existed in the independent variables that would predict the start time for the identified block combinations. FF 2 P, the second peak of resultant force of front foot, FVF 2 P, the second peak of vertical resultant force of front foot, and FRH, horizontal resultant force, were the independent variables most commonly identified although the contribution order was not the same. Little concordance existed in the rank of independent variables among the three significantly different combinations. Resultant force and resultant force angle, combinations of block angles and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing,</b> and sprint start time formed a mutual dependent relationship in this study. If an optimal model of statistical relationship between resultant force and resultant force angle, and combinations of block angles and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> could be set up, the range of block angle and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> variations could be minimized...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSprinters {{adjust the}} {{arrangement}} of their starting blocks prior to a race, {{but there is no}} standard approach to doing this. At present, it is unclear as to how the block arrangement affects the forces applied to the blocks and consequent performance during sprint start. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of the starting block arrangement on the forces applied to them. For 18 different arrangements of <b>block</b> <b>spacing,</b> forces applied by a sprinter to the front and rear starting blocks, as well as to the ground on the first step, were measured using three force plates. The results indicate that when in the starting posture, the magnitude of the impulse applied to both blocks changes little between the 18 arrangements. Likewise, no substantial change occurs in the forces applied to the ground upon the first step. However, as the distance between the front and rear blocks was changed, the ratio of the impulses applied to the front and rear blocks did change: as the <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> was increased, the impulse applied to the front block while in the starting posture decreased, while that applied to the rear block increased. In addition, changing the distance from the starting line to the front block influenced the relation between the <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> distance and the forces applied to the two starting blocks...|$|R

This paper proposes a novel and simple replacement scheme, called RACE, which differentiates the locality of I/O streams by actively detecting access patterns inherently exhibited in two correlated spaces: the discrete <b>block</b> <b>space</b> of program contexts from which I/O requests are issued and the continuous <b>block</b> <b>space</b> within files to which I/O requests are addressed. This scheme combines global I/O regularities of an application and local I/O regularities of individual files accessed in that application to accurately estimate the locality strength, which is crucial in deciding which blocks to be replaced upon a cache miss. Through comprehensive simulations on real-application traces, RACE is shown to significantly outperform LRU and all other state-of-the-art cache management schemes studied in this paper, in terms of absolute hit ratios.

40|$|AbstractPlacement {{algorithms}} for VLSI layout tend {{to stick}} {{the building blocks}} together. This results in the need to increase the <b>space</b> between adjacent <b>blocks</b> to allow the routing of interconnecting wires. The above problem is called the <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> problem. This paper presents a model for spreading the blocks uniformly over the chip area, to accommodate the routing requirements, such that the desired adjacency relations between the blocks are retained. The <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> problem is solved via a graph model, whose vertices represent the building blocks, and its arcs represent the <b>space</b> between adjacent <b>blocks.</b> Then, the desired uniform spacing can be presented as a space balancing problem. In this paper the existence and uniqueness of {{a solution to the}} one dimensional space balancing problem are proved, and an iterative algorithm which converges rapidly to the solution is presented. It is shown that in general, the two dimensional problem may have no solution...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Congress granted the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) authority to enter into transactions other than contracts, leases, and cooperative agreements; this gave the agency greater flexibility in achieving its mission. NASA uses its other transaction authority through three kinds of instruments known as <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements.</b> Specifically, NASA uses reimbursable agreements when costs associated with an undertaking are reimbursed by the agreement partner (in full or in part); the agency uses non-reimbursable agreements when each party bears the cost of participation in mutually beneficial activities. In 2006, NASA began to use a third kind of agreement [...] referred to as funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements</b> [...] that have involved NASA providing significant funds to private industry partners to stimulate the development of large-scale commercial space transportation capabilities. Under a funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreement,</b> appropriated funds are transferred to a domestic partner, such as a private company or a university, to accomplish an agency mission. These agreements differ from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contracts in {{that they do not}} include requirements that generally apply to government contracts entered into under the authority of the FAR. For example, under these agreements, partners are not required to comply with government contract quality assurance requirements. NASA policy provides that this authority may only be used when agency objectives cannot be achieved {{through the use of a}} procurement contract, grant, or cooperative agreement. As of October 31, 2011, NASA has used funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements</b> to provide industry partners with $ 833. 1 million for completion of developmental milestones, with the aim of potentially procuring crew (i. e., transporting astronauts) and cargo transportation services to the space station. Partners can collectively earn another $ 248. 3 million under these agreements through the first half of 2012. It is important that NASA have strong internal controls in place to ensure proper use and management of funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements</b> because they (1) permit considerable latitude by agencies and companies in negotiating agreement terms and (2) may not include the same oversight requirements found in traditional FAR-governed contracts. NASA has established policies and guidance for implementing agreements under its other transaction authority, specifically NASA Policy Directive 1050. 1 I, Authority to Enter into <b>Space</b> Act <b>Agreements</b> and NASA Advisory Implementing Instruction 1050 - 1 A, <b>Space</b> Act <b>Agreements</b> Guide. In this context, Congress asked us to evaluate the extent to which NASA's controls ensure the agency appropriately manages funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements</b> and enters into funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements</b> only when its objectives cannot be achieved through any other agreement instrument, such as a federal procurement contract. This letter is the third based on Congressional request to review NASA's use of <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements.</b> The previous two letters dealt with NASA's use of reimbursable <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements.</b> We have also testified recently on NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, which has been executed under funded <b>Space</b> Act <b>agreements.</b> COTS is focused on supporting and stimulating the development of a commercial market for space transportation, from which NASA could potentially acquire cargo transportation services (e. g., delivery of supplies to maintain the space station and equipment to conduct research). ...|$|R
