This article considers how the field of Index Numbers should be approached in the teaching of a general economic degree.

It is also emphasised that the differences between Index Numbers theory and the practice of compiling <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> such as inflation can help students {{gain a better understanding of}} applied <b>economic</b> <b>statistics.</b> Methods for assessing learning in the area are also considered and available material to support teaching is also summarised...|$|R

But in recent decades, as services output has continued to expand a system of <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> that had been designed during the manufacturing era began to seem increasingly outdated. Over the past decade, the statistical agencies have done yeoman work to expand the availability and quality of service sector statistics, but the task is far from completed. Moreover, the traditional accounting framework for <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> has focused almost exclusively on market transactions. Looking ahead, more comprehensive measurement of productive activities, however they may be organized, must be a priority. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>{{statistics}}</b> is a {{topic in}} applied statistics that concerns the collection, processing, compilation, dissemination, and analysis of economic data. It is also common to call the data themselves 'economic statistics', but for this usage see economic data. The data of concern to <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> may include those of an economy of region, country, or group of countries. <b>Economic</b> <b>statistics</b> may also refer to a subtopic of official statistics for data produced by official organizations (e.g. national statistical services, intergovernmental organizations such as United Nations, European Union or OECD, central banks, ministries, etc.). Analyses within <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> both make use of and provide the empirical data needed in economic research, whether descriptive or econometric. They are a key input for decision making as to economic policy.The subject includes statistical analysis of topics and problems in microeconomics, macroeconomics, business, finance, forecasting, data quality, and policy evaluation. It also includes such considerations as what data to collect in order to quantify some particular aspect of an economy and of how best to collect in any given instance.|$|R
40|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> {{produced}} by the Scottish Government have evolved markedly over the last decade. As part of this, in 2008, the Scottish National Accounts Project (SNAP) was launched with the aim to develop {{a full set of}} National Accounts for Scotland. This has been a significant undertaking, and the work is only partly complete. However for the first time, there now exists a fully integrated and coherent Scottish National Accounts system which continues to expand its coverage of economic data in Scotland. This article sets out what has been put in place to date, and highlights key areas for further improvement. It shows how this work fits with an historic programme to improve Scottish <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> by the Scottish Government. New priorities are outlined and users – including Commentary readers - are invited to engage with the Scottish <b>Economic</b> <b>Statistics</b> Consultation network to feed in their views as to how Scotland’s vital <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> can be developed further to better describe, measure and analyse the Scottish economy for the public benefit...|$|R

Oftentimes, statistics are used for all three purposes. This article considers the relationships between statistics and agricultural policy {{in the case of the}} United States. We address first the broad historical picture of U. S. official <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> concerning agriculture, and then turn to selected examples that relate policies to <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> in more detail. The examples show diversity in the interplay between statistics and policy. Over time, policymakers have asked for more detailed information about the financial situation of individual farm businesses and households, sources of risk in farm returns, and production practices that affect the environment.

40|$|Effective {{business}} cycle analysis, {{and indeed the}} monitoring of a countries economic performance from a policy perspective, requires access to timely high quality short-term <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> (STES). Consequently in recent {{years there has been}} a lot of pressure on national statistics organisations (NSOs) to better serve their users by improving the timeliness of release for their short-term economic indicators. In response to this demand, NSOs have focused on improving the efficiency and methodology of their statistical production processes. So this begs the question: where would one look to find comprehensive documentation on good practices used by NSOs to improve the timeliness of their short-term <b>economic</b> <b>statistics?</b> The answer is the STES Timeliness Framework, a structured collection of documentation on a range of good practices currently used by NSOs for improving timeliness, reducing costs or improving accuracy for short-term <b>economic</b> <b>statistics.</b> This resource is freely available in the form of an intuitive, user friendly website developed by the OECD Short-Term <b>Economic</b> <b>Statistics</b> Expert Group at www. oecd. org/std/research/timeliness.

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{introduction}} {{about the}} related fields of short-term <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> in China and shares our experiences {{of dealing with}} the emerged financial crisis. This paper also is expected to help OECD experts to clearly understand the present situation and mechanisms of the government’s <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> system. Furthermore, it is expected to contribute to enhance the communication and cooperation between the national statistic offices of OECD member countries and China. Even with the economic boom of the past three decades, China still is a developing country. Comparing with OECD countries, there are many weaknesses, and delays in current government <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> in China. Therefore, beneficial comments and suggestions to improve statistics in China are appreciated. 1. Short-Term <b>Economic</b> <b>Statistics</b> in China and the current crisis Usually, short-term statistics refers to the investigation frequency that is shorter than a year in national bureau of statistics (NBS) of China, and it includes semiyearly, quarterly, bimonthly, monthly, ten-days, weekly and daily statistical report systems.
