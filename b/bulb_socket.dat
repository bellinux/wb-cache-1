Second, we discuss {{the creation of a}} homopolar motor to convert the low-voltage electrical power available from a thermoelectric wafer, which could be powered by waste heat. We are able to achieve brushes and bearings with electrical resistance as low as 70 m[Omega] and friction torque under 300,/N. m to demonstrate a proof-of-concept test setup. The demonstrated electromotive force constant is 82 V/rad/s using a 1 inch diameter, 5500 gauss magnet. Finally, we discuss the application of waste heat harvesting to household water heating, and discuss several designs for a water heater with integrated attachment points for waste heat producing devices. by Brad A.

5000|$|A 3-way lamp, {{also known}} as a tri-light, is a lamp that uses a 3-way light bulb to produce three levels of light in a low-medium-high configuration. A 3-way lamp {{requires}} a 3-way <b>bulb</b> and <b>socket,</b> and a 3-way switch. Unlike an incandescent lamp controlled by a dimmer, each of the filaments operates at full voltage, so the color of the light does not change between the three steps of light available. Certain compact fluorescent lamp bulbs are designed to replace 3-way incandescent bulbs, and have an extra contact and circuitry to bring about similar light level. In recent years, LED three way bulbs have become available as well.|$|R
40|$|An up to 5 Watts {{wide range}} power supply LED driver {{demonstrator}} with a Piezoelectric Transformer (PT) {{has been built}} to show the static and dynamic behavior as an off-line power supply [1],[2],[5],[6],[7]. The target of the power converter controller using a PT, with 2. 3 mm thickness and 17 mm diameter at frequency of 155 - 175 kHz, designed in a resonant circuit of Class-E topology, is to maintain a constant output current of 290 mA/DC with variable output voltage drop at wide input voltage range of 85 - 250 V/AC. Also, the ZVS (Zero-Voltage-Switching) condition is achieved over the full operation range. The used 1200 V Fieldstop IGBT (1 A-Type) shows losses around 200 mW over the full operating range for constant output current. The paper shows the regulation method for off-line power supplies using PT in Class-E topology in constant current mode regulation (CCMR). The regulation algorithm has been programmed in C language operated by a 32 -bit DSP (TMS 320 F 2812). Besides, in the Class-E application, the duty cycle of the switching frequency needs to be controlled {{in order to achieve}} the ZVS during the operation at different load and input condition [1]. This goal is achievable only by Phase Locked Loop (PLL) feedback in a satisfying way [3]. To solve this problem, the idea of PT with an auxiliary tap has been applied, and it is shown in Fig. 3. The application is suited for low size LED line adapters, to be integrated in <b>bulb</b> <b>sockets.</b> The results are applicable for any controller design of resonant PT stepdown topologies. The several suited optimum control concept is investigated in this paper, considering the circuit expense being minimized...|$|R

This thesis provides comprehensive analysis on the lightning scenarios in 18 communication and broadcasting towers situated in similar and different isokeraunic contours in Sri Lanka. The results and observation show that most of the damages reported due to the indirect lightning flashes, power line surges and step voltage in the event of lightning strike to the tower. The property damages such as patches and cracks developed in their walls and floors, the damages to electrical and electronic equipment such as electrical switch gears, <b>bulbs,</b> <b>socket</b> outlets, televisions, and radios also reported. The personal injuries were in the form of temporary paralysis due to step potential or electric shock. In one case, the victims were sleeping on floor in his home which is located around 40 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. In another case the victims were sitting on the chair with legs on the ground in his home which is located around 30 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. The descriptions indicate that they have been subjected to step potential. The above scenarios with related to the lightning strikes to telecommunication tower going to explain with the geographical arrangement of tower surround, Earth resistance values measured, tower grounding arrangement, power line lightning protection system and the commercial power distribution to the area by Earth resistance tester, technical theories and simulation software. The outcome also shows that equipotential bonding of the grounding system, a distributed grounding network including a ring conductor and a suitable system of surge protective devices to radio base stations and neighborhood homes play a much vital role in lightning protection of equipment and safety of neighborhood people compared to the effects of simply achieving a low grounding resistance. However, in the absence of such integrated, distributed and equipotentialized grounding system, a high value of ground resistance will sharply increase the possibility of accidents and damag...|$|R

One field test involving an apartment complex showed that it took two men 30 man hours monthly to replace light bulbs; after Bulb-Miser installation only nine man hours a month were needed. Bulb-Misers are used not only in private homes but also by hospitals, schools, hotels and motels, restaurants, banks and firms providing contract maintenance for large outdoor electric signs.

40|$|Electricity {{from water}} power Cue: For most people, {{particularly}} in rural areas, kerosene lamps and battery powered torches are essential sources of light once {{the sun has}} gone down. But kerosene and batteries have costs, and not only financial ones. Smoke from lamps can cause eye and breathing problems, and batteries can damage the environment if they are disposed of carelessly. And with rising oil prices, just lighting a home is requiring {{more and more of}} household income. In Kenya, the NGO Practical Action, also known as ITDG, has been supporting rural communities to set up small-scale water-powered electricity generators. These work by piping water down a steep gradient and onto a turbine, which spins at high speed, generating electric power which is then supplied to homes. The system is known as Pico hydro. In Kathamba village, on the southern slopes of Mount Kenya, Eric Kadenge met with Silas Muchira Gachoki, Secretary of the village Pico hydro project. IN:	?The project has got about ? OUT:	? with 5 <b>bulbs</b> and 2 <b>sockets.</b> ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Silas Gachoki, hoping that electricity from a small-scale water-powered generator, or Pico hydro, can be supplied to more villagers in Kathamba, Kenya. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Gachoki	The project has got about 172 members, and the Pico has already served 58 households, which is benefiting around 1, 500 people. We start by contributing a small amount of money. After getting the money, we started building a reservoir, that?s a dam. From there we bought pipes, then we have the gradient where we build the powerhouse down here. We get the turbine. Then we had someone who came with all those technologies and after getting power that?s when we started supplying to those few members you have heard. Kadenge	What are the benefits of this project to the local people here? Gachoki	In fact to mention a few, my neighbour is used to buying paraffin. He has children who are in school. Every week he is using five litres. A litre is costing now 85 shillings. You can see it is more than 400 shillings per week. These dry cells for a radio or a torch are now lasting for one week and it is costing 45 shillings. So per month you are using a lot of money. Whereas whoever is using the power, it is just 80 shillings or 50 shillings the whole month. Kadenge	What kind of geographical environment do you need for you to construct this kind of facility? Gachoki	For someone to have power, first you need water flowing, and it should be flowing yearly, not seasonally. This is not a seasonal stream; it runs all the year round. You need a gradient area, so people has to work hard to get some money because a project like this needs some money to construct a powerhouse. Cables are now costly. You need pipes, generators, the turbine. We need security. You can see we have used the metal doors. Kadenge	And the parts that you have mentioned, the turbines, the motor, is there anything that you need to import or everything is available? Gachoki	Now the turbines and whatever are now locally found. Like ours here has never broken down for those years. So mostly you have to grease the machine. So after every three to four months we have to come here and maintain the machine, you grease it, you look whether the turbines are working well. So for sustainability we don?t have a problem. Kadenge	What are your plans in the future? Do you intend to extend it? Gachoki	Our future plan, as you can see downstream here, we have a big river here, just 800 metres from here, from this powerhouse. We want to extend; we have already bought in fact some materials. We have bought pipes, we have bought blocks, because we have to construct a powerhouse there, which {{we are going to get}} about 10 kilowatts there, whereby we will now be able to supply our 172 members with 5 <b>bulbs</b> and 2 <b>sockets.</b> End of trackHow a Kenyan village gets electricity from running wate...|$|R
