Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt {{at the beginning of}} 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E
5|$|Downtown had short skyscraper-building booms {{beginning}} in the 1970s. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is {{the location of the}} Hmong Archives.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most of his}} contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist {{anybody in}} film-making prior to {{entering}} the industry. He is credited with revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is referred for <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> dimension to the South Asian cinema. A majority of his films are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E

5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of {{tremendous}} expansion of population. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by weaving, {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or ramie fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate silk gauzes. In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period weaving and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs. A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and dyeing category, including: two mandalas, two monk's surplices or kesa, one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.|$|E
5|$|The first biographical {{sketch of}} Friedrich Accum's life {{was written by}} the American {{agricultural}} chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which {{he was able to}} complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (August 26, 1873 – September 15, 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that fills in the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.|$|E

25|$|The {{popularity}} of kamishibai declined {{at the end}} of the Allied Occupation and the introduction of television, known originally as denki kamishibai ("electric kamishibai") in 1953.

25|$|In 1250 slave soldiers, {{known as}} the Mamluks, seized control of Egypt and like many of their {{predecessors}} established Cairo as the capital of their new dynasty.

Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia.

25|$|Powertrain {{options for}} the Camry XV40 {{comprised}} both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and automatic transmissions.

For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted. All other XV40 series Camrys utilize front-wheel drive. XV40s produced in the United States from January 2009 saw the 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE powerplant replaced by the 2.5-liter 2AR-FE engine and with it <b>bringing</b> <b>new</b> six-speed manual and automatic transmissions.
