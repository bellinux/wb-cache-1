40|$|International audienceThe CapTA {{model of}} traffic {{assignment}} {{to a large}} transit network is aimed to deal with traffic phenomena, including a range of capacity constraints, {{as well as with}} passenger route choice (Leurent et al, 2014). To this end it has a 3 -layer architecture that involves (i) passenger route choice on a network of transit legs and pedestrian links, (ii) line coordination of service missions, vehicle runs with their link running times and station dwelling times, track occupancy and passenger waiting at stations, (iii) vehicle running, including the alighting and <b>boarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> in relation to run dwelling time at the station, in-vehicle passenger load in relation to seat capacity and total vehicle capacity. Yet the line model is macroscopic both for passenger flows and for vehicles serving a given mission, through a frequency variable per station. The paper brings about a novel, hybrid line model that can be used on a standalone basis at the line level or by inclusion in a three-layered model such as CapTA. In the model, a macroscopic representation of passenger flows is hybridized with a microscopic simulation of vehicles. This enables us to simulate headway (ir-) regularity and derive its consequences on vehicle loads, passenger wait times and on-board comfort, track occupancy and vehicle delay for railway modes. The resulting leg generalized times will be used to better simulate optimal travel strategies for path choice in a network in traffic assignment models such as CapTA. After presenting the model and the simulation algorithm, we provide an application to a metro line under two alternative operational policies...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Determining regularities {{of changes}} of trains {{occupancy}} and the approach commuters on landing {{for determining the}} technical and technological parameters of suburban passenger services. Methodology. To achieve this goal were identified research methods of train occupancy, basic approach periods of passengers to platform affecting the occupancy of carriages in different periods of the day. Findings. On the basis of conducted researches {{can be carried out}} comlex, systematically related calculations of important technical and technological parameters of suburban passenger transportations. To such parameters can be attributed parameters of trains timetable, occupancy of carriages, the number of ticket offices, passenger platforms size, number and location on them turnstiles, providing the comfortable and safe <b>boarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> on commuter trains. It is proposed to use the relative indicators of trains occupancy and generalized theoretical dependencies of approach intensity of passengers on landing in trains. There are graphs where there is unevenness of transportation demand, which is estimated by actual train occupancy that is established by direct natural supervision in train carriages. Results of the study hourly of passenger flow distribution have allowed to establish that irregularity by period of day has a pronounced character of manifestation, especially in the morning and evening during the "peak" periods. Dimensions of transportations in these hours do not meet comfortable conditions of passenger travel in suburban trains. Originality. It was suggested the new approach to determine regularities of changes of the suburban trains occupancy to approach commuters to platform. It is presented the comparisons of actual distribution curves and approximated theoretical curves of approach intensities of passengers and filling of trains, and the formula by which the described patterns are identified. These formulas can be used to construct appropriate mathematical models describing the process to approach of passengers on landing in trains. Practical value. Using of obtained regularities will allow in future predict the number of passengers in specific trains, thus optimizing the schedule of commuter trains the interval between trains, as well as the required number of rolling stock...|$|E
40|$|Patronage to bus public {{transport}} is growing quickly in Brisbane {{due to the}} development of its busway network. The busway corridors are at different stages of completion. However, with the increased public support travel demand, busway stations are becoming more crowded during the peak hours. Heavy <b>boarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> at some busway station platforms reduces comfort levels for passengers and makes the walking and manoeuvring to the bus door difficult. This in turn increases passenger boarding service times and hence dwell times of buses. Increased dwell times decrease the capacity of the loading areas on the platform and increase the bus delay through the station. Variation in delays through stations in turn affects the running time of buses along the corridor, which reduces the reliability of arrival times, with the associated flow-on impacts to later buses and formation of bus bunching. This paper looks into the operational efficiency of a busway station during the weekday afternoon school peak period in terms of passenger service times and station platform capacity. Mater Hill Busway Station on the South East Busway corridor of Brisbane was used as a case study. This station {{is one of the major}} stations on the corridor serving a large number of institutional employees, students and patrons with a nearby hospital, high schools, academic institutions, businesses and high density residential development. Passenger and bus flow data on the outbound peak direction platform was collected by using video recording technique and attributes including arrival time of bus, dwell time, departure time, number of passengers boarding and alighting was collected by viewing the video footage on a desktop computer. The extracted data was analysed. The passenger service times, and efficiency of each loading area considering the amount of time the loading area was empty as well as blocked for the bus entry, were calculated. In turn, the capacity of the bus station platform was calculated based on the methodology of the US Transportation Board’s Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TRB, 2003) calibrated using the site data. Field passenger boarding service times were significantly higher than the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TRB 2003) default value. Excessive passenger service times for loading area 3 arise due to “spent” dwell time as passengers walk from their waiting position to the end of the platform. The lead loading area and second loading area were found to reduce in efficiency respectively over the 100 percent efficiency of loading area 3. This study found that blocking of a loading area, particularly for the lead loading area, has significant impact on the station capacity. However, loading area efficiencies were found to be very similar to TCQSM default values for a busway station. The analysis shows that the station platform was operating at a degree of saturation of 56 percent which accorded with field observations. Higher field passenger boarding service times resulted in a substantial capacity over-estimate using the TCQSM...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the nitrogen oxides instrument {{designed for the}} autonomous operation on <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> aircraft {{in the framework of}} the European Research Infrastructure IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System, [URL]). We demonstrate the performance of the instrument using data from two deployment periods aboard an A 340 - 300 aircraft of Deutsche Lufthansa. The well-established hemiluminescence detection method is used to measure nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen oxides (NO x). NO x is measured using a photolytic converter, and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) is determined from the difference between NO x and NO. This technique allows to measure at high time resolution (4  s) and high precision (2 σ) in the low ppt range (NO of 24  ppt and NO x of 35  ppt) over different ambient temperature and ambient pressure altitude ranges (from surface pressure down to 190  hPa). The IAGOS NO x instrument is characterized for (1) calibration stability and total uncertainty (2) humidity and chemical interferences (e. g. ozone, HONO, PAN) and (3) inter-instrumental precision. We demonstrate that the IAGOS NO x instrument is a robust, fully automated, and long-term stable instrument suitable for unattended operation on airborne platforms, which provides useful measurements for future air quality studies and emission estimates...|$|R
