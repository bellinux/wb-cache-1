40|$|AbstractComposite {{laminates}} {{are used}} in many applications in industries like aerospace and aircraft due to their extremely high strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance properties. The composite laminates are difficult to machine materials, which results into low drilling efficiency and drilling-induced delamination, thus {{it is important to}} develop an innovative advanced drilling process to overcome the difficulties related in the machining of composite materials. This work is focused on comprehensive experimental characterization to understand the effect of cutting parameters on the delamination extent during abrasive water jet drilling of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Processing parameters, such as standoff distance and water pressure plays dominant role in delamination than abrasive flow rate. It also describes the development of different techniques for controlling the delamination in abrasive water jet drilling process, such as <b>backup</b> <b>plate,</b> pre-drilled hole and water immersion (under water). The analysis shows that abrasive water jet drilling with <b>backup</b> <b>plate</b> yields lower delamination, hole size variation and hole surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} enquires {{the role of}} the <b>backup</b> <b>plate</b> mechanical properties in the brittle failure of a ceramic tile. It provides a full-field solution for the elasto-static problem of an infinite Kirchhoff plate containing a semi-infinite rectilinear crack (the tile) resting on a two-parameter elastic foundation (the <b>backup</b> <b>plate)</b> and subjected to general transverse loading condition. The <b>backup</b> <b>plate</b> is modeled as a weakly non-local (Pasternak-type) foundation, which reduces to the familiar local (Winkler) model once the Pasternak modulus is set to zero. The same governing equations are obtained for a curved plate (shell) subjected to in-plane equi-biaxial loading. Fourier transforms and the Wiener-Hopf technique are employed. The solution is obtained for the case when the Pasternak modulus is greater than the Winkler modulus. Superposition and a two step procedure are employed: first, an infinite uncracked plate subjected to general loading is considered, then the bending moment and shearing force distribution acting along the crack line is adopted as the (continuous) loading condition to be fed in the solution for the cracked plate. Results are obtained {{as a function of the}} ratio of the Pasternak over the Winkler foundation stiffness times the tile flexural rigidity. It is established that the elastic foundation significantly affects the mechanical behavior of elastic plate. In particular, the Winkler model substantially underestimates the stress condition. Stress intensity factors are determined and they are employed as a guideline for increasing the composite toughness. The analytical solution presented in this paper may serve as a benchmark for a more refined numerical analysis...|$|E

40|$|This {{abstract}} {{reports the}} processing of shredder hammer tips, and metallurgical aspects related to improve the life prolonging factors that can achieve maximum crushing ratio and increase the preparatory index. An investigation conducted on typical shredder hammer tips revealed the cutting edges getting worn out in service because the sugarcane is typically mixed with silica sand and rocks. This leads to enhanced erosion, and increased abrasion and impact causing catastrophic failures. In extreme cases a composite comprising sintered carbide vacuum fused between a mild steel <b>backup</b> <b>plate</b> and a high chrome alloy powder block, {{is used as a}} replaceable tip. This geometry acts as a twin cutter, where the initial compressive load is divided by the top sintered alloy, which enables the tungsten carbide to take the balance load with much higher efficiency, better cutting ratio and longer edge retention. The geometry also considerably enhances the resistance to cracking. As per the performance reported by M/s Godavari Sugar Mill, Sameerwadi, the tool exhibited a life exceeding 950 000 tons of cane...|$|E
40|$|The mold {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of the continuous casting machine since the mold controls the shape and initial solidification of the steel product, where quality is either created or lost. During casting, the mold is submitted to heat flux from liquid steel on one side whereas the other side is water cooled, leading to the generation of large temperature gradients. It is also submitted to other stresses such as ferrostatic pressure and clamping forces. Casting can last several dozens of hours whereas the cooling step of the mold, when liquid steel is not poured anymore into the mold, can last only a few minutes. Maintaining a reliable, crack-free mold within close dimensional tolerances is crucial to safety and productivity. In order to withdraw the right amount of heat and to prevent mold distortion, mold is generally made of copper alloys that have the thermal and mechanical properties required for this function. The two copper alloys most widely used for casting mold are Cu-Ag and Cu-Cr-Zr. They present a wide range of thermal and mechanical properties due to the different treatments to which they can be submitted. The present master thesis aims to study the influence of thermomechanical properties of copper alloys on continuous casting mold behavior during casting and cooling, and more precisely on mold for continuous casting of steel slabs using realistic finite element models of heat transfer and stress. After realizing a literature review of the most widely used copper alloys, three finite elements models were developed in order to study the influence of three copper alloy grades on mold thermomechanical behavior. The three finite elements models were a 2 D simplistic transverse section of the mold model, a 2 D transverse section of the mold model that includes bolts and the <b>backup</b> <b>plate</b> and a 3 D quarter mold model. Simulations of casting and cooling step were performed with ABAQUS 6. 10 Â® for the two most widely used copper alloys and a copper alloy that was previously submitted to a heat treatment. Simulations results show that the two copper alloys most widely used lead to similar mold behavior. Besides, the material submitted to a heat treatment does not lead to a critical behavior but can lead to a necessity of more frequent re-machining of the mold...|$|E
