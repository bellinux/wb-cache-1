40|$|Payment systems {{play a very}} {{important}} role in ensuring the safe and efficient transfer of deposits and financial instruments. Consequently, the failure of these systems may have a destabilising impact. Business continuity plans have thus been developed to ensure their robustness. However, their smooth functioning is also contingent on the capacity of participants to submit their payment orders. The Banque de France, in its role of overseer of the French payment systems, conducted a study with a view to enhancing its understanding of the consequences and the impact of the technical default of a participant in such systems. This study, carried out using a simulator of the functioning of the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) large-value payment system, operated by the CRI (Centrale des Règlements Interbancaires), shows that the technical default of a participant in this system has negative consequences on the smooth running of the system. Indeed, a situation in which a major participant, {{in the wake of a}} technical incident, is unable to submit its payment orders in a normal fashion to its counterparties in PNS, could further exacerbate congestion in the system and result in almost 10 % of payments being rejected among non-defaulting participants. The consequences of a technical default could nevertheless be greatly reduced if the participants set their <b>bilateral</b> sender <b>limits</b> at a lower level than that currently observed and if they reacted rapidly to information indicating a technical default by reducing their <b>bilateral</b> <b>limits</b> with the defaulting participant (defaulter). ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rotational {{malalignment}} after intramedullary tibial nailing {{is rarely}} addressed in clinical studies. Malrotation (especially > 10 °) {{of the lower}} extremity can lead to development and progression of degenerative changes in knee and ankle joints. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the incidence and severity of tibial malrotation after reamed intramedullary nailing for closed diaphyseal tibial fractures. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients (53 males and 7 females) with tibial diaphyseal fracture were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 33. 4 ± 13. 3 years. All fractures were manually reduced and fixed using reamed intramedullary nailing. A standard method using <b>bilateral</b> <b>limited</b> computerized tomography was used to measure the tibial torsion. A difference greater than 10 ° between two tibiae was defined as malrotation. Results: Eighteen (30 %) patients had malrotation of more than 10 °. Malrotation was greater than 15 ° in seven cases. Good or excellent rotational reduction was achieved in 70 % of the patients. There was no statistically significant relation between AO tibial fracture classification and fibular fixation and malrotation of greater than 10 °. Conclusions: Considering the high incidence rate of tibial malrotation following intramedullary nailing, we need a precise method to evaluate the torsion intraoperatively to prevent the problem...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES:To {{evaluate}} the fertility of women eligible for surgical multiple myomectomy, but who carefully elected a fertility-sparing uterine artery embolization (UAE). METHODS:Non-comparative open-label trial, on women ≤ 40 years, presenting with multiple symptomatic fibroids (at least 3, ≥ 3 cm), immediate pregnancy wish, and no associated infertility factor. Women had a <b>bilateral</b> <b>limited</b> UAE using tris-acryl gelatin microspheres ≥ 500 μm. Fertility, ovarian reserve, uterus and fibroid sizes, {{and quality of}} life questionnaires (UFS-QoL) were prospectively followed. RESULTS:Fifteen patients, aged 34. 8 years (95 %CI 32. 2 - 37. 5, median 36. 0, q 1 -q 3 29. 4 - 39. 5) were included from November 2008 to May 2012. During the year following UAE, 9 women actively attempting to conceive experienced 5 live-births (intention-to-treat fertility rate 33. 3 %, 95 %CI 11. 8 %- 61. 6 %). Markers of ovarian reserve remained stable. The symptoms score was reduced by 66 % (95 %CI 48 %- 85 %) and the quality of life score was improved by 112 % (95 %CI 21 %- 204 %). Uterine volume was reduced by 38 % (95 %CI 24 %- 52 %). Women were followed for 43. 1 months (95 %CI 32. 4 - 53. 9), 10 live-births occurred in 8 patients, and 5 patients required secondary surgeries for fibroids. CONCLUSION:Women without associated infertility factors demonstrated an encouraging capacity to deliver after UAE.

The objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate our clinical experience with limited PLND and the difference in its yield between open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) for prostate cancer patients in Korea. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 601 consecutive patients under-going radical prostatectomy and <b>bilateral</b> <b>limited</b> PLND by either RRP (n= 247) or RALP (n= 354) in Asan Medical Center. All patients were divided into three groups according to the D’Amico’s risk stratification method. Clinicopathologic data, including the yield of lymph nodes, were thoroughly reviewed and compared among the three risk groups or between the RRP and RALP subjects. Results: The mean patient age was 64. 9 years and the mean preoperative prostate-spe-cific antigen was 9. 8 ng/ml. The median number of removed lymph nodes per patient was 5 (range, 0 to 20). The numbers of patients of each risk group were 167, 199, and 238, and the numbers of patients with tumor-positive lymph nodes were 1 (0. 6 %), 4 (2. 0 %), and 17 (7. 1 %) in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. In the high-risk group, the lymph node-positive ratio was higher in RRP (14. 9 %) than in RALP subjects (2. 4 %). Conclusions: We speculate that limited PLND may help in prostate cancer staging in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer groups. RRP is a more effective surgical modality for PLND than is RALP, especially in high-risk prostate cancer groups...|$|R
40|$|India and Pakistan {{have created}} {{sizeable}} ballistic missile forces and {{are continuing to}} develop and enlarge them. These forces can be both stabilizing (e. g., providing a survivable force for deterrence) and destabilizing (e. g., creating strategic asymmetries). Missile forces will {{be a factor in}} bilateral relations for the foreseeable future, so restraint is necessary to curtail their destabilizing effects. Such restraint, however, must develop within an atmosphere of low trust. This report presents a set of political and operational options, both unilateral and bilateral, that decreases tensions, helps rebuild the bilateral relationship, and prepares the ground for future steps in structural arms control. Significant steps, which build on precedents and do not require extensive cooperation, are possible despite strained relations. The approach is made up of three distinct phases: (1) tension reduction measures, (2) confidence building measures, and (3) arms control agreements. The goal of the first phase is to initiate unilateral steps that are substantive and decrease tensions, establish missiles as a security topic for bilateral discussion, and set precedents for <b>limited</b> <b>bilateral</b> cooperation. The second phase would build confidence by expanding current bilateral security agreements, formalizing bilateral understandings, and beginning discussion of monitoring procedures.

In the 19th century many nations passed laws forbidding their nationals from accepting commissions as privateers for other nations. The last major power to flirt with privateering was Prussia in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, when Prussia announced the creation of a 'volunteer navy' of ships privately owned and manned and eligible for prize money. The only difference between this and privateering was that these volunteer ships were under the discipline of the regular navy.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} in imaging, the incidence of patients presenting with bilateral lung lesions is increasing. A single contralateral lung lesion can be an isolated metastasis or a synchronous second primary lung cancer. For the revision of the TNM in 2009, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Committee proposes that patients with contralateral lung nodules remain classified as M 1 disease. In this retrospective study, the survival after resection of synchronous bilateral lung cancer is evaluated. Methods: From our database of bronchial carcinoma, all patients with bilateral synchronous Lung lesions between 1990 and 2007 were retrieved. We analysed 57 patients in which, after functional assessment and thorough staging, the decision was taken to treat the disease with bilateral resection. All these files were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-one patients were excluded from this analysis because only one side was resected (n = 15) {{or one of the}} lesions was non-neoplastic on final pathology In = 6). Results: Thirty-six patients underwent bilateral resection for synchronous multiple primary lung cancer. All resections were performed as sequential. procedures. In 23 patients, one side was anatomically resected (2 pneumonectomies) and the contralateral side was resected by limited resection. In 10 patients a bilateral lobectomy was performed, and 3 patients had <b>bilateral</b> <b>limited</b> resections. Postoperative mortality was 2. 8 %. Eighteen patients had a turnout with a different histological pattern, confirmed by comparing both specimens by an experienced senior pathologist. The median survival after resection of synchronous bilateral lung cancer in our series was 25. 4 months with a 5 -year survival rate of 38 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} survival between patients with different versus same histology. This survival is much higher compared to the survival of assumed stage IV disease. Conclusions: Our study shows that selected patients with bilateral Lung cancer may benefit from an aggressive approach, with acceptable morbidity and mortality, and rewarding tong-term survival. Patients with a single contralateral lung lesion should not be treated as disseminated disease (stage IV). After extensive searching for metastatic spread, bilateral surgical resection should be considered in fit patients. (2008 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier B. V.
