5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|Owumi {{returned}} to Alcorn State {{to play basketball}} as a senior and became team captain. In his season debut on November 9, 2007, he scored 10 points and grabbed eight rebounds in an 18-point loss to Southeastern Louisiana. On December 1, he led his team with 20 points off the bench vs. Texas–Rio Grande Valley. In his next Division I game, he recorded 24 points and eight rebounds. On January 5, 2008, Owumi posted a season-high 28 points, nine rebounds, and four assists as Texas Southern defeated Alcorn State, 81–75. Despite the senior's increased role, the Braves finished {{the season with a}} 7–24 record. Owumi closed out his final season with the team averaging 14.4 points, a team-best 6.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 0.9 steals. Due to the lower talent level and popularity of the SWAC, he was uncertain if he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> National Basketball Association (NBA) after college.|$|E

25|$|Outfielders field furthest {{from the}} bat, {{typically}} {{right on the}} boundary edge. Their main role is to prevent the ball from going over the boundary and scoring four or six runs. They need good footspeed {{to be able to}} get around the field quickly, and a strong arm to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> 50–80-yard throw. Outfielders also often have to catch high hit balls that go over the infield.|$|E
25|$|As {{a senior}} in 2003, he rushed for 2,960 yards on 252 attempts, an average of 11.7 yards per carry, and 32 touchdowns. After a game, players from the other team asked for his autograph. Following Maurice Clarett's {{unsuccessful}} attempt to sue the NFL over its age limit in 2004, there was considerable debate over whether any high school football player might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> leap from the preps to the pro game. The player most frequently mentioned was Peterson.|$|E
25|$|That test, Fairchild wrote, {{required}} that the court dispense with the mutuality provision under which {{a request for a}} lesser included charge can be granted only if the other side would also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> same request. A defense could request a lesser-charge instruction later in the trial as the facts became clearer, yet a prosecution making the same motion could well fail {{on the grounds that the}} defendant had not received sufficient prior notice such as is usually given in the indictment. Yet, the judge observed, there was no language in Rule 31(c) that would support such different treatment.|$|E

Because he was not with the Latter-day Saints in Utah, Cowdery was not immediately given a position of responsibility in the church, but in July 1849 Young wrote Cowdery a letter inviting him to travel to Washington, D.C., with Almon W. Babbitt to publicize the State of Deseret's desire for statehood and to draft a formal statehood application. Cowdery's deteriorating health did not allow him to accept this assignment, and within eight months he had died.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{that fish}} by stealth from {{above the water}} have to correct for {{refraction}} particularly when the fish are observed at an angle. Reef herons and little egrets appear to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> corrections needed when capturing fish and are more successful in catching fish when strikes are made at an acute angle and this higher success {{may be due to}} the inability of the fish to detect their predators. Other studies indicate that egrets work within a preferred angle of strike and that the probability of misses increase when the angle becomes too far from the vertical leading to an increased difference between the apparent and real depth of prey.|$|E
25|$|One {{man who has}} {{encountered}} this problem is Taiwanese politician Yu Shyi-kun, due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including {{a picture of the}} personality, or, especially {{as is the case with}} Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead.|$|E

25|$|When Willingham {{was fired}} {{all of his}} {{assistant}} coaches left, leaving Weis to rebuild a coaching staff. He sought to find experienced coaches that would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> team competitive. When the new assistants were announced in January they were billed as having 25 seasons of collegiate head coaching, 50 seasons as coordinators, 12 seasons as NFL assistant coaches, and 42 bowl victories. Before the season, however, assistant offensive head and quarterbacks coach David Cutcliffe after undergoing heart surgery and being on medical leave, decided to resign, saying he felt his absence unfair to the players and coaches. In early June, Peter Vaas was named as Cutcliffe's replacement. Vaas was a former six-year NFL Europa head coach, an eight-year collegiate head coach, and had 17 years of assistant coaching experience, including two years at Notre Dame under Lou Holtz.|$|E
25|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to Delhi for the Third Test. Australia batted first {{and took a}} 73-run lead on a spinning surface, although their captain only managed six. In the second innings, Lawry became the sixth Australian to carry the bat in Tests, making an unbeaten 49 as Australia collapsed for 107 against the spin of Bishan Singh Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna. Australia were confident that the Indians would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> target of 181 on a deteriorating pitch after 19 wickets had fallen for 167 on the second day. However, following the rest day, India comfortably won the match by seven wickets to square the series. Australian spinner Ashley Mallett claimed that India's Ashok Mankad later admitted that the hosts had switched the pitches on the rest day so they could bat on a favourable pitch. Australia then completed a 96-run win over East Zone in Guwahati, Lawry making 37 and 30.|$|E

Silverman added some special touches: for example, when Homer has an out of body experience, his foot was still touching his body to signify that he was not dead. A doctor acted as a medical consultant for the episode.|$|E
500|$|Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, an {{interrogator}} for the Gestapo and Jones' nemesis, {{who tries}} to torture Marion Ravenwood for the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. He is killed by the Ark's supernatural powers. Lacey was cast as he reminded Spielberg of Peter Lorre. Spielberg had originally offered the role to Roman Polanski, who was intrigued at {{the opportunity to work}} with Spielberg but decided to turn down the role because he wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> trip to Tunisia. Klaus Kinski was also offered the role, but he hated the script, calling it [...] "moronically shitty". Michael Sheard, who ended portraying Captain Oskar Schomburg in the film, also auditioned for the role, but he lost out to Lacey.|$|E

[...] His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral cavities bought in a second-hand bookshop, which he kept in his studio and to which he often referred.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Breen began {{keeping a}} diary on November 20. He {{primarily}} concerned {{himself with the}} weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries. Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a [...] "disagreeable" [...] glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay {{in front of their}} fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it. After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the emigrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine. Emigrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger. George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{was given}} {{complete}} creative {{control over the}} new television project by Paramount, which had promised him that it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> project a [...] "first-class effort" [...] with the budget to suit. Matt Jefferies, who had worked on The Original Series, was recruited as a technical advisor. He had designed the original USS Enterprise alongside Pato Guzman, but was unwilling {{to give up a}} position on the television series Little House on the Prairie for a 13-episode order on a new Star Trek series. Roddenberry was adamant that Jefferies was the right person to update the Enterprise, and agreed a position that the designer could advise the new show, but would have to choose between it and his main duties on Little House on the Prairie if the Star Trek work started to interfere. This occurred quite quickly, after Jefferies conducted design work on the new version of the Enterprise at a hotel in Tucson, Arizona while on a location shoot for Little House on the Prairie, and could not attend meetings with Roddenberry and the producers in Los Angeles. He recommended Joseph R. Jennings as the main art director on the series; Jennings had worked to Jefferies during the [...] and [...] seasons of The Original Series. Jefferies' re-design of the Enterprise was based on the principle that the technology was updated over time, but the general hull remained the same. He highlighted that the engines would specifically be designed to be replaced, so the external design of them was changed. Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures was hired to produce the physical model of the vessel, which was cast in moulds from fiberglass. Two models were built, a [...] version and a [...] version.|$|E
