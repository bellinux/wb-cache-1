Upon LC-MS analysis of the venom from Bufo melanosticus collected in Indonesia, new bufadienolide sulfates were identified. For a complete characterization, the MeOH extract of the toad venom from B. melanosticus was fractionated by preparative HPLC, and the structures of five new buadienolide sulfates (1 - 5) along with one new <b>bufogenin</b> (6) were rapidly elucidated on the basis of LC-DAD-MS(n) and LC-SPE-NMR data. The in vitro growth inhibitory activity of these six compounds along with hellebrin (positive control) has been assayed by means of the MTT colorimetric assay in four human and two mouse cancer cell lines. Compound 3 and hellebrin displayed similar and marked in vitro cytotoxicity. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|If {{invasive}} species use chemical weapons {{to suppress the}} viability of conspecifics, {{we may be able}} to exploit those species-specific chemical cues for selective control of the invader. Cane toads (Rhinella marina) are spreading through tropical Australia, with negative effects on native species. The tadpoles of cane toads eliminate intraspecific competitors by locating and consuming newly laid eggs. Our laboratory trials show that tadpoles find those eggs by searching for the powerful bufadienolide toxins (especially, <b>bufogenins)</b> that toads use to deter predators. Using those toxins as bait, funnel-traps placed in natural waterbodies achieved near-complete eradication of cane toad tadpoles with minimal collateral damage (because most native (non-target) species are repelled by the toads 2 ̆ 7 toxins). More generally, communication systems that have evolved for intraspecific conflict provide novel opportunities for invasive-species control...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the in vitro metabolites of toad venom, which has been widely used as a traditional Chinese drug, Ch'an Su, has been completed. Toad venom contains bufotoxins (such as marinobufotoxin; marinobufagin 3 -suberoylarginine ester) and <b>bufogenins</b> (such as marinobufagin and bufalin) as the main cardiac steroids. An in vitro experiment using the rat or human liver cytosolic fraction disclosed that marinobufotoxin produced marinobufagin, but not its 3 -hemisuberate. Marinobufagin was subjected to the enzyme reaction using the rat or human liver microsomal fraction together with NADPH and NAD, which produced 3 -dehydromarinobufagin and 3 -epimarinobufagin. Marinobufagin produced its 3 -sulfate upon treatment with the rat or human liver cytosolic fraction and 3 ′-phosphoadenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate. Bufalin was also subjected to the above enzyme reactions and showed almost the same results except for the result that the hydroxylation occurred at the 5 β-position. On the other hand, small amounts of marinobufagin 3 -glucuronide were obtained only by treatment with the human liver microsomal fraction and uridine 5 ′-diphosphoglucuronic acid. The structures of these metabolites were confirmed using authentic samples regarding their high-performance liquid chromatographic behavior and/or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.
