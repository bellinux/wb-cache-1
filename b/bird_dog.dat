25|$|The aerial {{fire-fighting}} operation {{consisted of}} two aircraft; the <b>bird</b> <b>dog</b> aircraft, a Rockwell Turbo Commander 690, and the tanker aircraft, Flight 448. The <b>bird</b> <b>dog</b> aircraft directed the tanker aircraft to {{the area where the}} fire retardant was to be released. On 31 July 2010 both of these aircraft took off from Kamloops Airport and proceeded to the wildfire. While making a bombing run, the tanker aircraft suddenly lost height and hit the trees, crashing into a ravine.|$|E

50|$|During {{the course}} of the Vietnam War, 469 O-1 <b>Bird</b> <b>Dogs</b> were lost to all causes. The USAF lost 178, the USMC lost 7, and 284 were lost from the U.S. Army, South Vietnamese Forces, and clandestine operators.

The Air Force took {{delivery}} of the Cessna O-1 <b>Bird</b> <b>Dog</b> in 1960, and those allocated to Southern Norway were stationed at Haslemoen Airport. These were used for aerial observations to support the artillery. They remained in service until 1992.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport was}} planned by the Norwegian Army Air Service {{as a main}} air station during the late 1930s, but the plans were stopped by the {{break-out}} ofh the Second World War. Haslemoen was built as a labor camp in 1943 and then taken over by Luftwaffe, who built the airport. Opening in August 1944, its main purpose was to station a squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors. Haslemoen was rebuilt and opened as {{the base of the}} Artillery Battalion in 1955. Operation of the airport resumed in 1960 with the delivery of Cessna O-1 <b>Bird</b> <b>Dog</b> observation aircraft. They remained in service with the artillery until 1992. The grass ultralight runway was established in 1990 and was sold to Våler Municipality in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{night of}} 17 February 1970 was eventful. At LS 22, four PT-76s {{attacked}} {{under cover of}} fog, only to be destroyed by defensive anti-tank mines. Coinciding with this, a Dac Cong squad had penetrated {{the security of the}} guerrilla headquarters in the rear area of Lima Strip 20 Alternate (LS 20A). Three of them were killed in the attempt, but two RLAF T-28s and an O-1 <b>Bird</b> <b>Dog</b> were damaged. Most importantly, the U.S. escalated the war in northern Laos with its first B-52 Arc Light strike. Approved personally by President Richard M. Nixon, the three plane strike was aimed at a suspected North Vietnamese headquarters at the eastern limits of the Plain of Jars. It would be followed by others during the campaign.|$|E

25|$|As {{an officer}} in the reserves, McMahon was {{recalled}} to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 <b>Bird</b> <b>Dog),</b> an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982, McMahon received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} Shooting Dog Stake, {{it may be}} very {{difficult}} to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard. Therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate this standard. The standard when applied should seek out a dog which displays superior <b>bird</b> <b>dog</b> characteristics in the form of natural qualities such as pace, range, bird sense, nose, stamina and style. The contender sought after should render a balanced, biddable performance, search intelligently and exhibit bird finding ability with quality always superseding quantity, manifest accuracy of location, loftiness and intensity on point. Subservience to the handler and proper handling response without the benefit of scouting and excessive handling are the “sine qua non” of a shooting dog. Excessive range {{on the part of a}} shooting dog is not considered desirable. When considering bird work, the judges should be swayed not by the frequency of occurrence but rather the quality of the performance.|$|E

Potts were flying USAF OV-10A (Covey 282) from 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron. Potts was directing naval gunfire from the destroyer [...] against Soviet-supplied North Vietnamese tanks to protect Hambleton. At 11:05a.m., an O-1 <b>Bird</b> <b>Dog</b> pilot observed a SAM launch and Covey 282 was shot down [...] west of Highway 1 and [...] north of Highway 9. Radio contact was established with both Potts and Walker, and both {{reported that they were}} uninjured, but each man was too close to North Vietnamese forces to attempt a rescue.|$|E

2500|$|All {{humans in}} Lyra's world, {{including}} witches, have a dæmon. It is the physical {{manifestation of a}} person's 'inner being', soul or spirit. It {{takes the form of}} a creature (moth, <b>bird,</b> <b>dog,</b> monkey, snake, etc.) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The dæmons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but towards the end of a child's puberty, their dæmon [...] "settles" [...] into a permanent form, which reflects the person's personality. When a person dies, the dæmon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have dæmons. An armoured bear's armour is his soul.|$|E
