Upon release, the song was widely panned by critics for its composure and lyrical structure, with many critics finding the track racist. However, several reviewers were more positive to the track for being [...] "interesting". [...] "Harajuku Girls" [...] was performed live during the Harajuku Lovers Tour in 2005, where it served as the opening number.

6000|$|When a {{child is}} five or six months old it will have got a certain use and grip with its hands, and it will want to handle and examine and test the {{properties}} of as many objects as it can. Gifts begin. There seems scope for a wiser selection in these early gifts. At present it is chiefly woolly animals with bells inside them, woolly balls, and so forth, that reach the baby's hands. There is {{no reason at all}} why a child's attention should be so predominantly fixed on wool. These toys are coloured very tastefully, but as Preyer has advanced strong reasons for supposing that the child's discrimination of colours is extremely rudimentary until the second year has begun, these tasteful arrangements are simply an appeal to the parent. Light, dark, yellow, perhaps red and [...] "other colours" [...] seem to constitute the colour system of a very young infant. It is to the parent, too, that the humorous and realistic quality of the animal forms appeal. The parent does the shopping and has to be amused. The parent who ought to have a doll instead of {{a child is}} sufficiently abundant in our world to dominate the shops, and there is a vast traffic in facetious baby toys, facetious nursery furniture, [...] "art" [...] cushions and [...] "quaint" [...] <b>baby</b> <b>clothing,</b> all amazingly delightful things for grown-up people. These things are bought and grouped about the child, the child is taught tricks to complete the picture, and parentage becomes a very amusing afternoon employment. So long as convenience is not sacrificed to the æsthetic needs of the nursery, and so long as common may compete with [...] "art" [...] toys, there is no great harm done, but it is well to understand how irrelevant these things are to the real needs of a child's development.|$|E

30|$|An {{example of}} how this model {{can be applied to}} {{research}} on dress as a cue to sexual information is Ben-Zeev and Dennehy’s (2014) research. In this research, a pilot study established that {{it was more of a}} gender violation for boys to wear pink than for girls to wear blue. In experiment 1, the cue of <b>baby</b> boys’ <b>clothing</b> color (pink or blue) was varied. The baby’s proposed treatment was affected when the child wore pink. Although neither interpretative or extended inferences were assessed, the researchers suggest that seeing a baby dressed in a feminine way (pink clothing) could have led to inferences that the baby is weak as well as fragile and consequently impacted the child’s proposed treatment (anticipatory set).|$|R

40|$|Apparel design {{solutions}} for {{an aging population}} with unique needs are lacking in the retail industry and specifically for baby boomer women. The fashion industry does not acknowledge that older women value fashion and are interested in maintaining a sense of style into old age. This study focused on expanding inclusive apparel design strategies and specifically to evaluate <b>baby</b> boomer women’s <b>clothing</b> preferences through their fashion blogs. Vital to this research was the design and construction of a mini-collection of clothing that served two purposes. First, {{as a starting point}} in the development of apparel prototypes designed specifically to satisfy multiple needs without calling attention to special requirements. Second, to provide physical garments that users interacted with and provided feedback about to inform recommendations for inclusive apparel prototypes designed for baby boomer women. The results from this study found that the study participants were interested in a variety of clothing styles and silhouettes and specifically in fashion trends that could be modified to accommodate an aging body. Design solutions addressed a range of needs without calling attention to disabilities. Simple designs with easy to manage closures and special details to enhance personal style were favored by the study participants. This research contributed to apparel design scholarship, fully documented and evaluated the inclusive design process and added to the body of qualitative research that utilizes social media and specifically blogs as a rich data source...|$|R
40|$|A CAJM journal article. Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{risk factors for}} hypothermia among neonates on admission to the Neonatal Care Unit. Hypothermia in newborn babies {{is a problem in}} tropical countries despite warm environmental conditions and it contributes to a high neonatal morbidity and mortality. Methodology: A study was undertaken to {{determine the}} prevalence of hypothermia and its association with early neonatal outcome among neonates admitted to the Neonatal Care Unit of Muhimbili Medical Centre. At admission all neonates were examined and axillary temperature recorded using a low-reading thermometer. Six-hourly temperature was taken in all infants: Those with a temperature below 36. 5 °C were recruited as cases and those with normal temperature served as controls. These neonates were followed up for early neonatal outcome. Results: Hypothermia on admission was found in 366 out of 1632 babies (22. 4 %). In none of these was hypothermia recorded or reported as a reason for admission. Thirteen percent of the hypothermic neonates had severe hypothermia, with body temperature below 32 °C on admission. Hypothermia was significantly associated with deliveries from outside hospitals and with those who had operative or instrumental delivery in the same hospital. It was also associated with prematurity, low birth weight babies, time taken to transfer the <b>baby</b> and inadequate <b>clothing</b> after delivery. It was found that hypothermic infants had a three fold higher mortality and morbidity. These infants had a longer stay in the unit and had a higher post natal weight loss. There was no low-reading thermometer in the unit. Conclusion: It is concluded that there is cause for concern about hypothermia in the neonates at Muhimbili Medical Centre, Efforts should be made to sensitize and educate all levels of staff dealing with neonates, and low-reading thermometers {{should be part of the}} essential kit in the unit...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{fertility}} {{is one of}} the few subject matters common to all disciplines in the social sciences. Yet, little agreement exists as to why families have the number of children they do. This article synthesizes existing theories, critically analyses supporting research, and suggests new directions for study. Although fertility is regarded more as a subject for doctors, biologists, and midwives, it is, in fact, intimately related to consumption and opens a new area for consumer research. In the first place, fertility be-havior indirectly affects the consumption of all goods and services. The decision to have children and their number and timing involve trade-offs which constrain the purchase and consumption of durable goods and other items vying for the consumer's scarce dollar. Further, fertility has direct implications for the con-sumption of products and services used in the pre-vention of childbirth and in the activity of child rearing. The purchase of contraceptives, family planning services, <b>baby</b> food, children's <b>clothing,</b> toys, and other " child services " can be thought to interact funda-mentally with the decision t 6 have children. Some researchers suggest that fertility itself is a consump-tion decision. Thus, fertility is seen to result directly from family choices, wherein overall household satis-faction is maximized subject to the constraints of in-come and prices (e. g., Becker 1960). Finally, from still another perspective, fertility behavior can be viewed as the "consumption " of psychic, social, and other benefits and costs brought about through social exchange (Bagozzi and Van Loo 1977 a, 1977 b). This article examines fertility as a topic for con-sumer research. It begins with a review of economic models of fertility with particular emphasis given to logic and supporting evidence. Throughout the analy-sis, the reasonableness of assumptions is considered...|$|R
