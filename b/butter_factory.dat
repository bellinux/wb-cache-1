5|$|Historically, in {{addition}} to its success as a fishing port, Esbjerg established its position as one of the country's major export centres. Before World War II, there was a large <b>butter</b> <b>factory,</b> Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employing some 150 workers while after the war the town developed agricultural industries, especially for meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300. Latterly owned by Danish Crown and employing 500, the plant closed in May 2012.|$|E
25|$|The Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> is {{now part}} of a network of extant {{historic}} or heritage listed butter factories in South East Queensland that have been re-purposed for cultural or community use including the Kingaroy <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory,</b> Nanango <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory,</b> The Downs Co-operative Dairy Association Limited Factory, Kingston <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> and Grantham <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{dedicated}} <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> in Boonah {{was built}} by Samuel Dover in 1900 on property he owned in Church Street neighbouring the Roman Catholic Church. Known as the Fassifern <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> and Ice Works, it was owned by Howes Bros. and employed seven men and collected milk from the various creameries in the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened due to {{rapid growth in}} the fruit (apples and pears) and dairy industries. The dairy {{industry}} needed a quick way of sending milk and cream to <b>butter</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{decline in}} the Queensland dairy {{industry}} in the 1960s and 1970s, and the resulting closure of small town <b>butter</b> <b>factories,</b> means that ex-butter factories that are relatively intact are now becoming uncommon.|$|R
50|$|While Kingaroy's supply benefited in {{the short}} term from Wondai's closure, {{ultimately}} it was not enough to sustain the business. In May 1977 it was announced that both Nanango and the Kingaroy <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> would close and that all cream supplies would be diverted to Murgon. With a large number of suppliers leaving the industry, and manufacturing and other costs dramatically increasing, it was no longer economically viable for the factories to stay open. By the time of Kingaroy <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory's</b> closure, there were only 38 suppliers and only one and a half tonnes of butter produced a week, a far cry from its interwar heyday.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{percentage of}} freight on the railway line were {{products from the}} combined output of the <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> and sawmill. The Dugandan railway line was closed in 1964 and the tracks and associated infrastructure removed. The original location of the Boonah railway station {{is marked by a}} memorial adjacent to the Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> site.|$|E
25|$|The {{local farmers}} were {{dissatisfied}} with Howes Bros. and, {{after a series}} of meetings, decided to form a joint venture between the Boonah Farmers Co-Operative Dairy Co., which had been established in 1899, and the Queensland Farmers Co-Operative Association which had been founded in 1899 and was based at the Booval <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory,</b> also known as the Jacaranda <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory.</b> The Queensland Farmers Co-Operative put a proposal to the Boonah Farmers Co-Operative in June 1905 to guarantee to establish a cooperative <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> in Boonah and, in November 1905, the Boonah Co-Operative opened a dedicated bank account to build the necessary funds to buy a site. In 1907 the two cooperatives merged and purchased the Fassifern <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> and Ice Works from Howes Brothers. Samuel Dover remained in place as manager and, by 1909, the factory output was larger {{than any of the other}} factories controlled by the Queensland Farmers Co-Operative Association.|$|E
25|$|Dairying {{emerged as}} an {{important}} economic activity on these selections, boosted by {{the establishment of a}} <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> at Gladstone in the early 1900s. In September 1904 the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was formed at Gladstone, with the express purpose of establishing a regional <b>butter</b> <b>factory,</b> which opened at Gladstone about March 1906. Located adjacent to the main railway line, it provided an accessible market for cream produced by regional dairy farmers, including those at Miriam Vale.|$|E
50|$|The interwar period saw {{the dairy}} {{industry}} expand greatly in Queensland. Between 1927 and 1937 {{the total number}} of dairy cattle rose by 50%. By the 1930s, dairying was Queensland's most widely spread agricultural industry and the state's second most profitable export industry from 1936 to 1941, accounting for 20% of primary production. By the late 1930s, around one in eight Queenslanders were living on dairy farms. In 1938 there were five co-operative <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> in the South Burnett: located at Nanango, Kingaroy, Murgon, Wondai and Proston. While <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> enabled the production and export of dairy products, numerous small farms reliant on family labour to milk herds twice daily for generally modest returns, were the backbone of the industry.|$|R
50|$|There {{was some}} Danish {{immigration}} {{at the time}} of the Australian gold rushes. It was estimated that there were 1,000 Danes on the Victorian goldfields. Danish immigrants had a significant effect on the Australian dairy industry from the 1880s, in particular establishing and managing <b>butter</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1800s Moyhu was a lively centre, {{and the home}} of several <b>butter</b> <b>factories,</b> race meetings, dances and other social events. Victoria's first narrow gauge railway line (2'6" [...] gauge) was opened in 1899 and {{connected}} the King Valley with the broad gauge line at Wangaratta.|$|R
25|$|The Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> is {{the only}} {{surviving}} major industrial site related to the dairy, timber and railway industries of Boonah from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The nearby Cossart's Mill at Dugandan was the largest supplier of butter boxes in Australia. Like the <b>butter</b> <b>factory,</b> the sawmill had been a dominant industry and employer in the area. The sawmill was recommended for heritage protection in 1998 as a rare surviving example of a major Queensland sawmill from the mid twentieth century. It was demolished around 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{plans for}} four {{self-contained}} two storey shops {{associated with the}} factory were approved. In April 1954, manufacture commenced on {{a new line of}} products at the <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> with the introduction of butter milk powder.|$|E
25|$|The new <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> {{was fitted}} with {{state of the}} art {{equipment}} and was officially opened in July 1916 by the Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams. During his visit to Boonah, the Governor also unveiled an Honour Board for local men who were serving overseas in World War One. In 1928 additions to the factory were made.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s/early 1930s the Co-operative's success enabled it to re-build {{a number of}} its timber <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> in {{concrete}} and brick - Dalby (1927), Toowoomba (1929), Clifton (1933) and Goombungee (1934) - but during the economic downturn of the early 1930s closed a number of its cheese factories.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1900s co-operatives were {{becoming}} the dominant form of ownership of cheese and <b>butter</b> <b>factories,</b> {{a pattern that}} defined the Queensland dairy industry {{for much of the}} 20th century. In 1897, Gympie's first dairy co-operative for butter production, the Gympie Central Dairying Company was established. By 1897 the Silverwood Dairying Company had taken over the factory and in 1906 the Wide Bay Co-Operative purchased the operations. In the year ending 30 June 1907 there were 322 suppliers to the Wide Bay Company, who were paid a total of £20,973 for their cream. Metal cans containing the cream produced by dairy farms surrounding Gympie was carted into the Wide Bay Co-operative's factory by contractors. In the Mary Valley, some cream was also sent from the Traveston railway station on the North Coast railway line to <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> further south.|$|R
50|$|Reshetylivka <b>Butter</b> Making <b>Factory,</b> has {{operated}} {{in the settlement}} since 1924.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century the quality of dairy {{products}} from the region was well established. In 1931 salted butter from the Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> was awarded the first prize at the London Dairy Show. By the 1930s, the factory had 900 suppliers and during a visit to Boonah in 1938 by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Joseph Lyons, the prominence and quality of butter from the region was mentioned in speeches.|$|E
25|$|Willis {{was born}} in January 1922 in Murwillumbah, New South Wales, the first son of Archibald Clarence Willis (1893–1975), a <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> hand and First World War veteran, and his wife, Vida Mabel Buttenshaw (1894–1984). His younger brother was NSW Legislative Council Member and President, Max Willis. He was educated at Tyalgum Public School and then at Murwillumbah High School, at which he was Dux of his year and won a {{scholarship}} to study Arts at the University of Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the creameries, the local farmers wished to have greater control of their own dairy {{products}} and pricing. Rather than transport the cream to Brisbane for final processing where the vibration of the train journey could impact the quality, the farmers wished to churn butter in Boonah. There was also a strong desire to remove their reliance on privately owned factories and participate in the cooperative movement in the dairy industry that was gaining momentum in Queensland. To achieve this, a local <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> operated as a cooperative venture was required.|$|E
50|$|Caselberg formed {{this company}} in 1892 {{with a capital}} of £100,000. It was formed to own his {{existing}} businesses. By 1908 {{it was the largest}} inland trading organisation in the North Island of New Zealand. Principally a stock and station agency its activities included eight retail stores, cheese and <b>butter</b> <b>factories,</b> motor vehicle dealerships.|$|R
25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the <b>butter</b> <b>factories,</b> and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|R
50|$|The Downs Co-operative Dairy Association soon expanded, {{constructing}} or purchasing branch <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> at Miles (1911), Clifton (1912), Dalby (1915) and Crows Nest (1918). World War I (1914-1918) stimulated cheese {{manufacturing in}} Queensland, prompting the Co-operative to establish or acquire branch cheese factories at Hodgson Vale (1915), Jondaryan (1919), Gowrie Junction (1920), Boodua (1926), Lilyvale (1926) and Wyreema (1927). However, the Toowoomba factory remained the Co-operative's flagship facility and administrative headquarters throughout the twentieth century.|$|R
25|$|The Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> {{closed on}} 1 March 1974 due to declining {{production}} {{as a result}} of low prices for milk and shifting agricultural practices in the region. The last batch of butter came off the production line at Boonah at 10:45am. It was packed by Hartley Schumacher with George Kubler, Stan Schlieff, Roydon Kubler and Sel Schneider watching. Milk products from Boonah were subsequently transported to Booval for processing with the majority of employees also transferring to Booval. Booval had ceased operation by 2011 and was demolished by 2016.|$|E
2500|$|The Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> is a heritage-listed former <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> in Boonah, Scenic Rim Region, Queensland, Australia. Constructed in 1916, it is a {{prominent}} landmark {{at the intersection}} of Boonah-Rathdowney Road and Railway Street on the northern entry to Boonah. During {{the first part of the}} twentieth century, it was one of the most modern butter factories in the Commonwealth, [...] the largest <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, [...] had the second highest output of butter in Queensland and was a major supplier of dairy products to Brisbane. [...] The former Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> office, which is currently the premises of Flavours Cafe, [...] is on the Local Heritage Register of the Scenic Rim Regional Council in acknowledgement of the site's historic, aesthetic and cultural significance.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> - when {{closed it}} became the Freezing Works ...|$|E
5000|$|Kempsey {{initially}} flourished as a centre for {{logging and}} sawmilling. Large reserves of Australian red cedar Toona australis, sold in Britain and the USA (as 'Indian mahogany') were extracted down until the 1920s, and with greater difficulty until the 1960s, {{by which time}} the resource was effectively exhausted. [...] Dairying was the major industry in the area until the 1960s, with a Nestlé Milo factory at nearby Smithtown, and several cheese and <b>butter</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Murgon <b>butter</b> <b>factory's</b> {{diversification}} into {{dairy products}} other than butter from the 1940s enhanced {{the longevity of}} SBCDA operations compared to other factories which became increasingly vulnerable to closure from the 1960s. Cheese making commenced at the factory in late 1942 in response to wartime demand, as occurred at the Kingaroy, Nanango and Wondai <b>butter</b> <b>factories.</b> While cheese making ended during or shortly after the war at most of these places, Murgon maintained this production until the 1990s. In 1948 pasteurised bottled milk sales commenced and in 1953, the earliest part of the complex was remodelled and a modern pasteurisation and bottling plant was installed. In 1950 the office was re-established in new brick and concrete premises opposite the factory in Macalister St, with the former office building operating as the co-operative's trading arm from 1951. This was followed in 1952 {{with the construction of}} a dairy research laboratory, staffed by members of the Department of Agriculture and Stock, adjacent to the new office. In 1960 a new building was constructed for the production of buttermilk powder, produced from the liquid by-product of butter churning.|$|R
50|$|While timber freight was {{initially}} the main income generator for the Mary Valley Railway, cream was transported {{on the line}} from its very beginnings. Transportation by rail was a far more efficient way of delivering cream to <b>butter</b> <b>factories,</b> with contractors and individual farmers able to deliver their cream direct to the nearest railhead. Following delivery and washing of the cans at the factory, they were returned by rail, with each can inscribed with the name of its owner for identification.|$|R
2500|$|The Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> is {{the sole}} {{surviving}} cream factory or <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> in Boonah {{and is one of}} the most historic buildings in the region. [...] It has served as a studio and gallery space for local and international artists for over twenty years [...] and has been identified by the Scenic Rim Regional Council as a developed attraction in the region. [...] The former loading platform for the factory is a fruit and vegetable store.|$|E
2500|$|The Boonah <b>Butter</b> <b>Factory</b> {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{original}} factories managed by the Queensland Farmers Co-Operative Association, including those located at Grantham, Laidley and Booval.|$|E
2500|$|Albury was at {{this time}} {{starting}} to grow substantially with German speaking immigrants using the area to grow grapes for wine. By the 1870s a <b>butter</b> <b>factory</b> was established, a flour mill, wineries and locally brewed cider and soft drinks were available.|$|E
50|$|Fires {{consumed}} buildings housing a <b>butter</b> tub <b>factory</b> (2 fires {{prior to}} 1916), the Opera House (1929), a cheese factory (1954), and the Monitor building (1968).|$|R
50|$|A {{town hall}} was {{completed}} in 1908 after a school of arts committee raised the funds. As the land was cleared and grasses were planted, dairy farms began to build up over the area. By 1920, two <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> had {{been built in the}} area. In 1922, a second sawmill was brought in from Verrierdale. The two mills operated amicably as one specialised in hardwood and the other processed softwood timber. In 1996, the former Methodist Church was re-opened as the Eumundi Historical Museum.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1880s, the Queensland {{government}} promoted {{the establishment of}} dairying in Queensland as a commercial, rather than subsistence, activity. The development of dairying as a staple industry was considered a means of relieving selector poverty and debt, and as encouragement to closer settlement of the land. The Meat and Dairy Produce Act 1893 was introduced to offer subsidies to dairy farmers and a tax on cattle, the latter funding the establishment of creameries, cheese and <b>butter</b> <b>factories</b> throughout Queensland. In 1895, Queensland produced its first butter surplus.|$|R
