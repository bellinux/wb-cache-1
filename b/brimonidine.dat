50|$|Allergan holds {{at least}} six active patents {{protecting}} Combigan from generic competition. Several generic companies challenged {{the validity of the}} patents and filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) seeking market entry. Allergan responded by filing a lawsuit against the ANDA filers. In Allergan, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Allergan’s composition-related patent claims were invalid based on obviousness, because <b>brimonidine</b> and timolol had already been marketed in the claimed concentrations. However, Allergan’s method claim (US Patent No. 7,030,149), which states “reducing the number of daily topical ophthalmic doses of <b>brimonidine</b> administered topically to an eye of a person in need thereof for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension from 3 to 2 times a day without loss of efficacy”, was held to be non-obvious.

40|$|Abstract: Treatment in {{glaucoma}} aims {{to lower}} intraocular pressure (IOP) {{to reduce the}} risk of progression and vision loss. The alpha 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist <b>brimonidine</b> effectively lowers IOP and is useful as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, and replacement therapy in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. A fixed combination of <b>brimonidine</b> and timolol, available in some countries, reduces IOP as effectively as concomitant therapy with <b>brimonidine</b> and timolol and offers the convenience of 2 drugs in a single eyedrop. <b>Brimonidine</b> is safe and well tolerated. Its most common side-effects are conjunctival hyperemia, allergic conjunctivitis, and ocular pruritus. The newest formulation of <b>brimonidine,</b> brimonidine-Purite 0. 1 %, has a higher pH to improve the ocular bioavailability of <b>brimonidine.</b> This formulation contains the lowest effective concentration of <b>brimonidine</b> and is preserved with Purite ® to enhance ocular tolerability. Brimonidine-Purite 0. 1 % is as effective in reducing IOP as the original <b>brimonidine</b> 0. 2 % solution preserved with benzalkonium chloride. Recent results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that <b>brimonidine</b> may protect retinal ganglion cells and their projections from damage and death independently of its effects on IOP. The potential for neuroprotection with <b>brimonidine</b> is an added benefit of its use in glaucoma and ocular hypertension...|$|E
