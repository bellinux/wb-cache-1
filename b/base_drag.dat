[...] Large caliber artillery also employ drag reduction mechanisms in addition to streamlining geometry. Rocket-assisted projectiles employ a small rocket motor that ignites upon muzzle exit providing additional thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag. Rocket assist is most effective with subsonic artillery projectiles. For supersonic long range artillery, where <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> dominates, base bleed is employed. Base bleed {{is a form of}} a gas generator that does not provide significant thrust, but rather fills the low-pressure area behind the projectile with gas pressure, effectively reducing the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> and the overall projectile drag coefficient.|$|E

50|$|The M864 is an US made 155 mm {{artillery}} shell. It {{carries a}} dual-purpose ICM submunition warhead and incorporates Base bleed technology {{to increase its}} range. The projectile is capable of delivering 24 M46 and 48 M42 dual-purpose anti-materiel/anti-personnel sub-munitions at ranges out to 29 kilometers. Base bleed technology was developed {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> on a projectile, thereby increasing the achieved range. The drag is reduced by a gas generator located on the base of the projectile. Once ignited, the gas generator bleeds hot gas into the projectiles wake which causes the flow of air at the base to be less turbulent. The decrease in turbulence, reduces <b>base</b> <b>drag,</b> which typically accounts for 50 percent of total drag. The amount of thrust produced by the base burner unit is negligible and does not serve the same function as the rocket motor on a rocket assisted projectile (RAP).|$|E

The tracer cups then light a composite propellant to sustain the burning at muzzle exit.

40|$|Current {{reentry vehicle}} designs exhibit {{large amounts of}} <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> due to large base areas. These large base areas can arise from the {{integration}} of the propulsion system (X- 33) or control surface placement (X- 38). Large <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> limits the vehicle's cross-range capability and causes a large glide-slope angle. Fortunately, {{there appears to be a}} possible means of lowering the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> on these vehicles. Based on early work on the subsonic aerodynamics of lifting bodies, it appears that the addition of small amounts of viscous fore-body drag can produce a significant reduction in <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> Recent work suggests that this phenomenon also occurs in the transonic and supersonic flight regimes. This report summarizes a study designed to demonstrate the reduction of <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> through the addition of fore-body viscous drag. The present study has focused on the measurement of viscous fore-body drag and the demonstration of the relationship between fore-body viscous drag and <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> at Reynolds Numbers up to 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6). The results of the present work do not conclusively demonstrate that viscous fore-body drag reduces <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> The apparent contradictory results of the present study are attributed to the different geometry used in the present study. However, the results suggest that the increased boundary layer thickness at separation caused by larger fore-body viscous drag somehow affects the vortex structure in the wake thereby reducing the <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> More research is required to confirm this postulated mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A ground {{research}} vehicle (GRV) {{has been developed}} to study the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> on large-scale vehicles at subsonic speeds. Existing models suggest that <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> is dependent upon vehicle forebody drag, and for certain configurations, the total drag of a vehicle can be reduced by increasing its forebody drag. Although these models work well for small projectile shapes, {{studies have shown that}} they do not provide accurate predictions when applied to large-scale vehicles. Experiments are underway at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center to collect data at Reynolds numbers to a maximum of 3 x 10 (exp 7), and to formulate a new model for predicting the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> of trucks, buses, motor homes, reentry vehicles, and other large-scale vehicles.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the work accomplished during a first-year investigation of <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> reduction for launch vehicles. Interest {{in this work}} has arisen due to the large base areas associated with {{the current generation of}} launch vehicles. For example, the X- 33 and Venture Star configurations all have large base areas because of the aero-spike engines they use. Because of the large base-to-wetted area ratios of these vehicles, the majority of the vehicle drag is due to <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> Based on previous research, {{there appears to be a}} means for reducing the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> on such vehicles. A clear relationship between viscous fore-body drag and <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> was demonstrated. For subsonic flow conditions, an increase in fore-body drag causes a decrease in <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> This base-drag reduction is a result of boundary layer effects at the base of the vehicle. The shear layer that develops from the boundary layer separating at the back of the vehicle is the conduit through which momentum is transferred from the high energy free-stream flow to the low-energy fluid in the base area. One way to think of the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> is that it is the momentum required to accelerate this low-energy fluid. The boundary layer that develops on the fore body acts as an "insulator" between the external flow and the low-energy air at the base. As the viscous fore-body drag is increased, the boundary layer thickness at the aft end of the fore body increases, thereby reducing the rate at which momentum is transferred to the base area. As a result of the lower momentum transfer (or reduced pumping), the base pressure coefficient rises resulting in a reduction of <b>base</b> <b>drag...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} wind-tunnel tests that demonstrate a novel drag reduction technique for blunt-based vehicles. For these tests, the forebody roughness of a blunt-based model was modified using micomachined surface overlays. As forebody roughness increases, boundary layer at the model aft thickens {{and reduces the}} shearing effect of external flow on the separated flow behind the base region, resulting in reduced <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> For vehicle configurations with large <b>base</b> <b>drag,</b> existing data predict that a small increment in forebody friction drag {{will result in a}} relatively large decrease in <b>base</b> <b>drag.</b> If the added increment in forebody skin drag is optimized with respect to <b>base</b> <b>drag,</b> reducing the total drag of the configuration is possible. The wind-tunnel tests results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a forebody dragbase drag optimal point. The data demonstrate that the <b>base</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient corresponding to the drag minimum lies between 0. 225 and 0. 275, referenced to the base area. Most importantly, the data show a drag reduction of approximately 15 % when the drag optimum is reached.
