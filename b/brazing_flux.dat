40|$|Abstract. Use of {{aluminium}} materials {{has increased in}} the vehicle industry {{in the last years}} due to their low weight. Machining {{of aluminium}} by industrial lasers is a more complex task than that of steel because of the lower absorption, higher heat conduction, higher heat capacity and oxide layer on the surface. The low absorption ability of the Al surface can be significantly improved by using appropriate <b>brazing</b> <b>flux</b> suspension on the wavelength of CO 2 lasers. In this paper the role of <b>brazing</b> <b>flux</b> components and their influence are investigated in the heating efficiency in case of Nd:YAG lasers, which are widely used in the laser joining technology. This research work presents the differences between the effects of the <b>brazing</b> <b>flux</b> in case of CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers...|$|E

Only with the protection of self-made <b>brazing</b> <b>flux,</b> a lap joint with the average shear strength of 30 MPa could be obtained in an ordinary resistance furnace without inert gas protection, which {{is much better than}} that without flux in which the shear strength is lower than 10 MPa...|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to oven brazing a brazing, process has been developed {{which is based on}} local electric heating, such as resistance or induction heating. Joining is executed in an inert gas atmosphere e. g. argon or nitrogen or in a weak reducing atmosphere, e. g. forming gas with a maximum of 10 % hydrogen, thus eliminating the necessity of applying aggressive flux material. Steel, Cr-Ni-steel, hard metal as well as brass alloys, can be <b>brazed</b> <b>flux</b> free. The joint surfaces are activated by means of heat, which causes the oxide layer to crack and spall. It will be demonstrated that different metals require different temperatures for the breaking of the oxide layer to occur and, thus, for wetting of the braze. Inert gas brazing with local heating is currently employed in the industry. Manual and automatic brazing equipment for this procedure is commercially available...|$|R

These joints are designed for various industries including the machine building and special industries such as aeronautics through the use of ceramics and metal brazing joints. Due to differences in material properties of brazing, the thermal expansion, different wetting and dispersion, residual stresses can occur in the joint.

Local pressure drop coefficients were determined from the experimental data and compared with published correlations. Results confirmed the Moody Chart {{to be applicable}} for the submillimeter channel flows used in heat exchangers explored.

40|$|Non-galvanized and 10 µm {{zinc-coated}} 1. 2 mm thick DC 04 steel {{was joined}} to 6016 -T 4 aluminium alloy by using three different laser processses : a key-hole welding mode, with a precise {{control of the}} aluminium – steel dilution, a reactive wetting mode where solid steel – liquid aluminium reaction occurred driving to a uniform Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic layer between the two overlapped sheets and a braze-welding mode involving direct fusion of aluminium and an Al- 12 Si filler wire on solid steel. For liquid aluminium to liquid steel interactions obtained by key-hole mode, rather sound and resistant assemblies were realized either on non-galvanized or galvanized steel provided steel was placed upon aluminium with penetration in aluminium limited to 0. 5 mm. The influence of galvanized layer was only detectable on the fusion zone of aluminium where occluded zinc bubbles were observed. Mechanical resistances of 150 N/mm were obtained for one joint assemblies and could be increased up to 250 N/mm making two joints per assembly. For liquid aluminium to solid steel interactions carried out by defocused laser, 180 N/mm transverse tensile strengths were obtained on non-galvanized steels by using a <b>brazing</b> <b>flux.</b> Due to a better wetting on non-galvanized steels, good assemblies could be obtained without using flux leading to lower mechanical resistances of up to 140 N/mm. However, using flux conduced to 220 N/mm maximal mechanical resistance. For this kind of interaction solid/liquid), using an Al- 12 Si filler wire allows to obtained also 180 N/mm mechanical strengths on non-galvanized steels using a <b>brazing</b> <b>flux.</b> Same characteristics are obtained in the reaction layers composition with a decrease in maximal layer thickness under 1 µm compared to the 2 - 40 µm thickness obtained without filler wire.

However high-concentration flux {{needs to be}} applied only to a necessary spot. In general, high-concentration flux is manually applied for conventional brazing furnaces, resulting in low production efficiency and harmful environments for workers due to particles and heat etc. Therefore an economical and efficient automatic spreading system needs to be developed.

The advantage of this method is that it reduces the high labor and skill requirement of manual brazing. The use of flux is also required for this method as there is no protective atmosphere, and it is best suited to small to medium production volumes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Brazing {{generally}} require cumbersome apparatus be it induction, vacuum or torch brazing. In torch brazing, metals {{are joined}} by using the oxyacetylene cylinder. It thus becomes difficult to carry out brazing at the places where {{it is not possible}} to take heavy gas cylinders and brazing apparatuses. So it is tried to figure out the method to carry out brazing at places where conventional brazing is not feasible. And thus Brazing was done by usual Shielded Metal Arc Welding, by developing the electrode composition for the joining process of three different kinds of metals and alloys, without using the oxyacetylene cylinder and other heavy brazing apparatus. The results show that this newly developed brazing method gave almost same appropriate welding results as it is given by the conventional <b>brazing</b> method. <b>Flux</b> composition is determined to braze three combinations of metals and alloys � Aluminium and Copper � Galvanized iron and copper � Galvanized iron and aluminium Index Terms- Brazing filler material, base metal, Flux compositions, welding B I...|$|R
50|$|Unless brazing {{operations}} are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax {{is required to}} prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the <b>brazing</b> surfaces. <b>Flux</b> can be applied {{in any number of}} forms including flux paste, liquid, powder or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal powder. Flux can also be applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper.Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active <b>fluxes</b> than short <b>brazing</b> operations.|$|R
40|$|Manual brazing, {{as it is}} {{used today}} in the {{manufacture}} of automobile bodywork, can be of variable quality and may be responsible for thermal damage to both base material and filler metal. Reworking is often necessary, but the need for this expensive and time-consuming process can be minimised by the automation of the brazing procedure. If Nd:YAG-lasers are used as heat sorce for brazing, the laser energy can be controlled with ease and specific temperature fields can be set up. Fibre-optic laser routing also makes it easy to integrate the technology into manufacturing systems. The goal of this project was the systematic development and optimisation of process controls and associated systems technology for automated flux-free brazing using double-beam laser technology. The system developed in the project was designed to handle modern bodywork materials (DC 04; DC 04 +ZE) and materials for lightweight construction (AlMg 0, 4 Sil, 2; AlMg 5 W 17) as well as aluminium alloys in combination with construction steels. The highest brazing quality was achieved with L-CuZn 40 and L-Ag 55 Sn filler metals. The use of 95 % N_ 2 and 5 % H_ 2 as a protection gas allowed flux-free brazing. If allowances are made for capillary action and gravity, it is possible to produce high quality joints using laser brazing and spacial seam-orientation. It is advantageous to use on-line process controls for the processing of critical contours. In flux-free laser brazing of aluminium alloys, an additional pulsed Nd:YAG-laser is used to modify the surface activity, making the surface more wettable to the filler metal. The different heat dispersal coefficients of aluminium and its oxide coat lead to disruption of this oxide layer and enable the filler metal to wet the surface. Combinations of construction steel and aluminium alloy can be <b>brazed</b> without <b>flux</b> by using the reducing gas and a zinc-based solder which is capable of wetting both materials. (orig.)

40|$|This {{work has}} {{developed}} new brazing alloys for joining mild steel to mild steel (SAE 1018) {{at a lower}} temperature. The alloys blends and error analysis were done by experimental design software (Design Expert 8. 0. 7. 1). Design of experiments was done by Scheffe quadratic mixture method. The liquidus temperatures were predicted by calculation of phase diagrams of the alloying metals. The brazing alloys were produced by gravity technique and melted using silicon carbide graphite crucible. The quality of the brazing alloys was analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} (FT-IR). Brazed joints were produced by torch method with a commercial <b>flux.</b> <b>Brazing</b> temperatures (liquidus) were tracked by a digital infrared/laser pyrometer. Some mechanical properties studied were tensile strength and hardness. Finally, brazed joints produced from the developed brazing alloys were compared to that produced from muntz brass. Six (6) brazing alloys were successfully developed. Zinc and manganese were the main components, to which were added; 3 to 4 %wt silver and 11 to 15 %wt modifying element. The microstructure showed a typical eutectic structure with zinc-rich phase distributed uniformly in the matrix with a combination of different sizes of dendrite, rounded blocks of compounds and hypoeutectic structures. AAS results indicated minimal out-gassing of zinc and FT-IR results indicated very low presence of atmospheric gas. The range of brazing temperature for best results was recorded from 690. 90 to 735. 10 0 C.
