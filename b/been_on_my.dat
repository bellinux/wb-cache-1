500|$|Many {{other artists}} have covered the song. Joan Baez, who has {{sometimes}} been speculated {{to be the subject}} of the song, covered it on her 1965 album Farewell, Angelina. It is one of four Dylan covers on that album, the others being the title track, [...] "Mama, You <b>Been</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Mind" [...] (recorded as [...] "Daddy, You <b>Been</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Mind"), and [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall". Baez sings [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in a falsetto voice, but retains the power of Dylan's version. Baez has continued to perform the song at live concerts well into the modern era.|$|E
500|$|To {{play the}} part of Pinker, cast {{director}} Rick Millikan read a number of actors. At the last minute, Millikan {{decided to make a}} call to noted actor John Diehl, famous for his work in Nixon, Stargate, and Miami Vice. Millikan explained that, [...] " [...] had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> list to put into the show since Day One. [...] It turned out the producers like him too—he'd read for us a couple of times already—and {{we were able to get}} him in without even a reading".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E

500|$|Make-up effects artist Toby Lindala was {{tasked with}} {{creating}} a prop {{which would allow}} actress Sarah Koskoff to simulate a nosebleed on-camera, rather than {{through the use of}} off-screen make-up and editing tricks. However, during test shots, the prop's tubing burst, causing the stage blood to begin dripping down Koskoff's forehead, rather than from her nose. Gillian Anderson has expressed displeasure over the scene in which her character, Dana Scully, visits Fox Mulder in his motel room in her underwear to have him examine a suspicious wound which turns out to be insect bites. The actress felt that the scene was too gratuitous, saying [...] "there really wasn't a reason for it. The bites could have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder or something." [...] However, Carter has explained that the scene was simply intended to highlight the platonic relationship between the two lead roles.|$|E
500|$|On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht {{invaded the}} Low Countries and France under the codename Fall Gelb. JG 27 {{supported}} German {{forces in the}} Battle for Belgium. On {{the third day of}} the offensive, 12 May 1940, [...] west of Liege, Belgium, at a height of about , flying a Messerschmitt Bf 109, Galland, with Gustav Rödel as his wingman, claimed his first aerial victories, over two Royal Air Force (RAF) Hawker Hurricanes. Both aircraft were from No. 87 Squadron. The Hurricanes had been escorting Bristol Blenheim bombers to bomb bridges in the Netherlands. [...] Galland remembered; [...] "My first kill was child's play. An excellent weapon and luck had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side. To be successful, the best fighter pilot needs both"— Galland pursued one of the [...] "scattering" [...] Hurricanes and shot down another at low level. The pilot, a Canadian, Flying Officer Jack Campbell was killed.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film four stars {{out of four}} and said: [...] "The film offers one sensational {{sequence}} after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues." [...] Ebert also added, [...] "had I not been prevented from seeing it sooner because of an injury, this would have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> year's best films list." [...] Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film five stars, writing: [...] "I can only say Django delivers, wholesale, that particular narcotic and delirious pleasure that Tarantino still knows how to confect in the cinema, {{something to do with}} the manipulation of surfaces. It's as unwholesome, deplorable and delicious as a forbidden cigarette." [...] Writing in The New York Times, critic A. O. Scott compared Django to Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds: [...] "Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness." [...] Designating the film a Times [...] "critics" [...] pick, Scott said Django is [...] "a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism." [...] Filmmaker Michael Moore praised Django, tweeting that the movie [...] "is one of the best film satires ever. A rare American movie on slavery and the origins of our sick racist history." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{references}} to Baez in Dylan's songs {{are far less}} clear. Baez herself has suggested {{that she was the}} subject of both [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] and [...] "Mama, You <b>Been</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Mind", although the latter was more likely about his relationship with Suze Rotolo. Baez implied when speaking about the connection to Diamonds and Rust that [...] "Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts" [...] is, at least in part, a metaphor for Dylan's view of his relationship with her. As for [...] "Visions of Johanna", [...] "She Belongs to Me", and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez, neither Dylan nor biographers such as Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray have had anything definitive to say, either way, regarding the subject of these songs.|$|E
