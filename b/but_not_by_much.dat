25|$|Bruckner's symphonies are scored for {{a fairly}} {{standard}} orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, {{two or three}} trumpets, three trombones, tuba (from the second version of the Fourth), timpani and strings. The later symphonies increase this complement, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> Notable {{is the use of}} Wagner tubas in his last three symphonies. Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the Seventh is supposed to have a cymbal crash at the exact moment Wagner died). Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the pipe organ, i.e., alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.|$|E
25|$|By 1858, {{the turnpike}} had {{basically}} begun to fold, with tolls only being charged at one gate {{for several years}} as most traffic had moved to rails rather than road. That year however, there were some upgrades made to the road, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> In 1867, the competitor Camden and Amboy Railroad merged with the United New Jersey Railroad {{to create a new}} company. In December 1871, that company then became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, {{which was one of the}} major railroads at that point. The railroad also took over jurisdiction of the turnpike. In 1899, people from Trenton and nearby Penns Neck approached the railroad to help reconstruct the old turnpike road, but no full proposal ever came forward. By 1903, the 1804 charter had expired, and the roadway was placed under public control, but was still in a derelict condition.|$|E

However, by then, the second episode was not yet written, and series producer Kudos were due to deliver the story to the BBC in one month. As a result, the episode was brought forward to the second slot. Since the first episode began Spooks [...] "with a bang", series creator and writer David Wolstencroft, was under pressure to top the efforts of the first episode with the second, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> During the writing stage, he introduced a story arc involving Danny Hunter and his obsession with money and spending, apparently mirroring the writer; the arc was created for the temptations that the officers may have. In the original screenplay, Danny was to spend on his mother.|$|E

[...] What Prof. Pattengill's estate might have been had he devoted the intellect, force, persistence and energy that he abundantly demonstrated in his career to those professions or activities whose ideal if flatly the accumulation of wealth makes interesting speculation. ... Prof. Pattengill was much more than senior professor of Greek. [...] He was a classicist and an educator of national reputation. ... Does the spectacle of such a reward as this induce the student deliberately to choose the career of scholar with its dignified penury in these days of great salaries and satisfying dividends? ...

[...] The faculty {{of the university of}} Michigan is a little more grievously underpaid than other institutions, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> [...] It is the tendency of the times to overlook the modest needs of the scholar in the rush after ideals that are overtaken by daring." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{feed-in tariff}} can {{differentiate}} {{on the basis}} of marginal cost. This is a theoretical alternative which is based on the concept of price differentiation (Finon).
