50|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinets</b> (BSC), first commercially {{available}} in 1950, are fairly common devices {{designed to provide}} effective primary biocontainment in laboratories working with highly infectious agents.

40|$|Overall {{contamination}} (on- plus off-streak) of the Isolator (Du Pont Co.) {{blood culture}} tube (23 %) {{was greater than}} that of a conventional broth blood culture bottle (0. 6 %) or that of a biphasic blood culture bottle (1. 3 %). To determine the source of this contamination, Isolator cultures of blood from 59 healthy volunteers and of sterile broth from 60 vials were made. A total of 37 % of the blood cultures and 22 % of the broth cultures were contaminated (P = 0. 06). Staphylococcus epidermidis-contaminated cultures represented 31 and 10 % of the blood and broth cultures, respectively (P = 0. 06). Contamination of plates processed on a bench top, in front of horizontal laminar flow, and in a <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> with vertical laminar flow were compared.

The contamination rate for 7, 874 Isolator blood cultures processed in the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> was significantly decreased to 6. 7 % on-streak (9. 3 % on- plus off-streak). Contamination of Isolator-processed blood cultures originated from the laboratory and the patient.

40|$|The <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> is the {{one piece}} of {{laboratory}} and pharmacy equipment that provides protection for personnel, the product, and the environment. Through the history of laboratory-acquired infections from the earliest published case {{to the emergence of}} hepatitis B and AIDS, the need for health care worker protection is described. A brief description with design, construction, function, and production capabilities is provided for class I and class III <b>safety</b> <b>cabinets.</b> The development of the high-efficiency particulate air filter provided the impetus for clean room technology, from which evolved the class II laminar flow <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet.</b> The clean room concept was advanced when the horizontal airflow clean bench was manufactured; it became popular in pharmacies for preparing intravenous solutions because the product was protected. However, as with infectious microorganisms and laboratory workers, individual sensitization to antibiotics and the advent of hazardous antineoplastic agents changed the thinking of pharmacists and nurses, and they began to use the class II <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> to prevent adverse personnel reactions to the drugs. How the class II <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> became the mainstay in laboratories and pharmacies is described, and insight is provided into the formulation of National Sanitation Foundation standard number 49 and its revisions. The working operations of a class II cabinet are described, as are the variations of the four types with regard to design, function, air velocity profiles, and the use of toxins. The main certification procedures are explained, with examples of improper or incorrect certifications. The required levels of containment for microorganisms are given. Instructions for decontaminating the class II <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> of infectious agents are provided; unfortunately, there is no method for decontaminating the cabinet of antineoplastic agents...|$|R
40|$|A <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> {{was tested}} to {{determine}} the effect of crossdrafts (such as those created by normal laboratory activity or ventilation) upon the ability of the cabinet to protect both experiments and investigators. A simple crossdraft, controllable from 50 to 200 feet per min (fpm; 15. 24 to 60. 96 m/min), was created across the face of the unit. Modifications of standardized procedures involving controlled bacterial aerosol challenges provided stringent test conditions. Results indicated that, as the crossflow velocities exceeded 100 fpm, the ability of the cabinet to protect either experiments or investigators decreased logarithmically with increasing crossdraft speed. Because 100 fpm is an airspeed easily achieved by some air conditioning and heating vents (open windows and doorways may create velocities far in excess of 200 fpm), the proper placement of a <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> within the laboratory [...] away from such disruptive air currents [...] is essential to satisfactory cabinet performance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> is {{commonly}} employed to protect both user and product in {{an increasing number}} of biotechnology applications. It is recommended that cabinets be fully certified annually, but given the requirements of good laboratory manufacturing practices, more frequent, less disruptive user checks of equipment may be desirable. Furthermore, annual field certifications only determine that cabinets meet basic design and performance parameters and cannot reveal all issues unique to a particular cabinet. This study describes the development of a novel inlaboratory test method using common biotechnology tools that is capable of assessing bioaerosols containment as well as cabinet-specific lateral motion of bioaerosols potentially responsible for product crosscontamination. Genetically engineered viable bacteria releases, followed by colony recovery and gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction, constitute the essence of the new approach. Specifically, a nebulizer was used to release a bioaerosol within a cabinet. Single-stage bioaerosol samplers were simultaneously used to sample the challenge bioaerosol containing bacteria engineered with a plasmid conferring Kanamycin resistance. Recovered challenge bacteria were grown on media containing the antibiotic, and the presence of a DNA fragment in the bacterial plasmid was confirmed. Results demonstrated that there was detectable lateral motion of bioaerosols within the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> <b>cabinet</b> tested. The importance of such lateral motion to product cross-contamination is discussed, as are the applications for this novel testing method.

The inactivation of 10 (6. 5) median cell culture infective doses (CCID 50 of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus per milliliter represented a reduction of 99. 99997 % of the viral particles from the control levels of 10 (7. 25 - 7. 5) CCID 50 /ml.

Analysis by polynomial regression of the logarithmic values for both ozone concentrations and percent reduction of viral titers had a highly significant r 2 of 0. 8 (F = 63. 6; df = 1, 16).
