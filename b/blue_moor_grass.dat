50|$|The {{western side}} of Kisdon has been {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) over an area of 3.7 hectares since 1988. The SSSI {{takes the form of}} four grazed enclosures with the combination of Calcareous grassland growing on limestone rock supporting exceptional and varied botanical species. The steepest of the enclosures has a considerable population of Juniperus communis which has survived since the last Ice age and appears to be regenerating. Other species include Sesleria albicans (<b>blue</b> <b>moor</b> <b>grass),</b> Carex pulicaris (flea sedge), Galium sterneri (limestone bedstraw), Orchis mascula (early purple orchid) and Primula vulgaris (primrose) amongst others.|$|E
40|$|Evaporation from a cutover {{raised bog}} in The Netherlands was {{modelled}} using a detailed, physically based evaporation model for heterogeneous vegetation and unsaturated soil water flow "SWAPS". The model enables a quantification {{of the role}} of heterogeneity on evaporation. Micro-meteorological measurements above a vegetation of Molinia caerulea (purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass)</b> in the cutover raised bog "Engbertsdijksvenen" are used for calibration and validation of the model. In the present study, it is investigated how small scale heterogeneity affects the prediction of evaporation. Therefore, two hypothetical variants, which represent two possible types of small scale heterogeneity in peatlands, are evaluated: (1) peatland in which drainage has resulted in a vegetation cover of 50 % purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass</b> and 50 % birch, (2) peatland in which after rewetting the vegetation consists of 50 % purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass</b> and 50 % Sphagnum mosses. The results show that characteristics of the evaporation from purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass</b> in the two variants are dissimilar. The evaporation from purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass,</b> forming the lower components of a vegetation stand (variant 1), can be accurately predicted via radiation based models. In case purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass</b> is the exposed part of the vegetation (variant 2), such models are not likely to predict the evaporation from purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass</b> correctly. An exposed, aerodynamically rough vegetation requires a model that accounts for the vapour pressure deficit as well...|$|R

40|$|In {{the most}} highly {{contaminated}} region of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: the 'Red Forest' site, the accumulation of the major dose-affecting radionuclides ({sup 90 }Sr and {sup 137 }Cs) within the components of an ecological system encompassing 3, 000 m{sup 2 } were characterized. The sampled components included soils (top 0 - 10 cm depth), Molina caerulea (<b>blue</b> <b>moor</b> <b>grass),</b> Camponotus vagus (carpenter ants) and Pelobates fuscus (spade-footed toad). In a comparison among the components of this ecosystem, the {sup 90 }Sr and {sup 137 }Cs concentrations measured in 40 separate grids exhibited significant differences, while the frequency distribution of the values were close to a logarithmically normal leptokurtic distribution with a significant right-side skew. While {{it is important to}} identify localized areas of high contamination or 'hot spots,' including these values in the arithmetic mean may overestimate the exposure risk. In component sample sets that exhibited logarithmically normal distribution, the geometrical mean more accurately characterizes a site. Ideally, risk assessment is most confidently achieved when the arithmetic and geometrical means are most similar, meaning the distribution approaches normal. Through bioaccumulation, the highest concentrations of {sup 90 }Sr and {sup 137 }Cs were measured in the <b>blue</b> <b>moor</b> <b>grass</b> and spade-footed toad. These components also possessed distribution parameters that shifted toward a normal distribution...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{grassland}} Sites of Special Scientific Interest on the Magnesian Limestone of County Durham were botanically surveyed {{using the}} methodology of the National Vegetation Classification. Both primary grasslands and grassland developed in abandoned quarries were included, but the sampling was limited to open calcicolous grassland and scrub-invaded grassland, with areas of impenetrable scrub and woodland being avoided. Characteristic of these grasslands is <b>blue</b> <b>moor</b> <b>grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, which reaches its southern lowland limit in County Durham. The results were analysed using multivariate techniques to reveal patterns in community composition and possible environmental factors causing this variation. Six main communities are described, comprising both grassland and scrub vegetation. A successional sequence linking these communities and their sub-communities is postulated. It is suggested that abandoned quarries are floristically different from primary grasslands, but may achieve similarity in time {{if there is a}} nearby seed source of S. albicans. Scrub invasion, mainly by hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna, is ubiquitous in both the primary and secondary grasslands and presents the major threat to the integrity of the limestone flora. The botanical survey reveals a significant change to the flora under scrub, with some of the low-growing calcicoles being partially replaced by tall nutrient-demanding grasses and herbaceous species. However, the invasion of willow (Salix spp.) at one of the abandoned quarries has had negligible impact on the ground flora. The two most common scrub species, hawthorn and dog rose (Rosa canina agg.) appear to have more influence on the ground flora than any other species. It is suggested that the age of these species is more important than density in altering the ground flora. The results of this investigation have been used to make tentative suggestions for management of the sites...|$|E

40|$|A two-year reptile {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in a heathland {{in the north of}} the Netherlands, using artificial refuges placed in different habitats. The studied habitats differed in their botanical composition and physical structure. Five reptile species were recorded: slow worm (Anguis fragilis), viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), grass snake (Natrix natrix) and adder (Viperu berus). Randomization tests were applied to assess the relationship between the presence of reptile species and habitat. Highest numbers of reptiles were found in habitats with a combination of common heather and purple <b>moor</b> <b>grass,</b> whereas habitats with common rush scored the lowest.
