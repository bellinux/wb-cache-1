Abstract: A conceptual model that accounts for the influence of pore geometry is needed to obtain soil water <b>conductivity</b> from <b>bulk</b> soil <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivity</b> measurements in unsaturated soils.

The model with only one free parameter can describe the measured data. Predictions indicate a large dependence of the model outcome on the value of the fitting parameter.

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of <b>bulk</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivity</b> with {{time domain reflectometry}} (TDR) requires calibration or direct measurement of the probe constant and the cable resistance. The aims {{of this study were}} threefold. First, the accuracy of an analytical expression for the direct {{determination of}} the probe constant was evaluated for three TDR probe designs by comparing the analytical result with the probe constant obtained by calibration to TDR measurements in solutions with varying electrical conductivity. Second, the accuracy of direct measurement of cable resistance was compared with the accuracy that can be achieved by calibrating this resistance. The uncertainty in directly measured and calibrated probe and cable properties was determined in a Monte Carlo analysis. The results showed that the analytical expression for the probe constant and calibration of the probe constant do not provide significantly different estimates when the uncertainty in both approaches is considered; however, the uncertainty in the calibrated probe constants was lower than or similar to the uncertainty in the direct measurements. Directly measured and calibrated cable resistance differed, which was attributed to recording time issues. It was concluded that calibration of probe and cable parameters should be preferred over direct measurements to achieve accurate <b>bulk</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivity</b> measurements. The final aim {{of this study was to}} quantify how the various sources of uncertainty identified in this study affect the accuracy of TDR bulk conductivity measurements.

40|$|The cores of {{high-grade}} {{nickel and}} copper sulphides appear as "perfect conductors" to most electromagnetic (EM) and airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems, {{because they have}} <b>bulk</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivities</b> {{of the order of}} 100, 000 S/m. The EM response of these highly conductive cores is essentially undetectable with off-time measurements or when using nonrigid towed-bird systems. Compact AEM systems with accurate primary field bucking and on-time or in-phase measurements are sensitive to perfect conductors, but are incapable of detecting deep targets. Using a GPS system to define geometry, calculations suggest that it should be easy for an AEM system to detect "perfect conductors" provided the receiver was several hundred meters distant from the transmitter. A twin (Gemini) aircraft test was undertaken to test this concept in 2005. The field test successfully demonstrated detection of very conductive targets. Errors associated with geometric changes were better than 0. 5 % of the primary field at 400 m separation, allowing detection and characterization of the 30 Hz, in-phase response of small and extended conductors.

40|$|Metallic {{contacts}} are a ubiquitous {{method of}} connecting electrical and electronic components/systems. These contacts are usually fabricated from base metals {{because they are}} inexpensive, have high <b>bulk</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivities</b> and exhibit excellent formability. Unfortunately, such base metals oxidize in air under ambient conditions, and {{the characteristics of the}} native oxide scales leads to contact resistances orders of magnitude higher than those for mating bare metal surface. This is a critical technological issue since the development of unacceptably high contact resistances over time is now by far {{the most common cause of}} failure in electrical/electronic devices and systems. To overcome these problems, several distinct approaches are developed for alloying base metals to promote the formation of self-healing inherently conductive native oxide scales. The objective of this dissertation study is to demonstrate the viability of these approaches through analyzing the data from Cu- 9 La (at%) and Fe-V binary alloy systems. The Cu- 9 La alloy structure consists of eutectic colonies tens of microns in diameter wherein a rod-like Cu phase lies within a Cu 6 La matrix phase. The thin oxide scale formed on the Cu phase was found to be Cu 2 O as expected while the thicker oxide scale formed on the Cu 6 La phase was found to be a polycrystalline La-rich Cu 2 O. The enhanced <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivity</b> in the native oxide scale of the Cu- 9 La alloy arises from heavy n-type doping of the Cu 2 O lattice by La 3 +. The Fe-V alloy structures consist of a mixture of large elongated and equiaxed grains. A thin polycrystalline Fe 3 O 4 oxide scale formed on all of the Fe-V alloys. The <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivities</b> of the oxide scales formed on the Fe-V alloys are higher than that formed on pure Fe. It is inferred that this enhanced conductivity arises from doping of the magnetite with V+ 4 which promotes electron-polaron hopping.
