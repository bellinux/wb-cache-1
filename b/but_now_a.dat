25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} year of operations, the {{partners}} had made a modest profit of $1,000, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> dispute broke out over how to employ the money. Roach wanted to use it to expand the business, but his three partners voted to divide it into dividends of $250 each. Realizing that they had reached the limit of their ambition, Roach took out a mortgage on the property and used the loan to buy his partners out, thus becoming sole proprietor.|$|E

25|$|The {{last three}} {{counties}} all have associations with another county; Huntingdonshire with Cambridgeshire, Rutland with Leicestershire and Westmorland with Cumberland. Huntingdonshire is sometimes {{considered one of}} the Minor Counties because, even though it has never played within the Minor Counties Championship, it has its own individual Cricket Board and played in the English domestic one-day competition, between the years 1999 and 2003. The Isle of Wight, historically a part of Hampshire <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> county in its own right, also has its own individual Cricket Board and has aspirations to play as a Minor County in the future.|$|E
25|$|The Ludlow Advertiser {{was founded}} in 1855 by John Crosse, with its {{original}} offices at 18 King Street. New premises for the Advertiser were constructed in 1914 on Upper Galdeford, still called the Advertiser Buildings, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> fast-food outlet. It has published an edition weekly ever since, though is now the Ludlow and Tenbury Wells Advertiser and published from the Hereford Times offices in Hereford, with an editor based in Birmingham. In 2010 the area's free weekly newspaper, the Ludlow Journal, stopped being published and was absorbed into its paid-for sister, the South Shropshire Journal. The Shropshire Star - with its related publication the South Shropshire Journal - is published in Ketley but has an office in Ludlow, at The Angel on Broad Street, which to date remains open but without a reception desk.|$|E
25|$|Guam has no native {{amphibian}} species, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> {{total of}} eight amphibian species {{has been established}} in Guam. Litoria fallax (native to the eastern coast of Australia) has been present in Guam since 1968, and Rhinella marina (the cane toad) was brought to the island in 1937. The other 6 amphibian species, namely Hylarana guentheri (native to mainland Asia), Microhyla pulchra (native to mainland Asia), Polypedates braueri (endemic to Taiwan), Eleutherodactylus planirostris (native to the Caribbean), Fejervarya cancrivora (the Guam variety being most closely related to F. cancrivora found in Taiwan), and Fejervarya limnocharis (native to Southeast Asia), have been in Guam since 2003. Many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo, especially from Taiwan, mainland China, and Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|Since 1989, the PRMCC {{has tended}} over 30 rescue and {{rehabilitation}} cases of manatees in Puerto Rico, and offered assistance {{to more than}} two dozen cases in the Caribbean (British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico, Turks and Caicos, and Venezuela), the Amazon (Peru and Colombia), Taiwan and Gabon, Africa. In Puerto Rico, four manatees have been immediately released after rescue, three have been released after rehabilitation (Moisés, Rafael and Tuque) and four are at present in rehabilitation (Guacara, Aramaná, Yuisa and Tureygua). Aramaná and Yuisa are slated for release in early 2016, while Tureygua has two more years of rehabilitation before it is considered a candidate for release. Guacara, originally from Florida, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> permanent resident of the PRMCC, can not be release back to the wild due to floatability problems caused by a boat injury to its right lung in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Still another {{possibility}} is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value {{may or may not be}} copied to I on each iteration. Again, modifications of I would not affect the control of the loop, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of I might be to the (possibly altered) current value of I or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element I of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if I is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a print-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable I instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.|$|E
25|$|At Saxilby, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway {{crosses the}} waterway, to {{run along the}} south bank {{all the way to}} Lincoln. There was once a swing bridge beyond the railway bridge, which was removed in 1937, {{although}} the foundations are still obvious. Access over the canal at this point was re-instated in 1987, when a footbridge was installed. The original bridge was manufactured in 1884, and crossed the Great Northern Railway at Newark-on-Trent for 103 years before it was put to a new use. The A57 crosses to the north bank soon after the railway bridge. The River Till flows south and under the road to join the Fossdyke, after which a new marina has been built at Burton Meadows. Because the construction has breached the flood bank, it is protected by a flood gate. The canal crosses under the A46 road on the outskirts of Lincoln, and then over a drainage ditch, to run alongside the Carholme golf club. The final bridge carries the B1273 Brayford Way over the canal as it enters Brayford Pool, once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of Lincoln, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> marina with the University on the southern bank. The unnavigable River Witham flows into the bottom end of the pool, and becomes the Witham Navigation when it flows out on its way to Boston.|$|E

500|$|The {{retreat from}} Roxburgh exposed the king to {{questions}} regarding his {{control over his}} subjects, his military competence and his diplomatic abilities yet he remained determined {{to continue with the}} war against England. Just two months after the Roxburgh fiasco, James called a general council in October 1436 to finance further hostilities through more taxation. The estates firmly resisted this and their opposition was articulated by their speaker Sir Robert Graham, a former Albany attendant <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> servant of Atholl. The council then witnessed an unsuccessful attempt by Graham to arrest the king resulting in the knight's imprisonment followed by banishment but James did not see Graham's actions as part of any extended threat. [...] In January 1437, Atholl received yet another rebuff in his own heartlands when James overturned the chapter of Dunkeld Cathedral whose nominee was replaced by the king's nephew and firm supporter, James Kennedy.|$|E
500|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} specifically to burn coal from the Northumberland coalfields. The neighbouring Ellington Colliery originally fed coal directly to the power station using a conveyor belt from its Bewick Drift Mine, situated [...] from the station. Within a year of the power station opening, 3,000 men were employed between the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries, producing over two million tons of coal a year, the majority of it being sold to the power station. In 1994, Ellington Colliery connected underground with Lynemouth Colliery, but coal continued to be taken straight to the power station's coal sorting area using conveyor belts. This supply was supplemented by coal from local opencast mines. However, Ellington Colliery was forced to close when it flooded in January 2005. The station burned the colliery's remaining coal stock after it closed, and since then coal has been sourced from opencast mines in Northumberland and Scotland, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> small amount of import is necessary.|$|E
