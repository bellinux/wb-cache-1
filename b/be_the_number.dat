5|$|A Nielsen study {{conducted}} during the show's final season (196768) indicated the show ranked number one among blue collar workers followed by The Lucy Show and Gunsmoke. Among white collar workers, the show ranked number three following Saturday Movies and The Dean Martin Show. The Andy Griffith Show {{is one of only}} three shows to have its final season <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> one ranked show on television, the other two being I Love Lucy and Seinfeld. In 1998, more than five million people a day watched the show's reruns on 120 stations.|$|E
5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of times n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many}} times it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and Canada, Tower Heist {{opened in}} 3,367 theaters. The film took $85,000 from midnight {{screenings}} {{and a total}} of $8.5million opening Friday, becoming the number one grossing film for the day. Although the film had been expected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> one film for the weekend, it took $10.5million on the opening Saturday, falling behind the animated film Puss in Boots ($15.3million). Tower Heist became the number two film for the weekend with $24million, behind Puss in Boots ($34million), with 70% of the audience being over the age of 25—the largest segment, 27%, being over 50—and 56% male. The opening audience was ethnically diverse consisting of 48% Caucasian, 21% African American, and 21% Hispanic.|$|E
5|$|Liz becomes furious when Jack {{decides that}} Tracy should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> one {{priority}} on The Girlie Show. Jenna fears that Tracy {{will begin to}} overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard her say terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} anything he wanted to do on The Original Series but could not. A further change was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E

5|$|With the {{off-season}} acquisition of Mitch Clark in the 2011 trade period, who was projected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> one {{forward in the}} team, the forward load {{was expected to be}} relieved off of Watts, who new coach, Mark Neeld, stated would play primarily as a forward alongside Clark, rather than as both a forward and back as was the case the previous season. He struggled for form during the 2012 NAB Cup where he had just three combined possessions in the first two matches against Brisbane and Gold Coast, before he was substituted out of the match against Collingwood the next week where he managed just seven disposals, which drew the ire of former Collingwood coach, Mick Malthouse, who said he lacked ambition when playing. He was subsequently omitted for the final pre-season match against Port Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Chyna {{became the}} first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first female to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> one {{contender}} for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good Housekeeping match, on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the lineage of the title would have been broken.|$|E
