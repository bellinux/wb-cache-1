25|$|Believer {{was formed}} in Colebrook, Pennsylvania in 1986 by drummer Joey Daub and vocalist-guitarist Kurt Bachman. The band was joined by Howe Kraft (bass) and David Baddorf (guitar). They began playing melodic metal and {{released}} the cassette The Return in 1987. Later, Believer changed its style to thrash metal, as the band said: ”We realized that we could write thrash <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> could write anything else”.|$|E
25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> did as a rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that sounds more like the music I listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|Only the {{flagship}} New York managed to match British practice in both categories. In Admiral Beatty's words, {{the results were}} [...] "distinctly poor and disappointing", and {{led him to the}} initial conclusion that he could not consider the American division the equivalent of a British one. The Americans worked to catch up, however, and with every target practice registered improved results. By the end of June 1918, Admiral Rodman was able to report that [...] "the firing was exceptionally fine, most encouraging and much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> have ever done previously".|$|E

[...] Umpire Mike Sweeney was unperturbed: [...] "They were both fighting for the same water. [...] That {{is not a question}} of disqualification." [...] Cambridge's Story said his crew were confident before the race: [...] "We were never in doubt that we would win" [...] and despite the record time, he remarked [...] "We can row a lot better than that." ...|$|E

500|$|The strongest {{hurricane}} {{to directly}} affect Bermuda since 2003's Hurricane Fabian, Gonzalo was generally less destructive. Damage modelling firms estimated insured losses from the hurricane to settle between US$200and US$400million, not including damage to watercraft, though the CEO {{of the largest}} property insurer on Bermuda believed losses to be much lower. It was estimated that a Fabian equivalence in 2014 would cause about US$650 million in damage. Some insurance companies decided to treat Fay and Gonzalo as a single event, allowing one deductible to count toward claims from both storms. After initial assessments, Premier Dunkley reported that the territory fared [...] "much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> expected", and the storm was not blamed for any deaths or major injuries on Bermuda.|$|E
500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far better off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war and the familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them." [...] According to Sarah Larson of The New Yorker, [...] "Sansa watches calmly, then smiles. You've come a long way, baby. Or she's become a monster, and so have I. The women of Westeros are on the warpath." ...|$|E

500|$|Tonight {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The album has a total score of 70/100 on Metacritic, based on 32 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". It {{did not receive}} the amount of critical acclaim their first two studio albums received. Critics often praised the album's sound and the instrumentation of the songs on the album. The album's sound was also subject to criticism by some critics, {{as well as the}} lyrics and album production. Clash magazine commented that it could be [...] "the band's most complete work to date. Worth the wait, and in all honesty <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> could ever have hoped for." [...] The Financial Post states that [...] "Tonight is the band's best album: Paradoxically, they've allowed themselves a degree of release from their characteristic tension by creating structures within which they can cut loose." [...] The Telegraph commented on how Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is a melody-packed re-affirmation of everything that has made the band so popular hitherto, but with a highly contemporary-sounding, keyboard-driven edge. The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one. Smart and danceable, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand proves that Franz Ferdinand are the masters of dance-rock." [...] NBC commented on how 'Franz Ferdinand has once again managed to outdo themselves with their best album to date.' ...|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{called the}} 1952 Sugar Bowl the second [...] "game of the century," [...] {{with the first}} having been between the undefeated Army and Notre Dame teams in 1946. The Associated Press called it {{possibly}} [...] "the greatest bowl game of them all." [...] Tennessee was a period powerhouse and its roster included five All-Americans. Maryland {{was viewed as a}} heavy underdog going into the game. Terrapins halfback Chet Hanulak said, [...] "Nobody expected us to get that far. But Jim Tatum was a coach who could work wonders." [...] After mechanical issues delayed Maryland's flight, the team became the first to practice at night for a Sugar Bowl.

2500|$|Having {{returned}} to the UK from the United States in August 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour {{at the time of}} the UK's Punk rock explosion. The band's 1977 album Whatever Happened to Slade proved a commercial failure while their tour that spring had shown that they could no longer fill large venues. Slade's waning success soon led to the band taking any gig they could. They found themselves playing small venues, mainly universities and clubs. The band's tours often ran at a loss, with the band having to bring their own PA and lightshow. Bassist Jim Lea however was unphazed. [...] "I still thought the band was great," [...] he told Chris Charlesworth in 1983, [...] "We were playing as well if not <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> ever had... now we had something to prove again." ...|$|E

In addition to Ruddock witnessing Ueshiba first hand {{on a couple of}} hundred occasions, he took extra private lessons, firstly from Kobayashi and then Ichihashi. In his memoir Ruddock recalled Ueshiba intervening when Ichihashi became overly zealous in his throws but also fondly remembered many aspects of the latters instruction and in particular advice Ichihashi provided {{as he was about to}} return to Ireland: [...] " [...] Remember, all these things like bowing and sitting in seiza are Japanese – not Aikido. You know <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> do how to teach foreigners. When you go back home, respect the ways of your country, remember to teach Aikido your way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played Warwickshire at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Warwickshire {{had been}} set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as {{unacceptable}} time-wasting and gamesmanship. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, M.J.K. Smith, [...] "Bad luck, Mike, you played <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> did. But I couldn't give you the game." [...] Smith appeared to accept this when he replied, [...] "I quite understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|A gale {{damaged the}} roof of the {{grandstand}} at the Coventry Road ground; fortunately, the next day's match was away, at Blackpool, and the damage was repaired before Small Heath played at home again. Blackpool took the lead after only five minutes, but their cause was hindered soon afterwards when they lost Harry Stirzaker to a head injury early in the game, and Tom Oakes scored twice as Small Heath exploited their numerical advantage to win 3–1. January ended with the first-round FA Cup tie played in heavy sleet at home to against Second Division leaders Notts County. In the first half, Notts were largely on the defensive, but early in the second, they twice forced the ball home. Small Heath pressed again, and Walton scored, but they were unable to equalise. The Owl reported they suffered [...] "cruel luck", that Notts' victory owed much to George Toone's goalkeeping, and that [...] "the attack was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> have seen it this season."
