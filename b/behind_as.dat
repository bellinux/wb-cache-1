5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water {{that had been left}} at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Adam West deploys {{the entire}} Quahog Police Department to Cartagena, Colombia {{to search for}} Elaine Wilder (a fictional {{character}} from the film Romancing the Stone which he was watching), leaving Joe <b>behind</b> (<b>as</b> he was not deployed due to his disability {{and the fact that}} parts of Cartagena aren't wheelchair-accessible) with the police station's skeleton crew. Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire join the department to assist Joe.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{settlement}} in villages, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting {{grounds for the}} bushcrow as they left loose, dung-covered soil <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> they moved their cattle. This provided a rich abundance of beetle larvae for the bushcrow to feed upon.|$|E

They could carry swords openly, and have their pistols hidden under their doublets." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{division}} {{took part}} in two brigade sized operations in Sicily, and an amphibious assault at Taranto in Italy. During the fighting in Italy, Major General Ernest Down became the divisional commander, after his predecessor, Major General Hopkinson, died of wounds received in the fighting. After service in the Mediterranean, the division returned to England in December 1943, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> an independent formation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a New Republic outpost where Katarn is {{training}} Jade, when Imperial forces attack the base. The player takes control of Katarn {{to defend the}} base from the stormtroopers {{and get to the}} command center. Once there, it is revealed that an evacuation cannot take place because of bombardment by large weapons from two nearby asteroids. Katarn leaves Jade <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> he travels to the asteroids to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|After , {{the road}} bent {{back to the}} east, leaving the {{woodlands}} <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> it passed south of the Miner Institute. The research complex led to another stretch of isolated homes along NY191, centered on the route's interchange with the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY191 entered the hamlet of Chazy, a small community located on the Little Chazy River. The route bypassed most of Chazy, skirting {{the northern edge of}} the hamlet as it headed northeast to a junction with US9. NY191 ended here while CR23 follows the state-maintained US9 south into downtown Chazy.|$|E

5|$|After rescuing Emilio, Gamma {{arranges}} to {{have the}} Ring of the Dead removed from his body by an old friend, mad scientist Nazna Gemini. The characters are brought to Gemini's lab by Angelle Cooney, a young girl {{with the power of}} teleportation. Once there, Gemini agrees to operate to remove the ring from Emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on Wolfina. Due to the series' early cancellation, Zombiepowder. is ended without a solid conclusion. The final chapter shows Gamma and Smith leaving Elwood and Wolfina <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> they depart the Gemini Laboratory, whose staff have just begun the operation to save Emilio. It is left ambiguous whether Elwood chooses to follow Gamma and Smith, stay with Wolfina and Emilio, or become a powder hunter in his own right.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving <b>behind,</b> <b>as</b> the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|Bok finally {{escaped from}} Giemma {{when he was}} 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police {{department}} to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> {{he walked into the}} crowded marketplace.|$|E

5|$|By 622, Heraclius {{was ready}} to mount a counter-offensive. He left Constantinople the day after celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622. His young son, Heraclius Constantine, was left <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> regent under the charge of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia. This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under Shahrbaraz to retreat from the front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A loop was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E

5|$|Del Piero {{then came}} on as a {{substitute}} in the 61st minute during Juventus's next Coppa Italia match on 27 August, against Napoli. Once again Juventus came from <b>behind,</b> <b>as</b> Del Piero scored twice to give his team the lead. The match eventually went to penalties; although Del Piero scored his spot-kick, Napoli won 5–4 in the penalty shoot-out. Despite starting {{the season with a}} nine-point penalty from the match-fixing scandal, Juventus gained promotion to Serie A as Serie B champions; Del Piero finished the league campaign as the top scorer of the 2006–07 Serie B season, with 20 goals. During the season, Del Piero also managed his 200th goal with Juventus on 21 October 2006, in a 1–0 league victory over Frosinone.|$|E
5|$|In a troop {{movement}} that took all {{night on a}} makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> protection, but Neill was adamant that the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish {{the day before the}} main battle Neill was severely wounded, and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength {{on the day of the}} main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Louise Nevelson {{was born}} Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Perislav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a {{contractor}} and lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson's relatives {{had begun to}} leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s. The Berliawskys had to stay <b>behind,</b> <b>as</b> Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father's departure that she became mute for six months.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{innovations}} attributed to Andriamanelo were not his personal invention. Rather, their origins {{can be traced}} back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Similarly, archaeological evidence proves the existence of iron implements in Madagascar at least four centuries prior to the war between Andriamanelo and the Vazimba, suggesting that while the technology was not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in Imerina to make wide-scale use of it in military campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{signed for}} League Two team Shrewsbury Town on 14 January 2008 on a one-and-a-half-year {{contract}} after training with the club, {{which included a}} clause that after making five appearances the contract could be renegotiated. He made his debut on 23 February 2008 in the 2–1 home defeat to Hereford United, finishing the 2007–08 season with three appearances, with his final match coming against Rochdale {{on the last day}} of the season. He was told that he did not figure in new manager Paul Simpson's immediate plans in July 2008, being left <b>behind</b> <b>as</b> the club travelled to Spain on a pre-season training camp.|$|E
5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard <b>behind.</b> <b>As</b> they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E
