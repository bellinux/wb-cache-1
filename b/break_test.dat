Another 2006 study, led by Simon Chapman, found that after this law was enacted in 1996 in Australia, the country went {{more than a decade}} without any mass shootings, and gun-related deaths (especially suicides) declined dramatically. The latter of these studies also criticized the former for using a time-series analysis despite the fact that, according to Chapman et al., [...] "calculating mortality rates and then treating them as a number in a time series ignores the natural variability inherent in the counts that make up the numerator of the rate." [...] Chapman et al. also said that Baker and McPhedran used the Box-Jenkins model inappropriately. A 2010 study looking at the effect of the NFA on gun-related deaths found that the law [...] "did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates," [...] although David Hemenway has criticized this study for using a structural <b>break</b> <b>test</b> despite the fact that such tests can miss the effects of policies in the presence of lags, or when the effect occurs over several years. Another study, published the same year, found that Australia's gun buyback program reduced gun-related suicide rates by almost 80%, while non-gun death rates were not significantly affected. Other research has argued that although gun suicide rates fell after the NFA was enacted, the NFA may not have been responsible for this decrease and [...] "a change in social and cultural attitudes" [...] may have instead been at least partly responsible. In 2016, Chapman co-authored another study that found that after the NFA was passed, there were no mass shootings in the country (as of May 2016), and that gun-related death rates declined more quickly after the NFA than they did before it. The study also found, however, that non-gun suicide and homicide rates declined even more quickly after the NFA, leading the authors to conclude that [...] "it is not possible to determine whether the change in firearm deaths {{can be attributed to the}} gun law reforms." ...|$|E

We {{present the}} design and results of the Spring 2007 (RT- 07) Rich Transcription Meeting Recognition Evaluation; the fifth {{in a series of}} communi-ty-wide {{evaluations}} of language technologies in the meeting domain. For 2007, we supported three evaluation tasks: Speech-To-Text (STT) transcription, “Who Spoke When ” Diarization (SPKR), and Speaker Attributed Speech-To-Text (SASTT). The SASTT task, which combines STT and SPKR tasks, was a new evaluation task. The test data consisted of three test sets: Conference Meetings, Lecture Meetings, and Coffee Breaks from lecture meetings. The Coffee Break data was included as a new test set this year. Twenty-one re-search sites materially contributed to the evaluation by providing data or build-ing systems.

Structural <b>break</b> <b>tests</b> applied to typical data sets often fail to reject the null hypothesis of no break.

40|$|Oxidative and enzyme {{breakers}} {{are used}} in this research project with the main objective to study on the degradation pattern of fracturing fluid (i. e., guar polymer gel) {{as a function of}} time, temperature and breaker concentration itself. The fracturing fluid used in hydraulic fracturing or frac pack contain a chemical breakers to reduce the viscosity of the fluid intermingled with the proppant. Chemical breakers reduce viscosity of the guar polymer by cleaving the polymer into small-molecular-weight fragments. The reduction of viscosity will facilitate the flow-back of residual polymer providing rapid recovery of polymer from proppant pack. Ineffective breakers or misapplication of breakers can result in screen-outs or flow-back of viscous fluids both of which can significantly decrease the well productivity. Breaker activity of low to medium temperature range oxidative and enzyme breaker systems was evaluated. ViCon NF an oxidative breaker (Halliburton product) and GBW 12 - CD an enzyme breaker (BJ Services product) were used in this research project with the main objective to study on the degradation pattern of fracturing fluid (guar polymer gel) as a function of (time, temperature and breaker concentration itself).

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this thesis, {{performance}} of the single structural break tests is examined. Since it has proved superiority of Sequential F test on other single break tests, it is chosen as single <b>break</b> <b>test.</b> Monte Carlo simulation is run for different scenarios and performances of the test with respect to estimating break points, and parameters, and rejecting or accepting the joint null hypothesis is observed. For all cases small sample bias is observed. The test estimates parameters correctly for large samples but for small samples it underestimates or overestimates parameters. Another common problem is about joint null hypothesis. When test rejects the joint null, it doesn’t identify which of the joint hypothesis is rejected. Therefore in this study, we utilize the t-statistic of the parameters to determine the individual hypothesis rejected. In addition to these common problems we illustrate other scenario specific problems in this study.
