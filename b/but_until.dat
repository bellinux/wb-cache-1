5|$|Rwandans {{have been}} growing coffee since colonial times, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> 1999 the product was classed below Grade C, making it unsalable on the global markets.

5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E
5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E

5|$|Star Dust (registration G-AGWH) was a British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian {{airliner}} which {{crashed into}} Mount Tupungato in the Argentine Andes on 2 August 1947, during {{a flight from}} Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile. A comprehensive search of a wide area (including what is now {{known to have been}} the crash site) was fruitless, and the fate of the aircraft and occupants remained unknown for over 50 years.

5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Frederick III (I), the Brandenburg Prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of the monarchy. Frederick William's {{testament}} would have divided Brandenburg-Prussia among his sons, yet firstborn Frederick III with the emperor's backing succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the Treaty of Gera, which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories. In 1689, a new central chamber for all Brandenburg-Prussian territories was created, called Geheime Hofkammer (since 1713: Generalfinanzdirektorium). This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories' Amtskammer chambers. The General War Commissariat (Generalkriegskommissariat) emerged as a second central agency, superior to the local Kriegskommissariat agencies initially concerned with {{the administration of the}} army, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks.|$|E
5|$|What {{became known}} as the King's Highway were a series of foot paths which the Mohawk had long used to get from west in the valley through the Pine Bush to trade with other tribes at the {{confluence}} of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers. This area was later the site of the Dutch Fort Orange. After the founding of Schenectady, the name was used for what became a major route between the two settlements <b>but,</b> <b>until</b> the mid-18th century, it was not improved beyond a foot path. During the war from 1699 to 1707, Albany residents collected firewood from the Pine Bush for the large army that was camped at Fort Frederick.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey's {{ordination}} as {{a priest}} took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{ordered a}} plan covertly to {{encourage}} a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians {{had never been able}} entirely to repress {{after the end of the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project <b>but</b> <b>until</b> the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{although}} the Scottish economy was still dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade, {{there was an}} increasing amount of foreign trade. Coins were replacing barter goods, with Scottish coins being struck from the reign of David I. Mints were established at Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Perth, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> {{the end of the}} period most exchange was done without the use of metal currency, and English coins probably outnumbered Scottish ones. Until the disruption caused by the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century, most naval trade was probably coastal and most foreign trade was with England. The wars closed English markets and raised the levels of piracy and disruption to naval trade on both sides. They may have led to an increase in continental trade, and isolated references indicate that Scottish ships were active in Norway and Danzig, and the earliest records from the 1330s indicate that five-sixths of this trade was in the hands of Scottish merchants.|$|E

5|$|Located in St John's Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, the IOA {{was founded}} in 1937, largely by {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> 1946 relied primarily upon volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, the latter being intolerant of the shortcomings of others, something Childe made an effort never to be. He was popular among students, who saw him as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He consistently referred to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and called towns by their Slavonic rather than Germanic names, further confusing his students. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954–55).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Nebi Samuel has officially been {{identified}} by the British as beginning on 17 November and finishing on 24 November 1917. <b>But</b> <b>until</b> 21 November infantry from the 75th Division was still continuing its advance towards Bireh. On that day, as the infantry division turned north east cutting {{across the front of}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division, their progress was blocked at Biddu by Ottoman forces entrenched on the height of Nebi Samuel, dominating Jerusalem and its defences. This hill, the traditional site of the tomb of the Prophet Samuel, was taken late in the evening by the 234th Brigade, 75th Division, after fierce fighting. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had taken the more difficult line, while the 75th Division was directed to the south western approaches. Several counterattacks by Ottoman forces during the following days failed. In close fighting, Ottoman soldiers strongly counterattacked, reaching the gates of the mosque before Gurkha infantry fought them off. Fevzi's Seventh Army had fought Allenby's two infantry divisions to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Ocean {{had been}} an {{important}} strategic region for British trade since the first British trading posts were developed in India. By the Napoleonic Wars, millions of pounds worth of goods crossed the ocean's trade routes every year, mostly in the heavily guarded convoys of East Indiamen. The French recognised the economic importance of these convoys <b>but</b> <b>until</b> 1808 failed to provide sufficient forces to disrupt the Indian trade. Late in 1808, {{it was decided to}} send a strong frigate squadron to the Ocean under the command of Jacques Hamelin to augment the forces available on the island bases of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France and raid British shipping in the region. Hamelin was an able commander and between May 1809 and July 1810 his ships captured seven East Indiamen and a large number of small merchant ships and warships.|$|E
