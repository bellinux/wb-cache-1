40|$|A {{review of}} current {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} deicing salt and trace minerals, such as sulfate, on aggregate deterioration was conducted. Such deterioration in both Portland cement concrete, and <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> was reviewed. For Portland cement concrete, it was determined that current research on the effects of moisture and deicing salt on aggregates concrete matrix durability, with little discussion on the effects on aggregates. The effects of trace minerals in deicing salt are also rarely discussed. Pore size distribution, insoluble residue, absorption, and susceptibility to alkali-silica reaction all appear to affect aggregate durability in the presence of moisture of freeze-thaw. Based on available research, it is concluded that salt in solution exacerbates the damaging effects of moisture and freeze-thaw on aggregates. Several researchers currently are evaluating other features of aggregate deterioration by deicing salts. 	Moisture damage effects on aggregates in <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> have been widely studied. Damage potential is strongly related to the susceptibility of stripping of the bituminous covering from the aggregate surface. Research has been conducted on the use of various additives to reduce stripping, some of which consist of proprietary commercial formulations. There is also extensive research on testing procedures, which predict stripping potential of aggregates. However, the added effect of deicing salt has received relatively little attention. Some researchers have speculated that deicing salts may increase the brittleness of asphalt pavements thereby increasing susceptibility to moisture. Determining specific effects of deicing salts on aggregate may prove difficult because of the numerous properties that affect the stripping potential of aggregates for <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements.</b> Mixture type, placement techniques and traffic, as well as aggregate properties, appear to be related to a <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavement’s</b> susceptibility to moisture damage...|$|R

It is also an obstacle with reference to the stiffness modulus of <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> in connection with performance based contracts.

In an earlier study concerning the determination of stiffness modulus, it was stated that the comparative tests showed that there is a great variation both within and in-between the results of different laboratories. The aim is to refine the test method for determining the stiffness modulus in a way that partly leads to less variation between stiffness modulus measurements performed by different laboratories, partly to increased knowledge of different apparatuses used in Sweden. This is done by controlling and comparing the load pulse and the resulting deformation pulse when using variable loading. Force and deformation were registered by different systems (additional stress and strain gauges). Dummy specimens, with more stable characteristics than bituminous test specimens, were used as a completion to the calibration and for the analysis of stress, deformation, loading time and pulse of different apparatuses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> {{suffer the}} effects of {{environmental}} and use exposure from ultraviolet light, water, aggressive chemical spills, and abrasion. The result of such exposure is {{the deterioration of the}} pavement from the surface. Oxidation (fading & hardening) of the pavement- causing brittleness, leads to cracking and subsequent crack wall erosion (water stripping of the bituminous binder), which all leads to further water penetration and eventual loss of structural integrity if not addressed in a timely manner. The pavement accordingly suffers reduced color contrast and service life, requiring facility shutdowns for remediation.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} {{issues in}} pavement materials and design form a strong {{incentive for the}} present work. Using recycled materials in pavements is a sustainable practice that is gaining adoption, particularly for flexible (<b>bituminous)</b> <b>pavements.</b> One approach is to incorporate large quantities of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) into base and sub-base applications for pavement construction. Numerous studies have reported that RAP can be reused as an aggregate in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) {{as well as in}} cold mix asphalt, granular base, sub-base, and subgrade courses. Cold recycling technology, like hot mix technology, has also become popular in various countries for rehabilitation of damaged <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements.</b> RAP stabilized with bitumen emulsion and foamed bitumen {{has been used as a}} base layer. The present study focuses on Foamed Bitumen treated Mixes (FBMs). Most of the agencies which use FBMs have their own mix design procedures which are the result of numerous efforts over decades. In spite of all these efforts, Foamed Bitumen application in cold recycling in the United Kingdom suffers from the lack of a standardised mix design procedure. To overcome this, the present research objective was to develop a mix design procedure by identifying critical mix design parameters. The mix design parameters that were optimised were Foamed Bitumen content, mixing water content (MWC), and compaction effort. Special attention was given to the simplest yet crucial mix design consideration of FBMs; curing. The thesis also attempted to simulate what should be expected in terms of the performance of flexible pavements containing FBMs as road base. The mix design parametric study was initially carried out on FBMs with virgin limestone aggregate (VA) without RAP material and a mix design procedure was proposed. Optimum MWC was achieved by optimising mechanical properties such as Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus (ITSM) and Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS-dry and ITS-wet). A rational range of 75 - 85...|$|R
