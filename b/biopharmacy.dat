40|$|Due {{to their}} promotory {{action on the}} {{transport}} of some drugs through various membranes (lipophilic barriers), oxo derivatives of bile acids have recently been increasingly used in <b>biopharmacy.</b> These compounds exhibit also a lower membranolytic (toxic) activity than their hydroxy analogues. Because of {{that it is of}} special importance to find out the descriptors that would adequately describe the structure of bile acids and their biological activity and be used to model the quantitative structure-activity relationship. In view of this, the present work is concerned with the application of the chromatographic parameter RM 0 obtained by normal-phase thin-layer chromatography in the solvent system toluene-butanol and silica gel as stationary phase to describe the lipophilicity of bile acids. Also, the work introduces a new molecular descriptor (ND) that reflects both 2 D and 3 D topological characteristics of the molecule. Between the retention constant, RM 0 and the descriptor ND there is a good correlation, and both RM 0, and ND describe sufficiently well the structural (conformational) changes that arise in the process of oxidation of the OH group of the steroid skeleton to an oxo group.

40|$|A {{few years}} ago the {{department}} Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology of the UMCG and the department Pharmaceutical Technology and <b>Biopharmacy</b> of the RUG developed the patented ColoPulse coating. ColoPulse tablets exhibit a site-specific release in the lower gastrointestinal tract. They {{have the potential to}} improve efficacy and to minimize side effects of locally acting drugs. Moreover, oral administration is considered more patient friendly than parenteral administration. In the literature colon-specific oral delivery is considered an alternative for parenteral administration of macromolecular and peptide drugs due to the relatively neutral pH of the ileo-colonic region combined with relatively low proteolytic activity. Patients that could profit from the ColoPulse technology are patients with inflammatory bowel disease. One of the cornerstones in their treatment is parenteral administration of the monoclonal antibody infliximab. The main concerns herewith are the development of anti-drug-antibodies which are associated with a shorter duration of response and an increased risk of infusion reactions. To overcome this problem and the drawbacks of parenteral administration, developing an oral dosage form of infliximab may become a new strategy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. In this thesis several studies are described, all aimed to improve the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We focused on pharmaceutical aspects regarding formulation of ColoPulse tablets and especially ColoPulse infliximab tablets. The pharmacokinetics of infliximab were explored in an outpatient setting. This was combined with the collection of more knowledge about in vivo behavior of ColoPulse tablets in healthy volunteers and in Crohn’s patients...|$|E

The cecal-contracting effects of repeated transdermal electroporation delivery and intravenous administration of neostigmine were compared in anesthetized rats. Methods: The cecal contractions were detected with implantable strain gauge sensors, and the plasma levels of neostigmine were followed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Both intravenously and EP-administered neostigmine (0. 2 – 66. 7 µg/kg) increased the cecal contractions in a dose-dependent manner. For both the low doses and the highest dose, the neostigmine plasma concentrations were the same after the two modes of administration, while an insignificantly higher level was observed at a dose of 20 µg/kg after intravenous administration as compared with the electroporation route. The contractile responses did not differ significantly after the two administration routes. Conclusion: The results suggest that electroporation-delivered neostigmine elicits action equivalent to that observed after intravenous administration as concerning both time and intensity. Electroporation permits the delivery of even lower doses of water-soluble compounds through the skin, which is very promising for clinical practice.

A prolonged release system was proposed for paliperidone (Pal) delivery, containing Kollidon® SR as an insoluble matrix agent and hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a hydrophilic polymer. The experimental part was preceded by the identification of potential sources of variability through Ishikawa diagrams, and failure mode and effects analysis was used to deliver the critical process parameters that were further optimized by design of experiments. A D-optimal design was used to investigate the effects of Kollidon SR ratio (X 1), the type of hydrophilic polymer (X 2), and the percentage of hydrophilic polymer (X 3) on the percentages of dissolved Pal over 24 h (Y 1 –Y 9). Effects expressed as regression coefficients and response surfaces were generated, along with a design space for the preparation of a target formulation in an experimental area with low error risk. The optimal formulation contained 27. 62 % Kollidon SR and 8. 73 % HPMC and achieved the prolonged release of Pal, with low burst effect, at ratios that were very close to the ones predicted by the model. Thus, the parameters with the highest impact on the final product quality were studied, and safe ranges were established for their variations.

Patients and methods: In 11 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system II/III, age range: 59 – 82 years), THA was conducted with an epidural blockade using 15 mL 0. 25 % bupivacaine (37. 5 mg) with 5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride and sedation with propofol infusion at a dose of 3 – 5 mg/kg/h. After the surgery, patients received ketoprofen at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. In the first 24 hours postoperative period, pain was assessed by numerical rating scale at rest and on movement; adverse effects (AEs) were recorded; and plasma concentrations of oxycodone, noroxycodone, and bupivacaine were measured. Results: The administration of epidural oxycodone at a dose of 5 mg in patients undergoing THA provided analgesia for a mean time of 10. 3 ± 4. 89 h. In one patient, mild pruritus was observed. Oxycodone did not evoke other AEs. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone while preserving analgesia were > 2. 9 ng/mL. Noroxycodone concentrations in plasma did not guarantee analgesic effect. Conclusion: The administration of epidural oxycodone at a dose of 5 mg prolongs the analgesia period to ~ 10 hours in patients after THA. Oxycodone may evoke pruritus.

40|$|This study expands on {{the work}} of Hausmann et al. (2007) on the product space of nations to come to a model for first mover {{industry}} advantage. For this model, insights from the varieties of capitalism theory (Hall & Soskice, 2001), comparative advantage theory (Davis, 1995) and first mover advantage theory (Wernerfelt, 1984) were combined in order to derive two key factors of endogenous industry growth, namely a learning advantage and a financing advantage. This model was then applied to the recently emerged industry of <b>biopharmacy</b> in the USA and the EU. For this case study, information from several different industry reports was gathered and combined into a narrative {{on the development of the}} industry in the USA and the EU since 1980. In this narrative, it was found that the USA had an early start in the development of biopharmaceutical products, owing to the Bayh-Dole act formulated in 1980 (AUTM, 2013), while corresponding European laws were only implemented 10 years later. This early advantage was maintained up to the current situation, where the USA has a firm lead in the biopharmaceutical industry. Based on the conceptual model derived earlier, an explanation for this phenomenon was found: in the early period of the industry, developing new biopharmaceutical products carried relatively little risk, allowing venture capitalists to gain experience in guiding new ventures to a successful exit. When the European nations implemented their versions of the Bayh-Dole act, these low-risk products had already been developed, meaning that the EU based venture capitalists did not have the same opportunity to gain experience that the USA based firms had been given. This difference in experience has led to the USA based ventures continuing to have a higher success rate than their EU based counterparts, giving the USA a long-term competitive advantage in the industry. In general, the coevolution of endogenous industry effects such as the knowledge accumulation in firms and venture capitalists are an integral part of the development of an industry and should be taken into account by policy makers attempting to stimulate industry growth...|$|E

The orphan and structurally unique receptor small heterodimer partner 1 (syn NR 0 B 2) is not only known for its modulation of drug response, but has also been reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Indeed, previous studies show that NR 0 B 2 is downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that NR 0 B 2 acts as a tumor suppressor via inhibition of cellular growth and activation of apoptosis in this tumor entity. The aim of our study was to elucidate whether NR 0 B 2 may also play a role in other tumor entities. Comparing NR 0 B 2 expression in renal cell carcinoma and adjacent nonmalignant transformed tissue revealed significant downregulation in vivo. Additionally, the impact of heterologous expression of NR 0 B 2 on cell cycle progression and proliferation in cells of renal origin was characterized. Monitoring fluorescence intensity of resazurin turnover in RCC-EW cells revealed no significant differences in metabolic activity in the presence of NR 0 B 2. However, there was a significant decrease of cellular proliferation in cells overexpressing this NR, and NR 0 B 2 was more efficient than currently used antiproliferative agents. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that heterologous overexpression of NR 0 B 2 significantly reduced the amount of cells passing the G 1 phase, while on the other hand, more cells in S/G 2 phase were detected.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate in postmenopausal women the effect of daily consumption and/or application of argan oil on skin elasticity. Materials and methods: Sixty postmenopausal women consumed butter during the stabilization period and were randomly divided into two groups for the intervention period: the treatment group of 30 participants received dietary argan oil, the control group of 30 participants received olive oil, and both groups applied cosmetic argan oil in the left volar forearm during a 60 -day period. Assessments of skin elasticity parameters, ie, the three R-parameters (R 2 or gross-elasticity of the skin, R 5 or net elasticity of the skin, and R 7 or biological elasticity), and the resonance running time (RRT) at both volar forearms of the two groups were performed during three visits: before starting oils consumption and application, after 30 days of oils consumption and application, and after 60 days of oils consumption and application. Results: The consumption of argan oil led to a significant increase of gross-elasticity of the skin (R 2) (P< 0. 001), net elasticity of the skin (R 5) (P< 0. 001), biological elasticity (R 7) (P< 0. 001), and a significant decrease of RRT (P= 0. 002). The application of argan oil led to a significant increase of gross-elasticity of the skin (R 2) (P< 0. 001), net elasticity of the skin (R 5) (P< 0. 001), biological elasticity (R 7) (P= 0. 001), and a significant decrease of RRT (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Efficient {{and safe}} protein {{nanoparticles}} for the targeted delivery of small molecule, protein and oligonucleotide based drugs {{will play a}} key role in the field of science in the upcoming years. Whereas viral and liposomal formulations have been extensively tested throughout the last two decades, their inherent and in the case of viruses sometimes even fatal obstacles not seldom seem impossible to conquer. The time for the development of a new therapeutic option in form of an advanced drug delivery system within pharmaceutical technology, <b>biopharmacy</b> and clinical studies has come. In our eyes gelatin based nanoparticles with polysaccharide and peptide modifications are an optimum to fulfil this need and will therefore be the center of the research presented in this work. Basically, nanoparticles with a size from 150 to 300 nm were prepared by desolvating a clear solution of gelatin through dropwise addition of an organic anti-solvent under heavy stirring. A subsequent destabilization of the water soluble protein chains resulted in round particles with a homogenous size distribution and an even surface. Initially, the polymers used for the formulation of the nanoparticles were characterized by such methods like asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, established measurement and calculation algorithms were revised into state-of-the-art technology and applied as so called automatic microviscosimetry for in- depth protein analysis. The development of novel nanoparticle formulations based on these polymers was done in a second step using diethyl-amino-ethanol-dextran, polysorbate and polyethylene glycol, as well as methylation and acetylation chemistry. While the modified dextran mainly increased the zeta potential of the nanoparticles, the other modifications were intended to change the pharmacokinetic distribution patterns towards e. g. prolonged circulation times. In novel nanoparticle cytology science the use of a flow chamber device for cell cultivation allowed us to study the interaction patterns of nanoparticles with adherent cells under near to physiological conditions simulating blood vessels, junctions and shear stress. This in-vitro model can be used for online preclinical and high-throughput screenings of new nanoparticle and protein formulations with cell monolayers. The hindrances in traditional static cell culture models were shown to be overcome by comparing several nanoparticle formulations in a static and in a flow model. Proper nanoparticle formulations were tested further in innovative preclinical in-vivo models like the hamster dorsal skin fold chamber and the mouse cremaster model to elucidate their body distribution and targeting properties with a focus on kinetics, blood cell interaction and novel fluorescence detection techniques. In addition, the potential of gelatin nanoparticles as therapeutic options in a model for antigen induced arthritis was demonstrated. Finally, hybrid (sandwich) nanoparticles were formulated by combining gelatin nanoparticle preformulations with the endosomolytic peptide Melittin from bee venom and loading them with small interfering RNA molecules against VEGFR 2 and luciferase. The novel hybrid carriers were extensively tested in cell cultures towards their efficiency to induce a protein knock-down based on RNA interference.

EDVB was produced and characterized by using FTIR spectroscopy. The adsorption was studied by a batch method by considering the factors affecting the adsorption such as initial metal ion concentration, adsorption selectivity, and mechanism of adsorption using a sequential desorption method. The adsorption of Iron onto EDVB followed a pseudo- 2 order kinetics model with the rate constant of 0, 144 L 2 mmol- 1 min- 1. The adsorption isotherm was studied with Tempkin, Langmuir and Freundlich models. The adsorption capacity (Qmax) obtained by Langmuir isotherms was 250 mg. L- 1 while the equilibrium value was 0. 8 Lmg- 1. A competitive adsorption study showed that EDVB is adsorbed selectively towards Iron rather than Chromium, Coppers and Cadmium ions. The interaction type of Iron onto EDVB was determined by a sequential desorption. Keywords: Polyeugenol; divinyl benzene (DVB); adsorption; Iron; Fe References • Abasi, C. Y.; Abia, A. A.; Igwe, J.

40|$|Future {{changes in}} the {{incidence}} and prevalence of OA are difficult to predict. As incidence and prevalence rise with increasing age, extending life expectancy will result in greater numbers with OA. Actually, usual therapeutic approaches are really restricted because of important side effects with long-term use. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop improved formulations which are well tolerated, biocompatible and biodegradable. Ideally, these new treatments should be able to deliver locally sufficient amount of anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs into the site of arthritic inflammation while stabilizing or better restoring the mechanical integrity of the joint. In this way, the objective of this project is to develop slow-release gels that are sterile, injectable, characterized by viscoelastic properties and capable to sustain the in situ release of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. The intraarticular delivery combined to sustained-release property should be interesting to reduce the number of injection required while prolonging the local drug activity over weeks. For that purpose, glycerol monooleate (GMO), also called “monolein” was selected for its capacity to form highly viscous crystalline phase structures upon contact with an aqueous fluid (e. g. synovial fluid). In the first step of this work, it was decided to develop and characterize hydro-lipidic gels based on the use of monolein and hyaluronic acid in order to provide in vitro sustained release of hydrophilic drugs such as clonidine and lipophilic drugs such as betamethasone. Initially, a compatibility study was performed on the main ingredients selected in order to check that there were not physico-chemical incompatibilities, which could be deleterious regarding to their stability in formulation. Then, the development of hydro-lipidic gels was initiated by considering on the first hand the solubility of each ingredient and on the other hand the syringeability, the rheological properties and the in vitro dissolution profiles obtained for the developed formulations. The objective of this preformulation program was to identify potential candidates that presented suitable syringeability while being able to sustain the release of drugs over weeks and being characterized by interesting viscoelastic properties for the long-term management of osteoarthritis. Moreover, several methods of quantification and characterization were developed in order to allow the physico-chemical properties (rheology, syringeability, water uptake, stability and dissolution profiles) of the developed formulations to be studied. Results of the compatibility study showed that the concomitant use of monolein, hyaluronic acid and clonidine/betamethasone is not contraindicated. Next, the preformulation program allowed many injectable drug delivery systems to be prepared. However, the carrier that best meets our needs was composed of 10, 0 % (wt/wt) absolute ethanol; 15, 0 % propylene glycol (wt/wt); 15, 0 % (wt/wt) water; 55, 0 % (wt/wt) de monolein; 5, 0 % (wt/wt) purified soybean oil; 0, 03 % (wt/wt) α-tocophérol and 7, 5 mg/g sodium hyaluronate (1. 9 MDa). This carrier assured suitable syringeability and rheological properties. Indeed, it presented marked pseudoplastic flow behavior that allowed relatively fast injection through a narrow needle, followed by an increase in viscosity upon contact with aqueous fluids to obtain an in vitro sustained release of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs over a few weeks. As a consequence, it was assumed that this carrier should be able to jellify in situ upon contact with physiological fluid such as synovial fluid. Then, according to EMA recommendations, a fast and easy manufacturing process that could be applied in a cleanroom at industrial scale was validated in our Laboratory. Finally, according to these promising results obtained in vitro, a stability study was performed on the carrier alone and containing clonidine or betamethasone according to ICH recommendations described for products intended for storage in a refrigerator. In that purpose, several parameters such as the quantification of drugs, the pH, the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid, the dissolution profiles of drugs and the rheological properties of the formulations were recorded depending on time and conditions of storage. This stability study showed clearly the importance to adjust the pH value of the formulation. Indeed, it was demonstrated that a pH value of 6. 5, adjusted with diluted NaOH, allowed the stability of the formulation to be significantly improved. During this first step of this project, our Laboratory initiated two new collaborations. On the first hand, collaboration with the Laboratory of Professor Siepmann (University of Lille 2 – Faculty of Pharmacy) was started for their expertise on mathematical modeling. On the other hand, collaboration with the Laboratory of Professor Jerôme (ULg – Faculty of sciences) was started for their expertise on macromolecular chemistry and more particularly on rheological properties. In the second step of this work, it was decided to evaluate in vitro the safety and the efficiency of the developed carrier and formulations containing clonidine or betamethasone. In this way, it was suggested to test selected drugs and potential candidates formulations on equine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PMNs stimulated or not with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). For that purpose, our Laboratory initiated a new collaboration with the Laboratory of Professor Serteyn (ULg – Faculty of veterinary) for their expertise on equine PMNs and quantification of (ROS) produced in particular in inflammatory diseases. This in vitro study has shown that no pro-inflammatory effect appeared by incubating carrier with unstimulated PMNs in comparison with the control assay. However, the production of ROS was quickly and considerably decreased when stimulated cells were placed in contact with carrier regardless on the incorporation of clonidine or betamethasone. This observation demonstrated that developed carrier provided a strong antioxidant effect, certainly by trapping the ROS produced. These results were very promising because that antioxidant effect of carrier could inhibit oxidative damages and might consequently potentiate the prevention of inflammatory conditions. Concerning the clonidine and betamethasone, only the last one provided significant inhibition of the ROS activity. Finally, by considering the very promising results obtained with the in vitro study on PMNs, an in vivo study on rabbits, which seemed to be the most appropriate small animal model for this kind of intraarticular formulations, was performed to evaluate the toxicity and the efficiency of the developed carrier and formulation containing betamethasone. Therefore, our Laboratory started collaboration with the unit of research in osteo-articular pathologies (UROC) of Pr. Henrotin (ULg) for their expertise in animal models, in particular rabbits with osteoarticular pathologies such as osteoarthritis. For this purpose, this in vivo study was outsourced by TNO (Delft, Holland) and was designed as follow: (i) 0. 9 % saline buffered (n= 8); (ii) carrier (n= 8); (iii) formulation containing betamethasone (n= 8); (iv) Durolane® (n= 8) a marketed product of HA. Surprisingly, it seemed that the control group (saline buffered) presented macroscopical and histological scores that were globally low according to literature. As a consequence, it was difficult to conclude about the efficiency of the developed treatments by considering only this pilot study. However, it is important to note that it seemed that the expected viscoelastic protection of the carrier to prevent the degradation of articular cartilage was not optimal regardless on the incorporation of betamethasone. Nevertheless, the histological analyses of synovial membranes from each treated groups demonstrated that there was no pro-inflammatory reaction. This meant that all formulations tested were well tolerated despite of the apparition of lumps (in 37. 5 % of treated rabbits) that are probably due to both the high volume injected (900 µL) and an excessive and unexpected in situ water uptake of developed formulations based on GMO. However, this lack of rejection of the developed carrier could be very important since it allowed new perspectives to be considered. For example, other articular disorders could be targeted by incorporating drugs, for which in situ sustained release or mechanical protection could be beneficial. Our laboratory is member of a collaborative project "JOINT-AIC" from BioWin and is supported by a grant from the Walloon Region. The development of analytical methods, the evaluation of physico-chemical properties and finally the preparation of sterile batches of formulations based on GMO intended for in vitro and in vivo studies were performed in the Laboratory of Galenic and <b>Biopharmacy</b> of the Faculty of Pharmacy of ULB. /L’arthrose est une pathologie dont la prévalence et le coût ne font qu’augmenter dans notre société vieillissante. Les moyens thérapeutiques actuels étant fort limités suite à de sérieux effets secondaires à long terme, il existe réellement un besoin médical important de développer de nouveaux traitements locaux qui soient bien tolérés, biocompatibles et biodégradables. Idéalement, ceux-ci devraient être actifs au niveau du processus inflammatoire ou de la douleur tout en étant capable de stabiliser, voire de restaurer, l’intégrité mécanique de l’articulation. Dans cette optique, l’objectif de ce projet a été de développer des systèmes hydrolipidiques stériles, injectables et viscoélastiques qui soient capables de prolonger in situ la libération de principes actifs hydrophiles et lipophiles. Cette caractéristique devait permettre de réduire le nombre d’injections nécessaires dans le cadre du traitement symptomatique de l’arthrose et de maintenir l’effet des composés sur un minimum de quatre à six semaines. Cette étude entre dans le cadre du projet JOINT-AIC entièrement financé par le programme BioWin de la Région Wallonne. Le développement, la validation des méthodes analytiques, l’évaluation des propriétés physico-chimiques ainsi que la préparation stérile des lots de formulation destinés aux tests in vitro et in vivo ont été réalisés au sein du Laboratoire de Galénique et Biopharmacie de la Faculté de Pharmacie de l’ULB. Au cours de ce projet, il a donc fallu dans un premier temps développer et caractériser des formulations hydrolipidiques à base de monoléine et d’acide hyaluronique permettant une libération in vitro prolongée de principes actifs tels que la clonidine (hydrophile) et le dipropionate de bétaméthasone (lipophile). Une étude de compatibilité a ainsi été préalablement réalisée afin de s’assurer qu’aucun des constituants principaux de la formulation ne présentaient d’incompatibilité physico-chimique qui pourrait être délétère vis-à-vis de leur stabilité en formulation. Ensuite, le développement de préparations hydro-lipidiques a été initié en tenant compte, d’une part de la solubilité des différents composants et, d’autre part de l’injectabilité, des propriétés rhéologiques et des profils de libération de la clonidine obtenus à partir des gels développés. Cette étude visait à obtenir une composition de référence qui soit à la fois injectable et capable de libérer un principe actif hydrophile sur plusieurs jours, voire plusieurs semaines, tout en possédant des propriétés rhéologiques intéressantes dans le cadre d’une viscosupplémentation articulaire. Enfin, un protocole de fabrication en milieu aseptique a été développé et plusieurs méthodes pour étudier les propriétés physico-chimiques des gels développés telles que la rhéologie, l’injectabilité, l’indice de gonflement, la stabilité et les profils de libérations ont été mises en place. Les résultats ont montré qu’aucune incompatibilité ne semblait exister entre les trois composés majeurs de notre préparation, la monoléine, l’acide hyaluronique et la clonidine. Le développement des formulations nous a ensuite permis d’obtenir de nouveaux systèmes hydrolipidiques stériles et injectables à délivrance prolongée. Le véhicule qui remplissait au mieux nos objectifs était composé de 10, 0 % (m/m) d’éthanol;de 15, 0 % de propylène glycol (m/m);de 15, 0 % (m/m) d’eau;de 55, 0 % (m/m) de monoléine; 5, 0 % (m/m) d’huile de soja purifiée; 0, 03 % (m/m) d’α-tocophérol, de 7, 5 mg/g d’HA et son pH était ajusté à 6, 5 avec du NaOH 1 N. Ce véhicule a montré un intérêt réel dans le cadre du développement de préparations biodégradables et biocompatibles pour le traitement de pathologies articulaires. En effet, cette composition présentait un écoulement de type pseudoplastique et des propriétés rhéologiques qui lui procuraient une bonne injectabilité. De plus, cette formulation a démontré in vitro une excellente capacité à gélifier au contact de fluides aqueux et à ralentir efficacement sur plusieurs semaines la libération des différents principes actifs incorporés (clonidine et dipropionate de bétaméthasone). Nous pouvions, dès lors, envisager que celle-ci serait capable de gélifier in situ au contact d’un fluide physiologique tel que le liquide synovial. Ensuite, suivant les recommandations de l’EMA, nous avons décidé d’utiliser l’association d’une filtration stérilisante et d’une préparation en milieu aseptique pour obtenir des formulations qui répondaient aux exigences en matière de préparation parentérale. C’est ainsi qu’un protocole de fabrication stérile de nos gels a été développé par nos soins en vue d’une éventuelle mise à l’échelle industrielle. Enfin, une étude de stabilité sur une année, suivant les normes ICH décrites pour des formulations destinées à être conservées au frigo, a été réalisée sur différents véhicules développés et contenant soit la clonidine, soit le dipropionate de bétaméthasone. Dans cette optique, plusieurs paramètres, tels que le dosage en principe actif, l’évolution du pH et du poids moléculaire de HA, le profil de libération ainsi que la rhéologie des formulations ont été évalués au cours du temps aux différentes conditions de conservation testées. Cette étude a permis de démontrer toute l’importance d’ajuster le pH de la préparation pour prévenir l’hydrolyse de l’HA, et cela indépendamment de l’incorporation de principe actif. Ainsi, il a pu être montré que l’ajustement du pH du véhicule à 6, 5 à partir de NaOH dilué permettait d’améliorer considérablement la stabilité de la formulation puisqu’aucune modification significative de ses différents paramètres physico-chimiques et teneurs n’a été observée après un an de conservation à 5 et à 25 °C (60 % HR) mais également après six mois à 30 °C (65 % HR). Au cours de cette première partie, deux collaborations ont été initiées, l’une avec le Laboratoire du Prof. Siepmann de l’Université de Lille 2 et l’autre avec le Prof. Jerôme de l’Université de Liège. Avec l’aide du Prof. Siepmann, il a été possible de mettre au point un modèle mathématique pour caractériser les profils de libération des principes actifs à partir des différents véhicules développés. Le Prof. Jerôme a, quant à elle, mis à notre disposition un rhéomètre qui a permis d’approfondir nos connaissances sur les propriétés rhéologiques et viscoélastiques des formulations. Ensuite, la seconde partie de notre travail a consisté à évaluer la tolérance, ainsi que l’efficacité des principes actifs sélectionnés et des formulations développées, à travers un modèle in vitro de cellules de l’inflammation (neutrophiles équins). Cette étude avait pour objectif d’évaluer deux aspects importants de la formulation :d’une part vérifier l’absence de réaction pro-inflammatoire qui pourrait être in vivo destructrice vis-à-vis du véhicule ainsi que des tissus environnants, et d’autre part vérifier l’effet anti-inflammatoire propre à la clonidine et au dipropionate de bétaméthasone seuls et en formulation. Cette étude a été réalisée avec la collaboration du Laboratoire du Prof. Serteyn de l’Université de Liège. Cette étude in vitro a démontré que les cellules restaient viables au moins pendant quatre heures lorsqu’elles étaient exposées à la matrice épurée de ses solvants. Ensuite, de manière surprenante, il a même pu être démontré que le véhicule permettait à la fois de prévenir et de réduire significativement la production des espèces réactives de l’oxygène (ROS) par les neutrophiles équins lorsque ceux-ci étaient stimulés au phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Cette propriété peut être d’un grand intérêt dans le cadre de la prise en charge de l’arthrose car cette activité antioxydante pourrait permettre d’inhiber les dommages oxydatifs générés par les ROS et ainsi prévenir les dommages liés au développement du processus inflammatoire et qui peut, à long terme, s’avérer délétère pour les tissus environnants tels que le cartilage. Cette propriété du véhicule semble trouver son origine dans la monoléine qui, de par sa composition en alpha-tocophérol (200 ppm), présente également une activité antioxydante vis-à-vis des ROS. Toutefois, une action synergique liée à l’HA, à l’huile de soja ou à l’alpha-tocophérol incorporés aux formulations, n’est pas à exclure. Enfin, parmi les deux principes actifs sélectionnés, seul le dipropionate de bétaméthasone a montré une inhibition significative de la production des ROS. Enfin, en tenant compte des résultats obtenus sur cellules, une étude in vivo pilote a été réalisée sur base d’un modèle de lapins. Cette étude visait à vérifier la tolérance ainsi que l’efficacité en prophylaxie de l’arthrose du véhicule développé ainsi que de la formulation contenant le dipropionate de bétaméthasone. Dans ce but, quatre groupes d’animaux (n= 8) ont été constitués pour chacun des traitements testés :(i) groupe témoin : 0, 9 % tampon salin pH 7, 4;(ii) véhicule à base de GMO développé; (iii) véhicule contenant du dipropionate de bétaméthasone;(iv) groupe référence :Durolane®. Cette étude a été réalisée avec l’aide du Laboratoire du Prof. Henrotin de l’Université de Liège. L’hébergement des animaux ainsi que les actes chirurgicaux ont, quant à eux, été sous-traités par TNO (Delft, Pays-Bas). De manière étonnante, il s’est avéré que le groupe contrôle présentait des scores macroscopique et histologique globalement peu élevés par rapport à ce qui est rapporté dans la littérature. Compte tenu de cette observation, il est difficile de se prononcer, sur base uniquement de cette étude, sur l’efficacité des différents traitements testés. Toutefois, il faut reconnaître que l’effet protecteur attendu pour le véhicule vis-à-vis de la dégradation du cartilage ne semble pas optimal et cela indépendamment de l’incorporation de dipropionate de bétaméthasone. Par ailleurs, l’étude des membranes synoviales a permis de démontrer qu’il n’y avait aucune différence significative en termes d’inflammation et de structure entre le groupe contrôle et les différents groupes traités. Ce qui signifie qu’aucun rejet n’a été observé vis-à-vis des formulations et que celles-ci ont, par conséquent, été bien tolérées malgré la formation de masses liées probablement au volume important injecté (900 µL) et au gonflement in situ du produit chez 37, 5 % des lapins. Cette observation est importante puisqu’elle permet d’envisager de nouvelles perspectives telles que l’incorporation d’autres principes actifs pouvant éventuellement viser d’autres pathologies articulaires et pour lesquels une libération prolongée ou une protection mécanique du principe actif in situ serait bénéfique.
