25|$|Two {{types of}} A-scan {{ultrasound}} <b>biometry</b> {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact applanation <b>biometry.</b> This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe indenting the cornea and shallowing the anterior chamber. Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion A-scan <b>biometry,</b> which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the anterior chamber is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between applanation and immersion axial length measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion <b>biometry</b> {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact applanation <b>biometry</b> in several studies. The main limitation with the A-scan ultrasound is the poor image resolution due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of PCI over ultrasound <b>biometry</b> {{is that the}} axial length measurement is performed through the visual axis since the patient is asked to fixate into the laser spot. In highly myopic or staphylomatous eyes, this can be particularly advantageous since it can sometimes be difficult to measure the true axial length through the visual axis with an ultrasound probe. PCI is also superior to ultrasound in the measurement of pseudophakic and silicone oil-filled eyes. For optical <b>biometry,</b> {{it is not as}} critical how the media change because the correction factor that must be applied is much smaller than in ultrasound <b>biometry.</b> It {{should be noted that the}} axial length obtained from PCI may be slightly longer than that obtained from ultrasound. This is due to PCI measuring the distance from the corneal surface to the RPE while ultrasound measures to the anterior retinal surface. Therefore, many IOL measurement machines require refined IOL constants unique to their mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{biometrics}} has noticeably increased. However, {{no single}} bodily or behavioral feature {{is able to}} satisfy acceptability, speed, and reliability constraints of authentication in real applications. The present trend is therefore toward multimodal systems. In this paper, we deal with some core {{issues related to the}} design of these systems and propose a novel modular framework, namely, novel approaches for biometric systems (NABS) that we have implemented to address them. NABS proposal encompasses two possible architectures based on the comparative speeds of the involved <b>biometries.</b> It also provides a novel solution for the data normalization problem, with the new quasi-linear sigmoid (QLS) normalization function. This function can overcome a number of common limitations, according to the presented experimental comparisons. A further contribution is the system response reliability (SRR) index to measure response confidence. Its theoretical definition allows {{to take into account the}} gallery composition at hand in assigning a system reliability measure on a single-response basis. The unified experimental setting aims at evaluating such aspects both separately and together, using face, ear, and fingerprint as test <b>biometries.</b> The results provide a positive feedback for the overall theoretical framework developed herein. Since NABS is designed to allow both a flexible choice of the adopted architecture, and a variable compositions and/or substitution of its optional modules, i. e., QLS and SRR, it can support different operational settings. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

The transformation is non-invertible and BioPhasor able to achieve extremely low error rate compare to sole biometrics in verification setting. The privacy invasion and nonrevocable problems in biometrics could be resolved by revocation of resulting feature through the pseudo-random number replacement.

40|$|Present {{biometric}} systems mostly rely on {{a single}} physical or behavioral feature for either identification or verification. However, day to day use of single <b>biometries</b> in massive or uncontrolled scenarios still has several shortcomings. These can be due to complex or unstable hardware settings, to changing environmental conditions or even to immature software procedures: some classification problems are intrinsically hard to solve. Possible spoofing of single biometric features is an additional issue. Last but not least, some features may occasionally lack the requisite of universality. As a consequence, biometric systems based on a single feature often have poor reliability, especially in applications where high security is needed. Multimodal systems, i. e., systems that concurrently exploit multiple features, are a possible way to achieve improved effectiveness and reliability.

Methods: Medical records of 76 patients and 104 eyes who underwent cataract surgery from January 2013 to June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. <b>Biometries</b> were measured using ultrasound and AL-scan and in-traocular lens power was calculated using the SRK-T formula. Automatic refraction examination was done 1 month after the operation, and differences between the ultrasound group and AL-scan group were compared and analyzed by mean absolute error. Results: Mean axial length measured preoperatively by the ultrasound method was 23. 53 ± 1. 17 mm while the lengths measured using the AL-scan were 0. 03 mm longer {{than that of the}} ultrasound group (23. 56 ± 1. 15 mm).

40|$|Detection of B-mode {{polarization}} {{from the}} cosmic microwave background would provide compelling evidence for the inflationary paradigm and has thus become a principal goal for experimental cosmologists during the last 5 - 10 years. A number of high sensitivity experiments have been developed and many are under construction, including the E and B EXperiment (EBEX), a balloon-borne experiment scheduled to take data in 2010. The design of EBEX is presented here, including the scientific motivation for the experiment, and an overview of all its components, with particular attention paid to the read out electronics for its array of over 1300 <b>biometries</b> detectors. In the read out of such a large array of bolometers, which must be kept at ∼ 250 mK, running many signals down the same wire (i. e. multiplexing) is vital.

A hundred and twenty tadpoles at the 25 Gosner stage averaging weight and length was 0. 046 g and 6. 22 mm, respectively, were used. Survival rate, length, final weight, weight gain, feed consumption, apparent food conversion, specific growth rate and activities of chime, amylase, lipase and trypisin were the parameters evaluated, biweekly, in five <b>biometries.</b> Quadratic effect was observed for the length and the weight. There was larger growth of the tadpoles from the 15 th to the 45 th day (19. 82 mm). On the 15 th day, the tadpoles presented the largest specific growth rate (16. 93 %/day), and the largest weight gain (5. 460 g), feed intake (14. 099 g) and the best apparent food conversion (2. 46) was from the 45 th to the 60 th day. The specific activity of amylase was 205 times greater at 60 days when compared {{to the beginning of the}} experiment. The results demonstrated that, for the three enzymes studied, the action capacity over the tadpole chime increased significantly after the 30 th experimental day.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{early and}} late fetal growth in pregnancies conceived after gastric bypass surgery in relation to time from surgery to conception of pregnancy. METHODS: National cohort study on 387 Danish women, who had laparoscopic or open gastric bypass surgery prior to a singleton pregnancy in which first trimester screening was performed between January 2008 and June 2011. Data were derived from national registers (Danish National Registry of Patients and Danish National Birth Registry, Pregnancy Complications and Abortion-clinical quality database (PreCAb) and the Danish Fetal Medicine Database). Main outcome measures were {{early and late}} fetal growth in relation to time from bariatric surgery to conception of the pregnancy. Early fetal growth was expressed as "Fetal Growth Index": the ratio between the estimated number of days from first trimester ultrasound to second trimester ultrasound <b>biometries</b> and the actual calender time elapsed in days. Late fetal growth was expressed as the observed versus expected birthweight according to gestational age (GA). RESULTS: The surgery-to-conception interval ranged from 3 to 1851 days with a mean value of 502 (SD, 351) days. The mean "fetal growth index" was 0. 99 (SD, 0. 02) days/day and thus significantly lower than in the background population (mean, 1. 04 (SD, 0. 09) days/day, p< 0. 0001). The proportion of infants being small for gestational age was 18. 8 % {{and the proportion of}} large for gestational age infants was 6. 7 %. The correlation coefficients between surgery-to-conception time and "fetal growth index" and birthweight according to GA were 0. 01 (p =  0. 8) and 0. 04 (p =  0. 4), respectively.

40|$|Aim: To {{ascertain}} {{the accuracy of}} ultrasonographic fetal weight estimation in term pregnancy. Population: A total of 446 pregnant women who underwent obstetric ultrasound in our Maternal and Fetal Medicine Unit. Design: Retrospective, transversal, descriptive study. Methods: From the database of ultrasound exams conducted between July 2007 and June 2008, cases were selected if they complied with the following inclusion criteria: singleton pregnancy, absence of malformations, normal amniotic fluid index, complete record of fetal <b>biometries,</b> exam performed between the 37 th and 42 nd week of gestation by a senior Obstetrician, and delivery of a live newborn within 6 days of the ultrasound. Fetal weight was estimated according to 26 formulas. Results: Mean gestational age {{at the time of}} the exam was 38. 6 weeks with a standard deviation (sd) of 0. 8. Delivery occurred within 3. 9 (sd= 2. 1) days. The most accurate formula for prediction of newborn weight was Hadlock, which revealed an error of 6. 2 % (sd= 5, 2 %), a Pearson coefficient of 0. 81, and 78 % of correct estimations considering a + 10 % error. There were no significant differences in accuracy between the four senior Obstetricians who performed the exam, nor if the subjects were divided according to gestational age. Cephalic presentations rendered more accurate estimations than breech [6. 0 (sd= 5. 2) vs 7. 8 (sd= 5. 1), p = 0. 03]. Fetuses with low birth were less accurately estimated than those who were macrossomic [13. 3 (sd= 5. 5) vs 6. 9 (sd= 5. 6), p = 0. 03]. Higginbottom and Warsof formulas had the highest accuracy for identification of low birthweight and macrossomic fetuses, respectively. Conclusions: Ultrasonographic fetal weight estimation at term is a relatively accurate procedure, and the Hadlock formula provides the most precise results in fetuses with normal weigh.

Después de 80 días de cultivo se observó que el tratamiento T 3 (D 2 S 1) obtuvo los mejores crecimientos (7, 05 ± 2, 13 g) y los mejores porcentajes de supervivencia (97, 5 %) para el camarón gigante de malasia. Los dos niveles de adición de substrato fueron igualmente efectivos para el crecimiento del camarón, se encontró una relación inversa entre el incremento de los substratos y los porcentajes de supervivencia. El crecimiento en talla de la tilapia solo fue afectado por la interacción de los factores densidad y substrato donde los tratamientos T 2 (D 1 S 2) y T 3 (D 2 S 1) presentaron crecimientos significativamente mayores; el crecimiento en peso de la tilapia solo fue afectado por el factor substrato, encontrándose una relación directa; no se encontró diferencia significativa (p es menor que 0, 05) para los porcentajes de supervivencia. Se encontró una relación directa entre el incremento de la densidad y la biomasa final del camarón gigante de Malasia, siendo el nivel D 2 significativamente mayor que D 1. El tratamiento T 3 (690, 1 Kg ha- 1) presentó una biomasa significativamente mayor que T 2 (420, 9 Kg ha- 1) y T 1 (387, 1 Kg ha- 1), T 3 y T 4 no fueron significativamente diferentes (p es mayor que 0. 05). Para la tilapia se encontró una relación directa entre en incremento del substrato y la biomasa final, siendo el nivel S 2 significativamente mayor que S 1. La biomasa del tratamiento T 2 (629, 7 Kg ha- 1) fue significativamente mayor respecto a T 1 (453, 4 Kg ha- 1). En el análisis de producción los tratamientos T 2 y T 3 alcanzaron los mejores valores, el análisis de proyección mostró que el policultivo camarón tilapia, con adición de substrato, es una buena alternativa para obtener mejores rendimientos y ganancias...|$|R
40|$|The FREE SURF project aims at proposing new {{technologies}} {{for the next}} generations of video surveillance systems oriented to the automatic real-time control of the presence and actions undertaken by people in the environment, without the direct control of a human operator. The FREE SURF project is born with a twofold aim: first, innovative scientific {{research in the field}} of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, second, innovative applied research for the development of new generations of video surveillance systems, both effective and socially acceptable with respect to privacy concerns. The first objective is to conduct a thoughtful research activity in the field of Computer Engineering for video surveillance of people in "structural constraint FREE" systems, that is in systems free from structural and environmental constraints. The automatic visual control of human presence and actions in a given environment is, indeed, one of the most studied problems in the last decade. Nowadays, a very large literature exists, which presents algorithms and robust implementations for the recognition of single persons, in structured environments: closed environments with controlled illumination, open environments with large field of view (in order to consider people as small rigid moving objects), with few people, with only partially occluded fields of view, controlled by fixed cameras (to segment objects as different from the background), and installed with a precise manual calibration (for an exact 3 D reconstruction). The final objective of the project is to study innovative methodologies and techniques for going further on: the final targets are environments free from structural constraints, in scenes with more people that live together and interact each other, as in parks or tourist areas. The foreseen activities are devoted to the study of new ways to extract visual data, from distributed camera systems, from hybrid systems with active cameras, capable to automatically move toward a target, from moving cameras, and coordinated with networks of sensors. New algorithms will be studied and working prototypes developed for people segmentation and tracking in videos acquired by multiple auto-calibrated cameras, by exploiting geometrical information and appearance (color and texture). Approaches for active camera control and mosaicing of the scene from moving cameras will be studied. Moreover, mobile agents systems will be studied to coordinate cameras and sensor networks in large scenes like archaeological sites. These techniques will all implemented in separated modules by each RU, but they will be coordinated in a single architecture to provide a common interface for the reasoning modules. All the previous modules have the common objective to extract visual data on the people in the scene. In particular, trajectory computation with invariants independent of the point of view, people posture analysis and soft <b>biometries</b> are the main data that will be extracted. Differently from projects dealing with biometric analysis, the FREE SURF project is oriented to the automatic visual analysis of the presence and behavior of people independently of their identities, which are not easy to assess in noisy, low-resolution videos with large filed of view, like those typical of distributed video surveillance systems. As a further support, hybrid system with PTZ and mobile cameras can provide, if needed, information with more details, which can be used in "posterity logging" by the experts. The visual data are provided to modules for dual activities: to monitor dangerous situations in real time, and to annotate interesting situations for future off-line queries. The first is a strategic tool to help the human operator in the prevention and fast responsiveness to facts regarding security, the second provides a valid support to investigations and a-posteriori analysis. These solutions may enable the many existing surveillance systems to provide effective support in a predictive way. The second objective of the project is to define new solutions to answer to the social requirements of safety and security both for places and people with solutions made "in a privacy-respectful way". In Italy, {{as well as in the}} whole world, cameras are spreading everywhere. This is not a social problem by itself if the cameras were only intelligent sensors, such as fire sensors, capable to simply process videos and generate alarms. The social awkwardness comes from the fact that behind a camera there is a human operator that controls and watches, prejudicing the individual's privacy. While it is acceptable to use cameras by the public officers for security reasons in public places, the diffusion of private closed-circuit TV systems in department stores, shopping centers or even the diffusion of web-accessible webcams in public tourist places are not. The current laws on privacy are (rightly) very restrictive, but currently there is no technological mean to guarantee that such laws are respected: many installed systems, without video processing, are either not compliant with these laws or simply unusable and used only as a deterrent for criminality since they declare to have a such low resolution or a such deep field of view to prevent people identification. The aim of this project is, instead, to provide automatic tools for extracting visual information on people that can be, on the one side, used by authorized systems to automatically monitor the scene, and, on the other side, used to guarantee the removal of biometric data and, thus, the compatibility with privacy laws. In particular, robust algorithms for people tracking and face and head detection will be useful to obscure biometric data in real time. The reported objectives of the project are for sure ambitious, but they are also feasible in the timeframe of the project. Besides the limited funding requests to MIUR, the RUs have made available many man-months of people with already a great experience on the field and can benefit of the resources, both hardware and software, in their laboratories. The consortium is composed of three very active RUs at national level, in particular in the GIRPR (www. girpr. it) : all the three RUs have organized both the International Conf. of GIRPR (ICIAP), and the school for PhD students (VISMAC) that has been/will be held in Firenze, Palermo and Modena, in year 1999, 2001 and 2007 (ICIAP) and 1992, 2006 and 2000 (VISMAC). They are, moreover, very active at international level, with frequent PhD students and researchers with research centers in USA and other countries (such as the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia), and they have many active projects in the field. A very important aspect of the project is that it already contributes to the creation of a network of expressions of interest and collaborations. In particular, ITC-iRST of Trento, one of the most important non-university research centers in video surveillance, will participate to the project; big national companies such as SIRTI and ALCATEL have indicated their interest. Public entities such as Regione Emilia-Romagna and Parco Valle dei Templi di Agrigento have declared their interest in the project, as final users...|$|R
2500|$|Karl Pearson was {{important}} in {{the founding of the}} school of biometrics, which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, [...] "Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution" [...] established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for <b>biometry.</b> These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelian's favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.|$|E
