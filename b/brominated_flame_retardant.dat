40|$|<b>Brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{have entered}} the human food chain. For the time being the {{occurrence}} of these chemicals in Dutch food does not pose a human health risk. However, this might easily change at increasing contents of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food. The monitoring of <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food therefore remains necessary. <b>Brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are environmental contaminants which {{have entered the}} human food chain. Next to food these chemicals can also enter the human body by ingestion of house-dust. Due to their persistent behaviour <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> leave the human body very slowly. <b>Brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> therefore have bioaccumulating properties. In {{order to determine the}} health risk of <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> these chemicals have been investigated in Dutch food product and, as a measure of the amount in the body, in Dutch breast milk. In Dutch food twelve <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found, eleven of which also occurred in breast milk. Contrary to results in Sweden the content of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch breast milk did not decline between 1998 and 2003. For health risk assessment a maximal allowed intake level is needed. Such an intake level is only available for the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> PolyBromoDiphenylEther- 99 (PBDE- 99). At the moment the exposure to PBDE- 99 from food equals its maximal intake level. So, though the exposure to PBDE- 99 does not pose an immediate health risk, this may easily change when the content of <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food would increase.

40|$|Many modern products, {{especially}} electronic goods, {{are protected}} by <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> (BFR). Some {{of the most common}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). These compounds have been found in environmental samples and shown to have physiological effects on experimental animals. This thesis considers end-of-life aspects of <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> When spread in the environment, these compounds may be degraded into other forms. For example, if sludge contaminated with PBDE is used as an agricultural fertilizer, the PBDE could be degraded by sunlight to species of PBDE with lower degree of bromination and, to some extent, also form polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDF). In addition, PBDF and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDD) are formed during combustion of <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> When waste products with <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are co-combusted with household waste or other chlorinated fuel, polybrominated- chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBCDD) and polybrominated- chlorinated dibenzofurans (PBCDF) will be formed. The bromin/chlorine composition of dioxins and furans is dependent on the bromine/chlorine ratio in the fuel, but the types of <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> that are being combusted is less important. In the studies reported here, bromine levels higher than "normal" for household waste has been used. The results show that there is a pronounced increase in total dioxin levels in fluegas when when bromine is present, implying that waste containing <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> should only be incinerated at combustion plants with effecient air pollution control devices...|$|R

50|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{has been studied}} since the 1990s. Mainly <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found in many environmental compartments and organisms including humans, and some individual substances {{were found to have}} toxic properties.

The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus <b>brominated</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> About a dozen halogen free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings.
