40|$|BACKGROUND: Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{may be a}} form {{of extreme}} sexual conflict in which females benefit more from feeding on males than mating with them, and males avoid aggressive, cannibalistic females in order to increase net fitness. A thorough understanding of the adaptive significance of sexual cannibalism is hindered by our ignorance of its prevalence in nature. Furthermore, there are serious doubts about the food value of males, probably because most studies that attempt to document benefits of sexual cannibalism to the female have been conducted in the laboratory with non-natural alternative prey. Thus, to understand more fully the ecology and evolution of sexual cannibalism, field experiments are needed to document the prevalence of sexual cannibalism and its benefits to females. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted field experiments with the Mediterranean tarantula (Lycosa tarantula), a <b>burrowing</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spider,</b> to address these issues. At natural rates of encounter with males, approximately a third of L. tarantula females cannibalized the male. The rate of sexual cannibalism increased with male availability, and females were more likely to kill and consume an approaching male if they had previously mated with another male. We show that females benefit from feeding on a male by breeding earlier, producing 30 % more offspring per egg sac, and producing progeny of higher body condition. Offspring of sexually cannibalistic females dispersed earlier and were larger later in the season than spiderlings of non-cannibalistic females. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In nature a substantial fraction of female L. tarantula kill and consume approaching males instead of mating with them. This behaviour is more likely to occur if the female has mated previously. Cannibalistic females have higher rates of reproduction, and produce higher-quality offspring, than non-cannibalistic females. Our findings further suggest that female L. tarantula are nutrient-limited in nature and that males are high-quality prey. The results of these field experiments support the hypothesis that sexual cannibalism is adaptive to females...|$|E
50|$|A. brasiliensis males use pheromones {{to attract}} females, in {{contrast}} to most other <b>burrowing</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> where the females attract the males. Males have been observed to specifically cannibalize on older females that were lured into the male's burrow, while preferring mating with virgins. The first egg sac of A. brasiliensis females contains more eggs than later ones, which, together with the harsh habitat, gives this behavior an evolutionary advantage.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} various aspects of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the Lycosidae, with particular emphasis on <b>burrowing</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> Three species of the genus Zyuzicosa Logunov, 2010 exhibit pronounced SSD, having typical dwarf males that are half or {{less than half the}} size of females. It is argued that although the reported case of extreme SSD could reasonably be explained by the differential mortality model, understanding the evolutionary origin of extreme SSD in <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> is better elucidated by examining life-history theory integrated with aspects of whole organism ontogeny...|$|R
40|$|Background: Rivers {{around the}} world are drying with {{increasing}} frequency, but little is known about effects on terrestrial animal communities. Previous research along the San Pedro River in southeastern AZ, USA, suggests that changes in the availability of water resources associated with river drying lead to changes in predator abundance, community composition, diversity, and abundance of particular taxa of arthropods, but these observations have not yet been tested manipulatively. Methods and Results: In this study, we constructed artificial pools in the stream bed adjacent to a drying section of the San Pedro River and maintained them as the river dried. We compared pitfall trapped arthropods near artificial pools to adjacent control sites where surface waters temporarily dried. Assemblage composition changed differentially at multiple taxonomic levels, resulting in different assemblages at pools than at control sites, with multiple taxa and richness of carabid beetle genera increasing at pools but not at controls that dried. On the other hand, predator biomass, particularly <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> and diversity of orders and families were consistently higher at control sites that dried. These results suggest an important role for colonization dynamics of pools, as well as the ability of certain taxa, particularly <b>burrowing</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> to withstand periods of temporary drying. Conclusions: Overall, we found some agreement between this manipulative study of water resources and a previous analysis of river drying that showed shifts in composition, changes in diversity, and declines in abundance of certain tax...|$|R
40|$|<b>Burrowing</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> Geolycosa sp. (Araneae:Lycosidae), {{excavate}} vertical burrows and inhabit {{them throughout}} their lives or, {{in the case of}} males, until they mature and wander in search of mates. Three species: G. fatifera Kurata, G. missouriensis Banks, and G. rogersi Wallace were studied to understand how and at what expense the burrowing is accomplished. Normal and high-speed videography coupled with scanning electron microscopy revealed (a) that the convex surfaces of the two fangs, together, constitute the digging tool, (b) that boluses of soil are transported to the burrow entrance on the anterior surfaces of the chelicerae held there by the pedipalps, and (c) that each bolus is either incorporated into the growing turret or flung away, propelled by the forelegs. To elucidate the energetics of burrow construction, burrow volumes were calculated and then the costs associated with dislodging, elevating, and throwing the known volumes of soil were measured. A typical Geolycosa burrow, at a volume of 23. 6 ± 2. 0 ml and a depth of 13. 2 ± 0. 7 cm, required the removal of 918 boluses each weighing about 34 mg. The aggregate dislodging cost was close to 1. 9 Joules in sand/sandy loam and 5. 6 J in clayey subsoil, the work against gravity necessary to raise all of the boluses to the surface was about 0. 13 J, an...|$|R
40|$|Locomotion in the vagrant <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> Trochosa ruricola is {{compared}} {{to that in the}} <b>burrow</b> dwelling <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> Lycosa tarentula (Araneae: Lycosidae). L. tarentula takes relatively shorter steps than T. ruricola. At high speeds T. ruricola approximates an alternating tetrapod gait but this does not occur in L. tarentula. Phase lag differs between species and varies marginally with speed except for ipsilateral phase lags in L. tarentula which are erratic if they include leg 1. In both species the protraction/retraction ratio is directly related to both running speed and stepping frequency, but the relationship is more marked in L. tarentula. The protraction/retraction ratio is more variable in leg 1 and varies between legs along the body but by a greater amount in L. tarentula. In these spiders, in contrast to the situation in many insects, both the duration of protraction and retraction show marked inverse relationships to stepping frequency. The power stroke (retraction) occupies a variable proportion of the stepping cycle, which is not the case in other spiders, and this proportion is lower than for other spiders. It is suggested that the first pair of legs is used more for sensory than for locomotory purpose and that this is more marked in the burrow dwelling species, L. tarentula...|$|R

40|$|Predators {{influence}} prey through consumption, {{and through}} trait-mediated effects such as emigration {{in response to}} predation risk (risk effects). We studied top-down effects of (sub-) adult <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> (Lycosidae) on arthropods in a meadow. We compared risk effects with the overall top-down effect (including consumption) by gluing the chelicers of <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> {{to prevent them from}} killing the prey. In a field experiment, we created three treatments that included either: (i) intact (‘predation’) wolf spiders; (ii) <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> with glued chelicers (‘risk spiders’); or (iii) no (sub-) adult <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> Young <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> were reduced by their (sub-) adult congeners. Densities of sheetweb spiders (Linyphiidae), a known intraguild prey of <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> were equally reduced by the presence of risk and predation <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> Plant- and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) showed the inverse pattern of higher densities in the presence of both risk and predation <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> We conclude that (sub-) adult <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> acted as top predators, which reduced densities of intermediate predators and thereby enhanced herbivores. Complementary to earlier studies that found trait-mediated herbivore suppression, our results demonstrate that herbivores can be enhanced through cascading risk effects by top predators...|$|R

40|$|Animal decorations are {{normally}} interpreted as signals of quality. In spiders, however, decorations {{may have different}} functions, including the attraction of prey to the web or making the spider cryptic to predators. To date, there is scant evidence for the latter hypothesis. Here we use the burrow-decorating <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> Lycosa tarantula to test whether turrets around the burrow serve to prevent burrow invasion and predation from the Occitan scorpion Buthus occitanus. We located spiders and scorpions in field enclosures and manipulated {{the presence or absence}} of decorations or turrets. We found that the presence of the turret decreases the rate of burrow invasion and improves spider survival, possibly because the turret makes the burrow cryptic to scorpions. In addition, a field survey showed that burrows with larger decorations had a lower chance of being invaded by scorpions. These results provide evidence that the decoration has an antipredatory function in nature.
