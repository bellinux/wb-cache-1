Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF <b>Base</b> Williamtown, {{which has been}} the main F/A-18 <b>base</b> throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF <b>Base</b> Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air <b>base</b> between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million so that it could accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF <b>Base</b> Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime.|$|E

5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first <b>base,</b> at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first <b>base</b> without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on <b>base.</b> A batter-runner may choose to remain at first <b>base</b> or attempt to advance to second <b>base</b> or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches <b>base</b> despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first <b>base</b> safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second <b>base</b> safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third <b>base,</b> a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on <b>base</b> may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches <b>base</b> due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E
