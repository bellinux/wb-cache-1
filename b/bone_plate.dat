5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive <b>bone</b> <b>plate.</b> On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval <b>bone</b> <b>plate,</b> with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
25|$|To {{power the}} flippers, the {{shoulder}} girdle and the pelvis had been greatly modified, developing into broad bone plates at {{the underside of}} the body, which served as an attachment surface for large muscle groups, able to pull the limbs downwards. In the shoulder, the coracoid had become the largest element covering the major part of the breast. The scapula was much smaller, forming the outer front edge of the trunk. To the middle, it continued into a clavicle and finally a small interclavicular bone. As with most tetrapods, the shoulder joint was formed by the scapula and coracoid. In the pelvis, the <b>bone</b> <b>plate</b> was formed by the ischium at the rear and the larger pubic bone in front of it. The ilium, which in land vertebrates bears the weight of the hindlimb, had become a small element at the rear, no longer attached to either the pubic bone or the thighbone. The hip joint was formed by the ischium and the pubic bone. The pectoral and pelvic plates were connected by a plastron, a bone cage formed by the paired belly ribs that each had a middle and an outer section. This arrangement immobilised the entire trunk.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to review}} {{biomaterials}} used in manufacturing <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> including advances {{in recent years}} and prospect in the future. It has found among all biomaterials, currently titanium and stainless steel alloys are the most common in production of <b>bone</b> <b>plates.</b> Other biomaterials such as Mg alloys, Ta alloys, SMAs, carbon fiber composites and bioceramics are potentially suitable for <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> because of their advantages in biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradability. However, today either they are not used in <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> or have limited applications in only some flexible small-size implants. This problem is mainly related to their poor mechanical properties. Additionally, production processes play an effective role. Therefore, in the future, further studies should be conducted to solve these problems and make them feasible for heavy-duty <b>bone</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} <b>bone</b> <b>plating</b> in four {{children}} (6 femurs, 2 tibias) with osteogenesis imperfecta type III were analyzed. Average age {{at time of}} operation was 44 months. In three of the femurs, multiple platings were performed {{for a total of}} 13 bone platings in the eight bones studied. Average time to revision following plating was 27 months. Indications for revision included fracture (6), deformity (3), hardware failure (3), and nonunion (1). Other complications included one case of compartment syndrome. All eight bones were ultimately revised to elongating intramedullary Bailey-Dubow rods. <b>Bone</b> <b>plating</b> in skeletally immature patients with osteogenesis imperfecta does not provide better outcome than elongating rods.

500|$|Between 1835 and 1849, Danish {{zoologist}} Peter Wilhelm Lund collected abundant {{remains of}} mammals around {{the village of}} Lagoa Santa in Brazil. After his death, his fellow Dane Herluf Winge described Lund's collections in detail, among many others publishing a monograph about the rodents of the collection in 1887. Winge described numerous new species, many of which received little attention from systematists afterward, and among these is the species he named Calomys anoblepas. The specific name, anoblepas, derives from the Greek [...] (ano) [...] "upwards" [...] and [...] (blepo) [...] "to look" [...] and thus means [...] "looking upward". Although Winge did not explain the name, it most likely refers to the zygomatic plate (a <b>bone</b> <b>plate</b> {{at the side of}} the skull), which is bended outward. Winge understood the genus Calomys in a sense very different from that used today, including in it the species Calomys longicaudatus (currently Oligoryzomys nigripes), Calomys coronatus (currently Euryoryzomys russatus), Calomys rex (currently Sooretamys angouya), Calomys laticeps (currently Cerradomys subflavus), Calomys saltator (currently Hylaeamys laticeps), and Calomys plebejus (currently Delomys, species uncertain). He wrote that C.anoblepas was the most divergent of the species of Calomys, but that it was similar to C.longicaudatus.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{titanium}} {{and steel}} <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> to fix fractured limbs can create problems due to stress shielding, bone resorption and subsequent refracture. Here, braided carbon fibre reinforced poly-ether-etherketone (CF/PEEK) was evaluated {{as a possible}} implant material that could reduce these problems. CF/PEEK <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> were aged in a simulated body environment for up to 12 weeks and then mechanically tested in 3 and 4 -point bending tests. Sample mass increased by around 0. 3 wt. %, yet bending stiffness and strength remained unchanged. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed no changes in failure modes with age. Braided CF/PEEK shows an excellent resistance to fatigue failure even after prolonged ageing, easily surpassing the fatigue life of commonly used stainless steel alloys such as 316 L. In addition, CF/PEEK had half the stiffness of steel for the same static strength, which would reduce stress shielding. Together, {{the results suggest that}} CF/PEEK is a highly suitable material for <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> and should be further investigated for this application...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{an attempt}} to contain {{the high cost of}} commercially {{available}} pedicle screw systems, several authors have used unconventional alternatives such as locally made plates or dynamic compression plates (DCP) along with cancellous screws for transpedicular fixation of the thoracolumbar spine. These plates, however, allow {{for a wide range of}} motion at the plate-screw interphase and the construct does not provide stability in the sagittal plane. Round hole <b>bone</b> <b>plates,</b> on the other hand, allow much less mobility at the plate-screw interphase and the final construct offers better stability in the sagittal plane. Our objective was to determine the clinical, radiologic, and functional status of patients who underwent posterior fracture fixation using round hole <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> and cancellous screws, and evaluate the construct&#x 2032;s ability to maintain reduction of the fracture. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective follow-up of patients with fractures around the thoracolumbar junction fixed using round hole <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> and cancellous transpedicular screws. Round hole <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> along with 6. 5 mm transpedicular cancellous screws were used for posterior spinal instrumentation in neurologically intact patients with isolated unstable fractures of the last thoracic or first lumbar vertebra. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in this study. Their mean follow-up was 10 months (range 5 to 12). All had evidence of fusion at a mean of 5 months (range 4 to 7). No patient had breakage or loosening of the screws and none had breakage of the plate. The mean kyphosis angle at the fracture site was 34 degrees preoperatively, [...] 4 degrees in the immediate postoperative period, and 3 degrees on final follow-up radiographs. The percentage loss of anterior vertebral body height was 51 &#x 0025; preoperatively, 15 &#x 0025; in the immediate postoperative period, and 16 &#x 0025; on final follow-up radiographs. CONCLUSION: The use of round hole <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> along with 6. 5 mm cancellous screws inserted into the pedicles provides an angle-stable construct that allows for better stability in the sagittal plane. It is effective in the surgical treatment of unstable fractures around the thoracolumbar junction. Because of their low cost and ease of insertion, round hole <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> are an excellent choice for short arthrodesis and instrumentation of such fractures...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{velocity}} and attenuation characteristics of ultrasonic waves in cortical bone and bone mimics {{is important for}} studies of osteoporosis and fractures. Three complementary approaches {{have been used to}} help understand the ultrasound propagation in cortical bone and bone mimics immersed in water, which is used to simulate the surrounding tissue in vivo. The approaches used were Lamb wave propagation analysis, experimental measurement and two-dimensional (2 D) finite difference modelling. First, the water loading effects on the free plate Lamb modes in acrylic and human cortical <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> were examined. This theoretical study revealed that both the S 0 and S 1 mode velocity curves are significantly changed in acrylic: mode jumping occurs between the S 0 and S 1 dispersion curves. However, in human cortical <b>bone</b> <b>plates,</b> only the S 1 mode curve is significantly altered by water loading, with the S 0 mode exhibiting a small deviation from the unloaded curve. The Lamb wave theory predictions for velocity and attenuation were then tested experimentally on acrylic plates using an axial transmission technique. Finally, 2 D finite difference numerical simulations of the experimental measurements were performed. The predictions from Lamb wave theory do not correspond to the measured and simulated first arrival signal (FAS) velocity and attenuation results for acrylic and human cortical <b>bone</b> <b>plates</b> obtained using the axial transmission technique, except in very thin plates...|$|R
