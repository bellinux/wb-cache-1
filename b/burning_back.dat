[...] Much of this growth was {{on the west side}} of the fire where it was <b>burning</b> <b>back</b> into the Three Sisters Wilderness, moving toward Lava Camp Lake and North Matthieu Lake. [...] In the morning, air {{operations}} had to stand down for about hour during the solar eclipse. [...] Ground crews also paused briefly to watch the eclipse. [...] During the day, ground and air operations continued to focus on the east side of the fire where crews extended and strengthened fire lines to ensure private property near Sisters remained secure while Oregon State Fire Marshal teams patrol the evacuated neighborhoods. [...] In the afternoon, air operations had to be discontinued due to heavy smoke that created a flight safety hazard. [...] By the end of the day, the fire had grown to [...] with 644 firefighters on scene. [...] The Forest Service estimated that the fire was 20 percent contained. On August 22, the day began with 675 firefighters assigned to the fire. [...] Because the northeast and southeast sides of the fire were effectively contained, fire managers shifted firefighting resources to the northwest side where the fire still threatened some homes and private property. [...] However, some crews remained on the east side to patrol fire lines, spraying water to hot spots and looking for spot fires. [...] The state fire marshal crews also continued to patrol evacuated neighborhoods and began assessing fire risk at Black Butte Ranch and other area along the Route 242 corridor west of Sisters. During the day, fire activity was moderate with the flames moving westward along the north side of Black Crater and slowly backing down the southern slope of Black Crater toward Lava Lake Camp and North Matthieu Lake. [...] There was torching and crowning in isolated areas when winds pushed the fire up steep slopes. [...] However, aircraft remained grounded all day due to smoky conditions. [...] In the late afternoon, crews prepared to do burnout work on the northwest side of the fire if nighttime weather condition were favorable.|$|E

While controlled burns utilize <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> during planned fire events {{to create a}} [...] "black line", <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> or backfiring is also done to stop a wildfire that is already in progress. Firebreaks are also often used as an anchor point to start a line of fires along natural or manmade features such as a river, road or a bulldozed clearing. It is called <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> because the small fires are designed to 'burn back towards the main fire front' and are usually burning and traveling against ground level winds.|$|R

40|$|Sclerotinia {{stem and}} crown rot of alfalfa {{can be a}} {{significant}} disease in California’s Central Valley in wet and/or foggy winters. Previous studies have failed to demonstrate significant control with cultural and weed control measures. Planting in September has numerous advantages in terms of stand establishment, seedling survival, and subsequent yields compared to the more traditional planting times of November through February. However, in years conducive to Sclerotinia crown and stem rot, growers feel the advantages of early seeding are negated by stand loss due to this disease. No fungicides are currently registered for controlling this disease in California. Because moisture and humidity favor disease, one management strategy has been to minimize canopy by <b>burning</b> <b>back</b> plant and weed growth with paraquat (Gramoxone Max). Two trials {{in the winter of}} 2004 / 2005 evaluated unregistered fungicides in addition to cultural and weed control measures.

40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the burner back into the boiler room (or {{back into the living}} room from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> in the stoker. There can be a number of reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that firing equipment shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against <b>back</b> <b>burning.</b> The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and wood chip burners, in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against <b>back</b> <b>burning.</b> However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (temperature limiter, water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners in order to ensure that it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> in older designs of wood chip burners using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel feed chute. Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such <b>back</b> <b>burning.</b> Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip wood burners are next reviewe...|$|R

30|$|Our review {{revealed}} several anthropogenic {{causes of}} veld fires, {{which can be}} divided into two categories which are deliberate and accidental fires (WWF 2001). Deliberate fires comprise fires used for hunting, improving grazing, early <b>burning</b> and or <b>back</b> <b>burning</b> to reduce the fuel load and negative impact of wild fires, creation of fire breaks, arson and smoking out bees during harvesting of wild honey (WWF 2001). Other deliberate causes of wild fires also include cooking, waste dumps, and carelessness such as throwing out lit cigarettes, religious and the traditional practice of annual burns to improve grazing (Mudekwe 2007), fires to flush out game, fires to please the rain gods particularly when there is an impending drought and safari hunters who deliberately start or leave campfires unextinguished (Judge 1975). Accidental fires may arise from locomotives along some of the major railway lines such as the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls railway line, which has been reported to cause a number of fires, in addition to fires that are caused by lightning or spontaneous combustion during very hot dry summers (Bond et al. 2003; Mudekwe 2007).|$|R
