For example, the <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> cut method that combines both <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> bound and cutting plane methods. <b>Branch</b> <b>and</b> bound algorithms {{have a number}} of advantages over algorithms that only use cutting planes. One advantage is that the algorithms can be terminated early and as long as at least one integral solution has been found, a feasible, although not necessarily optimal, solution can be returned. Further, the solutions of the LP relaxations can be used to provide a worst-case estimate of how far from optimality the returned solution is. Finally, <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> bound methods can be used to return multiple optimal solutions.|$|R

This paper investigates the computational feasibility of <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> bound methods in solving convex nonlinear integer programming problems.

Since {{the efficiency of the}} algorithm also depends on how fast an upper bound on the objective minimum is attained, heuristic rules are developed to locate an integer feasible solution to provide an upper bound. The different criteria for selecting branching variables, <b>branching</b> nodes, <b>and</b> heuristics form a total of 27 <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> bound strategies.
