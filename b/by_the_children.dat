5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Word of Seymour and Edna's {{relationship}} quickly spreads throughout Springfield, {{with the}} story growing more illicit and exaggerated with each passing turn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> An appalled Chief Wiggum, upon hearing his son Ralph's less than accurate version of the events, alerts Superintendent Chalmers. Chalmers gives Seymour an ultimatum – end the relationship or have both of them face dismissal. Seymour decides that love is stronger than his professional goals, so Chalmers fires him and Edna, expecting them to leave the school {{at the end of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

5|$|From about 1970, Hubbard was {{attended}} aboard ship <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO).

In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959. The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors, though Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, it was {{announced}} that a contest would determine the mascot of the games. Children under the age of 16 had until March 8, 2013 to submit their ideas. 4,000 ideas and drawings were submitted to the organizing committee during this time frame. In April 2013, a shortlist of six mascot designs (which were produced by professional graphic designers, with the sketches <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> as models) were released, including a raccoon, beaver, moose, two pixie creature twins, porcupine and an owl. The final six were selected based on originality, how well they represent Canadian culture and the branding of the Games, and the appeal they had amongst adults and children. On April 22, 2013, the general public was allowed to vote for the mascot they felt was the best. Voting was open until May 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> as being Flemish.|$|E
5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains.

40|$|This {{study was}} to examine the effect of the mother’s rearing {{attitude}} and mother-child relationship, as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> on adjustment to school life. The present study investigated how the mother’s rearing attitude and mother-child relationship, as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> influence school life adjustment. The participants were 300 4 th grade elementary school students (173 boys and 127 girls), in Seoul. The data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation and multiple regression, by SPSS 12. 0 program. The results were as follows: 1) <b>The</b> <b>child</b> who perceived <b>the</b> mother’s rearing attitude to be more rational and democratic, was more adaptive in school life. 2) The mother-child relationship that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> perceived, had a positive relationship with the school life adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> <b>The</b> <b>child</b> who perceived <b>the</b> mother-child relationship more positively, was more adaptive in school life. 3) In relationship with the teacher and school class, the mother’s democratic rearing attitude, as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> was found to be the most affecting factor. In relationship with the classmates and school rules, the mother-child relationship, as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> was found to be the most affecting factor. 주제어(Keywords) :어머니의양육태도(mother’s rearing attitude), 어머니-자녀관계(mother-child relationship), 학교생활적응(school adjustment...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the level of marital adjustment <b>the</b> <b>child</b> perceives <b>the</b> parents as having obtained and the degree of self-acceptance exhibited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> It has been proposed by theorists and researchers that the individual is influenced by his environment as it appears to him. The perception of the environment leads to the development of concepts concerning self, others, and situations. Thus, it becomes necessary to discover the concepts which <b>the</b> <b>child</b> has concerning <b>the</b> parental marital adjustment based on his perception of the situation. A secondary {{purpose of this}} study is to determine if a relationship exists between <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> perception of <b>the</b> parental marital adjustment and the parent’s perception of their marital situation. On the basis of current personality theory and prior research in this area, two hypotheses are proposed:(1) High parental martial adjustment as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> will be significantly related to high self-acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> Low parental marital adjustment as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, will be related to low self-acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> (2) No significant relationship exists between the parental marital adjustment as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and <b>the</b> parental marital adjustment as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parents.
