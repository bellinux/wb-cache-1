25|$|In the {{classical}} age Caieta, {{famous for its}} lovely and temperate climate, like the neighbouring Formia and Sperlonga, was a tourist resort and site of the seaside villas of many important and rich characters of Rome. Like the other Roman resorts, Caieta {{was linked to the}} capital of the Empire by Via Appia and its end trunk Via Flacca (or Valeria), through an opposite diverticulum or <b>by-road.</b> Its port was of great importance in trade and in war, and was restored under Emperor Antoninus Pius. Among its antiquities is the mausoleum of Lucius Munatius Plancus.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-day we {{were going}} to Blenheim," [...] said the colonel, [...] "but I thought I would try these new tits a bit on a <b>by-road</b> first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some of them knew. And {{he himself}} showed us this very <b>by-road</b> yesterday, {{when we took}} up our ground, and told us it might be of service on occasion--and so it has been.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The Visite du Branchage {{applies to}} all public roads {{including}} main roads, <b>by-roads</b> and footpaths.|$|R
60|$|During {{the three}} or four {{succeeding}} years a quaint and singular vehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and <b>by-roads</b> near Marygreen, driven in a quaint and singular way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I? My leg {{is hurting}} me a bit. Ireland {{is a great}} country, but its <b>by-roads</b> are not {{the best in the}} world, and this jolting shakes me up a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madonna," [...] said I. [...] "It were wiser {{to choose}} the <b>by-road</b> and forego the escort, since we have {{dispensed}} with it so far. There are many reasons why a lady should not seek to enter Fano at this hour of night." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was nearly}} five o'clock {{when they reached}} a place at which a <b>by-road</b> {{branched}} off, through a wood, from the highway which they had hitherto followed. Mrs. Lewson found a seat on a felled tree. [...] "We had better not go any farther," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|Lucetta's {{reply was}} taken from her lips by an {{unexpected}} diversion. A <b>by-road</b> on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway {{at the point where}} she stood, and down the track a bull was rambling uncertainly towards her and Elizabeth, who, facing the other way, did not observe him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Beam {{says that}} there are some <b>by-roads</b> just ahead of us, and as he was afraid you might turn into one and get lost, he thought it better to wait for you." ...|$|R
50|$|The Parish Assembly elects two Roads Inspectors {{for each}} Vingtaine Cueillette in St Ouen for a three-year {{term of office}} in {{accordance}} with the Loi (1914) sur la Voirie. Roads Inspectors are responsible for the repair of <b>by-roads</b> of the Parish and have to ensure the instructions of the Roads Committee are carried out.|$|R
60|$|Away from Naples in {{a glorious}} sunrise, {{by the road}} to Capua, and then on a three days' journey along <b>by-roads,</b> that we may see, on the way, the monastery of Monte Cassino, which is perched on the steep and lofty hill above {{the little town of}} San Germano, and is lost on a misty morning in the clouds.|$|R
6000|$|They {{were now}} in the black <b>by-road</b> near the place, and the Hands were {{crowding}} in. The bell was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the Elephant was getting ready. The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell. It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard, she said, and sounded grand! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'On {{his way to}} prison, {{where he}} was taken by a party of soldiers. They took a <b>by-road,</b> and not the one we expected. I {{was one of the}} few who tried to rescue him, and he called to me, and told me to tell Hugh where he was. We made a good struggle, though it failed. Look here!' ...|$|E
60|$|Venn made a {{farewell}} obeisance, {{and walked back}} to his former position, where the <b>by-road</b> from Mistover joined the highway. Here he remained fixed for nearly half an hour, and then another pair of lights came down the hill. It was the old-fashioned wheeled nondescript belonging to the captain, and Thomasin sat in it alone, driven by Charley.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is unfortunate, {{for they}} will leave little behind {{them in the}} way of food and drink; and we shall find it better to travel by <b>by-roads.</b> I should not mind being impressed, if it were only for the march down to Badajoz; but once with an army, there is no saying how long one may be kept." ...|$|R
50|$|Demmin {{lies on the}} West Pomeranian plain at the {{confluence}} of the rivers Peene, Tollense and Trebel. Lake Kummerow and the Bay of Stettin (Oderhaff) may be reached by boat on the Peene, Neubrandenburg via Altentreptow on <b>by-roads</b> and cycleways. The area of {{the confluence}}s of the Tollense and Trebel with the Peene are called the Three Streams Land (Dreistromland) for tourist purposes and borrowing from the ancient land of Zweistromland).|$|R
5000|$|Malay Falls is a {{small rural}} {{community}} located in the Halifax Regional Municipality in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The community is located inland from the Atlantic Ocean, along the Malay Falls Flowage, a flowage of East River Sheet Harbour. The community is also located primarily along Route 374, {{as well as some}} <b>by-roads.</b> There is a weather station in Malay Falls, which is run by the Government of Canada.|$|R
60|$|By this time, {{the boys}} had {{got to the top}} of the hill, and they got into the sleigh, and rode along. Presently, they came to a place where Jonas was going to turn off, into a sort of <b>by-road</b> which led away into the woods, where the pine-trees grew. The man that owned the trees lived pretty near, in a farm-house.|$|E
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Ormond's {{place of}} {{residence}} stood alone, surrounded by its own grounds. A wooden fence separated the property, on one side, from a muddy little <b>by-road,</b> leading to a neighbouring farm. At a wicket-gate in this fence, giving admission to a shrubbery situated at {{some distance from the}} house, Amelius now waited for the appearance of the maid.|$|E
60|$|The worst runners now {{came in for}} an {{unexpected}} share of the sport in consequence of this new turn of affairs, for the <b>by-road</b> conducted Kenneth {{back to the main}} street, and when he debouched into it he ran into and overturned a number of those who had just made up their minds that it was useless for them to run any farther.|$|E
60|$|I was {{too much}} {{exhausted}} to continue the argument; and, still numbed and torpid in all my limbs, permitted myself without reluctance {{to be placed on}} a horse brought for the purpose. My formidable conductor rode on the one side, and another person on the other, keeping me upright in the saddle. In this manner we travelled forward at a considerable rate, and by <b>by-roads,</b> with which my attendant seemed as familiar as with the perilous passages of the Solway.|$|R
50|$|In Jersey, the Roads Committee (French: Comité des Chemins) is {{the highway}} {{authority}} for Parish roads in each Parish. In {{accordance with the}} Loi (1914) sur la Voirie it superintends the repair and maintenance of <b>by-roads</b> in the Parish, establishes boundary stones, issues Choses Publiques licenses, examines planning applications that fall within its responsibilities, supervises refuse collection, adjudicates fines during the Visite du Branchage, and proposes new road names, as may be necessary, for approval by the Parish Assembly. The Connétable presides over the Roads Committee which also includes the Rector and three Principals of the Parish Principals for St Helier elected for a term of three years by the Parish Assembly.|$|R
60|$|Taking my way eastward {{through the}} great city, I stopped at the first office that I passed, and secured my place by the early coach to Ipswich. Thence I {{traveled}} with post-horses to the market-town which was nearest to Greenwater Broad. A walk of a few miles in the cool evening brought me, through well-remembered <b>by-roads,</b> to our old house. By the last rays {{of the setting sun}} I looked at the familiar row of windows in front, and saw that the shutters were all closed. Not a living creature was visible anywhere. Not even a dog barked as I rang the great bell at the door. The place was deserted; the house was shut up.|$|R
60|$|It was at {{the corner}} of the house, I remember, looking two ways. On one side to a stable-yard open to a <b>by-road,</b> where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage, and beyond that to the <b>by-road</b> itself, across which the sign was heavily swinging; on the other side to a wood of dark pine-trees. Their {{branches}} were encumbered with snow, and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window. Night was setting in, and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window-pane. As I looked among the stems of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it, I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die.|$|E
60|$|We issued at last upon {{a country}} <b>by-road</b> {{where we might}} walk abreast and without precaution. It was nine miles to Aylesbury, our {{immediate}} destination; by a watch, which formed part of my new outfit, it should be about half-past three in the morning; and as we did not choose to arrive before daylight, time could {{not be said to}} press. I gave the order to march at ease.|$|E
60|$|The Norcester highroad, when it {{has passed}} the village of Brackling, turns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks. From this the road twists to the left again, making a double curve, and then runs to Norling Parva in a clear stretch of some miles before {{reaching}} the sharp turn down the hill which is marked 'Dangerous to Cyclists.' From the latter village branches the <b>by-road</b> over the hill which is the short cut to Normanstand.|$|E
60|$|Rigg saw {{him leave}} the grounds {{and enter the}} lane. The gray day had turned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the grassy borders of the <b>by-roads,</b> and hastened the laborers who were loading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot, looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and {{industry}} {{as if he had}} been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to stare at him except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of his appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at his approach.|$|R
60|$|Dora now {{thought it}} was time to say something. She was irritated because Herbert had {{returned}} so soon, and because {{he was going to take}} her away before she was ready to go; and although she would have been delighted to have a drive in the Cobhurst gig, provided the proper person drove her, she did not at all wish to return to Thorbury in that ridiculous old vehicle with Herbert. In the one case, she could imagine a delightful excursion in she knew not what romantic <b>by-roads</b> and shaded lanes; but in the other, she saw only the jogging old gig, and all the neighbors asking what had happened to them.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} written accounts we have {{of residents}} in the area date from the 18th century—as the city spread southwards houses on the main roads or in select <b>by-roads</b> such as Charlemont Mall were occupied by the better-off citizens. This trend continued {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, but with the development of the smaller streets from around 1860 and finally the artisans' dwellings, a mix of classes ended up in the area. By the beginning of the 20th century, the grand houses that had been erected along the Grand Canal had been turned into poverty-stricken tenements, while more exclusive suburbs such as Terenure and Rathgar became the havens of the rich. The following list shows the range of people that have been associated with the area over the past 200 years.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{point in}} the highway near which the road to Mellstock {{branched}} off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the <b>by-road</b> aforesaid. Farfrae's off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard's face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist.|$|E
60|$|The morrow was Sunday, a sunny day, but a cold evening. The sky was grey, the new foliage very green, {{but the air}} was {{chill and}} depressing. Albert walked briskly down the white road towards Beeley. He crossed a larch plantation, and {{followed}} a narrow <b>by-road,</b> where blue speedwell flowers fell from the banks into the dust. He walked swinging his cane, with mixed sensations. Then having gone a certain length, he turned {{and began to walk}} in the opposite direction.|$|E
60|$|I {{crossed the}} park, and left my own {{possessions}} behind me. Following a <b>by-road,</b> I {{came to our}} well-known river; so beautiful in itself, so famous among trout-fishers throughout Scotland. It was not then the fishing season. No human being was in sight as I took my seat on the bank. The old stone bridge which spanned the stream was within a hundred yards of me; the setting sun still tinged the swift-flowing water under the arches with its red and dying light.|$|E
60|$|It {{was close}} upon that hour when the {{regiment}} marched. It was known {{that there were}} no French troops west of the Huebra but, after fording the Aqueda, the force halted until nightfall; and then moved forward and reached the Huebra at midnight, lay down to sleep until daybreak, and then extended along the bank of the Yeltes, as far as its source among the mountains; thus cutting the roads from Ciudad to Salamanca and the North. The distance to be watched was some twenty miles but, as the river was in many places unfordable, it was necessary only to place patrols here; while strong parties were posted, not only on the main roads, but at all points where <b>by-roads</b> or peasants' tracks led down to the bank.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} we have done enough for the present," [...] Terence said. [...] "We will leave it {{to the rest of the}} army to do a little {{fighting}} now. We have lost, in killed and wounded, some two hundred men, and I don't wish to see the whole force dwindle away. I propose that we do not go near Braga. I have no idea of putting myself under the command of Friere; I have seen enough of him already. So we will travel by <b>by-roads</b> till we get near Oporto, then we will find out how matters stand there. My own idea is that when the French army approaches, the Junta's courage will ooze out of its finger ends, and that the 50,000 peasants, which it calls an army, will bolt at the first attack of the French. So, as I don't mean to be trapped there, we will rest on our laurels until we see how matters go." ...|$|R
