40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the simulation, {{analysis}} {{and control of the}} energy flow in a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). HEVs operation is concerned with the on <b>board</b> <b>conversion</b> of chemical, electric and mechanic energy and its optimal control is essential in order to increase the global system efficiency. A dynamic model is used to describe the driver-vehicle interaction for a generic transient and to simulate the vehicle driveline, the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the electric motor/generator (EM). An estimate of future vehicle load is performed with a neural network to optimize the supervisory control strategy during the estimated future time window. A description of the whole model is presented and the simulation results carried out for a real driving cycle are reported...|$|E

The system processes signals from approximately 7, 000 drift wires and is unusual in that most electronic functions are packaged on printed circuit boards within the detector.

Chase filed a motion to dismiss on July 15, 2003, arguing that a judicial resolution would require a court to interpret religious doctrine. The motion was granted September 29, 2003. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Montana in 2004, and a decision came February 15, 2005,"Chase argues that the Guardianship, a religious office, vests him with {{the presidency of the}} corporation, a secular one, and that it is through holding the latter that he rightfully controls the corporate property. The presidency thus serves in this instance as the temporal nexus between the world of faith, represented by the Guardianship, and the secular world, in which laws define the relationships between persons, corporate or otherwise, and property.""This dispute revolves around two basic issues: the composition of the Board, and the powers of the presidency in relation to the church property...

The <b>conversion</b> may have reflected {{the impact of the}} Hospitals Act of 1923, which introduced a system of partly government-funded district hospitals, transforming public hospitals from charitable institutions for the poor to essential community services and a government responsibility. This system was enhanced under the Hospitals Act of 1936 and from 1 January 1946 access to public hospital treatment was made free for all Queenslanders. Between 1920 and 1940 the number of beds in Queensland's public hospitals rose from 3,700 to 7,606, increasing at a greater rate than population growth. In addition, the government- run hospitals tended to be better equipped than the small local private hospitals.|$|R

The diagnostic system, comprising a personal computer with an analog-to-digital <b>conversion</b> <b>board,</b> a diagnostic system unit, and software, uses time-synchronous averaging of the vibration signal to produce a vibration image of each tooth on any gear in a transmission. Several parameters were analyzed including gear pair stress wave and raw baseband vibration, kurtosis, peak ratios, and others. The system provides limits for the various parameters and gives a warning when the limits are exceeded. Several spur gear tests were conducted with this system and vibration data analyzed at 5 -min. intervals. The results presented herein show {{that the system is}} fairly effective at detecting spur gear tooth surface fatigue pitting failures...|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} dissertation as {{novel is}} the coming-of-age {{story of the}} title character, an orphan whose parents have recently drowned at a lake that has peculiar and specific resonance to their family. Cameron 2 ̆ 7 s voice {{is that of a}} seventeen-year-old girl negotiating ideas of social responsibility and searching for a language of subjectivity that evades the prescriptive determinations of heteronormative culture. Her quest for an understanding of her selfhood/identity is tempered by her obsession with popular culture in the form of VHS rentals. These pop cultural references help to dramatize Cameron 2 ̆ 7 s need to find her burgeoning queer identity reflected in satisfying ways in the “adult” culture that surrounds her. In terms of craft, this is a work concerned with using the first-person point of view to reveal to readers a layered, and often uncertain, or even contradictory, narrator.

30|$|The working {{principle}} is that {{power is supplied}} to the wireless receiving board and the outer magnetic ring on the cover by the cable and voltage-stabilizing circuit board. The rotating inner magnetic ring receives the voltage-stabilizing signal by wireless induction transmission, and all sensors in the detection roller and all the circuit boards on the rotating head are powered by the excitation power board. The output signals of sensor are gathered by the analog acquisition board, and the digital processing <b>board</b> implements analog-to-digital <b>conversion.</b> Digital processing and coding are performed under the conditions of magnetic coupling isolation and photoelectric isolation. The signals are then delivered to the wireless transmission board. The wireless transmission board converts the signals into high-frequency wireless signals and transmits the wireless signals to the wireless receiving board. The wireless receiving board converts the wireless signals to wired signals. Finally, the signals are transmitted to the remote signal-processing computer via the shielded cable.|$|R
