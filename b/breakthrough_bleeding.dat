5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding.</b>|$|E

5000|$|After {{being dropped}} by Capitol, the band used {{this time to}} {{undertake}} extensive touring which allowed them to self-fund recording sessions for their eventual mainstream <b>breakthrough,</b> <b>Bleed</b> American (2001). Along with Static Prevails (1996), the album was re-released on May 15, 2007. The reissue included [...] "Christmas Card" [...] and a studio demo of [...] "Sweetness" [...] as bonus tracks.

40|$|Both Sweden and the Netherlands {{have a long}} {{experience}} with primary prophylaxis in children with severe haemophilia. In these countries it has been offered to all children for the last 3 - 4 decades. In Sweden prophylaxis is generally started {{at an earlier age}} with a higher dosage and frequency than in the Netherlands. Patients in the Netherlands receive a more individually tailored regimen, with prophylaxis now started after the first one or two joint bleeds and dosages are increased when <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeds</b> occur. The current study evaluated the effect prophylaxis on long-term outcomes and the consumption of clotting factor concentrates in Dutch and Swedish cohorts. Our results show that the orthopaedic outcome in the oldest groups of patients from Sweden and the Dutch cohorts were comparable, although the Swedish patients used twice as much clotting products per year. In the youngest patients, joint status is very good and further follow-up is necessary to demonstrate the benefits of either strategy. In conclusion, more individually tailored regimens aimed at preventing bleeding prevent joint damage in children with severe haemophilia, while clotting factor consumption is about half of that in previously described regimens...|$|R
25|$|Noretynodrel (and norethisterone) were {{subsequently}} discovered to be contaminated {{with a small}} percentage of the estrogen mestranol (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the noretynodrel in Rock's 1954–5 study containing 4–7% mestranol. When further purifying noretynodrel to contain less than 1% mestranol led to <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding,</b> it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding,</b> in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956.

25|$|In December 1954, Rock {{began the}} first {{studies of the}} ovulation-suppressing {{potential}} of 5–50mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in Brookline, Massachusetts. Norethisterone or noretynodrel 5mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding,</b> but 10mg and higher doses of norethisterone or noretynodrel suppressed ovulation without <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{and led to a}} 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months.

5000|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial <b>breakthrough,</b> <b>Bleed</b> American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking the songs as far as they could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] "Mark would do a mix of it and add production ideas and we would just kind of go back and forth like that. He is the wizard at computers, and the history that we have working with him we don't have with anybody else, so it made sense on the familiarity level and the ease of working level." [...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of antibodies to factor VIII {{is one of}} the most serious complications of haemophilia treatment. Approximately 30 % of patients with severe haemophilia develop neutralizing inhibitors to replacement FVIII. Although most patients with inhibitors do not bleed more frequently than patients without inhibitors, bleeding is more difficult to control and this patients suffer more severe bleeding and have greater morbidity and mortality. Patients with persistent high-titer inhibitor who are not candidates or fail ITI, pose a great challenge to haemophilia management. The efficacy and safety of prophylaxis with bypassing agents in reducing bleeding tendency, has been described in numerous studies. Patients and methods: We report tree adult severe haemophilia A patients, two with persistent high-titre inhibitors and one who failed ITI, on prophylactic treatment after several significant musculoskeletal and life-threatening haemorrhagic episodes (intrabdominal/intramuscular) and pseudotumor haemorrhage. Treatment regimens consisted of APCC (Feiba®) in doses of 60 - 70 UKg- 1, 2 - 3 times per week, according underlying <b>bleeding</b> phenotype. <b>Breakthrough</b> <b>bleeds</b> were treated with either APCC (Feiba®) or rFVIIa (NovoSeven®). Results and Conclusion: There was reduction in total bleeding episodes in two patients (43 % to 80 %) and one patient remained stable, while receiving prophylaxis. Absence of severe and life threatening bleeding episodes, as well as inpatient stays, contributing to a better quality of life in those patients, was observed. APCC (Feiba®) was well tolerated and no thrombotic events were observed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFactor VIII {{concentrates}} have revolutionised {{the treatment}} of patients with haemophilia A. Concerns over the transmission of viral infections through these products have been addressed through stringent, donor screening procedures and robust antiviral manufacturing steps. BPL has developed a high-purity FVIII product with von Willebrand factor (VWF), Optivate®. Its safety, tolerability and efficacy as prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds {{has been established in}} long term studies. Seventy previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A, with > 20 exposure days (ED), were recruited into two long term, multicentre, open-label studies. The protocols were virtually identical. Patients received Optivate® either prophylactically or on demand. A mean of 159. 0 EDs were experienced over 11, 320 infusions. Under both conditions, Optivate® was well tolerated. Only 10 % of patients experienced a treatment related adverse event (AE); the most commonly reported were headache (4 % of patients) and dizziness (3 % of patients). The mean number of bleeds/patient over the 2 year treatment period was 23. 5 during prophylactic use and 70. 4 during on demand use. In patients treated prophylactically, clinical responses to <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeds</b> were rated by physician as excellent or good and as very helpful or helpful by patients in 95 % of bleeds. Clinical responses by physicians in on-demand patients were rated as excellent or good and helpful or very helpful by the patients for 91 % of bleeds. There were no viral transmissions or inhibitors. The studies confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of Optivate® in both prophylactic and on-demand management of patients with haemophilia A...|$|R

500|$|Infrequent or {{irregular}} ovulation {{is called}} oligoovulation. The absence of ovulation is called anovulation.

Anovulatory flow {{resulting from a}} very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding. Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{hormonal}} contraceptive formulations: combined methods which contain both an estrogen and a progestin, and progestogen-only methods which contain only progesterone or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins).

[...] The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, <b>breakthrough</b> <b>bleeding</b> is much more common with progestogen-only methods.
