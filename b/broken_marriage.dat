25|$|Lim {{met with}} a traffic {{accident}} and was badly injured in September 1961. Despite having made a full recovery, he had occasional health problems, for instance, before his disappearance in June 1966, he had undergone two months of medical treatment earlier on. After resigning from the Malaysian Foreign Affairs Ministry, Lim initially settled in Malacca, until he {{met with a}} <b>broken</b> <b>marriage</b> with his wife, when he chose to convert to Islam and emigrated to Mecca, Saudi Arabia {{to start a new}} life. He adopted an Islamic-sounding name, Haji Omar Lim Yew Hock.|$|E
25|$|Tristanne J. Connolly makes {{a similar}} observation, {{stating that the}} husband-wife motif {{reflects}} marriage as it was understood at the time. Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between Yahweh and the people Israel. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls under a unique genre called “covenant lawsuit” where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God’s disappointment towards Israel is therefore expressed through the <b>broken</b> <b>marriage</b> covenant made between husband and wife.|$|E

2500|$|Veedon Fleece is {{the eighth}} studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, {{released}} in October 1974 (see 1974 in music). Morrison recorded the album {{shortly after his}} divorce from wife Janet (Planet) Rigsbee. With his <b>broken</b> <b>marriage</b> in the past, Morrison visited Ireland on holiday for new inspiration, arriving on 20 October 1973 (with his fiancee at the time, Carol Guida). While there he wrote—in fewer than three weeks—the songs included on the album (except [...] "Bulbs", [...] "Country Fair" [...] and [...] "Come Here My Love").|$|E
2500|$|Writer {{and actress}} Jacquetta May, who played Rachel Kominski in EastEnders {{in the early}} 1990s, has commented on Kathy and {{questioned}} whether the events that happened in her fictional life reflected [...] "any sort of true experience". In an article she comments, [...] "Surely no woman's life could contain such a catalogue of disasters: slum childhood, two rapes, a drug-taking daughter, product of the first rape who tops herself, a <b>broken</b> <b>marriage,</b> disastrous affairs and now an alcoholic husband who endangered their son's life." [...] She states that Kathy's biography is a [...] "contrast between a realistic portrayal" [...] of a woman and familiar stereotypes — [...] Kathy [...] "the good, long-suffering woman and victim".|$|E
2500|$|In his seminal {{critical}} study {{about homosexuality}} in the movies, The Celluloid Closet, film historian Vito Russo wrote: [...] "Desert Hearts {{is a love}} story that recreates with perceptiveness and tenderness what {{it might have been}} like for two women of different generations and backgrounds to fall in love in the Fifties....Deitch's refusal to feature the straight world's reaction to lesbianism as the focus of her film made {{all the difference in the}} way the relationship between the women was perceived by audiences." [...] He remarked about Vincent Canby's review of the film: [...] "In the New York Times, Vincent Canby complained that we are not given enough information about the quality of Vivian's <b>broken</b> <b>marriage,</b> asking if perhaps her lesbianism was a hysterical reaction to her divorce. This is the point at which many heterosexual critics disqualify themselves from perceptively reviewing gay films." ...|$|E

2500|$|The character's exit storyline {{revolved}} around her <b>broken</b> <b>marriage</b> to Phil, a prominent storyline {{that had been}} heavily featured throughout 1997. After deciding to leave Walford with her son Ben for South Africa, Kathy found herself the object of desire from several Walford residents, all keen for her to stay and form a relationship. One of the men was Grant Mitchell, her husband Phil's brother, who Kathy shared a kiss with. Despite indicating to Phil that she was prepared to give their relationship one last try, he failed to rendezvous with her in time, and although {{he made it to}} the airport, he was persuaded to let her go by Ian. Kathy was shown to depart the serial on an aeroplane after a [...] "poignant scene" [...] showing her embracing her son Ian. The episodes marking Kathy's exit were screened in a one-hour special on Good Friday 10 April 1998. The episodes were also notable for being the last appearance of Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins). Despite the high-profile exits, the episodes were beaten in the ratings by rival soap Coronation Street, which garnered 14 million viewers. It had been reported that EastEnders producers had been hoping to topple the ratings success of Coronation Street popular [...] "Free Deirdre" [...] storyline, the jailing of the Street's Deirdre Rachid for a crime she didn't commit.|$|E
2500|$|The slogan [...] "Free a Marine to Fight" [...] {{proved to}} be a strong drawing card for the WR, {{stronger}} than any fashioned by the WAC, Waves, or SPARS. Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Tailor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: [...] "Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and do your job {{to the best of your}} ability." [...] And there were those parents who asked special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the WR. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat and 18-year-old girls could not even serve. Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the WR. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which asked this question. The results of this survey showed that the 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a <b>broken</b> <b>marriage,</b> boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings. The WR met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944, and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944, but on a limited basis. The peak strength was 17,640 enlisted and 820 officers.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in October 1918, the Soviet Union liberalized {{divorce and}} {{abortion}} laws, decriminalized homosexuality, permitted cohabitation, and {{ushered in a}} host of reforms that instigated a red sexual revolution. [...] But without birth control, this early emancipation produced many <b>broken</b> <b>marriages</b> and <b>broken</b> hearts, as well as countless children born out of wedlock. [...] The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy. Giving Soviet women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their country’s military power. By 1936, Joseph Stalin reversed most of the liberal laws, ushering in a conservative, pronatalist era that lasted for decades to come.|$|R
