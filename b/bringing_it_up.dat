5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the standard 62-page format.|$|E
5|$|In early 1918, the {{collapse}} of Tsarist Russia enabled the Germans to transfer {{a significant number of}} troops to the Western Front and in March, having amassed 192 divisions, they launched an offensive against the British forces in the Somme. Heavily outnumbered, the British and Dominion troops were pushed back by the initial onslaught and the Australian Corps was thrown into the line in an effort to stem the tide. The 15th Battalion was moved initially to Bavincourt before securing Hebuterne late in the month, where they experienced a heavy artillery bombardment before turning back a German attack. Later, after being relieved by a battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, they moved to Rossignol Farm. Throughout April, while the 13th and 15th Brigades fought significant actions around Villers-Bretonneux, the battalion received several drafts of reinforcements, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to a total of 57 officers and 955 other ranks as it prepared to move up to replace the 15th Brigade in late April. Following their arrival, they undertook a support role, constructing defences before moving on to Freschencourt on 22 May, remaining there until they marched {{at the end of the}} month to Hamelet near Corbie, where they conducted several patrol actions.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{composite}} good addresses this problem. The addition of a composite good in a single-good model (<b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to two) allows for all other opportunities to be accounted for. Since the composite is considered a single good only for purposes of the model, analysis can be made on a two-dimensional graph. Optimal choices represent the bundle of two goods; the first good and the composite.|$|E

The RTs lasted until 1976, outlasting the RMs which were replaced by Daimler Fleetlines in 1971, although they did return between 1976–1978 and 1982–1987 when the garage became entirely one man operated.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Columbia, {{under the}} command of John Young on what was his sixth spaceflight, {{undertook}} its second operational mission (STS-9), in which the Spacelab science laboratory and a six-person crew was carried, including the first non-American astronaut on a space shuttle, Ulf Merbold. After the flight, Columbia spent 18 months at the Rockwell Palmdale facility beginning in January 1984, undergoing modifications that removed the Orbiter Flight Test hardware and <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to similar specifications as those of its sister orbiters. At that time the shuttle fleet was expanded to include Discovery and Atlantis.|$|E

In addition to <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to modern standards, the work restored the window and door designs from 1882.

25|$|In 2000, the Government in {{the form}} of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (OPDM) set up a review of the fire safety {{legislation}} led by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott MP and found that there were some 80 Acts of Parliament or parts of Acts which specified fire safety legislation. In order to revamp the whole thing and <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to date, they decided to place all the odd bits of fire legislation under the umbrella of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which became law in October 2006.

25|$|After {{repelling}} {{the first}} Shu invasion, Cao Zhen observed that if Shu were to invade Wei again, they would attack via Chencang (陳倉; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi). He then put Hao Zhao and Wang Sheng (王生) {{in charge of}} defending Chencang and ordered them to strengthen the fortress's defences. As Cao Zhen foresaw, Zhuge Liang indeed led Shu forces to attack Chencang {{in the spring of}} 229. However, as Hao Zhao and the Wei defenders were well-prepared, they managed to hold their ground against the second Shu invasion. Zhuge Liang ordered a retreat after failing to breach Chencang's walls. As a reward for Cao Zhen's contributions, Cao Rui increased the number of taxable households in his marquisate, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to a total of 2,900.|$|E
25|$|For the 1924–25 season {{there were}} more off-the-field problems, the {{majority}} of a financial nature. A writ {{was presented to the}} club for £3,618 from the builders of the redeveloped South Stand, of which the club had only managed to pay £1,000. After a drawn-out meeting, it was decided to double the share capital, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to £10,000 in order to pay off the outstanding debt. In addition, the board underwent several changes, with new members being added in the hope of providing much-needed cash to help alleviate the dire situation. Sir Lindsay Parkinson resigned as president, to be replaced by Alderman John Bickerstaff. Also, the Blackpool Supporters' Club was formed, and in its early days boasted a membership of over three hundred.|$|E

25|$|Djokovic {{collected}} his 60th career {{title in}} Doha, defeating Nadal in two sets {{in a final}} that lasted 73 minutes. He broke his own ATP ranking points record, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to 16,790. Djokovic then proceeded to win his sixth Australian Open. On his road to his Open Era record sixth title in Melbourne, he defeated Roger Federer in four sets in the semi-finals, and in a rematch of the 2015 final, he defeated Andy Murray, in three straight sets. He quickly rebounded from an eye infection at the Dubai open to collect a fifth Indian Wells Masters title, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals, and Milos Raonic in the final. Djokovic's dominant run resulted in a situation, where Nos. 2 and 3 (Andy Murray and Roger Federer) could combine their points and still not have enough to pass Djokovic.|$|E
25|$|Even before news of {{the defeat}} at the Ticinus River had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered the consul Sempronius Longus to bring his army back from Sicily, {{where it had been}} {{preparing}} for the invasion of Africa, to join Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal was blocking Sempronius' way to Scipio's army. However, the Carthaginian capture of the supply depot at Clastidium, through the treachery of the local Latin commander, served as a diversion and allowed Sempronius' army to slip through to Scipio, who was still too seriously injured to take the field. After some minor successes, the united and numerically equal Roman force under the command of Sempronius Longus was lured into combat by Hannibal at the battle of the Trebia. The Roman troops were drawn into the engagement without breakfast and first had to cross a cold river, preventing many from putting up much of a fight. Furthermore, a hidden detachment led by Hannibal's younger brother Mago attacked them from the rear. All in all, the Romans suffered heavy losses with only 20,000 men out of 40,000 able to retreat to safety. They left Cisalpine Gaul in the aftermath. Having secured his position in northern Italy by this victory, Hannibal quartered his troops for the winter amongst the Gauls. The latter joined his army in large numbers, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to 60,000 men; their enthusiasm was somewhat reduced due to the Carthaginians living on their land.|$|E
500|$|The {{battalion}} {{was formed}} at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma, on 10 August 1942, with {{a cadre of}} 31 officers and 77 men. It received 829 draftees from Camp Upton, New York, in mid-January 1943, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to slightly over full strength. The unit was nominally organised as a [...] "tank destroyer battalion, heavy, self-propelled"; after some experimentation in 1941-2, this had become the standard organisation for tank destroyer units. Under this structure, the battalion would have three gun companies, each with three platoons of M3 self-propelled 75mm guns; each platoon had four gun crews and twelve additional men for command and security duties. These were supported by a fourth reconnaissance company with three reconnaissance platoons and one platoon of pioneers, and various headquarters and support elements.|$|E

500|$|In February 1941, the 9th Division was {{completely}} reorganised, with its 18th and 25th Infantry Brigades {{transferred to the}} 7th Division. In return, it received the 20th and 24th Infantry Brigades, the latter short one battalion which was on garrison duty in Darwin. The 9th Division, less its partly trained and equipped artillery, was ordered {{to move to the}} Tobruk–Derna area where it would relieve the 6th Division, so that formation could participate in the Battle of Greece. The half-trained and half-equipped 9th Division was pitched into the thick of the action almost immediately, steadying the retreat of Commonwealth forces from the newly arrived German Afrika Korps, under General Erwin Rommel, and occupying the vital port of Tobruk. Morshead was given command of the Tobruk garrison which, as the retreat (known to the Australians as the [...] "Benghazi handicap") continued, became surrounded, hundreds of miles behind enemy lines. Lieutenant General John Lavarack determined that Tobruk could be held and ordered Morshead to defend it. He also ordered the 18th Infantry Brigade to reinforce the garrison, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to four brigades, with British artillery and tank units brought up to provide support.|$|E
500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{opened the}} show with the song [...] "Harajuku Girls", an ode to Harajuku, the fashion {{district}} of Tokyo, Japan. She appeared on stage wearing a tiara and baby doll outfit, sitting in the red velvet and gold throne from the cover of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and surrounded by her backing dancers, also called the Harajuku Girls, while video images of Harajuku itself played on screens behind her. Her second song was the first single from the album, [...] "What You Waiting For?", which she began as a ballad before <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to its usual pace. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then left the stage to change into one-piece bathing suits while her band continued to play, before returning to perform [...] "The Real Thing". A group of four breakdancers came on stage to perform while Stefani left the stage again to change into a black-and-white leather tracksuit. For the next song, the album's sixth single [...] "Crash", the audience were then divided into male and female halves and, as images of a car hood bouncing to the beat were broadcast, each half took turns to sing the lyric [...] "back it up, back it up". Stefani then performed the fourth single from the album, [...] "Luxurious".|$|E
