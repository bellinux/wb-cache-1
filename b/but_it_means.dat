5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
25|$|Workers on-site now wear {{full-body}} {{radiation protection}} gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> they have another enemy: heat. As of 19 July 2011, 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded. In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s died from heart failure.|$|E
25|$|All {{debates in}} the {{championship}} are in English. This is for practical reasons, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that many countries debate in what is for them a foreign language. This has not stopped {{a number of these}} teams being very successful. Pakistan, for example, has reached the Grand Final twice; while the Philippines, Argentina, Peru, Greece and Israel have all reached the semi-finals. Special awards have been introduced for the highest-ranked teams made-up of English-as-a-second-language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) speakers.|$|E

2500|$|To the Orthodox Jewish creationist, Hovind's {{approach}} relies upon {{a strict}} literal {{reading of the}} King James translation. Where Jews interpret the Hebrew through Talmud and Midrash, Hovind relies on a direct reading of English. For example, Hovind claims that the word dinosaur, which was introduced to English in 1841, refers to what previously had been called dragon. Dragon is used where tannin (...) appears, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> serpent or crocodile.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, {{there is}} no single term in English that {{adequately}} translates or represents the concept of bhakti in Indian religions. Terms such as [...] "devotion, faith, devotional faith" [...] represent certain aspects of bhakti, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> much more. The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because [...] "wish is selfish, affection is unselfish". Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with saddha (Sanskrit: Sraddha) which means [...] "faith, trust or confidence". However, bhakti can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|However the Labour conference {{voted to}} drop its {{opposition}} to rearmament. When Winston Churchill said that the Labour Party should refrain from giving Hitler the impression that Britain was divided, Bevan rejected this as [...] "sinister": [...] "The fear of Hitler {{is to be used}} to frighten the workers of Britain into silence. In short Hitler is to rule Britain by proxy. If we accept the contention that the common enemy is Hitler and not the British capitalist class, then certainly Churchill is right. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> abandonment of the class struggle and the subservience of the British workers to their own employers".|$|E
5000|$|Özgü is {{a common}} {{feminine}} Turkish given name. In Turkish, [...] "Özgü" [...] <b>means</b> [...] "holly". <b>But</b> <b>it</b> also <b>means</b> [...] "characteristic".|$|R

2500|$|Hong Kong Cantonese has a {{high number}} of foreign loanwords. Sometimes, the part of speech of the {{incorporated}} words are also changed, like [...] "佢地好friend", translated into English as [...] "they are very 'friend'", means [...] "they are good friends". The word [...] "friend" [...] is changed from a noun into an adjective. In some examples, some new meanings of English words are even created. For example, [...] "至yeah", literally [...] "the most yeah", means [...] "the trendiest". Originally, [...] "yeah" [...] means [...] "yes/okay" [...] in English, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> [...] "trendy" [...] when being incorporated into Hong Kong Cantonese (see also [...] "yeah baby" [...] and [...] "").|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Lindsay of CBR gave issue #4 {{three stars}} writing, [...] "The Fearless Defenders #4 is an {{entertaining}} issue {{chock full of}} story and solid moments. Bunn packs the pages with dialogue, which can feel bulky at times, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> he can chock in {{quite a lot of}} narrative for one issue." [...] Lima also gave issue #4 four stars writing, [...] "This issue is very balanced: it has everything from mystery to humor and the pacing is really good. Of the issues before it, this is certainly {{one of the best in}} the way that it showcases these characters individually whilst continuing to develop a story that is both interesting and entertaining." [...] Grey again gave it a 7.9 writing, [...] "Now that the personalities of the Fearless Defenders are slotting into place and the shady force behind the rise of the Doom Maidens is amping up her villainy, The Fearless Defenders is shaping up to be one of the more unique and enjoyable titles in Marvel's monthly lineup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{talks about}} the same things he's been talking about in all his writings, self-knowledge. He says, [...] "Everyone else would presumably {{understand}} that self-knowledge is a difficult matter; although {{it is easy to}} understand the rest of the world, the understanding suddenly changes very substantially when it pertains to oneself." [...] He speaks of choosing oneself in Either/Or, [...] "When a person considers himself esthetically his soul is like soil out of which grow all sorts of herbs, all with equal claim to flourish; his self consists of this multiplicity, and he has no self that is higher than this (...) Someone who views the personality ethically has at once an absolute difference: namely, the difference between good and evil. And if he finds more of evil in him than of good, this still does not mean that it is the evil that is to advance, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that it is the evil that is to recede and the good that is to advance. (...) It truly takes considerable ethical courage to acknowledge the good as the highest, because one thereby falls into altogether universal categories." ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "quality" [...] {{was chosen}} because it has usually been opposed to [...] "quantity." [...] <b>But</b> here <b>it</b> <b>means</b> only {{affirmation}} and denial in a judgment.|$|R
