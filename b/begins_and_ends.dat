It links South Texas {{to the northern}} {{parts of the state}} via I-69E, US77, and US281. The highway functions {{as one of the few}} freeway hurricane evacuation routes for the southern Texas coast. It roughly parallels US 181, which both <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> <b>ends</b> at I-37, and US 281.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> <b>ends.</b> If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form.

30|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of each curve (different numbers for each measurement as implied below) led to {{the determination of the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> number for each curve and measurement. Thereafter by simply averaging the velocities within the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> number we calculated the mean velocity (apparently for each curve and measurement). It is noted that the velocity of each measurement at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of each curve was calculated with linear regression of the values right before and right after the curve implying that the trajectory and hence the variation of the velocity between two consecutive points, is linear.|$|R
5|$|The {{structure}} of the piece is unusually symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text. Harmonically, the piece <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> <b>ends</b> in C major, and the central movement is in D minor. The second movement modulates from A minor to F major, while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E
5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> <b>ends</b> the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E

Milan has hosted the most starts and finishes for Giro d'Italia stages, with Rome being a close second and many towns having hosted over 25 stages.|$|E
25|$|According to Jewish tradition, the Sun {{was created}} {{on the fourth}} day (יום רביעי, yom revi'i) of the week of Creation. Because Jewish law {{considers}} the time unit of a day to span from evening to evening, the beginning of the halachic fourth day, so to speak, is on Tuesday evening at sundown. The 28-year cycle therefore <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> <b>ends</b> at the point in time when the Sun was created, this being sundown on Tuesday. The Sun only returns to this exact position at sundown on a Tuesday once every 28 years.|$|E
