5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E

The actual numbers of species are imprecisely known, {{as many of the}} genera have not been the subject of recent monographs. For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} backward, particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the castle, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions. Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Basic to {{the second}} group is a clade {{consisting}} of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinct from the remaining species. These two species could in future be assigned to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.|$|E

The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office. The film was nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. The film became a cult classic and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Escape from L.A. (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell <b>but</b> <b>which</b> was much more poorly received.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black <b>but</b> <b>which</b> are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed him to speak to deportees selected as slave labour. He had his own office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. From the window he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, <b>but</b> <b>which</b> decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum.

Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight <b>but</b> <b>which</b> were otherwise similar.|$|E
