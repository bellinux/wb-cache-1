5|$|Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a {{few months}} later, and Cleveland {{nominated}} Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted.

5|$|On {{hearing that}} her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has {{died in a}} storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a {{previous}} marriage.

5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given {{in his testimony}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Foreign Relations Committee, {{is the belief that}} NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, and consequently increase the risk of a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes.

5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} to testify <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report.

5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Republic, {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some of the senators. Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of extraneous material in bills <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a single vote, that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.|$|E

In response to these complaints the Romans sent three ambassadors, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Gaius Claudius Nero and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus to Egypt with the orders to go to Rhodes after speaking with Ptolemy.|$|E

5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{exchanged}} {{letters with}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia, {{who had been}} captured by Sigismund Báthory because of his attempts {{to make peace with}} Poland and the Ottoman Empire. The pope's special envoy, Martio Malacrida, tried to convince Andrew to accept the post of the ambassador of Poland in Rome, but Andrew again refused. He said, his homeland would require his presence, because Sigismund's anti-Ottoman policy could not be continued for long. Letters found on one of Stephen Báthory's retainers suggested that Andrew and his brother sent letters to the leaders of the Székely commoners who had risen up against Sigismund Báthory in February 1596. Sigismund III of Poland summoned Andrew and Stephen <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> but Pope Clement VIII intervened on the brothers' behalf.|$|E

5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames.

On January 19, 1976, he also appeared <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E
5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} {{took place}} over House conference negotiations on the bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, the Nixon administration pleaded for a renewal <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis's attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked cloture over Gravel's second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel's attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel's later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken at face value in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
