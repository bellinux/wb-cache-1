5|$|A Haggadah is {{a ritual}} Jewish text {{containing}} prayers, hymns, Midrashic statements, and {{commentary on the}} story of Passoverthe liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. This text is recited <b>by</b> <b>participants</b> at a Passover Seder. The Haggadah has appeared in print since the 15th century and thousands of editions have been published.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{exhibitions}} and performances were also permitted {{to be held}} at Speakers' Corner. The conditions that organizers and participants had to adhere to were broadly similar to those applying to speeches. In addition, the organizer or an authorized agent had to be present at all times during the exhibition or performance, the event could not contain violent, lewd or obscene messages, no banners or placards could be carried <b>by</b> <b>participants,</b> and the event could not be an assembly or procession for which a permit was required under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules.|$|E
5|$|Messages, many in {{commonly}} used ciphers and encryption systems, {{have been found}} hidden in the video and its sound spectrogram, as well as images of tortured and mutilated people. Most of the messages have been decoded <b>by</b> <b>participants</b> in an ongoing Reddit thread, and the images sourced to notable murder investigations such as the Boston Strangler. They have been interpreted as implying a threat of bioterrorism against the United States, although {{it has also been}} speculated that the video is in reality a prank, a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming film or video game, or a student film.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the effects of participants' abused or nonabused status as it interacted with their age and gender in {{producing}} different patterns of Hand Test responses as a function of the age or gender of the card. Participants, 61 young adults (M age = 23) and 60 older adults (M age = 73), were presented with the original Hand Test cards, as well as four alternate versions (e. g., young male, young female, older male, and older female). Expected effects varying by age, gender, and abuse status were not found. Results indicated main effects for participant abuse status, which were largely consistent with previous Hand Test research. Significant interaction effects were also found for <b>participant</b> age <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> abuse status (p <. 05), as well as <b>participant</b> age <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> gender <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> abuse status (p <. 05). An interaction effect was also found for Hand Test version <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> abuse status (p <. 05), Hand Test version <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> age <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> abuse status (p <. 05), as well as Hand Test version <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> gender <b>by</b> <b>participant</b> abuse status (p <. 05). These results suggest that the alternate forms of the cards may pull for certain responses among abused participants that would not have been identified otherwise via the standard version of the Hand Test, clinical interviews, or other projective and self-report measures of personality. Overall, the variations in Hand Test stimuli interact with participants' abuse status, and warrant the use of alternate versions of the Hand Test as a viable projective measure...|$|R

5|$|The West {{responded with}} the Crusades, {{eventually}} {{resulting in the}} Sack of Constantinople <b>by</b> <b>participants</b> in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented {{what remained of the}} Empire into successor states, the ultimate victor being that of Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the Empire {{was little more than a}} Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Roman Empire finally collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking <b>by</b> <b>participants</b> {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|During the uprising, the Sejm {{realized}} {{the need for}} unified national insignia {{that could be used}} by the Polish military. On February 7, 1831 it adopted white and red, the tinctures (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as <b>by</b> <b>participants</b> of the Kraków Uprising of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued to regard the revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising.|$|E

5|$|The Dorset Ooser {{was first}} brought to public {{attention}} in 1891, {{at which time}} it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond's Holt Farm. After travelling with Edward Cave to Somerset, the Ooser went missing around 1897. Since then, various folklorists and historians have debated {{the origins of the}} head, which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn <b>by</b> <b>participants</b> in English Mummers plays. The folklorists Frederick Thomas Elworthy and H. S. L. Dewar believed that the head was a representation of the Devil and thus was designed to intimidate people into behaving according to the local community's moral system. Conversely, the folklorist Margaret Murray suggested that it represented a pre-Christian god of fertility whose worship survived in Dorset into the modern period, although more recent scholarship has been highly sceptical of this interpretation. The etymology of Ooser is also disputed, with various possibilities available.|$|E
