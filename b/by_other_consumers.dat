"The real {{measure of}} market {{power is not}} whether a {{supplier}} presents his terms on a take-it-or-leave basis but whether the consumer, {{if he decides to}} ‘leave it’ has available to him a workably competitive range of alternative sources of supply. Whether this is or is not so simply cannot be derived intuitively from the fact that a particular supplier is offering non-negotiable standard-form terms. It is a matter for independent inquiry. If the market is workably competitive, any supplier offering uncompetitive standard form terms will have to reformulate his total package of price and non-price terms to prevent consumers (at least consumers at the margin, which are the decisive consideration in such a market) from switching their business to other competitors....Non-economists often overlook the importance of marginal analysis in this context. For example, if only 10 per cent of the buyers of insurance policies or dry-cleaning services studied all terms scrupulously before contracting an were influence in their choice of policy by their evaluation of the so-called fine print clauses, and if no supplier of insurance or dry-cleaning services was able to ‘term discriminate’ between these consumers and other consumers in the market, there would be strong competitive pressures on each supplier to adjust the terms of his contracts so as to avoid losing this potential business....When one asks why, many consumers probably rely in part on the constraints imposed <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> at the margin (ie, they let the market shop for them)." ...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{ships and}} {{offshore}} units built for dynamic positioning (DP) are often powered by an {{electric power plant}} consisting {{of two or more}} diesel-electric generators. Actuation in any desired direction is achieved by placing electrical thrusters at suitable points on the hull. Usually, such ships also have other large electrical loads. Operations in the naturally unpredictable marine environment often necessitate large variations in power consumption, both by the thrusters and <b>by</b> the <b>other</b> <b>consumers.</b> This wears down the power plant and increases the fuel consumption and pollution. This paper introduces a thrust allocation algorithm that facilitates more stable loading on the power plant. This algorithm modulates the power consumption by coordinating the thrusters to introduce load variations that counteract the load variations from the <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> on the ship. To reduce load variations without increasing the overall power consumption, it is necessary to deviate from the thrust command given by the DP system. The resulting deviations in the position and velocity of the vessel are tightly controlled, and the results show that small deviations are sufficient to fulfill the objective of reducing the load variations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated on a simulated vessel with a diesel-electric power plant. A model for the simulation of a marine power plant for control design purposes has been developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} literature on eco-labeling and green consumerism has been framed within a classical market context where price and quality are the drivers of consumer choice.

Worldwide, women 9 ̆ 2 s financial independency is continuing to increase. Moreover, now a days woman {{are more willing to}} spend more money on their look and appearance, as a result the demand of the cosmetics continue to increase. Thus, in order to be successful in such competitive and fast moving industry, cosmetics companies have to understand all external factors (such as electronic word-of-mouth) which can influence individual 9 ̆ 2 s perception and consumption of the product. Furthermore, the popularity of the social networking portals continues to grow sharply. The development of such online platforms as Instagram and YouTube has changed the way individuals search for cosmetics products and evaluate them. The purpose of this research is to explore factors which encourage women to search for the online advice in relation to consumption of cosmetics products. Moreover the study is contributed to fulfil the gap in the electronic word-of-mouth literature by identifying what encourages women to read/watch recommendations on the user-generated platforms. In order to gain insights of the electronic word-of-mouth topic the literature regarding word-of-mouth and electronic word-of-mouth phenomenon, the motives, which encourage consumers to participate in the electronic word-of-mouth communication, and the behaviour outcomes, which lead to the cosmetics product perception and cosmetics product consumption was reviewed. Additionally, 12 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with the females who had an experience of using online reviews in relation to the cosmetics product consumption. The results of this study showed that women refer to the online recommendations in relation to consumption of cosmetics products {{due to the fact that}} they experienced the lack of product related knowledge. Moreover, for those women the information provided by companies was not identified as reliable, transparent and diverse.

40|$|Positive network {{externalities}} {{can arise}} when consumers {{benefit from the}} consumption of compatible products <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> (user-positive consumption externalities) or, alternatively, when they incur costs from the consumption of incompatible products <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> (nonuser-negative consumption externalities). But whereas user-positive externalities are typically mutually imposed and imply mutual benefit because they relate to interoperability, with nonuser-negative externalities the costs of incompatibility may be imposed unilaterally and borne asymmetrically. For example, increased risks of death and injury on the roads due to the co-existence of large and small vehicles are imposed exclusively by {{the owners of the}} large vehicles and borne exclusively by the occupants of the small vehicles. This paper compares the social optimality of incentives for compatibility under regimes involving user-positive and nonuser-negative externalities. Earlier work with respect to user-positive externalities (e. g., Katz and Shapiro, 1985) suggests that firms with relatively small networks or weak reputations tend to be biased in favor of compatibility, while individual firms’ incentives for compatibility are suboptimal when their networks are closely matched in size. Meanwhile, intuition suggests that with nonuser-negative externalities incentives for incompatibility should always be excessive, reflecting the notion that activities involving unilaterally imposed negative externalities will always be overprovided by the market (in the absence of regulation or Coaseian mitigation). Using a "location" model of differentiated products, we find that, under both regimes, incentives for compatibility tend to be suboptimal when firms' networks are close in size, and excessive for the small firm when the networks differ greatly in size. Surprising public policy implications with respect to externalities are discussed. ...|$|E

To test the generality of our findings, we ran similar experiments with seaweed/grazer populations in the North and Baltic Seas (NE Atlantic). Grazer-specificity in induction strength was assessed by using the same species of grazer for induction and consumption. ‘Indirect’ induction effects were assessed by using different species of grazers for induction and consumption. Palatability assays were run with live algae and with reconstituted food to distinguish between different mechanisms of resistance. Grazing by herbivores induced a chemical defence in F. vesiculosus. In the North Sea population, the induced defences were only effective against I. baltica, regardless of inducer identity. The sensitive responses of I. baltica to the induced defences were also detected in the reconstituted food assays using Baltic Sea organisms. Thus, marine meso-grazers may be affected by previous feeding through the same or a different species of consumer by modified prey traits, such as induced chemical defences.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Randomness is {{a common}} and yet quite an {{expensive}} challenge that every manufacturing and marketing system faces. In this research we focus on products for which the malfunction likelihood of the production outputs are not independent of one another, such as flu vaccine and semiconductors. Production has random yield that is interpreted as {{the ratio of the}} faultless items in a production batch. We also assume that these products have a limited marketing season, suggesting the news-vendor model with randomness on the supply side is an outstanding platform to analyze the production and marketing processes of such products. Our base model studies a single manufacturer present in a single market, where the manufacturer dynamically selects the production commitment and the price {{at the beginning of the}} production season and marketing season, accordingly. Also, we assume that demand is deterministic but price dependent. For strategically important products such as the flu vaccine, the government may find it necessary to intervene in the pricing or manufacturing process in order to coordinate the market. The need for coordinating the market may also be met <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>consumer</b> interest groups such as distribution channel owners, think-tanks or policy making agencies. We incorporate the presence of a social planner in our model by studying the centralized case and the socially optimum production commitment and pricing schema. The challenge is to find contracts that can set the conditions for the manufacturer in a way that his optimum production and pricing policy is exactly the same as the one of the social planner. Our study introduces three contracts that can coordinate the market. In the second phase of this research, we study the same problem for the cases where there are two symmetrical manufacturers with inter-dependent demands. By the third phase, we study the case with one manufacturer who has the option to provide the product to two different markets with different characteristics. Our study shows that production commitment is smaller if there is no randomness and the yield ratio is known. We also show that the production commitment of the centralized setting can be either less or more than the production commitment of the decentralized setting, depending on the salvage cost.
