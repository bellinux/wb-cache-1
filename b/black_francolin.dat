40|$|For phytosociological {{studies of}} Lal Suhanra National Park, Bahawalpur five {{vegetation}} study sites viz., old irrigated plantation, new irrigated plantation, natural vegetation within old demarcated desert area, new demarcated desert area and Patisar Lake area were evaluated on {{the bases of}} varied ecological conditions. Old irrigated plantations consisted of mixed species plantations, mostly of Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Forest plantations had specific type of flora, consisted of Prosopis glandulosa, Saccharum bengalense and Imperata cylindrica. New irrigated plantation possessed mixed type plantations but monocultures of Dalbergia sissoo and sometimes Eucalyptus camaldulensis are practiced in few blocks. The ground flora comprised of agriculture weed like Conyza ambigua, Desmostachya bipinnata, Imperata cylindrica and tall grasses like Saccharum bengalense and Saccharum spontaneum with few native trees/large shrubs like Tamarix aphylla and Prosopis cineraria. Dense plantations almost totally eliminated the ground flora, perhaps due to poor light intensity and last-seasoned non-decomposed plant material of deciduous trees. Natural vegetation is of desertic nature consisted of Acacia jacquemontii, Haloxylon recurvum, Lasiurus scindicus, Ochthochloa compressa and Prosopis cineraria. Habitat diversity was the maximum in demarcated area, containing saline or sodic patches, low sand dunes and sandy clayey soils. Aeluropus lagopoides, Cymbopogon jwarancusa and Suaeda fruticosa generally confined to saline soils. Ochthochloa compressa, Tamarix dioica, Cymbopogon jwarancusa and Prosopis cineraria restricted to interdunal sandy clayey soils and Aristida adscensionis, Calligonum polygonoides, Lasiurus scindicus and Haloxylon recurvum were typified to sandy habitat. Non-demarcated area showed high grazing pressure, the vegetation {{was more or less}} shrubby, but clusters of grasses like Cenchrus pennisetiformis, Cymbopogon jwarancusa and Lasiurus scindicus can be seen. Dominant species among dicots were Calligonum polygonoides, Dipterygium glaucum, Leptadenia pyrotechnica, Haloxylon recurvum and Salsola baryosma. Vegetation inside the Patisar Lake was dominated by Phragmites karka and Typha domingensis at shallow water whereas, Nelumbo nucifera and Vallisneria spiralis in the deeper waters. Cynodon dactylon with Phyla nodiflora dominated the bank but tussocks of Saccharum spontaneum and Saccharum bengalense were also recorded.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the evolution of}} the Asian francolins, five little known species in the genus Francolinus (Phasianidae). Evolutionary affinities of two of these species, F. gularis (swamp francolin) and F. pondicerianus (grey francolin), has long remained unclear. In contrast, the other three species, F. pintadeanus (Chinese francolin), F. pictus (painted francolin) and F. francolinus (<b>black</b> <b>francolin)</b> have been cast among the ‘‘spotted francolins’’ on a morphological and ecological basis. Previous molecular DNA investigations including Asian francolins mostly relied upon partial gene sequencing of one specimen per species (no more than three species and with the exclusion of F. pictus). Therefore, fundamental questions do persist. What relationship exists among the spotted and the other Asian francolins? What is the geographic origin of the <b>black</b> <b>francolin,</b> the species with the largest distribution range? How did the geological history influence the diversification of francolins across Asia? We sequenced the entire Control Region of the mitochondrial DNA in 228 samples of all five Asian francolin species, which were collected in 16 countries (from East Europe to East Asia). We constructed a molecular phylogeny according to four different procedures. We showed the monophyly of each of the Asian francolins and the spotted group, while that of the entire Asian group was presumed according to a biogeographical model we proposed. The splitting of the genus Francolinus occurred 17. 4 Ma (95 % HPD: 13. 4 – 22. 1) while the spotted francolins diverged 10. 5 Ma (7. 0 – 14. 9). We resolved the most recent common ancestor to painted and <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> as being in the Indian sub-continent, thus suggesting a westwards adaptive radiation of the latter. In Pakistan, we identified F. f. asiae representatives in the Northern Areas and in the Sindh.

40|$|The {{release of}} exotic genotypes {{into the wild}} {{can lead to the}} {{extinction}} of local demes through the hybridization among distinct gene pools. This may occur between wild specimens and their domesticated relatives. Escaped pets represent a well-known pathway for the introduction of allochtonous resources, and island environments require major attention as they include small-sized and naïve populations that may be prone to extinction. We characterized the genetic make-up of the <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> (Francolinus francolinus, Phasianidae) resident to Cyprus using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA for the purpose of sustainable use and long-term protection of this game species. We collected 59 samples of specimens hunted in the districts of Nicosia and Paphos, while others (n= 18) were obtained from birds of unknown origin. These had been imported to a pet-centre in Nicosia, the largest in the capital offering animals either for production or leisure purposes. Both genetic systems pointed to the occurrence of distinct wild district populations that could be treated as separate management units. The non-significant value of the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) computed for Nicosia and Paphos populations (- 0. 039 and - 0. 189, respectively: P> 0. 05) and the lack of evidence for recent genetic bottlenecks did not indicate a serious risk of over-hunting. The microsatellites revealed the birds in the pet-centre as highly genetically divergent with respect to the wild ones, the mtDNA pointed to their assignment to alien Asian subspecies once they were compared to 141 sequences of allopatric francolins. We advised the Game & Fauna Service to consider law enforcement to ban the import, detention and sale of these subspecies to protect the <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> population native to Cyprus.

A survey for forest birds was conducted in Kalaupapa National Historical Park in 2005 to determine presence-absence and abundance. Forest bird surveys were conducted using the variable circular plot method. Survey stations were established 140 m apart along six transects of variable length. Stations were surveyed for birds from March – May 2005. Also included in the analysis are data from a Hawaii Forest Bird Survey in 2004 for two transects located in the park. Of the nine native species that once inhabited the island, only three remain: We detected the Apapane (Himatione sanguinea), Iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and Maui Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni). As on other islands, Molokai now supports a number of non-native birds including: the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), <b>Black</b> <b>Francolin</b> (Francolinus francolinus), Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Nutmeg Mannikin (Lonchura punctulata), Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis), and White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus).

40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> (Francolinus francolinus) (BF) {{comprises}} six morphological subspecies distributed from Cyprus and Turkey across Asia to India. In {{spite of}} being renowned as courtly gamebird since the Classic Age, this species suffers from paucity of demographic and molecular studies. In order {{to update the}} BF biogeographic pattern by pursuing a thorough sampling across the unsafe and remote areas representing most of the specie’s range, tissues from museum specimens (76, XVIIIth c. -­‐ 1954) hosted in US and European ornithological collections were genotyped at a 185 bp-­‐long fragment of the mtDNA Control Region gene along with modern birds (205) sequenced at the entire gene. The access to ornithological collections opened the unforeseen opportunity to elucidate the genetic affinity of the extinct populations once residing in the western Mediterranean (Italy, Spain), thus settling the debate about autochthony versus allochthony in that region. Three well-­‐defined haplogroups -­‐ each one including a pair of morphological subspecies and matching the phylogeographical pattern inferred with the whole gene -­‐ were found to reflect a westward adaptive radiation, a more complex scenario being nonetheless disclosed in the Indian sub-­‐continent. The nonnative status of the western Mediterranean BFs was ultimately assessed, a tight genetic affinity with conspecifics from Cyprus and southern Asia being found. This finding, which partly confirmed the invoked importation during the Crusades, pointed to the major human impact on Mediterranean biodiversity through long-­‐distance trade across Asia to satisfy the high demand for exotic species by the European aristocracy during the Medieval times and the Renaissance...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of adaptive evolutionary conservation {{has been widely}} accepted. According to this concept, only a comprehensive evaluation pursued within both a temporal and a spatial perspective may enable to properly assess the potential conservation value of a given resource. This applies well to phylogeographic studies dealing with game birds subjected to intense and large-scale ex situ management. The present study attempted to gain useful genetic information to the adaptive conservation framework of two Palaearctic taxa deserving both evolutionary and conservation interest, namely the <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> (Francolinus francolinus) and the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) (Galliformes, Phasianidae). The former belongs {{to a group of}} five poorly known and secretive Asian species; the latter, claimed to be the most appreciated and economically relevant quarry species in southwestern Europe, suffers from extensive biotic homogenisation and hybridisation with the congeneric chukar partridge (A. chukar). Both taxa are threatened by hunting pressure and habitat loss over most of their distribution ranges. The evolutionary history of F. francolinus was investigated in relation to its inter- and intraspecific genetic kinship through the amplification and sequencing of the entire Control Region gene (ca. 1170 bp), a set of microsatellite DNA markers providing complementary-to-mitochondrial DNA information. Moreover, the phylogeography of the species was thoroughly updated in light of a molecular approach by genotyping both modern (n = 205) and ancient (n = 76 : first half of the XIXth century- 1967) birds at a highly variable 185 -bp long fragment of the Control Region. Remarkably, the sampling of F. francolinus museum specimens allowed to get around the problems represented by remoteness and political unrest peculiar to most of the species’ range as well as to elucidate the genetic affinity of some extinct populations once resident to the western Mediterranean. Special focus was given to Cyprus, this island representing the European stronghold of the entire genus. Specifically, the genetic make-up of birds (n = 59) hunted in the districts of Nicosia and Paphos was characterised. Captive francolins (n = 18) of unknown origin imported to a pet-centre in Nicosia were investigated as well. The phylogenetic reconstructions on the genus Francolinus concurrently supported the monophyly of each of the five species, whereas that of the entire group was suggested according to the proposal of a biogeographical model. The Indian sub-continent was evidenced as the ancestral area for the adaptive radiation of F. francolinus, thus producing weight for its westward adaptive radiation. Moreover, the molecular insight into the phylogeographic pattern of the species returned a poorly yet markedly sculptured genetic picture, the six morphological subspecies being arranged into three well-distinct mitochondrial DNA clusters. Nevertheless, the distribution of traditionally recognised subspecific taxa was revised as well, a more complex and intriguing scenario being disclosed along the Indus and Ganges river valleys in the Indian sub-continent. Molecular evidence for a likely human-mediated introduction of F. francolinus from Asia Minor to Cyprus was found, while the alleged introduction from Cyprus to Sicily was strongly suggested and the historically documented importation from the latter to Tuscany definitely proved. The mixed genetic origin of the extinct population inhabiting Sicily was disclosed as some of its representatives displayed an overt genetic affinity to conspecifics from southern Asia. The same affiliation emerged for an ancient <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> from Spain, thus crediting the invoked introduction from Sicily into the latter. As far as Cyprus is concerned, the combined genetic systems disclosed the occurrence of genetically isolated wild district populations which should be treated as distinct Management Units. Moreover, the assignment of captive birds to alien Asian subspecies unveiled that genetic pollution may represent a further threat to the native F. francolinus population. On the other hand, the first genetic survey of the introduced A. rufa resident to the UK was carried out to assess whether it could represent a useful genomic backup for the nominate subspecies. Specifically, an East Anglian population (n = 58) was genotyped at both 1092 bp of the mitochondrial Cytochrome-b gene and a panel of microsatellite loci, four species-specific A. rufa x A. chukar Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA markers providing further insights into their degree of genetic integrity. Furthermore, English A. rufa museum specimens (n = 13 : 1824 - 1915) were characterised at a 229 -bp long fragment of the Cytochrome-b to know if and to what extent the genetic diversity had been shaped over time by ex situ management. The picture inferred by mitochondrial DNA pointed to the tight genetic affinity of both historical and modern East Anglian birds with A. r. rufa from the easternmost part of the species’ range. Overall, an increase of diversity and decline of disparity over time within and among A. rufa populations emerged, respectively. Whereas no evidence of A. chukar mixed maternal ancestry was found in the ancient birds, introgression in modern ones was widespread, pointing to the irretrievable loss of the potentially high conservation value of this resource and precluding its possible employment for ex situ genetic conservation of A. r. rufa in its native range...|$|E
40|$|Some {{animals are}} somehow paradoxical: well {{impressed}} {{in the collective}} imaginary of the recent past, they might be nonetheless soon removed from our memory. Among these, the <b>black</b> <b>francolin</b> (Francolinus francolinus; BF), a pheasant-like bird known as Attagen in the Classic Age, is an exemplary case. Presently distributed from Cyprus and the Middle East eastwards to the Indian subcontinent, the BF was also found in Italy and Spain till the XIXth c., yet its nativeness to such areas was dubious. Long regarded as a renowned delicacy, the meat of this bird was also thought to possess medical and even aphrodisiac properties. For this reason, the BF was hold in high regard by the aristocracy in Medieval and Renaissance Europe as courtly gamebird. This is well documented by the severe bans restricting hunting of this bird to ruling elites enacted in Spain, Sicily and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany during the XVth c. onwards, with penalties ranging from exorbitant fines to even corporal punishment. Traditionally hunted by falconry, the BF is mentioned {{in a number of}} letters exchanged by rulers both in Italy and Spain that point to the relevance of this species as symbol of wealth and prestige. Interestingly, the species is portrayed as valuable game in a number of still life paintings realized in Italy and Spain during the XVIIth c. When the strict protection ceased, the BF rapidly became extinct in the western Mediterranean due to uncontrolled harvest and land reclamation, notwithstanding the belated attempts to save the species with the offer of cash prices for people who protected nests and broods. Here we present a multidisciplinary study relying on a thorough historical documentation and an extensive DNA analysis of modern and archival specimens (mtDNA Control Region gene; n = 281) aimed at unveiling the origin of the BF in the western Mediterranean and, at the same time, rescuing the memory of this prized bird from oblivion. Our data targeted the species as nonnative to the western Mediterranean, pointing to the occurrence of geographically distinct genetic stocks. If, on the one hand, the invoked importation from Cyprus during the Crusades was confirmed on a molecular basis, on the other hand strong evidences for importations from southern Asia through long-distance trade routes emerged. Noteworthy, this finding shed further light on the major role played by Portuguese merchants in satisfying the demand for exotic species at European courts and, more generally, on the sometimes neglected involvement of human-mediated species dispersal in shaping present-day biodiversity...|$|E
