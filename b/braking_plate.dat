5000|$|Mechanical Snubber: Whilst {{having the}} same {{application}} as the hydraulic snubber, retardation of the pipe is due to centrifugal braking within the snubber. A split flywheel is made to rotate at high velocity causing steel balls to be forced radially outwards. The flywheel is forced apart by the steel balls causing <b>braking</b> <b>plates</b> to come together thus retarding the axial displacement of the snubber. Rotation of the flywheel is generated by the linear displacement of the main rod acting on a ball-screw or similar device. It is also very expensive.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{few changes}} from applied B. The gears are changed to RA-width gears (1 mm {{increase}} in size) to increase durability of the transmission. There {{is also a}} valve that prevents [...] "drop-clutch" [...] starts {{in an effort to}} reduce the number of shattered gear boxes from abusive AWD launching. The ignition ring is now illuminated with green lighting. Early 2002 WRXs had <b>brake</b> duct <b>plates.</b> At the end of calendar year 2002, the <b>brake</b> duct <b>plates</b> were no longer equipped on the WRXs. A shorter metal fuel pipe and longer connector hose were implemented under the intake manifold to avoid fuel leaks at freezing temperatures.|$|R

40|$|In January 2004, two Mars Exploration Rover {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} Mars. Each safely delivered an identical rover to the Martian surface in a tetrahedral lander encased in airbags. Upon landing, the airbags deflated and three Lander Petal Actuators opened the three deployable Lander side petals enabling the rover {{to exit the}} Lander. Approximately nine weeks prior to the scheduled launch of the first spacecraft, one of these mission-critical Lander Petal Actuators exhibited a brake stuck-open failure during its final flight stow at Kennedy Space Center. Residual magnetism was the definitive conclusion from the failure investigation. Although residual magnetism was recognized as {{an issue in the}} design, the lack of an appropriately specified lower bound on brake drop-out voltage inhibited the discovery of this problem earlier in the program. In addition, the brakes had more unit-to-unit variation in drop-out voltage than expected, likely due to a larger than expected variation in the magnetic properties of the 15 - 5 PH stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>plates.</b> Failure analysis and subsequent rework of two other Lander Petal Actuators with marginal brakes was completed in three weeks, causing no impact to the launch date...|$|R

50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> tester is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} a vehicles braking system in a dynamic test. The unit consists of two moving parallel plates mounted on force transducers. A measurement of the braking force is made when a vehicle passes over the plates and then applies its brakes. The braking action causes the individual plates to ‘slip’ forwards allowing a calculation of braking force to be made. Brake imbalance between {{the left and right}} hand side can also be measured by the differences in voltage measured on each of the force transducers under the chassis. Due to the nature of it dynamic operation, <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> testers are far less common than roller brake testers in UK garages although they are also an extremely accurate method of measurement.|$|R

5000|$|North America {{receives}} {{its first}} Impreza WRX models. They {{are equipped with}} an EJ205 engine rated at [...] at 6000 rpm with 217 lbft Nm at 4000 rpm. Unlike the Japanese EJ205, the US-spec engine uses a Mitsubishi TD04-13T turbocharger unit. In stock form, it reaches a peak [...] of boost. The seats {{are the same as}} the basic J-spec Impreza. The wheels are cast 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] version of the J-spec WRX NB wheels while the brakes are 2-piston/1-piston front and rear with the front rotors being ventilated disks. 2002 WRXs came with <b>brake</b> duct <b>plates</b> that guided the air in the front bumper vent to the wheel well. The gear ratios are the standard export models, but the final drive is a 3.9:1 ratio. The rear LSD is a viscous coupling type. The steering rack has a ratio of 16.5:1. The 4 gear electronic automatic transmission (4EAT) WRXs have a Variable Torque Distribution AWD system instead of the conventional viscous coupling center differential. VTD employs an electronically controlled hydraulic transfer clutch and a planetary gear center differential to distribute power in a 45:55 split between the front and rear axles under normal circumstances. The VTD system uses multiple sensors to measure front and rear driveshaft speeds, throttle position and gear selection. Then it actively transfers power accordingly between the front and rear wheels for optimum traction and handling. The WRX weighs 3085 lb.|$|R
50|$|In {{production}} {{the complete}} power unit was {{carried on a}} special front fork, with the 104 cc two-stroke engine on the left with its main-shaft run through the wheel spindle to a flywheel. Ignition was by chain-driven Runbaken magneto bolted upside-down to the crankcase base, and transmission was by chain up to a counter-shaft carrying a clutch {{and then back to}} the wheel by a second chain. The firm offered a package of wheel, engine unit and front fork or the choice of complete ladies’ or gents’ machines. The complete Cykelaid could be purchased for £50. The specification included an Eadie coaster brake, rear hand-operated <b>brake,</b> number <b>plate,</b> rear stand and Brooks saddle. The wheels were 28″×1.75″, shod with Dunlop Roadster tyres. Alternatively, the complete front fork assembly was available for £32, as a conversion of an existing bicycle. The early versions were not fitted with a front brake and, as mentioned above, the complete machine was fitted with two independent rear brakes. Presumably, when buying the front fork unit to convert an existing bicycle, one was also expected to fit an additional rear brake to the machine. Although the engine was lubricated by the petroil mixture, an additional oil tank was fitted. An oil pump driven by the front wheel hub delivered a measured supply of oil to the engine’s main bearings. It would, therefore, be inadvisable to allow the engine to run for a long period with the clutch disengaged, since this would cut off the supply of oil to the crankshaft. None of the available options proved to be very popular with the buying public.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). <b>Brake</b> pistons are <b>plated</b> in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle {{received}} a new barrel with a chrome-lined bore and 4 right-hand grooves at a 200 mm (1:7.87 in) rifling twist rate. The front sight base and gas block were redesigned. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a 90° angle {{in relation to}} the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hole. A pair of support brackets are cast into the gas block assembly and are used to attach a BG-15c or GP-25 underslung 40 mm grenade launcher. Like the AK-47 and AKM, the muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as the standard muzzle brake or a blank-firing adaptor, while a spring-loaded detent pin held in the front sight post prevents them from unscrewing while firing. The distinctive standard-issue muzzle brake features a large expansion chamber, two symmetrical vertical cuts at the forward end of the brake and three non symmetrical positioned vent holes to counteract muzzle rise and climb as well as lateral shift to the right much like the AKM's offset muzzle <b>brake.</b> A flat <b>plate</b> {{near the end of the}} brake produces a forward thrust when emerging exhaust gases strike its surface, greatly reducing recoil. The muzzle brake prevents backblast from reaching the firer, although it is reported to be harsh on bystanders as the muzzle gases are dispersed to the sides. The standard-issue AK-74 muzzle brake has been subtly revised several times since the 1970s, ...|$|R
