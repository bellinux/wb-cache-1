5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current <b>badge</b> which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular <b>badge</b> which used the same shield as the current <b>badge,</b> inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual <b>badge</b> has not been used; instead shirts bearing a <b>badge</b> of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a <b>badge</b> of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual <b>badge</b> with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E
5|$|Most Scouts {{choose to}} work on the Explorer <b>badge</b> that is related to the section of Scouting their Troop belongs to, but {{there is no reason why}} a Scout can not do an Explorer <b>badge</b> from another section.
