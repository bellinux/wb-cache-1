The tester richlie embrothered with my Lo. armes in a garland of hoppes, roses, and pomegranetts, and lyned with buckerom.

60|$|At length a truce being established, {{the king}} came, {{and with him}} near three hundred men; and soon after the queen, with half as many women. They were not stark naked, neither men nor women, but wearing a loose piece of cloth about their middles; what {{it was made of}} we could not imagine, for it was neither linen or woollen, cotton or silk; nor was it woven, but twisted and braided by hand, as our women make <b>bone</b> <b>lace</b> with bobbins. It seems it was the stalk of an herb, which this was made with; and was so strong that I doubt not it would have made cables for our ships, if we had wanted to make such an experiment.|$|E
2500|$|Court dress, {{the grand}} habit de cour or [...] "stiff-bodied" [...] gown, {{retained}} the {{styles of the}} 1670s. It featured a low, oval neckline that bared the shoulders, and the heavily <b>boned</b> bodice <b>laced</b> closed in back, unlike the front-opening robe. The elbow-length sleeves were covered with tiers of lace flounces, echoing the full-sleeved chemise worn with the original style.|$|R
50|$|The second Kingmaker is {{the father}} of Bullseye who {{appeared}} during the Dark Reign storyline. When Bullseye was fighting an army of Hawkeyes and took them out except for one, he was captured by Solo and brought before Kingmaker. Kingmaker prepares to trade his old burned husk of a body for his son's by placing his brain in Lester's body. Unfortunately, nobody told him that Bullseye's <b>bones</b> are <b>laced</b> with adamantium which not only is impossible to cut, but also blocks Kingmaker's neural inhibitor.|$|R
50|$|Azerbaijani art has {{developed}} over the ancient history of Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijanis have created a rich and distinctive culture, {{a major part of}} which is decorative and applied art. This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity, is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jewelery-making, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and <b>bone,</b> carpet-making, <b>lacing,</b> pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the culture and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very popular there. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.|$|R
50|$|Bobbin lace is {{also known}} as pillow lace, because it was worked on a pillow, and <b>bone</b> <b>lace,</b> because early bobbins were made of bone or ivory.|$|E
50|$|Whoever wears clothes {{trimmed with}} gold, silver, or <b>bone</b> <b>lace,</b> above two shillings by the yard, shall be {{presented}} by the grand jurors, and the selectmen shall tax the offender at £300 estate.|$|E
50|$|Hearing of work {{opportunities}} in North America, Hall left England {{and settled in}} Jamestown. Hall supported themself by making <b>bone</b> <b>lace</b> and other needlework. Pursuing a different work opportunity, Hall relocated to the small settlement at Warrosquyoacke, Virginia, in an Indian village across from the James River, likely a village of fewer than 200 in the 1620s. Tobacco planters in need of workers preferred hiring men. Hall switched from Thomasine to Thomas to be hired as a male servant.|$|E
2500|$|Women's stays of the 18th {{century were}} laced behind {{and drew the}} {{shoulders}} back to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles {{of the end of}} the century, stays became shorter and were unboned or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again <b>boned</b> and <b>laced</b> to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny ("wasp") waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were stiffened with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the fainting room. By the 1880s, the dress reform movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by tight lacing. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the [...] "health corset", with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.|$|R
60|$|At one, Cousin George {{was at work}} {{upon his}} broiled <b>bones</b> and tea <b>laced</b> with brandy, having begun his meal with soda and brandy. He was {{altogether}} dissatisfied with himself. Had he known on the preceding evening what was coming, he would have dined on a mutton chop and a pint of sherry, and have gone to bed at ten o'clock. He looked {{at himself in the}} glass, and saw that he was bloated and red,--and a thing foul to behold. It was a matter of boast to him,--the most pernicious boast that ever a man made,--that in twenty-four hours he could rid himself of all outward and inward sign of any special dissipation; but the twenty-four hours were needed, and now not twelve were allowed him. Nevertheless, he kept his appointment. He tried to invent some lie which he might send by a commissioner, and which might not ruin him. But he thought upon the whole that it would be safer for him to go.|$|R
50|$|Alongside {{the boot}} and shoe {{industry}} was {{the remains of}} the hand lace trade. It was a cottage-based industry with a lace school in Church Street where children might have been taught the basic 3Rs and the Catechism but also and more importantly, how to make <b>bone</b> <b>lace.</b> By the late 19th century, this ancient craft was gradually being driven into decline by the Nottinghamshire machine lace industry, but it still exists today as a hobby or past-time practised by very skilled craftspeople.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first child}} to be born to Anne and James after James succeeded Elizabeth I of England, Mary was the first princess of Great Britain, {{although}} then {{it was not so}} named. Her birth was thus awaited with much excitement among both the Scottish and the English. Disputes among nobility as to the distribution of places in the establishment for the unborn child were very common. A note containing the necessaries ordered by the king for his child contains orders of the following: [...] "a carnation velvet cradle, fringed with silver fringe and lined with carnation satin; a double scarlet cloth to lay upon the cradle at night; a cradle cloth of carnation velvet with a train, laid with silver, and lined with taffeta to lay upon the cradle; two small mantles of unshorn velvet, lined with the same velvet; one large bearing cloth of carnation velvet, to be used when the child is brought forth of the chamber, lined with taffeta; one great head sheet of cambric for the cradle, containing two breadths, and three yards long, wrought all over with gold and coloured silks and fringed with gold; six fine handkerchiefs of fine cambric, one to be edged with fair cut work, to lay over the child's face; six veils of lawn, edged with fair <b>bone</b> <b>lace,</b> to pin with the mantles; six gathered bibs of fine lawn with ruffles edged with bone lace; two bibs to wear under them, wrought with gold and coloured silks." [...] The total cost of this went up to £300, currently worth around £790,000.|$|E
