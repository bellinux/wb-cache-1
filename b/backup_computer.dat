25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the <b>backup</b> <b>computer,</b> entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned {{for the remainder of the}} encounter.|$|E

50|$|The Apollo Abort Guidance System (AGS, {{also known}} as Abort Guidance Section) was a <b>backup</b> <b>computer</b> system {{providing}} an abort capability {{in the event of}} failure of the Lunar Module's primary guidance system (Apollo PGNCS) during descent, ascent or rendezvous. As an abort system, it did not support guidance for a lunar landing.|$|E
50|$|The RCE {{computers}} use the RAD750 CPU, {{which is}} a successor to the RAD6000 CPU of the Mars Exploration Rovers. The RAD750 CPU, a radiation-hardened version of the PowerPC 750, can execute up to 400 MIPS, while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to only 35 MIPS. Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup and will take over {{in the event of}} problems with the main computer. On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the <b>backup</b> <b>computer</b> due to an issue with the then active computer's flash memory, which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The <b>backup</b> <b>computer</b> was turned on in safe mode and subsequently returned to active status on March 4. The same issue happened in late March, resuming full operations on March 25, 2013.|$|E

In short, many corporations do not practice modern BCP but the traditional BCP (Kim, 2009 b: 135 – 138). Besides, not much has been done in terms of dealing with other hazards and related impacts, such as industrial espionage, arson, and earthquake.|$|R

50|$|STS-41-C {{launched}} successfully at 8:58 am EST on April 6, 1984. The mission {{marked the}} first direct ascent trajectory for the Space Shuttle; Challenger reached its 288-nautical-mile-(533-km)-high orbit using its Orbiter Maneuvering System (OMS) engines only once, to circularize its orbit. During the ascent phase, the main computer in Mission Control failed, as did the <b>backup</b> <b>computer.</b> For about an hour, the controllers had no data on the orbiter.|$|E

50|$|A {{concern with}} using digital {{fly-by-wire}} systems on the Shuttle was reliability. Considerable research {{went into the}} Shuttle computer system. The Shuttle used five identical redundant IBM 32-bit general purpose computers (GPCs), model AP-101, constituting a type of embedded system. Four computers ran specialized software called the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS). A fifth <b>backup</b> <b>computer</b> ran separate software called the Backup Flight System (BFS). Collectively they were called the Data Processing System (DPS).|$|E
