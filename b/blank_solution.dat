During the salting process huge amounts of salted wastewater are generated – approximately 22 % w/w of the codfish – carrying ca. 250 g/L of sodium chloride and ca. 10 g/L of organic compounds, namely proteins and free amino acids. In this study, the salt load of wastewater generated during the salting process of codfish (Gadus morhua) was successfully reduced by ethanol extraction. The effects of time, sample:ethanol ratio, pH and temperature on salt extraction by ethanol addition were assessed by a onevariable-at-a-time approach and then by performing a 32 fractional factorial design. The effects of pH were also assessed in absence of ethanol. The maximum amount of salt precipitated in the wastewater was ca. 33 %, at a wastewater-ethanol ratio 1 : 1 (v/v), at a temperature of 0 °C and after 30 min.

The observed effect is less significant for Fe 3 + and Cr 3 + in the presence of SO 42 - and HPO 42 - respectively.
