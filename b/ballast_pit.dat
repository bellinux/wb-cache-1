2500|$|Once the Tokarahi Branch opened, the {{two lines}} {{employed}} some inventive working. [...] Each morning mixed trains {{from the two}} termini met at Windsor Junction, where they were marshalled into a passenger train to Oamaru and a slower goods train. [...] The reverse of this {{took place in the}} afternoon. [...] Although the two branches were set up to open up country and provide transport for farmland, the freight on the line was not purely agricultural: a coal mine and, {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, a flour mill were located in Ngapara, and limestone for both building blocks and agricultural uses was loaded from quarries along the line. [...] Enfield had a <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> until the late 1940s or early 1950s, used to supply materials for the protection of Oamaru's foreshore.|$|E

5000|$|Cricket {{was also}} played on {{ice in the}} Fens, though it never became as popular as bandy. In February 1855 the Cambridge Chronicle {{reported}} on a match between March and Wisbech on the <b>Ballast</b> <b>Pits</b> at March. The home team beat the visitors by 118 runs, thanks to a century not out by Rhodes. [...] "The fielding and batting {{of many of the}} players was considered to be far superior to and more graceful than any cricketing on the green sward".|$|R
50|$|The War Department halt was an {{informal}} railway {{station on the}} Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent, England. Over the 15 years that the station was open, its location {{is believed to have}} moved several times. Details are scarce as this was a secret military installation, but the end of the War Department branch line moved as building work (see below) moved onto new stages. When the installation closed in 1945 the railway company took over the line for freight shipment of ballast. Again, the end point of the line changed several times as the exact location of extraction of ballast changed, until closure of the branch in 1951. The locations of the halt are now under water owing to subsequent commercial extractions and flooding of the <b>ballast</b> <b>pits.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Tyrrell's {{fortunes}} declined {{to the point}} where he had to run his team without sponsorship. Tyrrell still retained his eye for talent, bringing Michele Alboreto, Stefan Bellof and Martin Brundle to F1, but was not able to retain them. Without the proper funding, Tyrrell was the only entrant with the Cosworth DFV at a time when all other teams had switched to turbocharged engines. Alboreto scored the engine's last win in 1983, but in 1984 the team was excluded from the championship after being found to have run underweight cars before adding <b>ballast</b> during <b>pit</b> stops. Tyrrell denied this and felt his team was being singled out for refusing to run more expensive turbos.|$|R
50|$|Dunback was {{the only}} manned station. 100 m before Inch Valley, a short siding ran to a <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> and had a 39-wagon loop. The points faced towards Dunback.|$|E
5000|$|A 9 km branch from Kapuni to Manaia {{was built}} in 1920-24 to service a <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> on the Kaupokonui River, but was closed and the track lifted by 1926.|$|E
50|$|Pallavaram is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} oldest inhabited places in South India. A major archaeological find was made in the year 1863 when the British archaeologist Robert Bruce Foote discovered a stone implement from the Paleolithic Age inside a <b>ballast</b> <b>pit.</b> Since then, a number of stone age artifacts have been uncovered. Most of these artifacts are currently lodged in the Egmore museum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{situated}} on the main Didcot to [...] railway line, {{to the north of}} the site of Millstream Junction, the junction for the original terminus at Oxford (Grandpont), which was later a goods station but had closed by 1900. Access to Hinksey Halt was via Norreys Avenue and a footpath across the adjacent reservoir. The reservoir was formerly a <b>ballast</b> <b>pit,</b> dug by the GWR between 1844 and 1848.|$|E
50|$|Two {{engines that}} were not {{scrapped}} following withdrawal were FA 315 and 373, which had been allocated to the Nelson Section following their rebuilding. They had been put aside in the Glenhope engine shed following withdrawal, and were dumped in the Glenhope <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> in the mid-1930s. These locomotives were at the time relatively complete, but in time their wheels, boilers, and water tanks were removed. The remains of the locomotives, if they still exist, comprise the frames, cowcatchers, cylinders, upper cab and coal bunkers.|$|E
50|$|Steam Shovel No.1 {{was used}} early in its {{life at the}} <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> at Mt. Ruse. During 1909 the shovel was {{constantly}} dismantled and moved to other locations, one example being Armadale, when the cutting was being constructed from South Yarra to Toorak during the quadruplication of the Caulfield line, to increase services to Frankston and Dandenong. Presumably the shovel was also used to dig out Camberwell station {{and parts of the}} Glen Waverley line. It is thought that this work was shared with shovels Ruston and Harmon owned by the construction branch.|$|E
50|$|Upper Redwater Lake is {{a narrow}} {{freshwater}} {{lake in the}} municipality of Temagami of Northeastern Ontario, Canada, located southeast of the former Rabbit Creek <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> along Rabbit Creek Road that comes out at Highway 11. The settlement of Redwater {{is located on the}} southeastern shore of Upper Redwater Lake and the Ontario Northland Railway mainline runs along its entire western shore. Its northern end is crossed by the Ontario Northland Railway where the lake sways northeastwards. At {{the southern end of the}} lake is a strait that connects Upper Redwater Lake with Lower Redwater Lake.|$|E

50|$|Local railway enthusiast and preservationist John Murphy {{wrote to}} the Railways Department in October 1975 {{requesting}} a lease on a small plot of railway land in the Wairarapa on which he intended to erect a storage shed to house a Standard class railcar he has acquired in 1973. The railcar {{was at the time}} with the Glenbrook Vintage Railway but a policy change resulted in Murphy being requested to remove his railcar. He decided to relocate it to the Wairarapa and suggested three sites in his lease application that would be suitable: the former <b>ballast</b> <b>pit</b> at Featherston station, at Woodside station (south end of the yard, formerly in use for the stockyards), and at the former Opaki station site. The function of the site was to be for the storage of RM 31 and a D-class steam locomotive owned by another railway enthusiast as well as assorted parts and equipment, and for restoration and maintenance work on the same. It was not intended to allow for public access or commercial operations.|$|E
