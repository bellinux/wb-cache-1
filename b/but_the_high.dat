5|$|After Cersei {{fails to}} appear, Lancel Lannister {{is sent to}} {{retrieve}} her. Lancel follows one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, and finds a wildfire cache about to explode. He is stabbed in the spine before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery Tyrell, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. King Tommen Baratheon witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep and commits suicide by jumping out a window.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested {{that there may have been}} only a small amount of sewage released <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) main camera primary {{electronics}} {{failed in}} June 2006, {{and the power}} supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007. Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was operable using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel. The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline.|$|E

That month, the contract for four escalators in the station was awarded to Otis Elevator Company. The station opened on June 24, 1933.|$|E
5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, Alice married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Eustorgius, Archbishop of Nicosia, to inquire into the {{legality}} of the marriage. Alice, who continued to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Court ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli for the duration of her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy visited with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a crusade for the Holy Land.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a {{component}} of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast in a vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Episodes one and {{two were}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, episode three by Simon Delaney and episode four by Tim Sullivan. Ripley was in the late stages of pregnancy and permitted to work for only {{a short amount of}} time, so the fourth episode was filmed before the third. Ripley did not travel to Portmeirion {{with the rest of the}} cast, so a make-up artist stood in as Jenny in the beach and clifftop scenes, wearing the prosthetic stomach originally made for Ripley in the first series. A close-up of Jenny standing next to Jo was filmed in front of a similar backdrop in Manchester and edited into the location footage. The producers endeavoured to film on location once per series <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> cost of the Sydney episode and the rising salaries of the cast meant the budget could not permit travel any further than Portmeirion, a village most famous as the location in The Prisoner. Rachel's car accident was filmed on location in Moston, Greater Manchester in the early hours of 6 October 2002. Following the completion of filming, the sets were dismantled and moved to landfill sites.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

5|$|Starting in late 1917, the Germans {{had begun}} to use surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia; this forced the British to send squadrons from the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. On 6 February 1918, the 6th Battle Squadron and eight British destroyers escorted a convoy of {{merchant}} ships to Norway. While steaming off Stavanger on the 8th, Delaware was attacked twice by a German U-boat, though evasive maneuvers allowed Delaware to escape undamaged. The squadron was back in Scapa Flow on 10 February; Delaware escorted two more such convoys in March and April. On 22–24 April, the German High Seas Fleet sortied to intercept one of the convoys {{in the hope of}} cutting off and destroying the escorting battleship squadron. Delaware {{and the rest of the}} Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow on 24 April in an attempt to intercept the Germans, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet had already broken off the operation and returned to port.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and {{is quite different from the}} sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E

5|$|After making {{landfall}} near Jacmel, Hurricane Gustav began traversing northwestward {{across the}} mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti, dumping heavy rains as it passed. With favorable atmospheric conditions the storm maintained its hurricane intensity {{for several hours}} after landfall, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation. The eye because ragged and clouded over as Gustav weakened to a tropical storm. A large mid- to upper-level anticyclone over the Florida Straight slowed Gustav's movement, holding it over the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Rainfall from the storm, which had been heavy since its landfall, began to accumulate as the storm's movement stalled. Although the storm's upper levels began experiencing moderate shear, and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with the mountains of southwestern Haiti, enough of Gustav's convection was over the Gulf of Gonâve that {{on the morning of}} August 27 its organization started to improve. That afternoon, as a broad ridge extended from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Gustav began to slowly pull to the west, away from the island of Hispaniola. Increased shear weakened the storm as the building ridge to the north of Gustav imparted a southerly component to the storm's motion.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{was ready}} for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM drove it to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. Night Trap transitioned from VHS to CD-ROM and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five years after it was originally filmed.|$|E
