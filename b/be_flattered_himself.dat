You {{know what it}} must seem like to him to have another man step in, just as he may have <b>been</b> <b>flattering</b> <b>himself</b> that he <b>was</b> gaining ground. He hated you before. He'd give his soul, if he had one to break you now." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the solo}} was ended, the Old Lady's {{conscience}} compelled her to drag {{her eyes and}} thoughts from Sylvia, and fasten them on the minister, who had <b>been</b> <b>flattering</b> <b>himself</b> all through the opening portion of the service that Old Lady Lloyd had come to church on his account. He was newly settled, having {{been in charge of}} the Spencervale congregation only a few months; he was a clever little fellow and he honestly thought it was the fame of his preaching that had brought Old Lady Lloyd out to church.|$|R
6000|$|Six {{weeks passed}} away, and as no {{communication}} had been {{received from the}} Kitterbells, Dumps <b>was</b> beginning to <b>flatter</b> <b>himself</b> {{that the child was}} dead, when the following note painfully resolved his doubts:â€” ...|$|R
60|$|He sat {{on one of}} {{the high}} seats behind Sir Timothy Beeswax and Sir Orlando Drought, listening, or pretending to listen, to the speeches of three or four gentlemen {{respecting}} sugar, thinking of all this till half-past seven;--and then he went to dine with the proud consciousness of having done his duty. The forms and methods of the House <b>were,</b> he <b>flattered</b> <b>himself,</b> soaking into him gradually,--as his father had desired. The theory of legislation was sinking into his mind. The welfare of the nation depended chiefly on sugar. But he thought that, after all, his own welfare must depend on the possession of Mab Grex.|$|R
6000|$|Frank was {{completely}} bothered. He {{thought that if}} she were so sorrowful, if she grieved so deeply at the match being broken off, {{that was just the}} reason why he should see her. After all, it <b>was</b> rather <b>flattering</b> to <b>himself</b> to hear of her sorrows; dear Fanny! was she so grieved that she was forced to part from him? ...|$|R
6000|$|So it {{was sweet}} {{to her to}} think that he was another's! He who had <b>been</b> {{modestly}} <b>flattering</b> <b>himself</b> a few moments ago that he must take care not to go too far with this admiring little girl! O woman, woman, {{how difficult it is to}} know you, and how often, when we think we know you at last, have we to begin again at the beginning! He had never asked an enduring love from her; but surely, after all that had passed between them, he had a right to expect a little more than this. Was it maidenly to bring the glove and hand it to him without a tremor? If she could do no more, she might at least have turned a little pale when Corp told her of it, and then have walked quietly away. Next day she could have referred to it, with just the slightest break in her voice. But to come straight to him, looking delighted-- ...|$|R
60|$|Colquhoun {{was a man}} of some importance, {{who held}} a Crown appointment, and Vane felt {{inclined}} to wonder why Chisholm had not sent him a letter to him. Afterward, he guessed at the reason, which <b>was</b> not <b>flattering</b> to <b>himself</b> or his host. Nairn and he chatted a while on business topics, until there was a sound of voices below, and going down in company with Mrs. Nairn they found two or three new arrivals in the entrance hall. More came in; and when they sat down to supper, Vane was given a place beside a young lady whom he had already met.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is seldom}} that youth, however high-minded, is able, from mere {{strength}} of character and principle, to support itself against the force of ridicule. Half angry, half mortified, and, to say truth, half ashamed of his more manly and better purpose, Nigel <b>was</b> unable, and <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> it <b>was</b> unnecessary, to play {{the part of a}} rigid moral patriot, in presence of a young man whose current fluency of language, as well as his experience in the highest circles of society, gave him, in spite of Nigel's better and firmer thoughts, a temporary ascendency over him. He sought, therefore, to compromise the matter, and avoid farther debate, by frankly owning, that, if to return to his own country were not his choice, it was at least a matter of necessity. [...] "His affairs," [...] he said, [...] "were unsettled, his income precarious." ...|$|R
6000|$|Who, then, {{is to be}} the Reforming Statesman, {{and begin}} the noble work for us? He is the preliminary; one such; with him we may prosecute the {{enterprise}} to length after length; without him we cannot stir in it at all. A true king, temporary king, that dare undertake the government of Britain, on condition of beginning in sacred earnest to [...] "reform" [...] it, not at this or that extremity, but at the heart and centre. That will expurgate Downing Street, and the practical Administration of our Affairs; clear out its accumulated mountains of pendantries and cobwebs; bid the Pedants and the Dullards depart, bid the Gifted and the Seeing enter and inhabit. So that henceforth there be Heavenly light there, instead of Stygian dusk; that God's vivifying light instead of Satan's deadening and killing dusk, may radiate therefrom, and visit with healing all regions of this British Empire,--which now writhes through every limb of it, in dire agony as if of death! The enterprise is great, the enterprise may be called formidable and even awful; but there is none nobler among the sublunary affairs of mankind just now. Nay tacitly it is the enterprise of every man who undertakes to be British Premier in these times;--and I cannot esteem him an enviable Premier who, because the engagement <b>is</b> tacit, <b>flatters</b> <b>himself</b> that it does not exist! [...] "Show it me in the bond," [...] he says. Your Lordship, it actually exists: and I think you will see it yet, in another kind of [...] "bond" [...] than that sheepskin one! ...|$|R
60|$|Luis de Bobadilla {{was just}} as good a Catholic as a rigid education, a {{wandering}} life, and the habits of the camp would be apt to make one of his rank, years, and temperament. Still, that was an age in which most laymen had a deep reverence for religion; whether they actually submitted to its purifying influence or not. If there were any free-thinkers, at all, they existed principally among those who passed their lives in their closets, or were to be found among the churchmen, themselves; who often used the cowl as a hood to conceal their infidelity. His close association with Columbus, too, had contributed to strengthen our hero's tendency {{to believe in the}} constant supervision of Providence; and he now felt a strong inclination to fancy that this extraordinary facility of Ozema's in acquiring languages, was one of its semi-miraculous provisions, made with a view to further the introduction of the religion of the cross among her people. Often did he <b>flatter</b> <b>himself,</b> as he sat gazing into the sparkling, and yet mild eyes of the girl, listening to her earnest efforts to make him comprehend her meaning, that he was to be the instrument of bringing about this great good, through so young and charming an agent. The admiral had also enjoined on him the importance of ascertaining, if possible, the position of the mines, and he had actually succeeded in making Ozema comprehend his questions on a subject that was all-engrossing with most of the Spaniards. Her answers were less intelligible, but Luis thought they never could <b>be</b> sufficiently full; <b>flattering</b> <b>himself,</b> the whole time, that he was only laboring to comply with the wishes of Columbus.|$|R
60|$|The Doge {{shook his}} head, {{in a way}} to prove that he could not {{possibly}} <b>flatter</b> <b>himself</b> with such a hope.|$|R
60|$|Clovis {{could at}} least <b>flatter</b> <b>himself</b> that he had infused some of the {{reckless}} splendour of the East into his mendacity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless he <b>flatters</b> <b>himself,</b> there <b>is</b> no one {{belonging}} to you {{who would not}} wish {{that he should be}} nearer and dearer still." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Rowland <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> {{upon the}} shrewdness {{with which he}} read her, never dreaming that he had but read just what she {{intended}} he should.|$|R
6000|$|The {{intimacy}} {{begun in}} college chambers was continued when the youth {{came to town}} during the vacations. The uncouth, unwieldy moralist <b>was</b> <b>flattered</b> at finding <b>himself</b> an object of idolatry to two high-born, high-bred, aristocratic young men, and throwing gravity aside, was ready to join in their vagaries and play {{the part of a}} [...] "young man upon town." [...] Such at least is the picture given of him by Boswell on one occasion when Beauclerc and Langton having supped together at a tavern determined to give Johnson a rouse at three o'clock in the morning. They accordingly rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple. The indignant sage sallied forth in his shirt, poker in hand, and a little black wig {{on the top of his}} head, instead of helmet; prepared to wreak vengeance on the assailants of his castle; but when his two young friends, Lankey and Beau, as he used to call them, presented themselves, summoning him forth to a morning ramble, his whole manner changed. [...] "What, is it you, ye dogs?" [...] cried he. [...] "Faith, I'll have a frisk with you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. W.--And Professor of Phlebotomy in the University. He <b>flatters</b> <b>himself</b> he <b>is</b> {{a man of}} the world, Miss Mullins, {{and always}} dances in the long vacation.|$|R
60|$|He <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that it <b>was</b> opportunity, not audacity, {{which had}} failed him. He misjudged {{the quality of}} his own nature, and held it for {{something}} lower than it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and of yours. But {{it will be}} all right." [...] The {{young man}} <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that this <b>was</b> as near as he was willing to go to any view of pecuniary convenience.|$|R
60|$|Randal <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that he {{had made}} a prevaricating reply simply impossible. Nothing of the sort! Mr. Sarrazin slipped through his fingers once more. The unwritten laws of gallantry afforded him a refuge now.|$|R
60|$|Egremont <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> {{that he had}} {{not been}} recognised, and dismissing his little guide, instead of {{proceeding}} to the factory he sauntered away in an opposite direction, and made a visit to the church.|$|R
60|$|Did a {{momentary}} chill cool {{the intensity of}} Dudley Pickering's ardour? If so he overcame it instantly. He despised Roscoe Sherriff. He <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that he had shown Roscoe Sherriff pretty well who was who and what was what.|$|R
60|$|He <b>flattered</b> <b>himself,</b> however, that Brady's {{evidence}} {{would render}} that event certain; and whatever annoying questions might {{be put to}} himself on the defence, he was determined that Brady should swear to enough on the direct examination to ensure his purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "All that's ancient history," [...] said Major Forsyth, {{with what}} he <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> <b>was</b> a very good {{assumption}} of jocularity. It was his idea to treat the matter lightly, {{as a man of}} the world naturally would. But his interruption was unnoticed.|$|R
60|$|A man to <b>flatter</b> <b>himself</b> {{with the}} idea {{that he would not be}} guilty of some certain wickedness,---as, for instance, to yield to the {{personal}} temptations of the Devil,--yet to find, ultimately, that he was at that very time committing that same wickedness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if I didn't exercise, do {{you suppose}} I {{should be able to}} do that--or that?" [...] cried Jack, turning a {{somersault}} and striking a fine attitude as he came up, <b>flattering</b> <b>himself</b> that he <b>was</b> the model of a youthful athlete.|$|R
60|$|At {{dinner the}} strangers were proudly {{presented}} to M. le Colonel, and received affable bows {{from the little}} man, who <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that he could talk English, and insisted on speaking an unknown tongue, evidently wondering at their stupidity in not understanding their own language.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that he {{had said}} this pretty well for an idiotic monster; but the child, {{instantly}} perceiving the awkwardness of his attempt to adapt himself to her level, utterly destroyed his hopeful opinion of himself by saying compassionately: [...] "What a funny man you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ned {{thought that}} his {{knowledge}} was already pretty extended {{in reference to}} life, and even <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> {{that he had had}} some stranger views of it than his uncle, but he prudently did not give expression to his thoughts; and, after a short pause, Mr Shirley resumed-- ...|$|R
60|$|De Catinat {{knew well}} how {{this method of}} {{annoying}} Huguenots had been practised all over France, but he had <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that his own position at court would have insured his kinsman from such an outrage. He threw the paper down with an exclamation of anger.|$|R
60|$|Miss Drewitt {{eyed him}} {{carefully}} and then passed upstairs {{to put on}} her hat. Relieved of her presence the captain walked to the small glass over the mantelpiece and, regarding his tell-tale features with gloomy dissatisfaction, acquired, after one or two attempts, an expression which he <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> defied analysis.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what, Norman, if I was you, I {{would not make}} Decius <b>flatter</b> <b>himself</b> with the fame he was to get--it is too like the stuff every one talks in stupid books. I want him to say--Rome--my country--the eagles--must win, if they do--never mind what becomes of me." ...|$|R
60|$|The pump was, fortunately, a {{powerful}} one, {{and they had}} nearly two miles of smoother water before they stretched out of the bay upon the other track; but when they did so Carroll, who glanced down again through the scuttle, could not <b>flatter</b> <b>himself</b> that he had reduced the water.|$|R
6000|$|Did Pulci expect {{his friend}} Lorenzo {{to keep a}} grave face during the recital of these passages? Or did he <b>flatter</b> <b>himself,</b> that the {{comprehensive}} mind of his hearer could at {{one and the same}} time be amused with the banter of some old song and the pathos of the new one?[9] ...|$|R
60|$|But then {{occurred}} the {{recollection of}} the impossibility of obtaining an interview with his fatally estranged mistress, and testing the influence over her affections, which he still <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> with possessing. Could he step {{beyond the limits of}} his prison, the world would be all sunshine; but here was only gloom and death.|$|R
60|$|Vivian and {{his companions}} strolled about for some time, conversing on {{subjects}} of casual interest. The Baroness, though no longer absent, either in her manner or her conversation, seemed depressed; and Vivian, while he <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that he <b>was</b> more entertaining than usual, felt, to his mortification, that the lady was not entertained.|$|R
60|$|Whatever the curate's defects of person--and he <b>flattered</b> <b>himself</b> that he <b>was</b> modest {{enough to}} know his bad points--no one, he fancied, could deny him manliness. It is {{possible}} {{that he was not}} deceived. Put him in a bowler-hat and a bell-bottomed coat, and few could have distinguished him from a cab-driver.|$|R
