MLP {{is also used}} in the DVD-Audio format, but details of Dolby TrueHD and the MLP Lossless format as used on DVD-Audio differ substantially. A Dolby TrueHD bitstream can carry up to 16 discrete audio channels. Sample depths up to 24 bits/sample and audio sample rates up to 192 kHz are supported. Like the more common legacy codec Dolby Digital, Dolby TrueHD bitstreams carry program metadata. Metadata is separate from the coding format and compressed audio samples, but stores relevant information about the audio waveform and provides control over the decoding process. For example, dialog normalization and dynamic range compression are controlled by metadata embedded in the Dolby TrueHD bitstream. Similarly, a Dolby Atmos encoded Dolby TrueHD stream contains metadata to extract and place the objects in relevant positions. Dolby TrueHD is a variable <b>bit-rate</b> <b>codec.</b>|$|E

40|$|This work {{looks at}} the issues {{involved}} in performing robust speech recognition over mobile and IP networks. The conventional method for sending speech across a mobile or IP network is to encode the speech on the terminal device using a low <b>bit-rate</b> <b>codec</b> and then transmit the stream of codec parameters. It is shown in this work that for speech recognition applications an alternative is available whereby the front-end processing part of a network-based speech recogniser is detached and moved onto the terminal device.

Simulations demonstrate that sending the speech features in this manner can provide a significant enhancement in recognition performance over the traditional codec-based approach.

Because the degree of burstiness depends on the packet interval, we first derive a formula to re-compute the conditional loss probability of a Gilbert loss model when the packet interval changes. We find that FEC works better at a larger packet interval under bursty losses. In our MOS-based (Mean Opinion Score) listening tests, we did not find a consistent trend in MOS when burstiness increases if FEC is not used. That is, in some occasions MOS can be higher with a higher burstiness. With FEC, our results confirms the analytical results that quality is better with a larger packet interval, but T should not be too large to avoid severe penalty on a single packet loss. We also find that low bit-rate redundancy generally produces lower perceived quality than FEC, if the main codec is already a low <b>bit-rate</b> <b>codec.</b> Finally, we compare our MOS results with objective quality estimation algorithms (PESQ, PSQM/PSQM+, MNB and EMBSD).

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has posed new {{challenges to the}} development of speech codecs. The key issue of transporting real-time voice packet over IP networks is the lack of guarantee for reasonable speech quality due to packet delay or loss. Most of the widely used narrowband codecs depend on the Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) coding technique. The CELP technique utilizes the long-term prediction across the frame boundaries and therefore causes error propagation in the case of packet loss and need to transmit redundant information in order to mitigate the problem. The internet Low <b>Bit-rate</b> <b>Codec</b> (iLBC) employs the frame-independent coding and therefore inherently possesses high robustness to packet loss. However, the original iLBC lacks in some of the key features of speech codecs for IP networks: Rate flexibility, Scalability, and Wideband support. This dissertation presents novel scalable narrowband and wideband speech codecs for IP networks using the frame independent coding scheme based on the iLBC. The rate flexibility is added to the iLBC by employing the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and iii the scalable algebraic vector quantization (AVQ) and by allocating different number of bits to the AVQ. The bit-rate scalability is obtained by adding the enhancement layer to the core layer of the multi-rate iLBC. The enhancement layer encodes the weighted iLBC coding error in the modified DCT (MDCT) domain. The proposed wideband codec employs the bandwidth extension technique to extend the capabilities of existing narrowband codecs to provide wideband coding functionality. The wavelet transform is also used to further enhance the performance of the proposed codec. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed codec provides high robustness to packet loss and achieves equivalent or higher speech quality than state-of-the-art codecs under the clean channel condition...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) will dominate wireless and wireline voice communications {{in the near}} future. Traditionally, a minimum level of Quality-of-Service is achieved by careful traffic monitoring and network fine-tuning. However, this solution is not feasible {{when there is no}} possibility of controlling/monitoring the parameters of the network. For example, when speech traffic is routed through Internet there are increased packet losses due to network delays and the strict end-to-end delay requirements for voice communication. Most of today’s speech codecs were not initially designed to cope with such conditions. One solution is to introduce channel coding at the expense of end-to-end delay. Another solution is to perform joint source/channel coding of speech by designing speech codecs which are natively robust to increased packet losses. This thesis proposes a framework for developing speech codecs which are robust to packet losses. The thesis addresses the problem in two levels: at the basic source/channel coding level where novel methods are proposed for introducing controlled redundancy into the bitstream, and at the signal representation/ coding level where a novel speech parameterization/modelling is presented that is amenable to efficient quantization using the proposed source coding methods. The speech codec is designed to facilitate high-quality Packet Loss Concealment (PLC). The speech signal is modeled with harmonically related sinusoids; a representation that enables fine time-frequency resolution which is vital for high-quality PLC. Furthermore, each packet is encoded independently of the previous packets in order to avoid a desynchronization between the encoder and the decoder upon a packet loss. This allows some redundancy to exist in the bit-stream. A number of contributions are made to well-known harmonic speech models. A fast analysis/synthesis method is proposed and used in the construction of an Analysis-by-Synthesis (AbS) pitch detector. Harmonic Codecs tend to rely on phase models for the reconstruction of the harmonic phases, introducing artifacts that effect the quality of the reconstructed speech signal. For a high-quality speech reconstruction, the quantization of phase is required. Unfortunately, phase quantization is not a trivial problem because phases are circular variables. A novel phase-quantization algorithm is proposed to address this problem. Harmonics phases are properly aligned and modeled with a Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model (WGMM) capable of handling parameters that belong to circular spaces. The WGMM is estimated with a suitable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Phases are then quantized by extending the efficient GMM-based quantization techniques for linear spaces to WGMM and circular spaces. When packet losses are increased, additional redundancy can be introduced using Multiple Description Coding (MDC). In MDC, each frame is encoded in two descriptions; receiving both descriptions provides a high-quality reconstruction while receiving one description provides a lower-quality reconstruction. With current GMM-based MDC schemes it is possible to quantize the amplitudes of the harmonics which represent an important portion of the information of the speech signal. A novel WGMM-based MDC scheme is proposed and used for MDC of the harmonic phases. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} construct high-quality MDC codecs based on harmonic models. Furthermore, it is shown that the redundancy between the MDC descriptions can be used to “correct” bit errors that may have occurred during transmission. At the source coding level, a scheme for Multiple Description Transform Coding (MDTC) of multivariate Gaussians using Parseval Frame expansions and a source coding technique referred to as Conditional Vector Quantization (CVQ), are proposed. The MDTC algorithm is extended to generic sources that can be modeled with GMM. The proposed frame facilitates a computationally efficient Optimal Consistent Reconstruction algorithm (OCR) and Cooperative Encoding (CE). In CE, the two MDTC encoders cooperate in order to provide better central/side distortion tradeoffs. The proposed scheme provides scalability, low complexity and storage requirements, excellent performance in low redundancies and competitive performance in high redundancies. In CVQ, the focus is given in correcting the most frequent type of errors; single and double packet losses. Furthermore, CVQ finds application to BandWidth Expansion (BWE), the extension of the bandwidth of narrowband speech to wideband. Concluding, two proof-of-concept harmonic codecs are constructed, a single description and a multiple description codec. Both codecs are narrowband, variable rate, similar to quality with the state-of-the-art iLBC (internet Low <b>Bit-Rate</b> <b>Codec)</b> under perfect channel conditions and better than iLBC when packet losses occur. The single description codec requires 14 kbps and it is capable of accepting 20 % packet losses with minimal quality degradation while the multiple description codec operates at 21 kbps while it is capable of accepting 40 % packet losses without significant quality degradation. ...|$|E
