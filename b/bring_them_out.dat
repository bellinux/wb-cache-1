25|$|Southampton {{returned}} to St Mary's on 28 October to host Tottenham Hotspur, sitting in 19th {{place in the}} Premier League due to results the day before. The game started poorly for the Saints, as they went behind in the 15th minute to a goal from former Southampton player Gareth Bale, who headed in a Tom Huddlestone cross to put Spurs ahead. The visitors continued {{to take charge of}} the first half, with Bale receiving and creating many additional chances, many for striker Jermain Defoe, and the run of play finally culminated in a second goal for the visitors when Clint Dempsey followed up a Defoe shot in the 39th minute. After more domination by the visitors in the second half, the hosts finally pulled a goal back courtesy of Jay Rodriguez in the 66th minute, who converted a chance following a shot by José Fonte saved by Brad Friedel. Southampton continued to put pressure on Tottenham, with more chances for Lambert and Rodriguez, but it wasn't enough to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the relegation zone.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{year before}} her death, she was {{assistant}} editor of the Californian Illustrated Magazine, who offered the following tribute to her memory: [...] "The Pacific Coast world of letters has suffered a loss {{in the past month}} in the death of Emily Tracy (Swett) Parkhurst. Parkhurst was connected with the Californian as an assistant editor, was a contibutor to its columns, and wrote its literary reviews. She was a woman of rare promise, possessed of great talent, which, combined with executive ability, made her a prominent figure in many assemblies. Her especial work was the formation of the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association. A few years ago she traveled through the state and made the personal acquaintance of all the Pacific Coast writers, her object being to advance the interests of women writers — <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> and aid them in obtaining a field for their work. In this she was extremely successful. She gathered about her hundreds of contributors to the literary press of the day, and finally organized the Press Association, of which she became secretary. The work thus accomplished did much in encouraging women to make a fight for themselves, and by her means many are now self-supporting who, previous to the movement, realized little or nothing from their literary work. Parkhurst combined rare executive ability with literary discernment and taste, and was a brilliant organizer. At the time of her death, she had plans laid out for work that would have appalled many. One was a thorough investigation of the possibility of woman's work in horticulture and agriculture in this state. This was not theory, as the plan included a system by which women could enter the lists with men in farming and marketing their products. Few women had so large an acquaintance; few will be missed by so great a number; and so a well-spent, bright life is ended, apparently cut short, yet leaving a rich heritage, a rare example to those who are left behind." ...|$|E
