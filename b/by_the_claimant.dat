5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the Claimant was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Claimant,</b> who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant,</b> but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E
25|$|The conflict, {{for years}} {{localized}} and contained, entered its second phase in early 1888. Skirmishes between newspapers suddenly exploded when {{prestige of the}} claimant got involved; as Nocedal refused to budge, in August Carlos VII expulsed him from Carlism. Now both leaders rushed to acknowledge differences, with unusually brutal frankness listed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> and Ramón Nocedal.|$|E

25|$|Pre-existing {{disadvantage}} {{asks whether}} there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant.</b> In Corbiere v. Canada McLachlin described this factor to be the most compelling and suggestive of discrimination if proven. However, the absence of a pre-existing disadvantage does not necessarily preclude a claimant from succeeding as seen in Trociuk v. British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|The ESA50 claim form, {{together}} {{with any other}} information sent with it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant,</b> will first be read by a qualified healthcare professional employed by the outsourcing firm, who will then decide on whether a face-to-face medical assessment is necessary: some people with severe disabilities can be granted ESA {{based solely on the}} documents supplied, if that is clear from the paperwork. For this reason, Maximus encourages new claimants to send as much relevant information as possible and give a detailed description of their disability when filling in the claim form.|$|E
25|$|Contributory {{negligence}} is a mitigatory defence, whereby a claimant's damages {{are reduced}} {{in accordance with}} the percentage of contribution made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> to the loss or damage suffered. Thus, in evaluating a collision between two vehicles, for example, if the wronged driver were not wearing a seatbelt, he would most likely be contributorily negligent. The court will then quantify the damages for the actual loss or damage sustained, and then reduce the amount paid to the claimant by 20%. Contributory negligence can also function as a full defence, when it is assessed at 100%, as in Jayes v IMI Kynoch.|$|E

25|$|Elections {{were held}} in July 2012 to a General National Congress (GNC), which took power a month later, charged with organising a {{constituent}} assembly for authoring Libya's new constitution. The NTC was formally dissolved, and in November 2012 Ali Zeidan {{was sworn in as}} Prime Minister. In March 2014, Zeidan was ousted by the GNC, amid escalating conflict in the country. On 4 August 2014, the GNC was replaced by a newly elected Council of Deputies (CoD), but on 25 August 2014, some members of the former GNC reconvened unilaterally and said they had elected Omar al-Hasi as Prime Minister, effectively leaving the country with two rival governments: the one proclaimed by the CoD in Tobruk and the one proclaimed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> GNC in Tripoli.|$|E
500|$|If an {{occupier}} allows {{an extremely}} dangerous activity {{to take place}} on his land without taking precautions to ensure the contractor has liability insurance and a safety plan, he may be held liable. In Bottomley v Todmorden Cricket Club [...] the Court of Appeal held that, where the defendant had allowed an independent contractor {{to set up a}} pyrotechnic display on their land without checking for public liability insurance, they were liable for the injuries suffered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant.</b> The extent to which one has to check for public liability insurance is weak; in Gwilliam v West Hertfordshire Hospital NHS Trust [...] the Court of Appeal held that where the contractor's insurance had expired {{a few days before the}} event, the occupier was not liable. In Naylor v Payling the occupier was not liable for failing to check public liability, since he had checked the contractor was accredited under the police and local government schemes required, and the contractor had been employed for 18 months before the case during which there were no reasons to doubt his competency. The Court of Appeal also held that, except in special circumstances, there was no [...] "free-standing duty" [...] to take reasonable steps to ensure an independent contractor was insured.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, the Department of Social Security {{abolished}} Invalidity Benefit for new {{claims and}} introduced Incapacity Benefit instead. The main {{difference was that}} the new benefit would only be paid if <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> was unfit for any job, not just their old trade. The department then began to commission independent medical assessments using its new All Work Test. However, {{only a minority of}} fresh claims were actually assessed in this way; the rest were still gauged by a government official using information provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant's</b> GP.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Claimant</b> quickly {{acquired}} significant supporters; the Tichborne family's solicitor Edward Hopkins accepted him, as did J.P. Lipscomb, the family's doctor. Lipscomb, after {{a detailed}} medical examination, reported that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> possessed a distinctive genital malformation. It {{would later be}} suggested that Roger Tichborne had this same defect, but this could not be established beyond speculation and hearsay. Many people were impressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Claimant's</b> seeming ability to recall small details of Roger Tichborne's early life, such as the fly fishing tackle he had used. Several soldiers who had served with Roger in the Dragoons, including his former batman Thomas Carter, recognised <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> as Roger. Other notable supporters included Lord Rivers, a landowner and sportsman, and Guildford Onslow, the Liberal MP for Guildford who became one of <b>the</b> <b>Claimant's</b> staunchest advocates. Rohan MacWilliam, in {{his account of the}} case, calls this wide degree of recognition remarkable, particularly given <b>the</b> <b>Claimant's</b> increasing physical differences from <b>the</b> slim Roger. <b>By</b> mid-June 1867 <b>the</b> <b>Claimant's</b> weight had reached almost [...] and would increase even more in the ensuing years.|$|R

2500|$|The Perales {{proceeding}} {{is not the}} same. We are {{not concerned}} with termination of disability benefits once granted. Neither are we concerned with a change of status without notice.

And the authors of those reports were known and were subject to subpoena and to the very cross-examination that the claimant asserts he has not enjoyed.

2500|$|Justice Douglas {{joined by}} Justice Black and Justice Brennan dissented saying that {{although}} Section 556(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act provided that [...] "ny oral or documentary evidence may be received," [...] which could include hearsay evidence, hearsay evidence could not by itself {{be the basis}} for an adverse ruling. Written reports by physicians who have examined claimant for disability insurance benefits under Social Security Act constitute [...] "substantial evidence" [...] supporting a nondisability finding within the standard of 205 (g) of the Act, notwithstanding the reports' hearsay character, the absence of cross-examination (through claimant's failure to exercise his subpoena rights), and the directly opposing testimony <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> and his medical witness; and procedure followed under Act does not violate due process requirements.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{conservation}} of energy still holds and any claims otherwise (over unity) do not constitute part of mainstream science.

It held that the hearsay evidence in the case was admissible under the Act; that, specifically, the written reports of the physicians were admissible in the administrative hearing; that Dr. Leavitt's testimony also was admissible; but that all this evidence together did not constitute substantial evidence when it was objected to and when it was contradicted by evidence from the only live witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the sources}} {{consulted}} clarifies why Cortina left the regional jefatura. At the time Carlism was divided into supporters of de Mella and those standing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant,</b> but in historiography he is only marginally mentioned as a somewhat disoriented Mellista sympathizer. It seems that the circumstances were strictly personal. Third Carlist War broke {{the back of the}} family; while other Marchena representatives of [...] "burguesia agraria" [...] kept growing into wealth, Cortina struggled. Turning 60 and with health problems, he concluded that he would be better off on the state payroll possibly earning a pension and perhaps assumed that moving to Madrid would facilitate his return to public service. Starting 1917 he was already noted as resident of the capital. As Ministerio de Ultramar no longer existed he knocked at the doors of Ministerio de Hacienda and got finally restored as 3. class administrative official in Ministerio de Fomento, success probably conditioned by distant family ties.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} defences in England and Wales to a claim under Rylands v Fletcher; act {{of an unknown}} third party, {{contributory}} negligence, consent and statutory authority. An act of an unknown third party will absolve the defendant of liability, as in Perry v Kendricks Transport Ltd. In Northwestern Utilities Ltd v London Guarantee and Accident Co Ltd, the principle was established that if a claimant knows of the unknown third party and their actions, the defendant is additionally {{likely to be able}} to deny liability. As Rylands requires strict liability, any contributory negligence voids most of the claim. Initially it was sufficient to offset the case itself; with the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, courts instead apportion damages, taking into account how much of the harm was contributed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>claimant.</b> Nevertheless, contributory negligence is still a viable partial defence to a Rylands claim. Other valid defences are where the claimant has consented, expressly or impliedly, to the accumulation of the [...] "thing", and where there is statutory authority for the accumulation.|$|E
5000|$|It is, of course, {{possible}} that the disability may produce {{a situation in which}} further injury is caused.
