40|$|Reciprocal {{frames and}} {{reciprocal}} structures {{have already been}} considered of great interest in the past, as witnessed {{by the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci and of other important scientists and architects. Recent researches show that both the shape and the mechanical behaviour of such structures are really complexes, due to the concept of reciprocity. The position of each structural element in the space, indeed, as well as the way they transfer loads, depends on the position and on the role of adjacent elements, so that the structure must be studied as a whole and it can hardly be decomposed in simpler substructures. In this paper we focus on the statical and mechanical determinacy of a specific subset of this kind of structures, i. e. the multiple plane reciprocal frames. In this structures the shape can be easily defined in plane coordinates, so that only the mechanical behaviour needs to be studied. The presence of mechanisms or the possibility of self-stress states is largely related to the kind of internal constraints joining each bar to the others. The study is developed starting from the basic works on pinned <b>bars</b> <b>assemblies</b> [5], [8], in which the statical and kinematical determinacy are discussed by means of a matrix formulation of the equilibrium and compatibility equations. The extension of such formulation from pinned <b>bars</b> <b>assemblies</b> to plane reciprocal frames is the main goal of the researc...|$|R

40|$|Fidelity of the humoral immune {{response}} requires that quiescent B lymphocytes display membrane bound immunoglobulin M (IgM) on B lymphocytes surface {{as part of the}} B cell receptor, whose function is to recognize an antigen. At the same time B lymphocytes should not secrete IgM until recognition of the antigen has occurred. The heavy chains of the secretory IgM have a C-terminal tail with a cysteine instead of a membrane anchor, which serves to covalently link the IgM subunits by disulfide bonds to form “pentamers” or “hexamers. ” By virtue of the same cysteine, unassembled secretory IgM subunits are recognized and retained (via mixed disulfide bonds) by members of the protein disulfide isomerase family, in particular ERp 44. This so-called “thiol-mediated retention” <b>bars</b> <b>assembly</b> intermediates from prematurely leaving the cell and thereby exerts quality control on the humoral {{immune response}}.

Standard models have 12, 15 or 21 chord bars available, providing a selection of major, minor, and dominant seventh chords. These are arranged for historical or systemic reasons, as for example: Various special models have also been produced, such as diatonic one, two, or three key models, models with fewer or additional chords, and even a reverse-strung model (the 43-string, 28-chord Chromaharp Caroler).|$|E
50|$|On the CSBS each {{of these}} arrows has a {{mechanical}} equivalent in the bombsight. The direction of the yellow arrow {{is that of the}} aircraft itself, represented in the bombsight by its mounting to the aircraft fuselage. The length of the yellow arrow is set by rotating the air speed drum, carrying the windage calculator with it. The milled head is used to rotate the wind bar to the same angle as the wind, in this case about 120 degrees. This would leave the wind bar almost at right angles to the drift bar, with the wind speed knob easily accessible on the left. Finally the wind speed would be dialled into the wind speed knob, which would push the entire drift <b>bar</b> <b>assembly</b> to the right. When all of the adjustments are complete, the bombsight and airspeed shaft mechanically represent the yellow arrow, the wind bar represents the blue arrow, and the green arrow is formed by the drift wires providing direction, and the foresights are positioned {{at the tip of the}} arrow.|$|E

40|$|Membrane {{remodeling}} {{is important}} in cellular processes like vesicle trafficking, organelle shaping, movement or division. In Drosophila the membrane-shaping N-BAR protein amphiphysin {{is involved in the}} biogenesis and stabilization of deep invaginations of the sarcolemma, the T-tubules, crucial for the excitation-contraction coupling machinery in striated muscles. Drosophila amphiphysin mutants are viable but flightless due to a disorganized T-tubule network. However, details of the amphiphysin membrane interaction the underlying molecular mechanism how amphiphysin is remodeling and maintaining tubular membrane shapes and the three dimensional structure of the amphiphysin assembly are unknown. In this study I structurally characterized the helical arrangement of Drosophila amphiphysin on membrane tubes by using cryo-EM. I found that the BAR domain cooperatively self-assembles to a helical arrangement on the membrane surface. The cryo-EM 3 D reconstruction of amphiphysin N-BAR-mediated tubes provided first structural insights into the unique and well-connected helical amphiphysin <b>BAR</b> <b>assembly.</b> One tip of the crescent-shaped BAR dimer is immersed into the membrane whereas the other tip is protruding outwards from the tube surface. In addition, it seems that the regulatory domains with a SH 3 domain of amphiphysin are not involved in the membrane remodeling process. The helical BAR lattice is well-connected by laterally locking BAR domains in adjacent lattice rows via the H 0 helix and by tip-to-center interactions of neighboring BAR domains in one lattice row. The H 0 helix is insignificant for the membrane remodeling activity but essential for the fast initiation of the helical BAR polymerization and for the formation of a rigidly organized BAR arrangement on the tube surface. Mutations at the tip region or _H 0 helix mutants showed impaired tube remodeling activity and a disorganized helical BAR arrangement. This suggests that the H 0 helix as well as the BAR tips are crucial for an efficient and organized <b>BAR</b> <b>assembly</b> on the tube surface. I observed that amphiphysin N-BAR-mediated tubes are more rigid and uniform as endophilin N-BAR-mediated tubes, contributing to the dynamic membrane scission process in endocytosis. The cooperative BAR self-assembly and the unique and well-connected BAR arrangement on membranes give insights into the molecular mechanism of membrane shaping by amphiphysin and its ability to maintain the shape of T-tubules...|$|E

Methods: We used a polyethylene model representing the pelvic ring and simu-lated a unilateral sacroiliac dislocation.

A preliminary design study provided several suitable thermal protection system designs for the combustor, one of which was a two-pass regenerative type air-cooled omega-shaped segment liner.
