5|$|Leissègues' {{squadron}} {{had escaped}} from Brest on 13 December 1805, {{taking advantage of}} a lapse in the British blockade. Sailing with another squadron under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, Leissègues separated from Willaumez after two days and passed north of the Azores, where his ships were damaged and scattered by winter storms. Sailing for Santo Domingo to reconstitute his squadron and make urgent repairs, Leissègues arrived on 20 January 1806. Duckworth had been tasked with watching the remnants of the French and Spanish fleets in Cádiz following the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, but in November had gone hunting to the south in search of a French raiding squadron and on his route back to his station had encountered a frigate that reported the escape of Leissègues and Willaumez. Sailing in pursuit, Duckworth encountered Willaumez on 25 December but refused battle and instead sailed for the West Indies to replenish his supplies before making the journey back to European waters. News reached him of the French arrival while anchored at <b>Basseterre</b> on 1 February and he immediately sailed to investigate, joined by part of the West Indies squadron under Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the islands}} have mountainous {{interiors}} surrounded by narrow coastal plains. The exceptions were Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands (which are all fairly flat), and Trinidad (which has a large mountain range {{in the north and}} a small central mountain range in the interior of the otherwise flat island). The narrow coastal plains as well as historical trade is the main reason why almost all of the major settlements (cities and towns) of the Federation were located on the coast. Chief towns included Kingston, Port of Spain, Bridgetown, Spanish Town, Montego Bay, Mandeville, Castries, Roseau, St. George's, Kingstown, St. John's, and <b>Basseterre.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the 2001 census, Christianity is Anguilla's {{predominant}} religion, with 29 {{percent of}} the population practising Anglicanism. Another 23.9 percent are Methodist. Other churches on the island include Seventh-day Adventist, Baptist, Roman Catholic (served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's - <b>Basseterre,</b> with see at Saint John on Antigua and Barbuda) and a community of Jehovah's Witnesses (0.7%). Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the Church of God and Pentecostals increased considerably. There are at least 15 churches on the island. Although a minority on the island, it is an important location to followers of Rastafarian religion—Anguilla is the birthplace of Robert Athlyi Rogers, author of the Holy Piby which has had a strong influence on Rastafarian beliefs. Various other religions are practised as well. More recently, a Muslim cultural centre has opened on the island.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1782, {{after the}} {{military}} campaign of January in <b>Basseterre</b> {{on the island}} of Saint Christopher, the French fleet of Comte de Grasse, which aimed to annex British Jamaica, left Martinique and headed towards the archipelago of les Saintes, where it arrived in the evening. Caught in the Dominica Passage by the British and inferior in number, it was crushed by the vessels of the vices-admirals of Great Britain, Baron George Brydges Rodney aboard Formidable and Viscount Samuel Hood aboard Barfleur. According to legend, after he had fired the last of the ammunition of his carronades, de Grasse fired his silverware. In a little more than five hours, 2,000 French were killed, and 5,000 men and 5 boats captured. The defeat put les Saintes under British control for twenty years. The Royal Navy, after the Battle of the Chesapeake (Virginia) in 1781 and this battle, was very weakened and could not strengthen the colonial troops against the American separatists. So, the Battle of the Saintes finished the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
500|$|On 6 February, Leissègues was {{surprised}} at anchor by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, which had been taking on fresh supplies at <b>Basseterre</b> when news of Leissègues' arrival reached him. Joined by ships from the West Indian squadron, Duckworth's force was larger than Leissègues' and also {{had the advantage of}} the wind that prevented the unprepared French squadron from escaping. Sailing westwards along the coast in a line of battle, Leissègues' flagship Impérial was the first to be attacked, eventually driving ashore along with the next in line, while three others surrendered at the Battle of San Domingo. Leissègues himself escaped ashore; the only surviving ships of his squadron were the frigates, all of which eventually returned to France later in the spring.|$|E
500|$|On 1 February {{the small}} sloop [...] arrived at <b>Basseterre</b> with {{information}} that three French ships {{of the line}} had been sighted off Santo Domingo. Duckworth gave orders for the fleet to sail immediately. On 3 February the brig [...] joined him at St. Thomas and on 5 February the frigate [...] under Captain Adam Mackenzie joined near the Mona Passage. Mackenzie {{was accompanied by a}} Danish schooner that had sailed from Santo Domingo a few days before, and whose crew were able to provide a detailed account of the French squadron's composition. Before the schooner had sailed, a number of French officers had commented on the risk involved in allowing the vessel to leave port, but the admiral had refused their demands that he burn the Danish ship. Duckworth was now confident that he outnumbered and outgunned Leissègues. During the night of 5 February the British squadron slowly approached Santo Domingo, Acasta and Magicienne scouting ahead of the main fleet.|$|E

On 21 January two ships of the West Indian squadron joined them: [...] under Captain John Morrison and [...] under Captain Samuel Pym. Northumberland was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, {{who met with}} Duckworth but had no new information about French movements in the region. In fact, Leissègues {{had arrived in the}} Caribbean on 20 January, his passage delayed since departing from Brisbane's convoy in December and his ships damaged and dispersed by a series of winter storms off the Azores. Disembarking the troops at Santo Domingo, the French admiral made repairs to his ships, awaited the arrival of the missing Alexandre and Brave, and took on supplies over the next two weeks in preparation for raiding operations in the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|As Willaumez escaped {{into the}} South Atlantic, Duckworth ordered his {{squadron}} to sail for Barbados to resupply {{before making the}} long journey back to Cadiz.

There two ships of the Leeward Islands squadron, [...] and , joined him. Northumberland was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, commander of the station. Cochrane's arrival raised the number of admirals in the squadron to three, as Duckworth's second in command was Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis in [...] Leissègues was also {{en route to the}} Caribbean, winter storms off the Azores having delayed him, separated Alexandre and Brave and inflicted damage on Jupiter and Diomède. Arriving at the French-held city of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola on 20 January, Leissègues disembarked over 1,000 soldiers as reinforcements for the garrison, and made hasty repairs as he awaited the arrival of his missing ships, which appeared on 29 January. During his time in the harbour, Leissègues moved ashore and gave orders for the ships to be recaulked following their Atlantic voyage, a difficult and time-consuming process.|$|E

Cannonier was awarded a scholarship to the University of the West Indies in 1996, and consequently did not again appear for the Leeward Islands until the 1999–00 Red Stripe Bowl (a limited-overs competition). The 2000–01 season was his last with the Leewards, but in the 2002–03 Red Stripe Bowl he represented the [...] "Rest of Leeward Islands" [...] side that played during Antigua and Barbuda's period as a separate team.

The wound became infected and Hughes had to beg team management to be allowed to remain on the tour. Despite his later recovery, he did not play any of the Tests; his personality and attitude to the game did not meet with the approval of the captain, Simpson. A reporter wrote at the time, [...] "Kim Hughes is the most frustrated, disillusioned young man in the West Indies today and with good reason.
