40|$|During {{vertebrate}} gastrulation, convergence {{and extension}} (C&E) movements narrow and lengthen the embryonic tissues, respectively. In zebrafish, regional differences of C&E movements have been observed; however, the underlying cell behaviors are poorly understood. Using time-lapse analyses and computational modeling, we demonstrate that C&E of the medial presomitic mesoderm {{is achieved by}} cooperation of planar and radial cell intercalations. Radial intercalations preferentially separate anterior and posterior neighbors to promote extension. In knypek;trilobite noncanonical Wnt mutants, the frequencies of cell intercalations are altered and the anteroposterior bias of radial intercalations is lost. This provides evidence for noncanonical Wnt signaling polarizing cell movements between different mesodermal cell layers. We further show using fluorescent fusion proteins that during dorsal mesoderm C&E, the noncanonical Wnt component Prickle localizes at the anterior cell edge, whereas Dishevelled is enriched posteriorly. Asymmetrical localization of Prickle and Dishevelled to the opposite cell edges in zebrafish gastrula parallels their distribution in fly, and suggests that noncanonical Wnt signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to <b>bias</b> <b>cell</b> intercalations...|$|E

Planar polarization and coordination of these two cell behaviors are essential for neural CE, as shown by failure of mediolateral intercalation in embryos mutant for two proteins associated with planar cell polarity signaling: Vangl 2 and Ptk 7. Embryos with mutations in Ptk 7 fail to polarize cell behaviors within {{the plane of the}} tissue, whereas Vangl 2 mutant embryos maintain tissue polarity and basal protrusive activity but are deficient in apical neighbor exchange.

In order to significantly enhance microarray performance, we are working towards electro-responsive DNA transfection chips. This study focuses on the control of DNA adsorption and desorption by appropriate surface modification of highly doped p++ silicon. Silicon was modified by plasma polymerisation of allylamine (ALAPP), a non-toxic surface that sustains cell growth. Subsequent high surface density grafting of poly(ethylene oxide) formed a layer resistant to biomolecule adsorption and cell attachment.

40|$|Switching between {{attractive}} and repulsive migration in cell movement {{in response to}} extracellular guidance cues {{has been found in}} various cell types and is an important cellular function for translocation during cellular and developmental processes. Here we show that the preferential direction of migration during electrotaxis in Dictyostelium cells can be reversed by genetically modulating both guanylyl cyclases (GCases) and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) -binding protein C (GbpC) in combination with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol- 3 -OH kinases (PI 3 Ks). The PI 3 K-dependent pathway is involved in cathode-directed migration under a direct-current electric field. The catalytic domains of soluble GCase (sGC) and GbpC also mediate cathode-directed signaling via cGMP, whereas the N-terminal domain of sGC mediates anode-directed signaling in conjunction with both the inhibition of PI 3 Ks and cGMP production. These observations provide an identification of the genes required for directional switching in electrotaxis and suggest that a parallel processing of electric signals, in which multiple-signaling pathways act to <b>bias</b> <b>cell</b> movement toward the cathode or anode, is used to determine the direction of migration. ...|$|E

We found that FGF- 2 overexpression in retinal precursors altered the relative numbers of transgene-expressing retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and Miiller glia; RGCs were increased by 35 % and Muller glia decreased by 50 %. In contrast, the proportion of retinal precursors that became photoreceptors was unchanged. Within the photoreceptor population, however, we found a twofold increase in rod photoreceptors {{at the expense of}} cone photoreceptors.

The advancement of modern electronic technology has been setting more performance demand on the underlying integrated circuits including the {{operational amplifier}}.

To address these concerns, this thesis presents a design of micropower Class AB operational amplifiers which has the ratio of gain bandwidth product to supply current higher than that of an existing IC. The design is in a 0. 6 pxm CMOS process. The input stage of the design has the folded-cascode architecture that allows the input common-mode range down to negative supply voltage. The Class AB output stage swings rail-to-rail and has the ratio of maximum current to quiescent current greater than 100. The <b>bias</b> <b>cell</b> of the operational amplifier is designed to consume only 6 % of the total supply current.

These are often costly and inefficient, involving multiple steps. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we took an alternative approach and selected five small molecule compounds (SMCs) of key signaling pathways to test out a new protocol for the derivation of sensory neurons from human iPSCs. RESULTS: Within 8 days of the differentiation protocol, iPSCderived sensory neurons were achieved at > 80 % efficiency. The derived cells were positive for cytoskeletal markers common to neurons, Tuj 1 and neurofilament, and specific markers for sensory neurons, Islet, peripherin and Brn 3 a. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of the neurons showed firing in response to membrane depolarization, capable of generating action potentials sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX). In co-culture with rat Schwann cells in myelinating medium, axon bundles of the derived sensory neurons underwent myelination, showing internodal segments that were positive for myelin associated proteins. The phenotype of the iPSCderived sensory neurons was sustainable in Neurobasal medium supplemented with maintenance growth factors but without SMCs.

40|$|Invasion {{of cancer}} cells into the {{surrounding}} tissue {{is an important step}} during cancer progression and is driven by cell migration. Cell migration can be random, but often it is directed by various cues such as aligned fibers composed of extracellular matrix (ECM), a process called contact guidance. During contact guidance, aligned fibers bias migration along the long axis of the fibers. These aligned fibers of ECM are commonly composed of type I collagen, an abundant structural protein around tumors. In this paper, we epitaxially grew several different patterns of organized type I collagen on mica and compared the morphology and contact guidance behavior of two invasive breast cancer cell lines (MDAMB- 231 and MTLn 3 cells). Others have shown that these cells randomly migrate in qualitatively different ways. MDA-MB- 231 cells exert large traction forces, tightly adhere to the ECM, and migrate with spindle-shaped morphology and thus adopt a mesenchymal mode of migration. MTLn 3 cells exert small traction forces, loosely adhere to the ECM, and migrate with a more rounded morphology and thus adopt an amoeboid mode of migration. As the degree of alignment of type I collagen fibrils increases, cells become more elongated and engage in more directed contact guidance. MDA-MB- 231 cells perceive the directional signal of highly aligned type I collagen fibrils with high fidelity, elongating to large extents and migrating directionally. Interestingly, behavior in MTLn 3 cells differs. While highly aligned type I collagen fibril patterns facilitate spreading and random migration of MTLn 3 cells, they do not support elongation or directed migration.

Such approach allows to efficiently share the available energy among BSs and turns high heterogeneity in the BS powering into advantage. Comment: Under revision for IEEE TWireles...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} cell {{migration}} based on persistent random walks {{have been successfully}} applied to describe the motility of several cell types. However, the migration of slowly moving connective-tissue cells, such as fibroblasts, is difficult to observe experimentally and difficult to describe theoretically. We identify two primary sources of this difficulty. First, cells such as fibroblasts tend to migrate slowly and change shape during migration. This makes accurate determination of cell position difficult. Second, the cell population is considerably heterogeneous with respect to cell speed. Here we develop a method for fitting connective-tissue cell migration data to persistent random walk models, which accounts for these two significant sources of error and enables accurate determination of the cell motility parameters. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method for modeling both isotropic <b>cell</b> motility and <b>biased</b> <b>cell</b> motility, where the migration of a population of cells is influenced by a gradient in a surface-bound adhesive peptide.

It is necessary to understand how such biases affect algal dispersion in natural and industrial flows, especially in view of growing interest in algal photobioreactors. Motivated by this, we here study the dispersion of gyrotactic algae in laminar and turbulent channel flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the analytical swimming dispersion theory of Bees and Croze (2010). Time-resolved dispersion measures are evaluated as functions of the Peclet and Reynolds numbers in upwelling and downwelling flows.

Here, we develop high-throughput image quantification and statistical analysis methods to gain insight into M. xanthus developmental aggregation dynamics. A quantitative metric of features characterizing each aggregate is used to deduce the properties of the aggregates that are correlated with each fate. The analysis shows that small aggregate size but not neighbor-related parameters correlate with aggregate dispersal. Furthermore, close proximity is necessary but not sufficient for aggregate merging. Finally, splitting occurs for those aggregates that are unusually large and elongated.

We derived expected distributions of parasites per host embryonic cell by modelling parasite transmission as a multitype, Galton–Watson branching process. Parasite prevalence (proportion of females infected) was significantly heterogeneous among localities. Parasite burden in zygotes was much higher for females infected with Nosema than in animals infected with O. effeminans.

Once explanted and cultured in vitro under appropriate conditions, human ES cells retain pluripotency (i. e. capacity to differentiate into all somatic cell types) and acquire the ability to self-renew indefinitely. These two properties of human ES cells make them an invaluable resource for developmental biology, cell replacement therapies, drug development and toxicology screening.

In this study we develop a differentiation assay to better recapitulate embryonic development, which we also show as a useful model for predictive toxicology. Within the assay, however, we found persistently heterogeneous differentiation. To better understand how hESCs make lineage decisions, we went back to interrogate heterogeneity within the stem cell compartment, and show that discreet, but functional heterogeneity <b>biases</b> <b>cells</b> to particular fates.

40|$|The {{neural crest}} is a {{transient}} migratory population {{of stem cells}} derived from the dorsal neural folds at the border between neural and non-neural ectoderm. Following induction, prospective neural crest cells are segregated within the neuroepithelium and then delaminate from the neural tube and migrate into the periphery, where they generate multiple differentiated cell types. The intrinsic determinants that direct this process are not well defined. Group E Sox genes (Sox 8, Sox 9 and Sox 10) are expressed in the prospective neural crest and Sox 9 expression precedes expression of premigratory neural crest markers. Here, we show that group E Sox genes act at two distinct steps in neural crest differentiation. Forced expression of Sox 9 promotes neural-crest-like properties in neural tube progenitors {{at the expense of}} central nervous system neuronal differentiation. Subsequently, in migratory neural crest cells, SoxE gene expression <b>biases</b> <b>cells</b> towards glial cell and melanocyte fate, and away from neuronal lineages. Although SoxE genes are sufficient to initiate neural crest development they do not efficiently induce the delamination of ectopic neural crest cells from the neural tube consistent with the idea that this event is independently controlled. Together, these data identify a role for group E Sox genes in the initiation of neural crest development and later SoxE genes influence the differentiation pathway adopted by migrating neural crest cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{comparative}} study {{is presented to}} illustrate several key relationships between impurity density in the silicon wafer and device performance within a baseline silicon nitride firing-through cell process. Results are given {{as a function of}} solidification fraction on multi-crystalline production ingots, and link cell investigations to the solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) blends. Illuminated current-voltage characteristics of SoG-Si cells having a compensated, net acceptor concentration up to 3 x 1017 cm- 3 of show equivalent conversion efficiencies relative to control cells (η> 15. 3 %), and excellent open circuit voltage measurements (Voc> 625 mV). As net acceptor concentration is further increased, recombination influences minority carrier lifetime and offsets corresponding increases in open circuit voltage. To identify metallic impurity species responsible for recombination, laser beam induced current and microwave detected photo-conductance decay mappings are combined with elemental analysis from secondary ion mass spectrometry in the phosphorus-gettered region. Upon optimizing diffusion conditions to create a shallow emitter, enhanced short circuit current values were obtained (Jsc> 32. 5 mA cm- 2). Infrared luminescence images of reverse <b>biases</b> <b>cells</b> are paired with leakage currents measured during dark current-voltage characterization and expressed as a function of net-ionized dopants. Light induced degradation findings on SoG-Si cells are contrasted with other work and proposed explanations from elemental analysis offered. Near-term performance extensions through advanced cell constructions are explored on full size (η> 16. 1 %) and on small area devices (η> 17. 8 %) to illustrate SoG-Si feedstock potential...|$|R
40|$|During {{blastocyst}} formation, inner cellmass (ICM) cells differentiate {{into either}} epiblast (Epi) or primitive endoderm (PrE) cells, labeled by Nanog and Gata 6, respectively, and organized in a salt-and-pepper pattern. Previous {{work in the}} mouse has shown that, in absence of Nanog, all ICMcells adopt aPrEidentity. Moreover, the activation or the blockade of the Fgf/RTK pathway <b>biases</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification towards either PrE or Epi, respectively. We show that, in absence of Gata 6, all ICM cells adopt an Epi identity. Furthermore, the analysis of Gata 6 +/- embryos reveals a dose-sensitive phenotype, with fewer PrE-specified cells. These results and previous findings have enabled {{the development of a}} mathematical model for the dynamics of the regulatory network that controls ICM differentiation into Epi or PrE cells. Themodel describes the temporal dynamics of Erk signaling and of the concentrations of Nanog, Gata 6, secreted Fgf 4 and Fgf receptor 2 Themodel is able to recapitulate most of the cell behaviors observed in different experimental conditions and provides a unifyingmechanism for the dynamics of these developmental transitions. The mechanism relies on the co-existence between three stable steady states (tristability), which correspond to ICM, Epi and PrE cells, respectively. Altogether, modeling and experimental results uncover novel features of ICM cell fate specification such as the role of the initial induction of a subset of cells into Epi in the initiation of the salt-and-pepper pattern, or the precocious Epi specification in Gata 6 +/- embryos.
