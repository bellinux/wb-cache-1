5|$|In May 1941, David Stirling, {{an injured}} British forces Commando in the North Africa theatre, {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} small airborne special forces units to operate <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b> Whilst lobbying for support within Middle East Command it came to Clarke's attention, who offered his backing provided the force {{could also be used}} to help his own deception schemes.|$|E

5|$|Returning to {{his unit}} in mid-March, he soon {{achieved}} his 50th victory. On 23 March, {{he was promoted}} to Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of 9./JG52 after his predecessor was shot down <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> and taken prisoner. The rains returned in April, bringing the muds of the rasputitsa. Aerial activity virtually stopped as both sides took the opportunity to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} also charged with {{gathering}} intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project.

5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war.

In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E
5|$|An Alsos {{team went}} to Stassfurt in the Soviet Occupation Zone and {{retrieved}} 11 tons of ore from WIFO.

50|$|It {{is known}} that other American air units were {{assigned}} to Toul during World War I, however they are unidentified.

5|$|In April 1945, Groves sent Lansdale to Europe, {{where he}} worked with the Alsos Mission to secure 1,000 tons of uranium ore from the German Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt.

The 5th SAS was {{deployed}} on numerous missions <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b> In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and to link up with the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German retreat from the Falaise Gap.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} a frontal {{assault on the}} Gustav Line stronghold at Monte Cassino, and VI Corps, under Major General John P. Lucas from 20 September, was assigned to Operation Shingle, detached from the 15th Army Group to land <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> at Anzio on 22 January 1944. For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the 1st Armored Division {{was attached to the}} 45th Infantry Division. Landing on schedule, VI Corps surprised the Germans, but Major General Lucas's decision to consolidate the beachhead instead of attacking gave the Germans time to bring the LXXVI Panzer Corps forward to oppose the landings.|$|E

25|$|Yet, {{faced by}} the two deadliest German pilots, Nash fought a {{tremendous}} battle.

50|$|From December 1808 until 1812 {{he served}} in the Peninsular War, where {{alongside}} his regular duties, he worked as an 'observing officer'.

5|$|On 19 September he {{attacked}} a Rumpler C.IV which he {{drove down to}} 1,000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates fall from the machine as it took violent evasive action. He abandoned the chase and spotted another. This time {{he attacked}} {{from the sun and}} from behind and below. His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b> Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill. A DFW C.V followed on 23 September—his 13th victory.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} three armies the Wehrmacht also {{designed}} two special units {{to aid the}} offensive. One of these was a battalion-sized airborne formation tasked with dropping behind American lines during {{the first day of}} the offensive, allowing a panzer division from the Sixth Panzer Army easy access across the Meuse. The second unit was a panzer brigade, intending to go <b>behind</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> dressed in American uniforms to give false orders and spread confusion among American defenders in the Ardennes. Also earmarked for the offensive were around 800 aircraft, deployed by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), to provide air support to German forces and destroy much of the Allied air power on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Baliszewski and Tadeusz Kisielewski {{are among}} those who point out the {{opportunity}} the Soviets had at Gibraltar.

The head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's counterintelligence for the Iberian Peninsula from 1941 to 1944 was Kim Philby, the Soviet double agent who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since the 1940s.
