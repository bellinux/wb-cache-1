5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered. The remains of the structure included the foundations and fragments of roof tiles, which most likely, covered the rooms and were found on the surface.

The roof tiles indicate that the building was erected {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century CE.

5|$|Classified as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN due to ongoing habitat destruction and {{a decline in}} the quality of the remaining habitat, the long-tailed ground roller {{is believed to be the}} most threatened species of ground roller. Thirty percent of its already small habitat area was degraded between the mid-1970s and 2000. Slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, logging, and cattle grazing have all contributed to the loss of habitat. As of 2012, no reserves protect any portion of its habitat, and as a result its habitat has been described as the area of Madagascar most in need of conservation efforts. It is also threatened by both hunting and egg-collecting. In addition to humans, dogs hunt this species, and the introduced black rat is a nest predator. This ground roller is capable of tolerating some habitat disturbance, but requires a suitable amount of shade and leaf litter to continue living in the area. Although it was fairly common at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, its population went into decline and it was considered rare by the 1960s. As of 2012, the estimated population of the long-tailed ground roller is between 9,500 and 32,700 birds and declining.|$|E

Para tanto, são analisados, inicialmente, as origens do processo de internacionalização dos direitos humanos e os antecedentes, tanto institucionais quanto sob a perspectiva dos princípios jurídicos, do Tribunal Penal Internacional.

40|$|What do we {{gain from}} {{labeling}} certain norms {{of social organization}} law? This question provides the backdrop against which this chapter will examine <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Leon Petrażycki and Eugen Ehrlich, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founders <b>of</b> legal sociology who devised concepts of law broader than state law. In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> this examination we shall also assess <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> Petrażycki’s 'intuitive law' and Ehrlich’s 'living law' to contemporary legal sociology. The chapter starts by describing the academic and political contexts in which these classical theories were born, before examining their imprint on empirical research. <b>The</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapter brings into focus the potentially romantic element of these ideas, arguing that Petrażycki and Ehrlich’s theories, which were initially intended as alternatives to legal positivism, lend themselves to romantic quests for <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> a community lost in <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> modernity. In <b>the</b> final part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapter these theories are used to explore the Chinese business practices known as guanxi, in order to exemplify how “living law” and “intuitive law” may be employed in socio-legal research. It also shows how these classical ideas can be developed through confrontation with <b>the</b> empirical conditions <b>of</b> global law and trade.

The story focuses on <b>the</b> dilemma <b>of</b> a woman who discovers restrictive social realities as she passes from childhood to womanhood.
