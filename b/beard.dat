Charles Darwin first suggested possible evolutionary explanation of <b>beards</b> in his work The Descent of Man, which hypothesized {{that the process of}} sexual selection may have led to <b>beards.</b> Modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of <b>beards,</b> concluding that there is evidence that a majority of females find men with <b>beards</b> more attractive than men without <b>beards.</b>|$|R
