50|$|In the {{concurrent}} flow dryer, both the grain and air {{are moving in}} the same direction, which means the wettest grain is subjected to the hottest drying air. The kernels leave the drying region at the same temperature and the same moisture content. Energy efficiency is 40% better compared to cross flow dryer. However, the <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> must be deeper than 12 inches depth than cross flow type. Thus, fan power requirements are high {{in this type of}} dryer.|$|E
50|$|Recently it was {{identified}} a special phenomenology for heavy liquid metal-cooled fast reactors -HLM, as lead and lead-bismuth-cooled reactors. Because of the similar densities {{of the fuel}} and the HLM, an inherent passive safety self-removal feedback mechanism due to buoyancy forces is developed, which propels the packed bed {{away from the wall}} when certain threshold of temperature is attained and the bed becomes lighter than the surrounding coolant, thus preventing temperatures that can jeopardize the vessel’s structural integrity and also reducing the recriticality potential by limiting the allowable <b>bed</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E

Still, the resistances of mass transfer, kinetics and equilibrium isotherm of NH 4 + onto granular activated carbon (GAC) need to be verified. In this study, the hybrid plug-flow column reactor (HPFCR) {{with a combination of}} sand and GAC was used to remove NH 4 + from a WWTP’s effluent. Mass transfer model was applied to determine the global, external and internal mass transfer. The data obtained from batch study were analysed using Langmuir and Freundlich equations; Langmuir equation fitting with the NH 4 +adsorption more appropriate. The adsorption kinetics have found match well with pseudo first-order. The dependency of resistance of mass transfer on film mass transfer was slightly higher than porous diffusion, for the <b>bed</b> <b>depths</b> of 2 to 12 cm, while the dependency of resistance of mass transfer on film mass transfer was lower than porous diffusion, for the <b>bed</b> <b>depths</b> of 15 cm. The effect of varying <b>bed</b> <b>depths</b> of column on resistance of mass transfer for the adsorption of NH 4 + on GAC was verified to contribute to optimizing the adsorption process for the removal of NH 4 + from wastewater of containing multi-pollutants...|$|R

The adsorbent capacity was determined using the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherm models. The Cs+ adsorption isotherm data fit best to the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum Cs+ uptake of polyaniline titanotungstate was found 217 mg/g.

50|$|Since {{screening}} {{efficiency is}} {{directly proportional to}} the length of the trommel, a shorter trommel screen would be needed at a smaller inclination angle to achieve a desired screening efficiency. It is suggested that the inclination angle should not be below 2° because the efficiency and production rate is unknown beyond this point. A phenomenon exist below 2° such that for a given set of operating conditions, decreasing the inclination angle will increase the <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> resulting in a lower screening efficiency. However it will also simultaneously increase the residence time, which results in an increase in the screening efficiency.

40|$|Physical and {{biological}} parameters of corn stalks, silage, and oat straw were determined and the variation of airflow characteristics {{and biological}} activity were evaluated under varying moisture contents. The predicted air-filled porosity showed high correlation with measured airfilled porosity over the all materials. A reliable model of air-filled porosity {{made it possible}} to predict the effect of varying moisture content and compost bed height on air-filled porosity and permeability. The air-filled porosity decreased with increasing moisture content and compost depth for all materials. Corn stalks and oat straw air-filled porosity was in the range of 69 - 97 % over the all moisture levels and bed heights tested. Silage showed a wider range of air filled porosity than the other two materials, varying from 43 to 89 %. The effective particle size of all three materials increased with increasing moisture content from 20 % to 80 %of WHC. Permeability increased with increasing air filled porosity and decreasing bulk density, but the relationship between permeability and moisture content is complex. Permeability decreased for all materials with increasing moisture content from 20 % WHC to 50 % WHC, regardless of the depth of the compost bed. Since the particle size increased dramatically near saturation, the influence of aggregated particle size on the permeability is not significant at these relatively low moisture levels. But the permeability increased with increasing moisture level from 50 % to 80 % WHC at moderate to shallow simulated <b>bed</b> <b>depths</b> (Corn stalks: 2. 1 m, Oat straw: 1. 5 m, Silage: 0. 8 m). This results from the relatively large particle size aggregations under high moisture conditions, which compensate for the effect of reduced air filled porosity by compaction and moisture content at moderate to shallow <b>bed</b> <b>depths.</b> In this study the maximum wet bulk density and mechanical strength decreased with increasing the moisture content. The optimum moisture contents for respiration rate of corn stalks, oat straw, and silage are 81 %, 64 %, and 78 % respectively.

Variation in the void fraction caused variation in the pressure drop per unit of <b>bed</b> <b>depth.</b> Since bulk density and void fraction are functionally related to each other, the void fraction was expressed as a mathematical function of <b>bed</b> <b>depth,</b> and the model was verified using fundamentals of mathematics. In order to develop the model, Ergun's equation was used and integrated over the <b>bed</b> <b>depth,</b> substituting a void fraction that varied with the <b>bed</b> <b>depth.</b> Model results were compared to Shedd's data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{program of}} {{research}} has been established at Oregon State University to study wood residue combustion using an experimental spreader-stoker combustor. This research was conducted to increase the understanding of combustion occurring in wood fired boilers. Using Douglas Fir screened to 3 / 8 - 3 / 4 inches, two 4 x 4 factorial experiments were conducted varying depth of fuel bed and fuel feed rate. The objective of the experiments was to test the hypotheses that increased fuel <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> has the statistically significant effects of decreasing particulate emissions and increasing the relative amount of solid carbon oxidized by the underfire air (the Relative Carbon Saturation). The amount of carbon is relative to the maximum amount that could be oxidized by the air. The results of the experiments were that the following effects {{were found to be}} statistically significant. 1. Increasing fuel <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> from two to four inches decreases particulate emissions. 2. The effect of <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> on particulate emissions is more pronounced at higher combustion rates. 3. Increasing fuel <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> from two to four inches increases the Relative Carbon Saturation of the gases produced in the fuel bed. 4. At either fuel <b>bed</b> <b>depth,</b> the Relative Carbon Saturation is decreased by higher combustion rates. The most important results of the research are that a fuel bed several inches thick in a wood fired spreader-stoker can be used to effectively meter the underfire air to reduce particulate emissions and increase the heating value of the gases produced in the fuel bed which become fuel for the overfire combustion.

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to predict the effects of wall friction upon the elastic modulus of powder beds. The model combined a Janssen stress distribution with non-linear contact mechanics. Overall bed properties were predicted by integrating strain over the <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> and relating this to applied stress to find the apparent spring constant of the bed. This model was compared to the experimental data of Yanagida et al., for particulate materials subject to low-magnitude vibration. These data cover a range of particulate materials in test cells ranging from 0. 0345 to 0. 15 m in diameter. The model gave excellent qualitative correspondence with the experimental data, showing the following points: • for shallow beds, first peak frequencies are independent of cell diameter and only dependent upon cell depth, • for intermediate bed depths, first peak frequency is dependent upon both <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> and cell diameter, • there are indications that, for deeper beds, first peak frequency may be independent of <b>bed</b> <b>depth</b> and only dependent upon cell diameter.
