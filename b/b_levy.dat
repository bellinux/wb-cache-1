500|$|Throughout September, Agnew {{was in the}} news, {{generally}} as {{a result}} of what one reporter called his [...] "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality". He used the derogatory term [...] "Polack" [...] to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as [...] "the fat Jap", and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating [...] "if you've seen one slum you've seen them all." [...] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message [...] "Spiro Agnew for Vice President" [...] against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter, before a final message: [...] "This would be funny if it weren't so serious." [...] Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew's rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize [...] "white backlash" [...] into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter <b>B.</b> <b>Levy</b> as [...] "orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order".|$|E

50|$|Early {{experiments}} on associative plasticity {{were carried out}} by W. <b>B.</b> <b>Levy</b> and O. Steward in 1983 and examined the effect of relative timing of pre and postsynaptic action potentials at millisecond level on plasticity. Bruce McNaughton contributed much to this area, too.In studies on neuromuscular synapses carried out by Y. Dan and M. M. Poo in 1992, and on the hippocampus by D. Debanne, B. Gähwiler, and S. Thompson in 1994, showed that asynchronous pairing of postsynaptic and synaptic activity induced long-term synaptic depression. However, STDP was more definitively demonstrated by Henry Markram in his postdoc period till 1993 in Bert Sakmann's lab (SFN and Phys Soc abstracts in 1994-1995) which was only published in 1997. C. Bell and co-workers also found a form of STDP in the cerebellum. Henry Markram used dual patch clamping techniques to repetitively activate pre-synaptic neurons 10 milliseconds before activating the post-synaptic target neurons, and found {{the strength of the}} synapse increased. When the activation order was reversed so that the pre-synaptic neuron was activated 10 milliseconds after its post-synaptic target neuron, the strength of the pre-to-post synaptic connection decreased. Further work, by Guoqiang Bi, Li Zhang, and Huizhong Tao in Mu-Ming Poo's lab in 1998, continued the mapping of the entire time course relating pre- and post-synaptic activity and synaptic change, to show that in their preparation synapses that are activated within 5-20 ms before a postsynaptic spike are strengthened, and those that are activated within a similar time window after the spike are weakened. This phenomenon has been observed in various other preparations, with some variation in the time-window relevant for plasticity. Several reasons for timing-dependent plasticity have been suggested. For example, STDP might provide a substrate for Hebbian learning during development, or, as suggested by Taylor in 1973, the associated Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules might create informationally efficient coding in bundles of related neurons. Works from Y. Dan's lab advanced to study STDP in in vivo systems.|$|E
