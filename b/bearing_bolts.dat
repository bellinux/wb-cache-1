Rooms were overcrowded with few working bathrooms and no ventilation, resulting in conditions ranging from sweltering heat to freezing cold. In regards to work conditions, the Asch Building {{at the time}} did not comply with several requirements that were needed {{to ensure the safety}} of the building. The rooms in the upper three floors were packed with flammable objects, including clothing products hanging from lines above workers' heads, rows of tightly spaced sewing machines, cutting tables <b>bearing</b> <b>bolts</b> of cloth, and linen and cotton cuttings littering the floors, that resulted in a massive spread of fire occurring in the matter of seconds. The water hose was not installed properly to the water tower, due to the lack of understanding on behalf of the owners. The owners installed a fire escape that was not durable enough to hold many people, and there were no sprinklers installed in the building. The rooms on each floor were overcrowded because there was no limit at the time as to how many people could occupy one floor. The staircases did not have landings and the stairwells were poorly illuminated, resulting in unsafe, often dark conditions in the stairwells.|$|E

This {{new type of}} staircase needs a basic verification by valuable standards for using in a different indoor using. Stair with load <b>bearing</b> <b>bolts</b> is combined wooden and metal materials and their mechanical properties in construction. The goal {{of this paper is}} to review wooden tread behaviour as consequence of static load defining by Eurocode 5, implemented in Czech standards. Static load is exactly defined in different load values and the loading places. The three different loading place dimensions are defined by Eurocode 5 too. The wooden tread mechanical behaviour is modelled by FEM software ANSYS 11. 0. The numerical simulation offers the distribution of specific magnitudes in the numerical model. The analysis is broken into three parts: geometric model, material model and finite element model. The geometric mo­del is created via script by Ansys Parametric Design Language. This method allows using parametric creation. Material model is defined like linear elastic material model for nine independent values. The defined evaluative criteria begin to ultimative limit state and serviability limit state. The Euro­code 5 for this case defined the minimum load value and the maximum deflection value in vertical direction. The last selected is Hoffman’s failure criterion used to identify the possible crash places. Hoffman’s failure criterion is appropriate for orthotropic material like wood. The loading places must simulate the real constructional tread using...|$|E

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are test results for the {{determination}} of the pin-bearing strength of pultruded fibre reinforced polymer material required to calculate the <b>bearing</b> resistance of <b>bolted</b> connections under factored loading. It is well-known [1] that single-bolted and multi-bolted connections of pultruded material fail ultimately in a number of distinct failure modes (e. g. bearing, shear-out, cleavage, net-tension and block shear). Bearing {{is the only one of}} the mechanisms that does not give a brittle failure response, and can provide the connection with a degree of damage tolerance, which is desirable. The design calculation for bearing resistance is given by the projected area of <b>bearing</b> <b>bolt</b> times the specified bearing strength (Fbr) in the direction of the connection force, which is then multiplied by the number of bolts. In [2] a historical review on the determination of Fbr, is reported, and evaluated to show that there is a lack of consistency in how this strength has been measured, and much uncertainty on what values are to be taken in the resistance calculations. A comparison in [2] of pin-bearing strength measurements, based on the two test methodologies given in ASTM D 5764 [3] and BS EN ISO 13706 [4], showed that the ‘timber’ approach is suitable when there is a restriction on the size of coupon specimen that can be cut from a pultruded section. Presented are new test results for pin-bearing strengths when is equal to 0, 45 or 90 degrees, using the ‘timber’ approach.

40|$|Composite parts can be {{manufactured}} to near-net shape with minimum wastage of material; however, {{there is almost}} always a need for further machining. The most common post-manufacture machining operations for composite materials are to create holes for assembly. This thesis presents and discusses a thermally-assisted piercing process {{that can be used}} as a technique for introducing holes into thermoplastic composites. The thermally-assisted piercing process heats up, and locally melts, thermoplastic composites to allow material to be displaced around a hole, rather than cutting them out from the structure. This investigation was concerned with how the variation of piercing process parameters (such as the size of the heated area, the temperature of the laminate prior to piercing and the geometry of the piercing spike) changed the material microstructure within carbon fibre/Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) laminates. The variation of process parameters was found to significantly affect the formation of resin rich regions, voids and the fibre volume fraction in the material surrounding the hole. Mechanical testing (using open-hole tension, open-hole compression, plain-pin <b>bearing</b> and <b>bolted</b> <b>bearing</b> tests) showed that the microstructural features created during piercing were having significant influence over the resulting mechanical performance of specimens.

Closely encircling the changing law of anchorage force during the <b>bolt</b> <b>bearing</b> course, the reason of the low initial anchorage force in soft coal roadway, the effect of surrounding rock deformation on bolt anchorage force and the circulating hysteresis descending of anchorage force as well as the impact of the structure stability on bearing structure of the bolt-mesh support were analyzed. The analyzed results show there exists a great amount of bolt pre-stress hysteresis descending in soft coal roadway because of remarkable difference between bolt and soft coal deformable capability. Thus, many comprehensive measures should be taken to effectively control the initial loose deformation of non-anchorage rocks between two bolts, to achieve higher initial anchorage force and to prevent anchorage force losing during <b>bolt</b> <b>bearing</b> course. At the same time along with increasing the bolting strength, the structure compensating measures should be taken to ensure the structure stability of the bolt-mesh support and to realize the high-strength stable bolting...|$|R
