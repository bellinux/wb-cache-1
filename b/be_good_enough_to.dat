25|$|Durham won the toss against Leicestershire {{and elected}} to bat first at Grace Road, Leicester. The first day was {{dominated}} by Durham's Australian left-handed opener, Mike Hussey. Hussey may not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make the Australian Test squad, but he was good to make an undefeated 165 off 290 balls on a flat pitch on the first day. Former England Under-19 batsman Gordon Muchall helped Hussey add 166 for the third-wicket partnership, before being run out for 82. Durham finished day one on 325 for 3.|$|E

25|$|Although Elway's {{performance}} in the AFC Championship Game was widely considered his best ever, many sports writers and fans believed that the Broncos' best effort would not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> beat the 49ers. After all, Denver had barely defeated the Steelers, who only had a 9–7 regular season record, while the 9–6–1 Cleveland Browns had almost overcome a 17-point second half deficit before Denver put them away in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the Elway-led Broncos had already lost two Super Bowls. On the other hand, the Montana-led 49ers, with their powerful offense, had already won three Super Bowls.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} 1985 Indian tour. Mendis {{led from the}} front, scoring three fifties and one series-saving century in the third Test, as India were {{defeated}} 1–0 in three Tests. After that tour, which also included a drawn ODI series, Mendis' career declined, {{and by the end}} of his career it was probably only his captaincy that kept him in. He made two Test fifties in his last ten Tests, and two ODI fifties in his last 32 ODIs following the India tour. Ranjan Madugalle replaced him as captain for the very last Test that Mendis played, where he bowed out with a rearguard 56 that was, however, not to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> save a draw. He remained within the Sri Lankan cricketing sphere, however, as he was manager of the successful 1996 Cricket World Cup side.|$|E
25|$|The DSSC has {{a number}} of {{attractive}} features; it is simple to make using conventional roll-printing techniques, is semi-flexible and semi-transparent which offers a variety of uses not applicable to glass-based systems, and most of the materials used are low-cost. In practice it has proven difficult to eliminate a number of expensive materials, notably platinum and ruthenium, and the liquid electrolyte presents a serious challenge to making a cell suitable for use in all weather.

The Canadiens stocked their team with francophone stars including Newsy Lalonde, Georges Poulin and Didier Pitre. Before being allowed to play, Pitre had to resolve a lawsuit with the Montreal Nationals, to whom he was already under contract.|$|E
500|$|When the two {{began working}} on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on {{which he had been}} working and which became [...] "Crash", the album's final single. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be part of that history." [...] Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, {{including}} Outkast's André 3000, the Neptunes, and Dr. Dre. Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004, marketing it as a [...] "dance record" [...] and a [...] "guilty pleasure".|$|E

She praised the [...] "intelligent performances" [...] of the actors, and though she found the [...] "Smash" [...] Williams character less convincing than the others, she thought it improved towards the end. She also appreciated the use of audio to tell the story: the buzz of a surgeon's saw or the sound of skin stuck to leather. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club, wrote [...] "I appreciate the feel for the high stakes attached to small-market school sports, the knowing take on the high-school caste system, and the details of family life."

500|$|In early 2003, Stefani began {{embarking on}} {{recording}} sessions for her debut album. After listening to songs recommended {{to her by}} No Doubt bassist and former boyfriend Tony Kanal, she considered recording material that [...] "modernized 1980s music". After writing a series of several songs, including [...] "Serious", [...] "Crash", and [...] "Luxurious", the pair gave up after Stefani didn't find anything worth recording from the sessions. When asked about the aforementioned collaborations, Stefani expressed her doubts {{of whether or not}} her newly recorded material would be any good: [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be part of that history." [...] Due to Stefani's doubts, the project began a six-month hiatus, which resulted in the singer deciding to collaborate with various new musicians instead. Stefani's change of heart also ensured her work with Kanal would end up on Love. Angel. Music. Baby..|$|E
500|$|The {{overall effect}} of Starr's {{drumming}} for the Beatles has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: [...] "I'm no {{good on the}} technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that." [...] Beatles producer George Martin stated: [...] "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, [...] "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier." [...] Starr commented: [...] "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: [...] "I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fill it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Afghan company {{contracted}} to bring heavy construction equipment delayed its arrival to until 13 July. It {{was decided that}} soldier labor {{with the aid of}} an engineer squad and a Bobcat front end loader already at Bella would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prepare an initial defense in the six days until heavier equipment arrived. The number of men at the base was judged enough to defend against intelligence estimates that placed the insurgent forces in the local area at only about 150 experienced fighters, though they did not know that attackers would be backed up by other guerrilla groups from neighboring regions as far away as Pakistan and Kashmir. While they thought it was possible the base might be attacked while the camp was being prepared, they thought it unlikely. Platoon Sergeant Dzwik later remarked [...] "I was expecting harassing fire from any one of the high ground in every direction. I did not think the village itself would let the AAF [...] turn their village into a battle zone.|$|E

500|$|Exceptions {{are made}} for {{children}} and a person [...] "in the exercise of his calling" [...] (a professional person or somebody exercising a trade or skill). With children, occupiers must [...] "be prepared for children to be less careful than adults"; a warning notice, for example, would normally <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> alert adults to a potential danger, but not to alert children. This is another extension of a common law principle; in Glasgow Corporation v Taylor [...] 1 AC 44, a seven-year-old child died after eating poisonous berries from a bush in a park. The berries, which looked like cherries or blackcurrants, were found by the House of Lords to constitute an [...] "allurement" [...] to the child, who found Glasgow Corporation, which owned the park, liable. However, the situation is different if the child has a guardian with him, who {{one would expect to}} appreciate any obvious dangers, as in Phipps v Rochester Corporation [...] 1 QB 450. This was essentially the same as the existing common law; indeed, [...] "It is doubtful whether the Act alters the law at all on this point".|$|E
500|$|His 1994 film I'll Do Anything, {{starring}} Nick Nolte, {{was conceived}} and filmed by Brooks as an old-fashioned movie musical and parody of [...] "Hollywood lifestyles and movie clichés", costing $40 million. It featured songs by Carole King, Prince, and Sinéad O'Connor, among others, with choreography by Twyla Tharp. When preview audience {{reactions to the}} music were overwhelmingly negative, all production numbers from the film were cut and Brooks wrote several new scenes, filming them over three days and spending seven weeks editing the film down to two hours. Brooks noted: [...] "Something like this not only tries one's soul – it threatens one's soul." [...] While {{it was not unusual}} for Brooks to edit his films substantially after preview screenings on this occasion he was [...] "denied any privacy" [...] because the media reported the negative reviews before its release and [...] "it had to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> counter all this bad publicity." [...] It was a commercial failure, and Brooks attempted to produce a documentary about it four years later but was scuppered by failing to obtain the rights to Prince's song.|$|E

England had tried all manner of combinations at No.3, from the left-field Jason Gallian to the veteran Robin Smith, via the temperamentally suspect pairing of Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash. [...] "A lot is made of your batting position," [...] Hussain recalled to Cricinfo, [...] "but I always felt, and I did back then when David Lloyd rang me up and asked me to bat No.3, that if you're good enough to be playing Test cricket, you should <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> move from No.5 to No.3".|$|E
2500|$|There is no precise {{qualification}} for {{a player}} to be considered an all-rounder {{and use of the}} term tends to be subjective.
