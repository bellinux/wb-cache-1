5|$|Ubiquitousness and {{stability}} of atoms relies on their binding energy, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the temperature {{is much higher than}} ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000years after the Big Bang—an epoch called recombination, when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Prem and Poonam {{go through}} the most magical and romantic period of their lives. Coming from {{different}} sensibilities, both want their relationship to be very right for each other. Both {{realize the importance of}} the engagement rings that they have given to each other and the special right that they have got on each other in return. They begin to fall in love and <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> each other, thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings. After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy presentation in Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E

25|$|Jainism is a {{religion}} originating in ancient India, its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else.

The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.|$|E

25|$|On April 13, 1969, local {{merchants and}} {{residents}} held {{a meeting to}} discuss possible uses for the derelict site.

The two presented a plan for developing the under-utilized, university-owned land into a public park. This plan was approved by the attendees, but not by the university. Stew Albert, a co-founder of the Yippie Party, agreed to write an article for the local counter-culture newspaper, the Berkeley Barb, {{on the subject of the}} park, particularly to call for help from local residents.|$|E
25|$|In infants, {{behavior}} {{associated with}} attachment {{is primarily a}} process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, {{for the purpose of}} survival. Infants <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.|$|E

She shows them a {{treasure}} room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds, and ivory.

Unfortunately for Gagool, a brief scuffle with a beautiful native named Foulata—who had <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store {{of food and water}} rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.|$|E

25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 all the old {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a ball mill {{to the size of}} fine sand before being passed into a bank of froth flotation cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the ball mill was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New concentrating tables were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the ball mill and froth flotation plant.|$|E
25|$|By 1666 Behn had <b>become</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the court, {{possibly}} {{through the}} influence of Thomas Culpeper and other associates. The Second Anglo-Dutch War had broken out between England and the Netherlands in 1665, and she was recruited as a political spy in Antwerp on behalf of King Charles II, possibly {{under the auspices of}} courtier Thomas Killigrew. This is the first well-documented account we have of her activities. Her code name {{is said to have been}} Astrea, a name under which she later published many of her writings. Her chief role was to establish an intimacy with William Scot, son of Thomas Scot, a regicide who had been executed in 1660. Scot was believed to be ready to become a spy in the English service and to report on the doings of the English exiles who were plotting against the King. Behn arrived in Bruges in July 1666, probably with two others, as London was wracked with plague and fire. Behn's job was to turn Scot into a double agent, but there is evidence that Scot betrayed her to the Dutch.|$|E
