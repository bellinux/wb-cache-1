5|$|The result meant Montoya {{moved up}} into fifth {{place in the}} Drivers' Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who {{clinched}} the title two races beforehand. Barrichello's third position finish allowed him {{to close the gap}} to David Coulthard. Williams' strong finish meant the gap <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> McLaren was reduced to eight points with two races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the rail crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E

5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Mansell, {{with three}} ships (the 30 gun Hope {{along with the}} 42 gun Victory and the Answer) {{departed}} and patrolled about Dungeness. Mansell's flag captain {{came up with the}} strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so that a good communication system was erected <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|E

G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900m) gap <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead.

5|$|On 3 April 1996, Liverpool faced Newcastle United in a Premier League fixture at Anfield, {{during the}} 1995–96 season. Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle's three. The winning goal was scored by striker Stan Collymore {{in the second}} minute of {{stoppage}} time. Before the match, both clubs had lost their previous fixtures but still had a chance of winning the league and wanted {{to close the gap}} <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> leaders Manchester United. Newcastle United, who were 12 points ahead in January, had suffered from poor performance throughout March, winning one match out of four that month. Liverpool had won six of their last nine league games during February and March, scored the most goals and conceded the fewest until this match.|$|E
5|$|Yorktowns second strike—utilizing {{the same}} aircraft—returned to Tulagi and began their attack at 12:10 on the Japanese ships, {{many of which}} were now at full steam and {{attempting}} to put distance <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> Tulagi harbor. The second strike hit and sank the minesweepers #1 and #2 and severely damaged Tama Maru northeast of Savo Island. Another Japanese seaplane was shot down by a U.S. dive bomber during the second strike. After four F4F-3/3A Wildcat fighters from Yorktown joined the strike, the fighters shot down two more Japanese floatplanes over Florida Island. The four U.S. fighters then strafed Yūzuki, killing her captain and nine others of her crew, and causing moderate damage to the ship. Two or three other Japanese floatplanes were damaged in Tulagi harbor and their crews were killed.|$|E
5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell {{to the back of the}} field.|$|E

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} on 27 May had changed considerably from just 24 hours earlier. The Belgian Army {{had been forced}} from the Leie line on 26 May, and Nevele, Vynckt, Tielt and Iseghem had fallen on the western and {{central part of the}} Leie front. In the east, the Germans had reached the outskirts of Bruges, and captured Ursel. In the west, the Menen–Ypres line had broken at Kortrijk and the Belgians were now using railway trucks to help form anti-tank defences on a line from Ypres–Passchendaele–Roulers. Further to the west the BEF had been forced back, north of Lille just over the French border and was now in danger of allowing a gap to develop <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the Belgian southern flank on the Ypres–Lille axis. The danger in allowing a German advance to Dunkirk would mean the loss of the port which was now too great. The British withdrew to the port on 26 May. In doing so, they left the French 1st Army's north-eastern flank near Lille exposed. As the British moved out, the Germans moved in, encircling the bulk of the French Army. Both Gort and his Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, accepted that their withdrawal would mean the destruction of the French 1st Army, and they would be blamed for it.|$|E

50|$|The {{specific}} {{origin of}} this term remains uncertain. The term has gained widespread use {{throughout much of}} western Polynesia including Tokelau, Tuvalu, 'Uvea and Futuna, etc., with the expansion of {{use of the term}} being though to have occurred in the 18th century when Tongans, and to lesser extent Samoans, regularly interacted with white sailors, beachcombers, convicts, missionaries, and whalers who clearly delineated ethnoracial boundaries <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> (papalagi/papalangi) <b>and</b> the Polynesians they encountered.|$|R
25|$|The Beaumont Cup, a {{first-class}} knock-out competition competed for by North Trinidad, South Trinidad, Central Trinidad and East Trinidad, was retained by North Trinidad {{when the final}} <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> East Trinidad was drawn.

25|$|Krems, Neel, Neuberg, Puts and Kenrick (2016) {{also found}} that women created larger social {{distance}} <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> a competing female, but only if she was ovulating and attractive. Similarly, this only occurred if the woman was partnered with a desirable mate.

50|$|However, the {{nationalist}} effort was seriously {{hampered by the}} fact that all troops deployed were warlord troops, and all of them were wary of each other, as well as Chiang himself.

As a result, there was not much coordination <b>and</b> cooperation <b>between</b> nationalists <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> this weakness was exploited by the Communists to the maximum.|$|R

25|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{travelers}} have observed the custom of hanging objects upon trees in order to establish some sort of a relationship <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the tree. Throughout Europe, trees are known as sites of pilgrimages, ritual ambulation, and the recital of (Christian) prayers. Wreaths, ribbons or rags are suspended to win favor for sick humans or livestock, or merely for good luck. Popular belief associates the sites with healing, bewitching, or mere wishing.|$|E
25|$|A second {{structural}} change that undermined monetary management was {{the decline of}} U.S. hegemony. The U.S. {{was no longer the}} dominant economic power it had been for more than two decades. By the mid-1960s, the E.E.C. and Japan had become international economic powers in their own right. With total reserves exceeding those of the U.S., higher levels of growth and trade, and per capita income approaching that of the U.S., Europe and Japan were narrowing the gap <b>between</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the United States.|$|E
