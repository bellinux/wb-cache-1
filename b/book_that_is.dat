5|$|Artemis Fowl II is the twelve-year-old prodigy, who has {{dedicated}} {{his life to}} criminal activities. He leads the Fowl criminal empire, which has been established by his family for generations. After significant research, Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies. He tracks down an alcoholic sprite posing as a healer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her The Book of the People—the Fairy holy <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> written in Gnommish.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} {{approach was}} widely {{practiced in the}} 1930s, primarily to provide descriptions of the changes underway in the previous half-century. In 1935, American historian William L. Langer published The Diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890–1902, a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> still widely cited. In 1939, Oxford professor Reginald Copeland published The Exploitation of East Africa, 1856–1890: The Slave Trade and the Scramble, another popular treatment.|$|E

25|$|One of Asturias' {{most famous}} novels, El Señor Presidente, {{describes}} life under a ruthless dictator. Asturias' very public opposition to dictatorial rule led to him spending {{much of his}} later life in exile, both in South America and in Europe. The <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sometimes described as his masterpiece, Hombres de maíz (Men of Maize), is a defense of Mayan culture and customs. Asturias combined his extensive knowledge of Mayan beliefs with his political convictions, channeling them into a life of commitment and solidarity.

25|$|She Was a Lady {{was adapted}} for {{the screen in}} 1939 {{as the basis for}} the second Hollywood motion picture based upon the {{character}} of Simon Templar. The film, The Saint Strikes Back, was released by RKO Pictures and was the first film to star George Sanders as Templar. The film makes numerous changes to the original story, changing Jill Trelawney's name to Val Travers and eliminating the angle of the Saint and Trelawney/Travers partnering up.

25|$|In the 1st century AD, many of {{the first}} books about {{acupuncture}} were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing, {{which was published in}} the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> still in existence in the modern era. Other books like the Yu Kuei Chen Ching, written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved. In the mid 7th century, Sun Simiao published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.|$|E
25|$|After his retirement, Eamon Carr went on {{to become}} a {{producer}} of young rock talent in the mid-1980s, and also forming his own record label called Hotwire (which sponsored noted acts such as the punk rock group The Golden Horde). He also did a number of specialist DJ slots on radio before morphing into a music/sports journalist with the Evening Herald in Dublin. More recently he presented on a Dublin station 'Carr's Cocktail Shack' in which he played American music of the 1950s and 1960s. In 2008, Carr and Henry McCullough co-wrote a new bunch of songs. A resulting album entitled Poor Man's Moon was released on 1 September 2008. Also in 2008, Carr released his first book, The Origami Crow, Journey Into Japan, World Cup Summer 2002, a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> at once a travel log about his journey to Japan, a poetry collection, an homage to Japanese poet Basho, heralded by many as the creator of Haiku, and also has some sports commentary thrown in.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Time {{acknowledged the}} critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while [...] "not all readers will agree that Dr. No... is magnificent writing,... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> readable'." [...] In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning of Fleming's work, saying [...] "it's {{harder than ever}} to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales". Benson described Boucher's critique as [...] "true to form" [...] and [...] "a tirade" [...] as Boucher concluded his review by saying: [...] "it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} particularly {{criticized the}} scene where Noah gives Claire a printed <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{supposed to be a}} first edition copy of the [...] Iliad, a work written nearly 3,000 years ago in Greece. Amy Heidt, writing for Slate, noted that while a first English edition could have been a possible explanation, such works were from the 16th and 17th centuries, and describes the book Noah gives Claire as [...] "A pristine hardcover that looks like those Jane Austen Penguin Classics they sell at Urban Outfitters." [...] Following the film's release, the term [...] "The Iliad, first edition" [...] became the top search term on the online book marketplace AbeBooks. Richard Davis, a spokesman for the website, said: [...] "It appears people who have watched the film are trying to identify the actual edition handed to Lopez, which has dark yellow and blue boards. I cannot match the book seen in the movie to anything currently for sale on AbeBooks." ...|$|E
500|$|Burwell and Fleming say the book's subtext {{is about}} aging, as {{symbolized by the}} writer's {{attraction}} to the younger fertile woman, and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize [...] "the aging writer's anxiety {{about his ability to}} write". [...] The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer, and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript. Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on [...] "the writer not writing", [...] which for Hemingway would have been a fate worse than aging. Thus, she says, True at First Light invokes a paradox with [...] "an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult in the moment of writing about the not-writing author". Writing, for Hemingway, had always been difficult. He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing [...] "one true sentence" [...] and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write. Tom Jenks, editor of an earlier posthumously published book The Garden of Eden, says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in True at First Light: presenting himself as a [...] "self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing" [...] persona in a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no more than a mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as The Sun Also Rises. However, he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} {{cited as a}} factor in the success of the civil rights {{movement}} in the 1960s, however, in that it [...] "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it [...] "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" [...] and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as [...] "an act of humanity" [...] in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel [...] "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Independent, James Urquhart found the novel to be [...] "richly textured" [...] {{and that it}} had [...] "energetic, acutely {{observed}} characters"; stating [...] "Miller populates Baratte's quest for equanimity with these lush and tart characters, seductively fleshed out, who collectively help to deliver the [...] resolution of Baratte's professional and personal travails." [...] Clare Clark, writing for The Guardian, found that [...] "Miller is a writer of subtlety and skill" [...] and stated that she found the novel to be much like a parable, stating that [...] "Unlike many parables, however, Pure is neither laboured nor leaden. Miller writes like a poet, with a deceptive simplicity – his sentences and images are intense distillations, conjuring the fleeting details of existence with clarity." [...] Clark {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Pure defies the ordinary conventions of storytelling, slipping dream-like between lucidity and a kind of abstracted elusiveness. The characters are often opaque. The narrative lacks dramatic structure, unfolding in the present tense much as life does, without clear shape or climax" [...] and found that [...] "The result is a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unsettling and, ultimately, optimistic." [...] The Australian's Jennifer Levasseur found Pure to be [...] "Well-executed and inventive", stating that she found the plot [...] "Historically convincing, immediately engaging and intellectually stimulating". She went on to state, of Miller himself: [...] "Miller is the calibre of writer who deserves to be followed regardless of topic, time period or setting because of his astonishing dexterity with language, his piercing observations and his ability to combine rollicking storytelling with depth of character." ...|$|E
