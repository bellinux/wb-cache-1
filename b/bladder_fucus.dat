50|$|Fucus vesiculosus, {{known by}} the common name bladder wrack or bladderwrack, is a seaweed found on the coasts of the North Sea, the western Baltic Sea, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, also {{known by the}} common names black tang, rockweed, <b>bladder</b> <b>fucus,</b> sea oak, black tany, cut weed, dyers fucus, red fucus, and rock wrack. It was the {{original}} source of iodine, discovered in 1811, and was used extensively to treat goitre, a swelling of the thyroid gland related to iodine deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|It lives {{primarily}} on toothed wrack (<b>Fucus</b> serratus) and <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus), {{but is also}} found on the basal part of thongweed (Himanthalia elongata). Numerous individuals {{can be found on}} any one surface.|$|R
5000|$|L. oceanica {{is found}} in {{temperate}} waters from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea, and from Cape Cod north to Maine. It is a common species, occurring wherever the substrate of the littoral zone is rocky, and is especially common in crevices and rock pools and under stones. It is a nocturnal omnivore, eating many kinds of seaweed,diatoms [...] and debris, with a particular fondness for <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus).|$|R
50|$|The rocky and boulder shores {{toward the}} south of the lough are {{dominated}} by the seaweed knotted wrack Ascophyllum nodosum. The usual zonation of weeds on these shore is, at the top channel wrack (Pelvetia canaliculata (L.) Dcne. et Rhur.), followed by spiral wrack (Fucus spiralis L.), then knotted wrack (Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol) with some admixture of <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus) L. and then serrated wrack (Fucus serratus L.) before coming to the low water kelps.|$|R
50|$|The thallus {{grows to}} 35 cm long - smaller than other similar species, it is {{attached}} by a discoid holdfast. The thallus is flattened {{and has a}} midrib like the other common species of Fucus. However {{it does not have}} <b>bladders,</b> as <b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus, or serrated edges to the fronds as Fucus serratus nor a twisted thallus, as Fucus spiralis. Fucus ceranoides does not have bladders but may have elongated air pockets in the fronds. The receptacles on F. guiryi show a distinct rim around the edge.|$|R
40|$|Copper, zinc, and Irgarol 1051 {{concentrations}} were determined around a pleasure boat marina in the Stockholm Archipelago. Copper concentrations in water {{were twice as}} high (6. 62 mu g L(- 1)) in 2004 as 1992 - 1993, zinc concentrations six times higher (20. 0 mu g L(- 1)). Concentrations in <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus) had also risen. Irgarol concentrations in water were similar (similar to 0. 17 mu g L(- 1)) in 1996 and 2004, while concentrations in bladder wrack halved from 1993 to 2004. The peak concentrations of copper and Irgarol in water have shifted indicating that the main source in the 1990 s were local boats, but in 2004 visiting boats...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{variations}} in the elemental and stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur isotope composition of <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus) growing along the shore line of the semi-enclosed urbanized Kiel Fjord (western Baltic Sea) was investigated at more than 60 sites. The analyses of the carbon-nitrogen-sulphur (CNS) stoichiometry and C and N stable isotope signature of F. vesiculosus displayed substantial differences between the north-western and the south-eastern parts of the Kiel Fjord. Different size classes displayed in part differences in C:N and C:S ratios, and the carbon isotope composition, reflecting {{the impact of the}} boundary conditions during growth. Whereas the sulphur isotope composition was controlled by the assimilation of seawater sulphate, the carbon isotope composition reflected the difference in the composition of surface waters. The δ 15 N values of the organic tissue tend to be an integrated monitor of anthropogenic impacts on the fjord. Results are compared to the composition of surface waters...|$|R
40|$|Photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors are {{ubiquitous}} in costal {{areas around the}} world. Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence have been seen in plants exposed to low concentrations of PSII inhibitors in laboratory experiments. Saw wrack (<b>Fucus</b> serratus), <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus) and Fucus evanescence are important and widespread in Norwegian coastal ecosystems, as primary producers and as structure forming perennial species. Ability to sensitive and rapidly monitor adverse effects in these species could be useful in a monitoring program. Two chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic efficiency (how efficient quanta is used in PSII) and quinone pool (amount of electron acceptors in PSII) were measured by Hansatech Handy Photosynthetic Efficiency Analyser. Few differences in these parameters were seen in F. vesiculosus was grown under different irradiances, temperatures and salinities in three laboratory studies. Photosynthetic efficiency and quinone pool in F. serratus and F. vesiculosus were adversely affected by 100 µg L- 1 Irgarol, but not by the other biocides tested. In a field survey at 6 sites in the Oslofjord from April to December 2007, differences were seen between fluorescence parameters in samples from different sites. Photosynthetic efficiency and quinone pool were highly correlated with light intensity, temperature and salinity during the survey, but this could not explain the difference observed on all days. Analysis of Irgarol in Fucus tissue from different sites did not either clarify the observed differences. Measurement of photosynthetic efficiency and quinone pool in Fucus spp. is discussed in relation to ecological relevance and other biomarker methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{moderate}} environmental stress may be modulated by stress-induced shifts of biotic interactions such as host – epibiont relationships. We studied the stress regime in shallow Western Baltic habitats, {{the variability of}} fouling at different temporal and spatial scales, and whether common stressors - low light, high temperature, grazing – affect the abundance and composition of the biofilm on a regionally important macroalga, the <b>bladder</b> wrack <b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus. We further explore the alga’s capacity to chemically modulate the recruitment of microfoulers and whether this ability is impacted by stress. In laboratory, mesocosm and field experiments fouling pressure and epibiotic cover on the algae varied strongly with changing environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, depth or grazing. The expectation that abiotic stress affects the fouling-modulating ability of the alga and, thus, indirectly produces the observed variability of epibiosis was not generally confirmed. Indeed, while the strength of chemical antifouling resistance varied seasonally, with a maximum in winter/spring and a minimum in late summer, this could not be related to temporal patterns of environmental stress, fouling pressure, or growth of Fucus. Only the seasonal variation in reproduction {{seemed to be in}} phase with antifouling activity. Controlled experiments confirmed that resistance strength was not affected by temperature or grazing, and only moderately by light. We conclude that the fouling modulation ability of Fucus vesiculosus may suffer from light-reduction (e. g. by eutrophication effects) while they are not sensitive to the predicted warming or enhanced grazing...|$|R
30|$|In {{the frame}} of the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), samples of {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) and biota have been taken yearly and aliquot pool samples have been deep-frozen for retrospective monitoring since the 1980 s [22, 23]. The major advantage of the ESB is that material from different areas sampled over a period of up to 30  years is already available and can be used directly. BMFfield can, in principle, be determined for different matrix combinations: At fresh water stations, lipid-normalised chemical concentrations in the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, can be divided by organic carbon normalised chemical concentrations in SPM to obtain a biota/SPM accumulation factor for lower trophic levels. In the marine environment, organisms of different trophic levels are monitored by the ESB: the brown alga common <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) and egg content of the herring gull (Larus argentatus). For sites where a direct prey to predator relationship exists, BMFfield values can be calculated. Assuming that the difference between trophic levels in each prey to predator combination equals 1, fresh weight normalised biota concentration of PFOS resulted in a BMFfield of approximately 5 for herring gull/eelpout and 20 for eelpout/blue mussel (North Sea sampling site Jade bay/Mellum; based on data from [24]). Indeed, it has to be considered that in the different species either whole soft tissue or single tissues were investigated (e.g. whole soft tissue in mussels, liver in eelpout) which can vary in their bioaccumulation potential. Due to missing data, biota concentrations have also not been normalised to protein content, although PFOS is known to bind to proteins [25]. Furthermore, information on prey/predator trophic interaction and exact trophic positions of the studied species have to be confirmed (e.g. by stomach content analyses or carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratio shifts (δ 13 C, δ 15 N); [20]).|$|R
40|$|Seaweeds are {{established}} sentinels for metal contamination and are utilised for biomonitoring. Metallothionein (MT) is a protein that is induced by metal exposure, {{and has been}} widely used as a biomarker for metal pollution. MT has not been reported in spiral wrack (Fucus spiralis), but has been identified in <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus), {{where it has been}} suggested as a protective mechanism against metal exposure. This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of MT in F. spiralis as a biomarker for metal pollution for the first time. Samples were collected from Poole Harbour, UK, over a year-long period, from January to October 2015. MT and metal concentrations were quantified during winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons. Linear regression analysis showed few relationships between MT and metal concentrations, apart from in summer. During summer, significant positive relationships existed between MT concentrations and iron (R 2 = 0. 631), nickel (R 2 = 0. 486), tin (R 2 = 0. 579), and lead (R 2 = 0. 415). It is possible that for most of the year, metal concentrations in Poole Harbour are not high enough to elicit a MT response in F. spiralis, as it is a metal tolerant species. However, during summer, rates of photosynthesis and growth increase, which may increase metal toxicity, due to the inhibition of photosynthesis and growth. Thus, MT may be induced in order to prevent disruption. This study suggests that the use of MT as a biomarker for metal pollution in F. spiralis may not be a sensitive biomarker at low levels of metal pollution. However, MT concentrations in F. spiralis may respond to metal exposure when natural processes are vulnerable to pollution. The potential for MT {{to be used as a}} biomarker in Fucus spp. has been highlighted, warranting further research to develop a promising cosmopolitan bioindicator for metal pollution...|$|R
40|$|Phlorotannins are {{the least}} studied group of tannins and are found only in brown algae. Hitherto the roles of phlorotannins, e. g. in plant-herbivore interactions, have been studied by {{quantifying}} the total contents of the soluble phlorotannins {{with a variety of}} methods. Little attention has been given to either quantitative variation in cell-wall-bound and exuded phlorotannins or to qualitative variation in individual compounds. A quantification procedure was developed to measure the amount of cell-wall-bound phlorotannins. The quantification of soluble phlorotannins was adjusted for both large- and small-scale samples and used to estimate the amounts of exuded phlorotannins using <b>bladder</b> wrack (<b>Fucus</b> vesiculosus) as a model species. In addition, separation of individual soluble phlorotannins to produce a phlorotannin profile from the phenolic crude extract was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Along with these methodological studies, attention was focused on the factors in the procedure which generated variation in the yield of phlorotannins. The objective was to enhance the efficiency of the sample preparation procedure. To resolve the problem of rapid oxidation of phlorotannins in HPLC analyses, ascorbic acid was added to the extractant. The widely used colourimetric method was found to produce a variation in the yield that was dependent upon the pH and concentration of the sample. Using these developed, adjusted and modified methods, the phenotypic plasticity of phlorotannins was studied with respect to nutrient availability and herbivory. An increase in nutrients decreased the total amount of soluble phlorotannins but did not affect the cell-wall-bound phlorotannins, the exudation of phlorotannins or the phlorotannin profile achieved with HPLC. The presence of the snail Thedoxus fluviatilis on the thallus induced production of soluble phlorotannins, and grazing by the herbivorous isopod Idotea baltica increased the exudation of phlorotannins. To study whether the among-population variations in phlorotannin contents arise from the genetic divergence or from the plastic response of algae, or both, algae from separate populations were reared in a common garden. Genetic variation among local populations was found in both the phlorotannin profile and the content of total phlorotannins. Phlorotannins were also genetically variable within populations. This suggests that local algal populations have diverged in their contents of phlorotannins, and that they may respond to natural selection and evolve both quantitatively and qualitatively...|$|R
