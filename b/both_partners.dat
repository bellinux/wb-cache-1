5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for <b>both</b> <b>partners</b> is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence.

5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in <b>both</b> <b>partners</b> in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where <b>both</b> <b>partners</b> have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of <b>both</b> <b>partners.</b> To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if <b>both</b> <b>partners</b> could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
