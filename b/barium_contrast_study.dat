He had an incisional hernia at the right lumbar region. A <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>study</b> of the small intestine and magnetic resonance imaging showed that the hernial sac included gastric antrum and bowel.

MethodsThis is a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgery for gastric stenosis within 6 weeks to 26 months following corrosive ingestion. The data analyzed included the extent of cicatrisation, surgical procedure performed and outcome. Preoperative evaluation in these patients included a <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>study</b> and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. ResultsMain presenting symptoms were nonbilious vomiting, early satiety, dysphagia and significant weight loss. Antropyloric strictures were present in 28 (64 %) patients, total gastric involvement was seen in 16 (36 %) patients, associated esophageal stenosis was present in 18 (40. 91 %) patients. Surgical procedures performed included distal gastrectomy with Billroth 1 reconstruction in 31. 82 %, distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction in 20. 45 %, stricturoplasty in 11. 36 %, subtotal gastrectomy in 18. 18 % and total gastrectomy with pouch reconstruction in another 18. 18 % patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastric volvulus is an {{uncommon}} condition, {{which can be}} difficult to diagnose and treat. This study represents a large series of patients with the condition. METHODS: All patients presenting with gastric volvulus over a 14 -year period were reviewed. RESULTS: Some 36 patients (median age 75 years) were identified. Volvulus, usually secondary to a hiatus hernia, presented acutely in 29 patients. The major symptoms were abdominal pain, vomiting and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The most useful investigations were <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>studies</b> and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which were helpful in 21 of 25 and 11 of 18 patients respectively. Treatment was conservative in five patients, by open surgery in 13 and laparoscopic repair in 18 (three converted to open operation). There were no major complications and no deaths. Median hospital stay was shorter in patients treated by laparoscopic rather than open surgery (6 (range 4 - 36) versus 14 (7 - 50) days; P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Acute and chronic gastric volvulus can be treated successfully by either open or laparoscopic surgery. However, laparoscopic surgery now represents a safe and acceptable approach, with minimal morbidity and a significantly shorter hospital stay.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Barium {{peritonitis}} {{is extremely}} rare, but {{is difficult to}} treat and may be life-threatening. Barium suspension leakage from the gastrointestinal tract into the abdominal cavity has a time-dependent and synergistically deleterious effect in patients who have generalized bacterial peritonitis. The severity of barium peritonitis {{is dependent on the}} quantity of barium in the abdominal cavity. Barium sulfate leak-age results in hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia by worsening the exudation of extracellular fluid and albumin. Abdominal fluid analysis is a useful and efficient method to diagnose barium peritonitis. Serial radiographs may not be a reliable or timely diagnostic technique. Initial aggressive fluid resuscitation and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be instituted promptly, followed quickly by celi-otomy. During exploratory surgical intervention, copious irrigation and direct wiping with gauze are employed to remove as much barium as possible. Omentectomy should be considered when needed to expedite barium removal. Despite aggressive medical and surgical treatments, postoperative prognosis is guarded to poor due to complications, such as acute vascular shock, sepsis, diffuse peritonitis, hypoproteninemia, electrolyte imbalance, cardiac arrest, small bowel obstruction related to progression of granulomas and adhesions in the abdominal cavity. Therefore, intensive postoperative monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to maximize chances for a positive outcome. For those that do survive, small bowel obstruction is a potential consequence due to progression of abdominal adhesions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The lusorian artery {{is a rare}} anomaly of {{the right}} subclavian artery. This artery arises from the aortic arch distal of the left subclavian artery, {{crossing}} the midline behind the esophagus. Normally this anomaly causes no symptoms. Sometimes dysphagia first appears above the age of 40 yr. METHODS: In the period of 1992 - 1997, the diagnosis of an aberrant right subclavian artery was made in five patients with dysphagia who were referred to a small community hospital. A sixth patient had a right-sided aorta with an aberrant left subclavian artery. RESULTS: Endoscopy revealed a pulsating impression in the esophagus of three patients. Four patients had coexisting esophageal abnormalities. Barium contrast examination of the esophagus showed a characteristic diagonal impression {{at the level of}} the fourth thoracic vertebra in all patients. Computed tomography and angiography confirmed the diagnosis and excluded aneurysms. Manometric investigation of the esophagus revealed nonspecific abnormalities in five patients. Drug treatment was sufficient in three patients (mean follow-up, 6. 2 yr). Three patients were operated upon because of persistent dysphagia. Through a cervical approach the artery was ligated near its root and connected with the right carotid artery. Postoperatively two patients became symptom-free, the other patient still has intermittent dysphagia. CONCLUSION: Dysphagia can be caused by a rare anomaly of the subclavian artery. The diagnosis can be overlooked at endoscopy, but <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>study</b> of the esophagus will reveal the abnormality. In patients with coexisting esophageal abnormalities the finding may be incidental and specific conservative treatment may be sufficient.

40|$|SUMMARY Five {{cases of}} early gastric {{carcinoma}} (EGC) {{were seen in}} 12 months. The clinical features did not provide guide-lines to diagnosis, which depends on air <b>contrast</b> <b>barium</b> <b>studies,</b> endoscopic recognition of early malignancy, adequate biopsies, and their interpretation. Malignancy was pre-sent in an average of 60 % of the biopsies taken. The {{most common type of}} lesion was lIc. The superficial nature of the malignancy was predicted at endoscopy in four cases but was unsuspected in one case which was considered to be advanced carcinoma until the resected specimen was thoroughly examined microscopically. The excellent prognosis ofEGC was discussed. Only conserva-tive surgery need be performed if the superficial nature of the lesion is recognized before operation. Early gastric cancer (EGC) can be defined as carci-noma confined to mucosa or submucosa without infiltration into the muscularis propria (Murakami, 1971). This condition is well recognized in Japan where mass screening is used to detect carcinoma because of its high prevalence (Segi, 1969), but is seldom recognized in Australia, the United Kingdom, and U. S. A., judging by the sparsity of references in the literature. The high five year survival rate of surgically treated EGC (more than 95 %/ 0) compared with that of advanced gastric cancer (approximately 30 %) (Ransom, 1953; Muto, 1962) provides the stimulus for making a diagnosis at this stage of disease. The detection of this early lesion requires team work between expert radiologists giving good air <b>contrast</b> <b>barium</b> <b>studies,</b> experienced endoscopists aware of the condition, and histopathologists capable of interpreting the small biopsy specimens. This paper describes our experience of early gastric carcinoma during a 12 month period.

40|$|Background: The use of {{pneumatic}} dilation (PD) is {{well established}} in adults with achalasia; however, it is less commonly used in children. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of PD in pediatric achalasia and to define predictive factors for its treatment failure. Design: Single-center, prospective cohort study. Setting: Academic tertiary referral center. Patients: Twenty-four patients with achalasia were enrolled from January 2004 to November 2009 and were followed for a median of 6 years. Intervention: PD was performed with the patients under general anesthesia. Main Outcome Measurements: Efficacy and safety of PD. Follow-up was performed by using the Eckardt score, <b>barium</b> swallow <b>contrast</b> <b>studies,</b> and esophageal manometry at baseline; 1, 3, and 6 months after dilation; and every year thereafter. A Cox regression model was used to identify independent predictors of failure after the first PD. Results: The PD success rate was 67 %. In 8 patients, the first PD failed, but the parents of one patient refused a second PD and requested surgery. Of the 7 patients who underwent repeated treatment, the second PD failed in 3 (43 %). Overall, only 3 of the 24 patients underwent surgery (overall success rate after a maximum of 3 PDs was 87 %). Multivariate analysis showed that only older age was independently associated with a higher probability of the procedure success (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 66; 95 % CI, 0. 45 - 0. 97). Limitations: Small sample size, single-center study. Conclusions: PD is a safe and effective technique {{in the management of}} pediatric achalasia.

40|$|Abstract There {{continues}} to be significant controversy related to diagnostic testing for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Clearly, <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> fluoroscopy is superior to any other test in defining the anatomy of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. Although fluoroscopy can demonstrate gastroesophageal reflux (GER), this observa-tion does not equate to GERD. Fluoroscopy time should not be prolonged to attempt to demonstrate GER during <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> radiography. There are no data to justify prolonging fluoroscopy time to perform provocative maneuvers to demonstrate reflux during <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> UGI series. Symptoms of GERD {{may be associated with}} physio-logic esophageal acid exposure measured by intraeso-phageal pH monitoring, and a significant percentage of patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure have no or minimal clinical symptoms of reflux. Abnormal acid exposure defined by pH monitoring over a 24 -h period does not equate to GERD. In clinical practice presumptive diagnosis of GERD is reasonably assumed by substantial reduction or elimination of suspected reflux symptoms during therapeutic trial of acid reduction therapy...|$|R

The purpose of this review {{was to determine the}} reliability of the admission plain abdominal radiographs and subsequent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) <b>contrast</b> <b>studies</b> in predicting the need for operative intervention. The use of nasogastric tubes (NGT) versus nasointestinal (long) tubes (NIT) was correlated with the following outcome variables; length of hospital stay (LOS), timing of operative intervention, incidence of postoperative complications, and duration of postoperative ileus. Long tubes (NIT) were used in 64 episodes of PSBO and 81 episodes of CSBO, whereas nasogastric tubes (NGT) were used in 116 cases of PSBO and 68 cases of CSBO. Thirty-eight of 193 (19 %) patients with PSBO required operation (20 of 116 with NGT and 18 of 64 with NIT), whereas 125 of 149 (84 %) patients with CSBO required operation (60 of 68 with NGT and 65 of 81 with NIT). Need for operation was not correlated with whether or not long tubes passed beyond the pylorus; 50 passed versus 33 not passed in operative groups (p = 0. 15). Twelve of 83 patients with NIT had operation within 24 hours versus 52 of 80 patients with NGT (p less than 0. 001). In six of 64 patients who had surgery within 24 hours, complications developed versus in 39 of 99 patients operated on more than 24 hours after admission (p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001). In 29 of 83 patients treated with NIT, postoperative complications developed versus in 16 of 80 patients with NGT (p less than or equal to 0. 04). The mean duration of postoperative ileus in patients with NIT was 7 days versus 4. 1 days for NGT patients (p less than 0. 001).

There were 50 males and 30 females, with a median age of 58. 4 years (range 30 - 90). Among 80 patients diagnosed with esophagal cancer, 72 / 80 (90 %) were included SCC and 8 / 80 (10 %) as adenocarcinoma. 41 / 80 (51. 3 %) were located in the lower third esophagus. The most location of tumors was middle third esophagus in females and lower third esophagus in males. Involving cardia observed in 8 / 8 (100 %) of adenocarcinoma. 36. 1 % of lesions were infiltrative in SCC vs 12. 5 % in adenocarcinoma. Cardia Vegetation and stagnation were most frequent in adenocarcinoma. This approach suggests that cardia involvment combine with vegetation and stagnation can be useful tool in evaluating esophageal cancers in the lower third esophagus...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the {{diagnostic}} value of magnetic resonance (MR) fluoroscopy in the study of oesophageal motility disorders and to compare MR fluoroscopy results with those of manometry and <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> radiography. Twenty-five subjects referred for dysphagia and three patients in follow-up after pneumatic dilatation of the lower oesophageal sphincter to treat severe achalasia underwent esophageal manometry, <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> radiography and MR fluoroscopy. Examinations were performed on a 1. 5 T scanner. Dynamic turbo- fast low angle shot (turbo-FLASH) sequences acquired during oral contrast agent administration were used to perform MR fluoroscopy. MR fluoroscopy correctly diagnosed achalasia in nine patients, uncoordination of esophageal body motility in ten and scleroderma oesophagus in one. Diagnostic performance was satisfactory, with a sensitivity of 87. 5 % and a specificity of 100 % in the general depiction of motility alterations. Our work demonstrates that MR fluoroscopic examination in subject affected by oesophageal motility disorders is feasible and can properly depict motility and morphology alterations, achieving correct diagnosis in the majority of cases. Studies on larger populations are necessary to obtain statistically significant results...|$|R
40|$|Villous {{tumors of the}} {{duodenum}} are rare, but {{treatment may}} be problematic because of their association with invasive adenocarcinoma. Two cases of villous tumor of the duodenum are described and 39 other reported cases are reviewed. Presenting symptoms were bleeding 27 %; obstruction 24 %; jaundice 22 % and vague dyspepsia 20 %. Diagnosis may be made by radiographic <b>barium</b> <b>contrast</b> evaluation of the duodenum, especially {{with the addition of}} air <b>contrast</b> hypotonic <b>studies</b> and by fibro-optic endoscopy. Twenty-seven per cent of villous tumors of the duodenum are associated with adenocarcinoma. Invasive tumor is more common in patients over 50 years old (35 %), in tumors of the third and fourth portions of the duodenum (44 %) and in tumors over 4 cm in diameter (30 %). Local excision is the treatment of choice for benign lesions. Pancreatico-duodenectomy is recommended for tumors which include invasive carcinoma in patients without distal metastases...|$|R

40|$|Appendiceal orifice {{inflammation}} (AOI) {{is observed}} as skip lesion in distal ulcerative colitis (UC). The endoscopic frequency of AOI {{is reported to}} be 7. 9 % to 76 % of distal colitis. UC is a relapsing and remitting disease and a morphological change of the large bowel occurs over time. Patient and physician can easily understand the shape of the whole large bowel not through endoscopic pho-tograph but by roentgenogram of the bowel. Therefore, the authors undertake barium enema study when a diagnosis of UC is made. We have experienced a patient with proctitis in which an appendiceal submucosal tumor (SMT) was suspected on the roentgenogram but it was {{turned out to be a}} protruding lesion of AOI. A 16 -year-old boy visited us with complaining of blood in his stool for the past 10 days. Sigmoidoscopy revealed mild diffuse inflammation. Crypt abscess was found in biopsy specimen. A diagnosis of UC, proctitis type, was made. A double <b>contrast</b> <b>barium</b> enema <b>study</b> revealed a defect shadow with a smooth surface, length 37 mm, height 12 mm, over the ap-pendix. An appendiceal SMT was suspected. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomogra-phy were non-contributory. Colonoscopy revealed a spiral inflamed mucosa at the site of an ap-pendiceal orifice. There was an inflammation in the cecum surrounding the orifice. Biopsy speci...|$|R
