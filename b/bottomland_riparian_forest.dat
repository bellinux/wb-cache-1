The American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old-growth forests. American sycamores can grow at least [...] in height and the species is distributed throughout the Eastern United States. It usually thrives in moist soils along streams, especially in sandy loam soils.

40|$|Quantification {{of carbon}} pools as {{affected}} by forest ageldevelopment can facilitate riparian restoration and increase {{awareness of the}} potential for forests to sequester global carbon. <b>Riparian</b> <b>forest</b> biomass and carbon pools were quantified for four <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> representing different sera 1 stages in the South Carolina Upper Coastal Plain. Three of the <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> were recovering from disturbance (thermal pollution), whereas the fourth represents a mature, relatively undisturbed <b>riparian</b> <b>forest.</b> Above and belowground carbon pools were determined from linear transects established perpendicular to the main stream channels and spanning the width of the riparian area. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the biomass and carbon pools in severely disturbed, early successional <b>bottomland</b> hardwood <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> and to compare these values to those of a less disturbed, mature <b>riparian</b> <b>forest.</b> Aboveground biomass in all four <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> increased during the 2. 5 -year investigation period. The total carbon pool in these South Carolina Coastal Plain <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> increased with forest ageldevelopment due to greater tree and soil carbon pools. The mature <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> stored approximately four times more carbon than the younger stands. The inlportance of the herbaceous biomass layer and carbon pool declined relative to total aboveground biomass with increasing forest age.

40|$|ABSTRACT) <b>Riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are {{integral}} {{components of the}} landscape. The inherent biogeochemical processes that occur in such forests provide numerous benefits to wildlife and society. Maintaining good water quality is a major benefit from <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> and therefore, the maintenance, creation, or restoration of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> is indispensable. This {{study was designed to}} broaden current knowledge of the complex, interrelated biogeochemical processes and determine indices for <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> restoration based on the various carbon pools/fluxes that may represent restoration success. This study was implemented on the Savannah River Site, an Environmental Research Park, where several <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are recovering from thermal disturbances. The streams in these forests were subjected to thermal discharges that increased flows and resulted in removal of soil and a decline in the amount of woody vegetation. Two of these <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are at different ages post-disturbance and represent different stages of recovery, which provides an exceptional opportunity to study successional processes in <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> and enhance restoration efforts.

Composition and species richness of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> were studied at 16 sites located along an altitudinal gradient and TSS was determined from water samples collected in each site. In order to evaluate conservation status of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests,</b> we calculated an index of Quality of Yungas <b>Riparian</b> <b>Forests</b> (QBRy). We recorded 90 plant species at all sites, from which 77 % were native. QBRy index was mainly associated with altitude and varied from <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> with good preservation or slightly disturbed to those with extreme degradation. At lower altitude, forests were more disturbed, more invaded by exotic plant species, and closer to urban and cropped areas. QBRy was not correlated with species richness or TSS.

A sugar cane field adjacent to a strip of young <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> bordering an older <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> along a stream was used to study the <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> as a buffer zone to prevent pesticides pollution. Concentrations of the herbicides diuron, hexazinone and tebuthiuron were determined in different soil layers of a Red Yellow Oxisol during 2003 and 2004. The determination was done by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with reverse phase C- 18 column, through two mobile phases. Diuron and hexazinone concentration diminished between the sugar cane and <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> as buffer strip demonstrating a protective effect. However, tebuthiuron had about four times higher concentrations in the old <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> {{compared to the other}} areas. Concentrations were higher in the surface and decreased in deeper soil layers in the old <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> suggesting that this herbicide probably was introduced by air pollution. This pesticide concentrated in the canopy could be washed by rain to the soil adjacent to the stream. Our data suggest that climate conditions were responsible for enhanced volatilization exposing the old <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> to more air pollution that was captured by the higher canopy.

The communities in <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> included on average 1. 5 times more primate species than those in terra firma forests {{due to the fact}} that <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> shelter 4 specialist species and 6 - 7 generalist species. The results differ from findings in Amazonia where <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> consistently have fewer primate species than terra firma forests accommodate. This may be partly explained by the water level amplitude in Amazonian <b>riparian</b> <b>forests,</b> which deterred the radiation of semiterrestrial species. In Africa, most riparian-specialist primates are terrestrially-adapted and have access to an enlarged food niche. In terms of African primate conservation, we recommend protecting <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> and adjacent terra firma forests so that most of the lowland forest diversity is captured.

40|$|<b>Riparian</b> <b>forests</b> {{are vital}} for {{maintaining}} healthy stream ecosystems; acting as buffers against nutrient and contaminant inputs, contributing energy subsidies and providing favorable instream habitat conditions. In urban catchments <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are often degraded or cleared, removing the ecosystem functions the <b>forest</b> provides. Intact <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> along urban waterways, may mitigate {{some aspects of}} degradation associated with an urbanized catchment. In Bulimba Creek, an urbanized catchment in southeast Queensland, Australia, we investigated some ecosystem functions provided by <b>riparian</b> <b>forest.</b> We found that during baseflow periods a <b>forested</b> <b>riparian</b> corridor provided energy subsidies to the stream through litterfall and had a controlling influence on instream production through shading. Denitrification potential of benthic sediments increased with increasing levels of woody debris and organic matter, deposited from riparian vegetation. Denitrification was nitrate limited, indicating some potential to reduce nitrate loads in the stream. Riparian soils also showed moderate denitrification potential; which, through management strategies, could be utilized to reduce excess nitrate loads. These results suggest that <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> provide important functions for urban streams; highlighting the importance of conserving forest remnants in urban landscapes and the usefulness of replanting degraded <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> to enhance stream health and habitat condition.

40|$|Claimed {{benefits}} of <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> {{cover for the}} aquatic ecosystem include purification, thermal control, organic matter input and habitat provision, which may improve physicochemical and biotic quality. However, these beneficial effects might be flawed by multiple stressor conditions of intensive agriculture and urbanization in upstream catchments. We {{examined the relationship between}} <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> cover and physicochemical quality and biotic integrity indices in extensive large scale datasets. Measurements of hydromorphological conditions and <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> cover across different buffer widths for 59 ¬†√ó¬† 103 river stretches covering 230 ¬†√ó¬† 103 km of the French river network were coupled with data for physicochemical and biotic variables taken from the national monitoring network. General linear and quantile regression techniques were used to determine responses of physicochemical variables and biological integrity indices for macroinvertebrates and fish to <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> cover in selections of intermediate stress for 2 nd to 4 th order streams. Significant responses to forest cover were found for the nutrient variables and biological indices. According to these responses a 60 % <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> cover in the 10 m buffer corresponds to good status boundaries for physicochemical and biotic elements.

In headwater streams, light is regulated primarily by the <b>riparian</b> <b>forest,</b> but few studies have evaluated the influence of <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> stand age and associated structural differences on light availability. In this study, we evaluate canopy cover and streambed light exposure in four second-order streams with paired reaches of primary old-growth versus second-growth mature <b>riparian</b> <b>forests.</b> Stand age class is used as a proxy here for canopy complexity. We estimated stream canopy cover using a spherical densiometer. Local streambed light exposure was quantified and compared within and between reaches using fluorescein dye photodegradation. Reaches with complex old-growth <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> had frequent canopy gaps which lead to greater stream light availability compared to adjacent reaches with simpler second-growth <b>riparian</b> <b>forests.</b> We quantified light exposure at relatively high resolution (every 5 m) and also found greater variability in stream light along the reaches with old-growth <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> in three of the four streams.

40|$|The Araneidae is a speciose family {{including}} web-spinning spiders {{that are}} very abundant in various terrestrial ecosystems. Several studies demonstrate that changes in vegetation surrounding rivers, streams and brooks affect the associated araneofauna. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare differences found in diversity (abundance and richness), composition and phenology of Araneidae spiders sampled in different habitats in four <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> catchments in southern Brazil. Samples were taken from <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> in four rivers of Rio Grande do Sul State: Piratini, Camaqu&# 227;, Sinos and Maquin&# 233; rivers, each in a different hydrographic basin. Samples were taken twice seasonally on each basin during two years, sampling the araneofauna of the tree-shrub strata with beating tray. Six transects were employed on each basin, two per habitat: edge with grassland, forest interior and river edge. Araneids totalled 20 genera and 65 species. Comparing <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> significant differences are found. Spider abundance differed among <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> as well as species richness. Overall, Piratini river <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> had the higher abundance and richness for Araneidae; the lower values were in Sinos river forest. The stronger degradation and fragmentation of the <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> of Sinos river probably influenced the results, with human disturbance gradients associated negatively to web building.

40|$|<b>Riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are {{important}} for the structure and functioning of stream ecosystems, providing structural components such as large woody debris (LWD). Changes in these forests will cause modifications in the LWD input to streams, affecting their structure. In order to assess the influence of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> changes in LWD supply, 15 catchments (third and fourth order) with <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> at different conservation levels were selected for sampling. In each catchment we quantified the abundance, volume and diameter of LWD in stream channels; the number, area and volume of pools formed by LWD and basal area and tree diameter of <b>riparian</b> <b>forest.</b> We found that <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> were at a secondary successional stage with predominantly young trees (diameter at breast height < 10 cm) in all studied streams. Results showed that basal area and diameter of <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> differed between the stream groups (forested and non-forested), but tree density did not differ between groups. Differences were also observed in LWD abundance, volume, frequency of LWD pools with subunits and area and volume of LWD pools. LWD diameter, LWD that form pools diameter and frequency of LWD pools without subunits did not differ between stream groups. Regression analyses showed that LWD abundance and volume, and frequency of LWD pools (with and without subunits) were positively related with the proportion of <b>riparian</b> <b>forest.</b> LWD diameter was not correlated to riparian tree diameter. The frequency of LWD pools was correlated to the abundance and volume of LWD, but characteristics of these pools (area and volume) were not correlated to the diameter of LWD that formed the pools.
