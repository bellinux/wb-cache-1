40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteDaniel Y. C. FungThere {{are many}} {{different}} environmental sampling methods that are currently used in the industry. They include swab, sponge, flocked swab, direct agar contact, and M-Vac. Several {{studies have been conducted}} to determine the benefits and drawbacks of each method. Sampling methods utilized in this study were the swab, flocked swab, and M-Vac. Three surfaces were utilized in this study: ultra high density polypropylene, 304 stainless steel with a 2 B finish, and 304 stainless steel with a 2 B finish and a <b>buffed</b> <b>surface.</b> Surfaces sampled were 100 cm 2. Prior to inoculation, surfaces were autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C for sterilization. Surfaces were inoculated by either Listeria monocytogenes or Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 at a concentration of 9 log 10 CFU/ml by painting the inoculum onto the surface with a sterilized paintbrush. Brushes were dipped in inoculum for 2 sec before painting from left to right once and then from up to down once. Brushes were redipped for 2 sec and the painting step was repeated. The same brush was used for all E. coli O 157 :H 7 samples and a different brush was used for all L. monocytogenes samples. Then, the surfaces were allowed to dry for 30 min before sampling took place. Listeria monocytogenes samples were appropriately diluted and plated in duplicate onto Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) and Modified Oxford Media (MOX). Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 samples were properly diluted and plated in duplicate onto TSA and MacConkey Sorbital Agar (MSA). After plating, dry surfaces were stained using LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability Kit. The Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal laser scanning electron microscope was used for microscopy images and photographs. Six 1 mm by 1 mm random and representative images were taken of each surface. Viable cell count results show that the sponge sampling method, in general, recovered a higher number of microorganisms. The swab was normally shown to recover the least number of microorganisms. When examining the microscopy images it can be concluded that biofilms are more easily formed with L. monocytogenes than E. coli O 157 :H 7. Imaging also allowed for a visual representation of the remaining organisms that made it appear as if there was actually more bacteria recovery when the M-Vac sampling method was employed than when the sponge method was utilized...|$|E

50|$|Yuchengia narymica has a {{cream to}} {{yellowish}} <b>buff</b> pore <b>surface</b> with angular pores. The hyphal system is dimitic (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae), and the generative hyphae have clamp connections. Similar to Perenniporia, Yuchengia has thick-walled and cyanophilous spores. Yuchengia is distinguished from Perenniporia in its acyanophilous and amyloid skeletal hyphae that dissolve in KOH, and non-dextrinoid spores.|$|R
30|$|Upon arrival, {{participants}} were briefed about the purpose, method, risks, {{and benefits of}} the study. After signing a written consent form, participants answered a set of demographic questions, including gender, ethnicity, age, marital status, education level, and income. An experimenter prepared each participant’s skin by lightly <b>buffing</b> the <b>surface</b> of skin and attached electrodes to the participant. The experiment began once the participant expressed understanding of the procedure.|$|R

50|$|This {{is a large}} {{deciduous}} tree up to 20m in height, {{found at}} low altitudes in river valleys, but also in open woodland on rocky slopes and ridges. Bark is grey, flaking in large, irregular scales and revealing a <b>buff</b> <b>surface,</b> giving a mottled appearance. The leaves up to 25 cm long, puberulous, crowded near the ends of branches, paripinnately compound with 6 or 7 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet measuring up to 11 x 3.5 cm. The leaflets are hairless with a narrowly attenuate apex or drip-tip, and entire margin. Petioles are some 20mm in length and slender, causing the leaflets to droop. Flowers are green in colour and in branched sprays some 20 cm long arising from the axils of leaves. Engler & Prantl favoured placing E. caudatum in Wulfhorstia because it has only 6 ovules in each loculus, and because it lacks partitions inside the staminal tube, the feature which struck Anne Casimir Pyrame de Candolle when he named it Entandrophragma in 1894. The partitions, though, are variable in species and are very short in Entandrophragma speciosa Harms, so that {{the differences between the}} two genera become trivial and untenable.|$|R

50|$|The fungus is {{characterized}} by a white, resupinate (crust-like) fruit body with a cream to <b>buff</b> pore <b>surface,</b> and the near absence of a sterile margin when mature. The angular pores number 5-6 per mm with entire mouths. It has a dimitic hyphal structure, containing both generative and skeletal hyphae. The generative hyphae in the subiculum and the trama are covered by fine crystals. The spores are allantoid (sausage-shaped), hyaline, smooth and thin walled, measuring 3.5-4.5 by 1.0-1.2 µm. They typically contain two small oil droplets.|$|R

500|$|The {{yellowish}} to <b>buff</b> cap <b>surface</b> is fibrous and roughened, {{and reaches}} up to [...] in diameter. The thick stem, {{roughly the same}} color as the cap or lighter, is hollowed out into chambers. All parts of the mushroom turn an intense blue color within a few moments of bruising or cutting. The mushroom is edible, despite its hard stem. A less common variety occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the oxidation of a chemical called gyrocyanin.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a buffing {{cream and}} chamois skin have been used. Modern {{instruments}} {{are much more}} efficient and are similar in appearance to a large rubber eraser, with different sides for different levels of coarseness. As <b>buffing</b> is gentle <b>surface</b> abrasion, {{it should not be}} performed too strongly or too often or thinning of the nail may result.|$|R

50|$|The Kolan vole has a {{head and}} body length of about 90 mm with a tail 32 to 44 mm long. The ears {{are small and}} rounded and hardly project from the pelage. The dorsal fur is a uniform dull buffish brown and the underparts are pale <b>buff.</b> The upper <b>surface</b> of hands and feet are brown; the upper surface of the tail is dark brown and the {{underside}} is pale brown giving it a bicoloured appearance.|$|R
50|$|The spores are thick-walled, spherical or broadly elliptical, <b>buff</b> colored, with <b>surface</b> ornamentations, and {{dimensions}} of 13-16 or 12-13 by 16 µm. They germinate {{by means of}} a basidia that bears an apical cluster of elongate basidiospores. The sterile (non spore-producing) cells are pale, nearly colorless, ornamented, and frequently collapsed. The conidia are thin-walled, mostly Y-shaped, transclucent, and arranged in roughly like a loose ball. When the conidia germinate, they make hyphae that can form both blastic conidia and ballistospores.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical buffing {{technology}} (ECB) applies electrochemical {{and mechanical}} finishing characteristics {{in the surface}} finishing process. ECB can buff ultrahigh purity components to make them shine, without leaving residual stress, micro-cracks, and etc. The control parameters of the ECB process include current density, the rate of revolution of the buffing head, the buffing pressure on the surface, the concentration of electrolyte, the buffing time and others. Improper control parameter setting in the process will result in unsatisfactory surface quality. It is necessary to determine optimal control parameters of an ECB process with robust performance that can insure surface quality and process reliability. In this study, parametric analyses were conducted on electrochemical buffing technology. An ECB system with a CNC machine was established. The buffing head was clamped on the tool holder of the CNC machine. It was used {{on a flat surface}} for automatic <b>surface</b> <b>buffing.</b> Taguchi′s parameter design approach is employed to evaluate signal-to-noise ratios (SN) given from various levels of these factors. Then, the optimized control parameters will be recognized thus can get the optimal <b>surface</b> <b>buffing,</b> reducing with the lowest variability. The contribution of every factor to the sum of square is calculated. An experiment is performed using the optimal control parameters to confirm the results of the previous experiment...|$|R
5000|$|The only notable {{architectural}} {{remains of}} this period consist {{of a number of}} plastered hearths [...]T.Cuyler Young Jr. defined three main groups of pottery for Level IV. Two of these groups belong to Transcaucasian Early Bronze Age Culture. One of these groups bears two types of coarse ware tempered with coarse grit. One of these types is characterized by a grey-black burnished surface mostly with contrasting colours in the interior and exterior of the vessels. This type of coarse ware was used for producing bowls entirely. Conical bowls decorated with incised and excised designs are common; the incised designs are occasionally filled with a whitish paste. The second type of coarse ware is lighter in colour, often tan or pinkish <b>buff.</b> The <b>surface</b> of the vessels is either burnished or plain. Besides bowls there are jars with protruding rims and concave or recessed necks [...]|$|R
