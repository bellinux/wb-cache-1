2500|$|Sagan {{warned against}} humans' {{tendency}} towards anthropocentrism. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the Cosmos chapter [...] "Blues For a Red Planet", Sagan wrote, [...] "If {{there is life}} on Mars, I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, the French Army, at {{the request}} of Tombalbaye, intervened in an attempt {{to put an end to}} the rebellion, killing 25 rebels and 121 civilians in various towns, {{including}} Zouar. However, the French leader of the intervention force, General Edouard Cortadellas, admitted that the Tibesti area was basically ungovernable, remarking, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> draw a line below [...] and leave them to their stones. We can never subdue them." [...] The French therefore concentrated its intervention to the center and the east of the country, leaving the Tibesti region area largely alone.|$|E
2500|$|Georgia, however, {{responded with}} a thinly veiled threat at a lawsuit. The owners {{eventually}} acquiesced to her demands, wary of going through a long, protracted legal battle. Tagliabue simply stated that [...] "The desire to have peace and not be at war was a big factor" [...] in allowing the Rams move to go forward. In {{a matter of a}} month, the vote had gone from 21–6 opposed to 23–6 in favor, with the Raiders, who would leave the Coliseum and return to Oakland in 1995, abstaining. Jonathan Kraft, son of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, elaborated on the commissioner's remarks by saying that [...] "about five or six owners didn't want to get the other owners into litigation, so they switched their votes." [...] Only six franchises remained in opposition to the Rams move from Los Angeles: the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Giants, New York Jets, Buffalo Bills, Arizona Cardinals (who played in St. Louis from 1960-87), and Washington Redskins. After the vote was over, Dan Rooney publicly stated that he opposed the move of the Los Angeles Rams because [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> support the fans who have supported us for years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, Sachs {{contends that}} democratization {{is not an}} {{integral}} part of having efficient aid distribution. Rather than attach strings to our aid dollars, or only working with democracies or [...] "good governments", Sachs <b>believes</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> consider the type of government in the needy country as a secondary concern.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was what}} I {{saw in his}} face when I gave him the warning. I was right, so far. I was wrong in my {{estimate}} of the reserve of vital power left in him. When he dropped on the race-course, I firmly <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> find him a dead man." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wiles accepts God as {{the sole}} creator of the world, yet {{believes}} he does not intervene {{in the world for}} a number of reasons. He <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not see God as playing an 'active role' but instead hold the belief that God created the world as he wanted in its entirety: ...|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--I have {{received}} additional despatches, which, with former ones, induce me to <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> revoke or suspend the order suspending the Chicago Times; {{and if you}} concur in opinion, please have it done.|$|E
60|$|Do you know, we {{came very}} near sending {{for you this}} winter. If we had not had news that you were ill too, I almost <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have done so, we were so much in trouble.|$|E
25|$|Tina Arena {{has been}} a {{prominent}} vocal supporter of female artists {{in the music industry}}, particularly celebrating the long-term careers of mature women artists. Arena <b>believes</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> embrace and celebrate ageing and not fall victim to ageism – especially in the music industry where the maturity of women is not seen as viable or relevant.|$|R
6000|$|... "True; {{but if the}} {{information}} brought by Poyor be correct, {{there will not be}} as strict a watch kept. The Indian <b>believes</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> try to force a passage through the swamp, fighting in case of a necessity; but I prefer that course where the least danger is to be met, even though the distance be greater." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1. This House <b>believes</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{establish}} one permanent centre for the Olympic Games to be {{held each}} Olympiad.|$|R
6000|$|BEFORE {{another word}} had been {{exchanged}} between us, Lucilla entered the room. We {{looked at each}} other. If we could have spoken at that moment, I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> both have said, [...] "Thank God, she is blind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Jolly-cum-pop and {{his companions}} slept that night under some trees, and started off early the next morning. [...] "If I could only get myself turned in the proper direction," [...] said he, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> soon reach my house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far from it; {{but when}} claims were disputed, {{is it not}} natural for the loser to view them as a hardship? I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have had a much better neighbourhood, as you call it, with France, had not the modern {{difficulties}} connected with religious changes, occurred." ...|$|E
50|$|Hooton {{also brought}} out the {{controversy}} of the intelligence test. Although the general results of such tests have been indicating that Whites have better mental status than Blacks, Hooton <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{be aware of the}} bias existing in those tests. Different races have different cultural backgrounds; he thought that maybe it was the Whites who cannot devise intelligent tests that are fairly applicable.|$|R
5000|$|You {{are talking}} to a leftist. I believe in the {{redistribution}} of wealth and power in the world. I believe in universal hospital care for everyone. I <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not have a single homeless person in the richest country in the world. And I <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not have a CIA that goes around overwhelming governments and assassinating political leaders, working for tight oligarchies {{around the world to}} protect the tight oligarchy here at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} of if," [...] said Godwin. [...] "To carry out her plan she held it {{necessary}} to lie, as I think she lied {{when she said that}} she <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> both escape, though it is true that so it came about. I will tell you why she lied. It was that she might give her life to set you free to join me in Jerusalem." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{and with}} good cause. When Colonels Cox and Paris say openly that it is cowardly for us to loiter here, surely {{there must be some}} reason in their words. A full third of this force <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have come in front of Fort Schuyler {{yesterday}} mornin', an' think you all those can be mistaken, an' only General Herkimer stand in the right?" ...|$|E
60|$|She saw me, {{she gave}} one cry, then, as I caught {{her in my}} arms, she fainted. It was happy indeed {{that she did not}} faint before, for {{had it not been for}} the sound of her voice I do not <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ever have found that cunningly hidden cave, unless, indeed, Indaba-zimbi's magic (on which be blessings) had come to our assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I had rather cheat the hangman. I told those doctors {{yesterday}} {{that they were}} giving themselves and {{me a great deal}} of useless trouble. The villains, as I told you, could not <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not betray them, and meant to make an end of us all. It's best as it is. My poor faithful Hans would never have had another happy moment." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD BROCKLEHURST. In common fairness, of course, {{this should}} be remembered, that two years had elapsed. You and I {{had no reason to}} <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ever meet again.|$|R
50|$|Murphy {{started playing}} guitar {{at the age}} of 12 while {{listening}} to the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. In high school he played guitar for Young Life and enjoyed how music pulled people together with love. After high school, he followed in his oldest brother's footsteps and joined the U. S. Navy to earn a free college education. Later he would say it was a high price to pay for an education, <b>believing</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never have been in Vietnam.|$|R
6000|$|Bewildering spring, {{and by the}} Auvezère [...] Poppies and day's-eyes in {{the green}} émail [...] Rose over us; and we knew all that stream, [...] And our two horses had traced out the valleys; [...] Knew the low flooded lands squared out with poplars, [...] In the young days when the deep sky befriended. [...] And great wings beat above us in the twilight, [...] And the great wheels in heaven [...] Bore us {{together}} ... surging ... and apart ... <b>Believing</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> meet with lips and hands ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not I; {{the poor}} rogues were not worth wasting good powder on, {{and a good}} English drubbing was a much newer and more {{effective}} experiment. I was thenceforth known {{by the name of}} Grandfather of Clubs, and Brown always manoeuvred me into sleeping across the entrance of the tent. I do <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have left him entombed in the desert sands, if John's dressing-case had been lost!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{he arrived}} within six {{miles of the}} town, the Jews poured out; and fell upon them with such fury that, if the horse and light troops had not made a circuit, and fallen upon us in the rear, I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have {{destroyed}} the whole army. But {{we were forced to}} fall back, having killed over five hundred. As the Romans moved forward, Simon--son of Gioras--with a band, pressed them closely in rear; and slew many, and carried off numbers of their beasts of burden.|$|E
60|$|Such is the {{diversity}} of opinion upon the why and the wherefore of education. And my hearers will be prepared to expect that the practical recommendations which are put forward are not less discordant. There is a loud cry for compulsory education. We English, in spite of constant experience to the contrary, preserve a touching faith in the efficacy of acts of Parliament; and I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have compulsory education {{in the course of}} next session, if there were the least probability that half a dozen leading statesmen of different parties would agree what that education should be.|$|E
5000|$|... "You {{stated that}} you <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> find water {{at a depth}} {{at a depth of}} between 60 and 70 feet. We found a supply at 69 feet and there is every {{probability}} that it will be sufficient for the requirements of the farm. You are no doubt aware that we had before sunk a well to a considerable depth without success. I was much surprised to find that you first indicated the locality of the water with your hands and no rod, only using the rod as a secondary aid to confirm your indication." ...|$|R
6000|$|... .... If it were as easy {{to invent}} a {{credible}} falsehood {{as it is to}} <b>believe</b> one, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have little else in print. The mechanical construction of a falsehood is a matter of the gravest import.|$|R
50|$|Chean Chung always <b>believes</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> give {{ourselves}} {{a chance to}} change for the better. He is confident that his home town - Kuantan will become better than {{what it is today}} with this positive thinking and value in mind.|$|R
6000|$|He {{came back}} {{late in the}} afternoon, looking jaded and distraught. Hinkle, who looked neither, was with him. [...] "Well," [...] he began, [...] "this is the {{greatest}} thing in my experience. Belsky's not only alive and well, but Mr. Gregory and I are both at large. I did think, one time, that the police would take us into custody on account of our morbid interest in the thing, and I don't <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have got off, if the Consul hadn't gone bail for us, so to speak. I thought we had better take the Consul in, on our way, and it was lucky we did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I heard," [...] said Larry. [...] "Nupper {{has been}} with him, I know, and I fancy they have sent for {{somebody}} from London. I don't know that he cares much about the land. He thinks more of the foreign parts he's always in. I don't <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> fall out about the price, my lord." [...] Then Lord Rufford explained {{that he would not}} go into that matter just at present, but that if the place were in the market he would certainly like to buy it. He, however, did as John Morton had done before, and endeavoured to persuade the poor fellow that he should not alter the whole tenor of his life because a young lady would not look at him.|$|E
60|$|This storm {{drove us}} {{away to the}} northward; and I once thought {{we should have been}} driven back to the Cape again; which, if it had happened, I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never have gone on with the voyage; for the men began to murmur again, and say we were bewitched; that we were beaten off first from the south of America, that we could never get round there, and now driven back from the south of Africa; so that, in short, it looked as if fate had {{determined}} this voyage to be pursued no farther. The wind continued, and blew exceeding hard: and, in short, we were driven so far to the north, that we made the south point of the island of Madagascar.|$|E
25|$|Hence {{to protect}} ourself from Kali, it is <b>believed</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> start doing japa, {{meditation}} or any yoga like Bhakti yoga, karma yoga, Raja yoga, and jnana yoga. But, Chanting the holy name of God {{is the best}} path in Kali yuga.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, Helen,' said Elizabeth, who {{had been}} {{pursuing}} her own thoughts, rather than listening to her sister's words, 'I do <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all have been more like her if she had lived; at least, I am sure I should.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I am much {{obliged to}} you for your advice, for I am very ignorant myself, and hate {{anything}} to do with money. I go back to first principles, and <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all be better without it." ...|$|R
