[...] When I have said that the 7th symphony of Shostakovich is a dull and {{unpleasant}} composition, people have responded: [...] "Yes, yes, <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the background of that symphony." [...] Such an attitude does no good to anyone.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the video}} interview, Okamoto said: [...] "Men are always {{aware of the}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between men and}} women, and so cannot help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> themselves as superior. So I used that to my advantage by stroking their egos. [...] Until [...] I could compensate for the disadvantages of being a woman by working longer hours—10 hours per day instead of the 8 that the men worked." [...] At Keio University, she could not find day care for her daughter and brought her to the laboratory, [...] " [...] that she would behave herself". She carried her on her back as an infant while working in the lab.|$|E
2500|$|These {{fears were}} echoed by the Scottish Parliament. Its members were telling the king {{that they were}} [...] "confident" [...] that his plans for an {{incorporating}} union would not prejudice the ancient laws and liberties of Scotland; for any such hurt would mean that [...] "it culd no more be a frie monarchie". James attempted to reassure his new English subjects that the new union would be much like that between England and Wales, and that if Scotland should refuse [...] "he would compel their assents, having a stronger party there than the opposite party of the mutineers". In June 1604 the two national parliaments passed acts appointing commissioners to explore the possibility of [...] "a more perfect union". James closed the final session of his first parliament with a rebuke to his opponents in the House of Commons — [...] "Here all things suspected...He merits {{to be buried in}} the bottom of the sea that shall <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> separation, where God had made such a Union".|$|E

5000|$|Conservatism, Levin has said, [...] "understands society not as just {{individuals}} and government, <b>but</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> {{it in terms}} of everything that happens in between. That huge space between the individual and the state is where society actually is. And that’s where families are, it’s where communities are, it’s where the market economy is." ...|$|R

2500|$|Künneth {{begins by}} noting that [...] "the {{bankruptcy}} of a secularized theology {{in the face of}} the resurrection is (of course) largely due to Schleiermacher", who maintained that the spiritual presence of Jesus and his influence on the disciples he left behind was not contingent on any news of the facts of Christ's resurrection (p.16). Ritschl added to the confusion by approaching from the other direction: the qualities of the exalted Christ are already contained in his existence in time. Künneth sees this as enormously over-simplistic, and notes wryly, of those who conclude that Christ's resurrection was largely a [...] "vision" [...] of the fervent would-be apostles, that Jesus himself taught that visions from beyond the grave would not alter the religious experience of men (the parable of Lazarus and Dives, Luke 16:29ff). Künneth argues that [...] "the resurrection of Jesus cannot be cut out of" [...] the Christian kerygma/message (p.36) : [...] for that would leave us merely with matters for psychic or sociological investigation, however inadequate, scientifically, these explanations would be to account for the duration, intensity, and persistence of the Christian faith (and here, one cannot help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> William James's Varieties of Religious Experience). To imagine Dogma to be what Matthew Arnold took it to be, the Aberglaube, or added Belief above and beyond the Facts, would be to imprison Christianity forever within the continuum of space and time, which for Künneth, is subject to uncertainty and mortality and subjectivity. This, in fact, is just what Adolf Harnack had done in Germany, as Arnold was writing in England : Dogma was interpreted, via Higher Criticism, to be a Greek addition to the pure New Testament.|$|E
