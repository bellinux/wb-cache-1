25|$|A {{syndicated}} {{version with}} almost identical rules ran weekly in 1975–76. Each episode featured {{the same two}} contestants competing for the entire show. After the first few episodes the rules were changed so that rather than requiring contestants to win a two-out-of-three match, the winner of each game played the <b>Big</b> <b>Numbers,</b> and the losing contestant returned for another game. The contestants played as many games as possible until time was called. If this happened during a game, {{the one who had}} removed more digits won the final game and any prizes accumulated. Under the two-out-of-three game format used in the first few episodes, the contestant also had another chance at the <b>Big</b> <b>Numbers.</b> Like other weekly nighttime game shows at that time, this version had no returning champions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Numbers</b> bonus round {{was also}} used on Las Vegas Gambit, which was hosted by future High Rollers host Wink Martindale and was also {{produced}} by Heatter-Quigley Productions, in 1981. The round used the same dice table as the 1978–80 version (complete with sound effects) and had the same rules, but the top award was an accumulating jackpot of prizes known as the Gambit Galaxy.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Leontyne Price and William Warfield, who had {{starred in}} the 1952 world tour of Porgy and Bess, {{recorded}} their own album of excerpts from the opera for RCA Victor. None of the other singers from that production appeared on that album, but John W. Bubbles, the original Sportin' Life, substituted for Cab Calloway (who had played Sportin' Life onstage in the 1952 production). The 1963 recording of Porgy and Bess excerpts remains the only official recording of the score on which Bubbles sings Sportin' Life's two <b>big</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Duremdes was {{surprisingly}} traded from Alaska to the Sta. Lucia Realtors {{for a future}} first round pick (which {{turned out to be}} Brandon Cablay). The trade stunned everyone in attendance and made the Realtors one of the formidable contenders to win a PBA crown with the trio of Duremdes, Marlou Aquino and Dennis Espino. Despite <b>big</b> <b>numbers</b> in his first season with Sta. Lucia, he failed to lead the squad to a single championship. However, in the 2003 All-Star Game, he led the Commissioner's All-Star in a win over the Governor's team after scoring a buzzer-beating layup in the final seconds.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods were}} used to {{forecast}} {{the outcome of the}} 2016 election. For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's Crystal Ball and Electoral-Vote. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at The New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country. The near-unanimity of forecasters in predicting a Clinton victory may have been the result of groupthink. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in <b>big</b> <b>numbers</b> there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.|$|E

Henry Hitchings of the Evening Standard gave a mixed {{view of the}} music, [...] "There are seductive melodies {{and a couple of}} {{genuinely}} catchy songs. But it never settles into a single confident idiom, and between the <b>big</b> <b>numbers</b> there are lulls, especially in the overlong first half." [...] Letts praised Campbell for his vocal talents, stating that he [...] "does some worthy old-fashioned crooning – in a pleasant song called 'Marking Time' there are moments when he actually sounds like Nat King Cole." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was {{conflicting}} instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title [...] "Tamarod Storm". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for <b>big</b> <b>numbers</b> to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, [...] "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when people feel they are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Monaghan, Drive Shaft {{is similar}} to Oasis, in that [...] " [...] first album {{was kind of like}} Oasis's first album: {{critically}} acclaimed, didn't sell <b>big</b> <b>numbers,</b> but in the industry, people gave it respect." [...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other. According to Burk, [...] "At one point, in a delirious stupor, we realized we had said it so many times that that had to be the song." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{one stage}} in the game, Kristie, having earned immunity, used water loading to gain 5.9kg which meant she had a large loss of 8kg the {{following}} week. The water loading technique was then officially banned with a new rule stating that gaining weight would result in being at risk of elimination even if immunity had been won.

2500|$|During the season, Smith's game showed marked improvement, {{especially}} in his leadership and intangibles. While {{he did not}} put up <b>big</b> <b>numbers,</b> he helped the 49ers win games through efficient play, minimizing mistakes and controlling the clock. [...] In Philadelphia in week 4, Smith rallied the team from a 23–3 second-half deficit to win 24–23, completing 9 of 9 passes for 179 yards and 2 touchdowns {{in the third quarter}} alone. [...] Two weeks later Smith led his third come-from-behind road victory of the year with a six-yard fourth and goal touchdown pass to tight end Delanie Walker, beating the Lions in Detroit 25–19. [...] In a week 10 matchup against the New York Giants, he completed 19 out of 30 passes for 242 yards. The Giants shut down the 49ers' run game (Frank Gore was held to zero yards on six carries before leaving the game in the second half) and Smith was instrumental in the 27–20 victory.|$|E

2500|$|After {{prompting}} by cartoonist and self-publishing advocate Dave Sim, Moore {{then used}} Mad Love to publish his next project, <b>Big</b> <b>Numbers,</b> a proposed 12-issue series set in [...] "a hardly-disguised version of Moore's native Northampton" [...] known as Hampton, and {{deals with the}} effects of big business on ordinary people and with ideas of chaos theory. Illustration of the comic was begun by Bill Sienkiewicz, who left the series after only two issues in 1990, and despite plans that his assistant, Al Columbia, would replace him, it never occurred and the series remained unfinished. Following this, in 1991 the company Victor Gollancz Ltd published Moore's A Small Killing, a full length story illustrated by Oscar Zárate, about a once idealistic advertising executive haunted by his boyhood self. According to Lance Parkin, A Small Killing is [...] "quite possibly Moore's most underrated work". Soon after this, Mad Love itself was disbanded as Phyllis and Deborah ended their relationship with Moore, taking with them much of the money that he had earned from his work in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Ahmadinejad, in [...] {{a speech}} praising the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was {{translated}} by Iranian state-run media {{as saying that}} [...] "Israel must be wiped off the map." [...] A controversy erupted over the translation, with specialists such as Juan Cole of the University of Michigan and [...] Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project {{pointing out that the}} original statement in Farsi did not say that Israel should be wiped off the map, but instead that it would collapse. The words [...] ‘Israel’, ‘map’, and ‘to wipe off’ [...] are non-existent in the Iranian speech's original. According to another IRNA translation, on the occasion of a commemoration of the anniversary of Khomeini's death on 3 June 2008, Ahmadinejad stated that [...] "The corrupt element will be wiped off the map." [...] Contextually, Ahmadinejad was quoting Khomeini's words about the imminent disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. In Katajun Amirpur's analysis, there is no implication in the text that Iran intended destroying Israel or annihilating the Jewish people, any more than Khomeini was suggesting with his words that the Russians, or the Iranian people themselves under the Shah would be extinguished. Ahmadinejad is on the record as stating that Iran had no plans to attack Israel. The statement itself was in fact a citation, with a minute verbal variation, of a remark made by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which had created no furor at the time, but did so when Ahmadinejad quoted them in 2005. Dan Meridor, Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy said during an Al Jazeera interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had repeatedly said [...] "that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive. They didn’t say, ‘We’ll wipe it out,’ you’re right, but, ‘It will not survive.’" [...] adding [...] "If Iran says this, and continues to pile up uranium that they enrich, and build missiles in <b>big</b> <b>numbers,</b> and have a nuclear military plan -- if you put all this together, you can't say, they don't really mean it." [...] The Washington Post's fact-checker editor Glenn Kessler says the interpretation gets murkier when Ahmadinejad's quote is set against other Iranian propaganda. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites proof that the Iranian government releases propaganda that clearly says Israel should be [...] "wiped off." [...] Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs discovered pictures of Iranian propaganda banners that clearly say in English: [...] "Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world." [...] In March 2016, Iran tested a ballistic missile painted with the phrase [...] "Israel should be wiped off the Earth" [...] in Hebrew. The missile is reported to be capable of reaching Israel.|$|E
