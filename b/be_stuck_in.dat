25|$|The third {{race of the}} 2006 season went poorly for Ide: He {{was blamed}} for {{blocking}} Rubens Barrichello during his qualifying lap, causing the Brazilian to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> {{the first round of}} qualifying and start 16th on the grid. Ide finished in Australia, two laps down. His weekend in Melbourne was notable for a number of spins, and team principal Aguri Suzuki subsequently suggested Ide's seat was not safe if his performances did not improve.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{ended the}} subcontinental {{part of the}} tour with victory over Ceylon by an innings and 44 runs. Not wanting to wait {{a month for the}} next boat and a fortnight's sea voyage, the Australians {{returned}} to Perth by hitching a ride on a B-24 Liberator. The pilot of the RAAF plane had already promised 14 friends a lift so that they would not <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> India for another six months, so the Australian team sat {{on the floor of the}} aircraft. They made it back to Australia despite suffering engine trouble and an overloaded plane.|$|E
25|$|The ‘‘hiding’’ effect {{takes into}} account the fact that, while small grains are {{inherently}} more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones. As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.|$|E

25|$|Greed is a {{theme of}} the novel {{because it is a}} basic {{motivation}} for several of the characters. In the past, Marek and his team are thrust into a world that is one large battlefield between the French and the English. The French are not happy that the English are continuously attempting to conquer their lands. For this reason, {{there is a great deal}} of fighting between the two sides. Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnaut’s greed in wanting to take it back. This causes Marek and his team to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the engines}} found that their fuel systems were {{contaminated}} with spherical particles. The particles had caused the Fuel Metering Units' Main Metering Valves (MMVs) to seize; the MMVs were found to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> positions corresponding to the recorded thrust output of each engine as it approached Hong Kong. Other engine components {{were found to be}} contaminated with the particles as well, and No. 2 engine's Variable Stator Vane Controller was also found to be seized; the entire fuel system including the aircraft's fuel tanks was found to be contaminated with the spherical particles. As part of the investigation, fuel samples had been collected at Juanda International Airport. Investigators found that the contaminant particles were present in the fuel samples. The fuel supply pipeline system used to refuel aircraft at Juanda International Airport had been extended prior to B-HLL being refuelled there, as part of the construction of new aircraft parking bays. The investigation discovered that not all procedures were followed when the fuel pipeline system was brought back into service.|$|E

500|$|The wraith-blade {{attached}} to Raziel's arm, over-aroused after {{the deaths of}} the Sarafan, suddenly seizes control of the physical Reaver, and impales Raziel; Raziel, horrified, then realizes his destiny. He himself has always been the ravenous spirit inside the Reaver, and therefore is fated to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a time loop; the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it was unable to consume itself. While his soul is being drawn into the sword, Kain emerges and tears the Reaver from Raziel's body, saving him in reciprocation and forcing history to reshuffle again. However, this paradox strains Nosgoth's history too far, enabling the Hylden to return and jeopardize his ambition to restore the Pillars. Amidst Kain's dismay, Raziel realizes that the wraith-blade is still bound to him, and laments that his destiny has not been changed, but merely [...]|$|E

500|$|Smith {{agreed to}} return {{for a few days}} in 1988 to finish off Daphne's storyline. This time, the actress asked for her {{character}} to be killed off. Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die. I didn't want to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a television series {{for the rest of my}} life. I'd taken Daphne as far as she could go. She's run the gamut of every life experience she could possibly have. I'd had enough." [...] Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father's funeral and she was left in a coma. Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E
500|$|Author Gary Tillery draws {{parallels}} between Harrison's approach to [...] " [...] {{through the motions}} of living in the material world" [...] and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game. Tillery writes that [...] "what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the middle of New York and be very spiritual... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E
500|$|Lior Philips from Consequence of Sound found {{influences}} of Gaga's [...] "dance musicality" [...] in [...] "The Cure", {{especially in the}} [...] "finger clicking, pristine clean production, anthemic flute-like synth, and her remarkable falsetto". Comparing the track to songs by OneRepublic, Philips complimented {{the simplicity of the}} verses, writing that it [...] "intensifies the mood". Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood states that [...] "The Cure" [...] is [...] "an intriguing midtempo pop-soul jam", with [...] "synthetic textures", and [...] "very Madonna circa 'Human Nature'". Amy Mackelden of Marie Claire called it a [...] "synth-pop masterpiece that will <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> your head from the second you hear it" [...] and further wrote: [...] "The lyrics are super uplifting and relatable, especially as the chorus features the positive refrain, 'No matter what you know, I'll fix you with my love.'" [...] Ian Monroe from V praised the song for its lyrics and called it [...] "the song of the summer".|$|E

500|$|The {{love story}} {{involving}} Kurt and Blaine {{was met with}} critical acclaim, especially {{the events in the}} [...] "Original Song" [...] episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of Billboard stated, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] The Boston Herald Mark Perigard wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of the}} moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> pure misery." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet" [...] and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty".|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{believed the}} episode [...] "got us quickly {{back on track}} after last week's lackluster tale," [...] and called the killer revelation the greatest shock she has received on the series thus far. She continued {{that one of her}} favorite parts of the Peter-as-a-killer arc is being able to watch the emotional setbacks he is facing as a result of Fauxlivia's betrayal; she called it [...] "good characterization, and excellent acting". However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just when you think they might <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> old habits, they come up with new ideas and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and it gives us one big new plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Colin Stutz of Billboard described [...] "Say Yes" [...] as a [...] "peppy" [...] number.

Mike Wass from Idolator praised the song's catchiness, describing {{it as an}} [...] "infectious gospel club-banger" [...] and {{an invitation to the}} dance floor for listeners. Further, he called it [...] "possibly the first twerk-inducing song of praise". He concluded his review, writing, [...] "those harmonies remain unrivaled and the chorus is a monster. Trust me, [...] will <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> your head after the first listen." [...] In another review he felt that the song managed {{to bridge the gap between}} gospel and popular music. Describing the song as [...] "kinetic", Marc Hogan of Spin magazine called it [...] "not only star-studded, but damn near impossible to get out of your head, too". Rolling Stone writer Jon Blistein described the horn stabs as [...] "heavenly" [...] and praised the trio's [...] "always potent harmonies".|$|E

500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Randall Roberts stated [...] "the album's highlight, and {{an instant}} classic, is [...] "Made in America," [...] a solid, slow-paced Frank Ocean-teamed jam about the American dream that reveals the main {{difference}} between West and Jay Z: humility." [...] Popdust writer Emily Exton that while [...] "Frank Ocean's [...] "Sweet Baby Jesus" [...] might <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> your head {{for the rest of the}} day", the highlist is [...] "Kanye who manages to both appreciatively give thanks to his rise to fame as well as generate more than one eye roll with his bravado." [...] Rolling Stones Simon Vozick-Levinson mused [...] "Frank Ocean's second appearance on the album is another keeper. Hip-hop heads will be singing his honey-voiced, religiously-themed hook all fall. Jay Z and Kanye keep the thoughtful mood going with verses that revisit their respective rises to fame." [...] BBC Music's Marcus J. Moore perceived that [...] "Made in America fails to resonate because of a contrived chorus that pays homage to West's Sweet Baby Jesus, among others." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent found it to be a stand-out track, [...] "featuring assured vocal refrains from Frank Ocean, while the two rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity." [...] The track briefly charted on the South Korea Gaon International Chart for one week.|$|E
500|$|According to Pokémon co-creator Ryan Long, {{the games}} were {{designed}} with the DS's unique features in mind, such as the Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridges. The command buttons in the battle screen are large and color-coded; according to Masuda, this feature would facilitate gameplay for players unable to read. Also, the touchscreen interface was designed to encourage players to use their fingers rather than the stylus to manipulate the screen. Though most of the graphics in Diamond and Pearl are 2D, some of the background elements are 3D. The decision to retain 2D graphics in Diamond and Pearl drew criticism; in response, Tsunekazu Ishihara said that [...] "we wanted to maintain the original idea of Pokémon being a game that you played on this big map" [...] and explained that physically, {{the games were}} in three dimensions but was designed to [...] "maintain the original feel of the game". Responding to criticism {{over the use of}} Friend Codes in the games, Ishihara explained that it was a security measure taken to ensure that players {{would not be able to}} chat with strangers over the Wi-Fi connection. Nintendo released a statement detailing glitches found in Japanese releases of Diamond and Pearl. The glitches caused players to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> an in-game wall or lose saved data. Nintendo has released patches to certain retailers in Japan to fix these glitches.|$|E

[...] He wakes in time to retrieve the Winchesters, but his weakened state prevents this so he is forced to draw power from Bobby's soul. [...] While Dean killed the Phoenix, Castiel brought them back before they could gather the ashes so it all appears for nothing and he lacks the power to send them back. [...] Luckily, Samuel Colt collected the ashes and sent a package with them to be delivered to Bobby's after the boys return.|$|E
