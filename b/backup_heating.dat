The soldiers started to farm the land; they acquired sheep's and goats. These fields were called [...] "soldier field". Such a field was located near the current <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> plant in Ålidhem.|$|E

System uses air flat-plate collectors, 12000 kg rock storage and <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> pump. Solar portion requires 0. 7 kW, and provides 35 % of average total heating load including hot water.

50|$|Thermal mass {{walls are}} best-suited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal (day-night) {{temperature}} swings (e.g., southwest, mountain-west). They do not {{perform as well}} in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where {{there is not a}} large diurnal temperature swing. Nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates; the wall loses stored heat in less than a day, and then leak heat, which dramatically raises <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> requirements. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system.|$|E
50|$|Especially small strains are {{suitable}} for keeping in an aquarium. However, this fish is not as easy to keep as the sailfin molly, let alone the P. sphenops (black molly). They need spacious tanks with well-aerated, slightly brackishwater to thrive. They are able to withstand higher temperatures than most pet fish. Although they can survive over 30°C for prolonged periods of time if other conditions are good, temperatures should be kept between 25 and 30°C. Direct sunlight and an ample supply of plant food, such as lettuce, peas, or certain algae, are necessary for optimal health; in subtropical areas, they can be kept outside in unheated tanks in the summer; in temperate zones, <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> may be necessary. This strain of molly can also be kept in saltwater reef tanks, and provide clean-up duties for the tank. To transition a molly to saltwater, adjustment time is needed; increase the salt content to match the reef tank {{over a period of}} three hours.|$|E
30|$|For {{each city}} {{the results of}} the EnergyPlus {{simulation}} are used to determine the proportion of heating provided by heat pumps and also by the <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> systems. During any hour that a heat pump is used there is a reduction in energy consumption as compared to using the <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> system exclusively. Electricity needed to operate the heat pump is subtracted from the displaced <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> energy to arrive at a net reduction in energy consumption.|$|E
50|$|A superinsulated {{house is}} {{intended}} to reduce heating needs very significantly and may even be heated predominantly by intrinsic heat sources (waste heat generated by appliances and the body heat of the occupants) with very small amounts of <b>backup</b> <b>heat.</b> This has been demonstrated to work even in very cold climates but requires close attention to construction details {{in addition to the}} insulation (see IEA Solar Heating & Cooling Implementing Agreement Task 13).|$|R
30|$|Natural {{gas prices}} are far lower per unit of energy than electricity. This {{has no effect on}} energy {{consumption}} for the balance point controlled heat pump results, but has a significant effect on those using the advanced controls. It is simply not economical to use a heat pump as often when natural gas <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> is available. Because of this trade-off between cost and energy savings, we see that, in Fig.  18, the energy consumption is nearly always greater under advanced control.|$|R
50|$|ASHPs {{are often}} paired with {{auxiliary}} or emergency heat systems to provide <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> when outside temperatures {{are too low}} for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions. Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected. Propane, natural gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces can provide this supplementary heat.|$|R
30|$|Costs {{of heating}} are {{calculated}} by tallying {{the cost of}} the source of energy for <b>backup</b> <b>heating.</b> This baseline cost is measured against the displaced <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> cost minus the cost of electricity needed to power the heat pump when it is in operation. The costs of natural gas and furnace oil are constant, whereas the cost of electricity varies hourly due to TOU pricing (elaborated in “Electricity prices”).|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the measured performance of four advanced residential ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems. The GSHP systems {{were developed by}} WaterFurnace International to minimize the need for electric resistance <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> and featured multiple speed compressors, supplemental water heating, and at most sites, multiple-speed fans. Detailed data collected for a complete year starting in June 1994 shows that the advanced design is capable of maintaining comfort {{without the use of}} electric resistance <b>backup</b> <b>heating.</b> In comparison with a conventional air-source heat pump, the advanced-design GSHP reduced peak heating demand by more than 12 kilowatts (kW) per residence and provided energy savings. The report describes the cooling and heating season operation of the systems, including estimated seasonal efficiency, hours of operation, and load profiles for average days and peak days. The electrical energy input, cooling output, and efficiency are presented as a function of return air temperature and ground loop temperature...|$|E
50|$|Metro Atlanta {{primarily}} uses {{natural gas}} for central heating and water heaters, {{with the major}} exception of heat pumps in apartments built during and since the 1980s. This is because winters are mild, and large apartment buildings usually require little energy to <b>heat.</b> <b>Backup</b> <b>heat</b> (also used during defrosting) is usually supplied by electric resistance heating, though some homes have hybrid heating units which use gas backup when it is cold. Exurban homes may also use all-electric instead of gas, if gas mains have not been extended to an area.|$|R

One-hectare pond with production of common carp was used as a model example. First of all the function of nuclear power plant is discussed, especially {{from the point of view}} of waste heat production. In next chapter the possibility of aquaponics system of fish breeding and plant growing is examined. In practical part the possibility of one-hectare heated pond is designed according to suitable location, <b>heat</b> pump and <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> source. There is a brief economic evaluation of suggested project at the end of the chapter...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analytical model}} using Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) {{has been developed}} to simulate life cycle climate performance (LCCP) for residential heat pumps. The LCCP model includes the direct impacts of refrigerant emissions, the indirect impacts of energy consumption used to operate the heat pump system, and the energy to manufacture and safely dispose the system and refrigerant. The annual energy consumption for heat pump operation, including <b>backup</b> <b>heat,</b> is calculated using input performance data at several operating points, {{in a number of}} different formats, assuming a linear relationship as defined in AHRI Standard 210 / 240. With appropriate input, the program can handle different heat pump systems, refrigerants, locations, and CO 2 emission profiles of power plants...|$|R
30|$|Similarly, {{supplying}} all heating {{needs with}} the <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> system results in GHG emissions {{that are considered}} the baseline estimate. Any heating displaced by heat pump use in a given hour results in the equivalent abatement of GHG emissions. The emissions resulting from electricity consumed by the heat pump is subtracted from the GHG emission reductions {{to arrive at a}} net value.|$|E

In particular, the artificial lighting system, which is adjusted by an automated control system, can be considered as unique <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> system...|$|E
30|$|The natural {{consequences}} of significant reductions in energy consumption are reductions in GHG emissions. Figures  20,  21, and  22 show GHG emissions in kilograms {{of carbon dioxide}} equivalent (kg CO_ 2 e) using the 100 year global warming potential [19, 30]. They are calculated for both the emissions due to consumption of electricity to operate the heat pumps, and also {{for each of the}} <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> systems. Emissions are calculated hourly to reflect the changes in electricity production mix throughout the days and months.|$|E
50|$|CANDU reactors, Canadian-invented deuterium-uranium design, are {{designed}} with at least one, and generally two, large low-temperature and low-pressure water reservoirs around their fuel/coolant channels. The first is the bulk heavy-water moderator (a separate system from the coolant), {{and the second is}} the light-water-filled shield tank(or calandria vault). These <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> sinks are sufficient to prevent either the fuel meltdown in the first place (using the moderator heat sink), or the breaching of the core vessel should the moderator eventually boil off (using the shield tank heat sink). Other failure modes aside from fuel melt will probably occur in a CANDU rather than a meltdown, such as deformation of the calandria into a non-critical configuration. All CANDU reactors are located within standard Western containments as well.|$|R
50|$|Since masonry heaters burn hot and fast, {{they can}} accept any dry, split (usually {{three to five}} inches in diameter) wood. In some areas {{of central and eastern}} Europe, these heaters are {{sometimes}} effectively fired using grass, straw, and hay. It is also common in eastern Europe to modify these efficient heaters so that they are connected to the gas network and are fueled with gas. Some modern models incorporate electric heating elements connected to timers. These are used only as a <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> source during periods when the structure will be left unattended for long duration in winter (and therefore with no one to build a new fire in the heater each day or as needed) to prevent the structure from freezing.|$|R

40|$|Zaradi postavitve novega termoenergetskega bloka 6 je bila zgrajena nova upravna stavba, ki ima večjo porabo toplotne moči. Njen toplotni odjem je priključen na obstoječi ogrevalni razvod interne toplotne postaje, ki je bila zgrajena leta 1975, in je še danes enake toplotne moči. Z leti pa se je povečevala potreba po toplotni moči, saj so se na toplotne razvode priključevala dodatna ogrevalna telesa, kot sta nova upravna stavba in rezervno ogrevanje strojnice bloka 6. V magistrski nalogi sem opisal obstoječe stanje interne toplotne postaje in informativno določil novo tehnološko opremo, ki bi jo bilo potrebno zamenjati pri rekonstrukciji interne toplotne postaje za nadaljnjo stabilno in varno obratovanje, ter določil nove režime regulacije obratovanja. Izdelal sem tudi izračun in izvedbo rezervnega ogrevanja strojnice bloka 6 in določil možne vire napajanja s paro za nadaljnjo obratovanje interne toplotne postaje. Določena tehnološka oprema je informativno izbrana kot primerzaradi poslovne narave so prikazani le osnovni podatki in stroškovne vrednosti izvedbe rekonstrukcije interne toplotne postaje. The {{building}} of the new thermo-electric power plant block 6 consequently required the need of a larger administrative infrastructure with a higher heating capacity.

Over the years, additional heaters were connected to the heating distribution system and as latest administrative infrastructure with a <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> of turbine house on block 6. The thesis described the existing internal heating station and informatively defined the new technological equipment, which should be replaced by the reconstruction of the internal heat station for further stable and safe operation with the new operating regimes. The thesis also includes calculation and implementation of the <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> the turbine house on block 6 and determined the potential sources of steam supply for further operation of the internal heat station. Certain technological equipment is selected for information, as an example and due to its business nature include only basic technical data and cost values of the implementation of the reconstruction internal heat station...|$|E
30|$|The {{advanced}} {{control system}} seems to provide greater reductions in energy consumption {{than the usual}} balance point control. This is because both the heat pumps and the electric <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> systems are powered with electricity and any time that a heat pump can be operated it will cost less than electric heat. Balance point control switches over to the conventional furnace when the heat pump can no longer provide the full heating. This switch occurs once the outdoor temperature is low enough that the home’s heat loss exceeds the heat pump’s capacity. While this is a simple control strategy to implement, it prevents energy from being saved {{due to the fact}} that the heat pump could still provide for part of the heating demand, while the electric furnace can supply the remainder. Simultaneous operation is possible if the heat pump indoor heat exchanger is installed before the electric furnace coils.|$|E
3000|$|Typical {{control systems}} in homes have one single thermostat. When the indoor {{temperature}} falls below the set point, heat is required and requested. For the conventional heating systems {{this means that}} the electric, natural gas, or oil-fired furnace is asked to supply heat. When a heat pump is added to the system, the call for heating is first put to the heat pump. Within a range of exterior temperatures the heat pump is able to deliver its full heating capacity and needs no additional heat from the conventional furnace. Only when below this temperature range will the heat input to the home fall below full capacity and <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> may be required from the main furnace.

40|$|Parabolic trough {{power plants}} can provide {{reliable}} power by incorporating either {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) or <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> from fossil fuels. This paper describes a gas turbine / parabolic trough hybrid design that combines a solar contribution greater than 50 % with gas heat rates that rival those of natural gas combined-cycle plants. Previous work illustrated benefits of integrating gas turbines with conventional oil heat-transfer-fluid (HTF) troughs running at 390 ?C. This work extends that analysis to examine the integration of gas turbines with salt-HTF troughs running at 450 degrees C and including TES. Using gas turbine waste heat to supplement the TES system provides greater operating flexibility while enhancing the efficiency of gas utilization. The analysis indicates that the hybrid plant design produces solar-derived electricity and gas-derived electricity at lower cost than either system operating alone...|$|R
40|$|While the {{potential}} hazards posed by large particle accelerator driven spallation targets are greatly reduced {{in comparison to}} nuclear reactors capable of similar neutron production levels, they are significant, and require a safety-by-design approach to ensure there is little likelihood of accidental releases of target materials. Most postulated accident scenarios evolve very slowly, given the modest after-heat levels in spallation targets, and modest <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> removal systems can prevent target damage. Similarly, events where problems develop with the accelerated particle beams are easily detected and can be quickly terminated. This leaves an interesting class of postulated accidents, where problems are postulated to develop in the target cooling system {{but there is a}} failure to recognize the problem and shut down the accelerator. Safety systems designed to detect such problems are likely to be reliable, but given {{the potential}} for serious target damage, there is incentive to further reduce the likelihood of this class of events.

Typically, these applications have long operating hours with relatively constant electrical usage. Although design heating and cooling loads vary appreciably with geographical location, all stores have appreciable HVAC loads to support kitchen exhaust. The final report details the data gathering effort on 1, 000 McDonald stores, a 28 city building load simulation, the component selection, system design, and economic analysis. The selected system design was based on McDonald's standard 39 x 89 store and utilizes a 70 kW turbocharged Waukesha engine, 30 -ton Hitachi chiller-heater, and a gas fired power burner for supplemental or <b>backup</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling. Annual savings range from $ 12, 000 to more than $ 50, 000, (based upon operation 19 hour/day, only when heating or cooling loads exist), depending heavily on climate and energy prices. The turnkey cost is projected at $ 127, 700, but may displace up to $ 20, 000 of current rooftop equipment. Reduction in cost and complexity of ancillaries, especially the chiller and related components, must be examined. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{technological}} and economic limits wood-chip based heating systems typically operate as baseload units, leaving peak load and <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> production to fossil fuel boilers. The techno-economic feasibility {{of greenhouse gas}} mitigation with SNG (Synthetic Natural Gas) and FPL (Fast Pyrolysis Liquids or Pyrolysis Oil) wood based biofuels are examined in this study. Both fuels are feasible but SNG does not meet current natural gas quality standards but the matter is more regulatory than technical and FPL would require significant new infrastructure. The cost of SNG production varies from $ 10. 72 to $ 56. 29 per GJ (Gigajoule), depending on technology and wood costs. FPL production costs range from $ 17. 40 to $ 24. 66 per GJ. Emissions mitigation costs range from $ 155 to $ 1052 per tonne CO~'' (carbon dioxide). SNG being most viable due to fewer civil works required at the district heating plant.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The current {{availability}} of online weather forecasts, with increasingly abundant and detailed information, facilitates {{the implementation of}} predictive control strategies in buildings, a measure that can help in reducing energy consumption and peak loads, and in improving comfort. These forecasts are even more useful {{in the case of}} solar-optimized buildings, where the estimation of future conditions (especially solar radiation availability) is essential for planning a sequence of control actions. This paper presents methods to incorporated weather forecasts into the control system of a solar house, focusing on applications for a cold climate. Simulation results employing Simulink (a MATLAB® based tool) are presented for the particular case of a solar house under Montréal weather conditions. It has been found that predictive control, by helping to manage stored thermal energy, becomes essential to enhance the performance of a building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) system. The use of predictive control permits cutting down the utilization of the <b>backup</b> <b>heat</b> source, and the reducing the total electric energy consumption of the heat pump by 23. 4 %.
