5000|$|<b>Bicycle</b> rollers are {{a type of}} <b>bicycle</b> trainer {{that make}} it {{possible}} to ride a <b>bicycle</b> indoors without moving forward. However, unlike other types of <b>bicycle</b> trainers, rollers do not attach to the <b>bicycle</b> frame, and the rider must balance him or herself on the rollers while training. <b>Bicycle</b> rollers normally consist of three cylinders, drums, or [...] "rollers" [...] (two for the rear wheel and one for the front), on top of which the <b>bicycle</b> rides. A belt connects the middle roller to the front roller, causing the front wheel of the <b>bicycle</b> to spin when the <b>bicycle</b> is pedaled. The spacing of <b>bicycle</b> rollers can usually be adjusted to match the <b>bicycle's</b> wheelbase. Generally, the front roller is adjusted to be slightly ahead of the hub of the front wheel.|$|R

40|$|Bicycling {{is known}} to produce {{benefits}} for cities, in regards to reducing levels of congestion, generating positive health outcomes, and providing affordable transportation options to low-income families. Conventional analysis of urban <b>bicycle</b> commuting does not currently consider the importance of separating migrant, or “newcomer,” <b>bicycle</b> commute use from pre-existing resident <b>bicycle</b> commute use. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide additional information on individual, social, and environmental factors that influence newcomer <b>bicycle</b> use for commuting purposes. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2007 - 2011 American Community Survey (5 -year Estimates) to analyze the <b>bicycle</b> commute use of newcomers in the 70 largest U. S. cities. Relationships between newcomer <b>bicycle</b> commute use and socio-demographic, physical environment, and social environment factors were explored. Newcomer <b>bicycle</b> commute use has a strong positive association with pre-existing city-wide levels of <b>bicycle</b> commute use and a weak positive association with city-wide levels of <b>bicycle</b> infrastructure. After controlling for the built environment, cities with very high levels of pre-existing <b>bicycle</b> use are associated with a 690 % higher likelihood of a newcomer’s <b>bicycle</b> commute use when compared to cities with low levels of pre-existing <b>bicycle</b> use. The results suggest that a newcomer’s <b>bicycle</b> use is related to demographics characteristics and pre-existing <b>bicycle</b> use, and that <b>bicycle</b> infrastructure has a relatively negligible influence. The findings may be useful for city planners and policymakers attempting to attract <b>bicycle</b> users to their cities. [URL]...|$|R
