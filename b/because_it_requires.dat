5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This is difficult <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of}} the Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} dead trees from forests may cause {{problems}} locally for this species <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> cavity sites for nesting; declines {{have been noted}} in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest. This nuthatch is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) are all signatories.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|As with König's paradox, {{this paradox}} cannot be formalized in axiomatic set theory <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> {{the ability to}} tell whether a {{description}} applies to a particular set (or, equivalently, to tell whether a formula is actually {{the definition of a}} single set).|$|E
25|$|Rectal biopsy {{is rarely}} {{performed}} {{due to its}} risks of abscess formation, rectal perforation and peritonitis, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> a skilled clinical to perform.

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} no-till and related methods are {{impractical}} and {{too expensive for}} many growers, partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} feature of this case is how it diverges from Powell v. McCormack. In Powell, a grant of discretionary power to Congress was deemed to be justiciable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>required</b> a mere [...] "interpretation" [...] of the Constitution.|$|R

25|$|This method {{works well}} for cubic and quartic equations, but Lagrange {{did not succeed in}} {{applying}} it to a quintic equation, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> solving a resolvent polynomial of degree at least six. This is explained by the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which proves that such polynomials cannot be solved by radicals. Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.|$|E
25|$|Keg beer was {{replacing}} traditional cask ale in {{all parts}} of the UK, primarily <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> less care to handle. Since 1971, CAMRA has conducted a consumer campaign on behalf of those who prefer traditional cask beer. CAMRA has lobbied the British Parliament to ensure support for cask ale and microbreweries have sprung up to serve those consumers who prefer traditional cask beer.|$|E
25|$|From the {{mathematical}} point of view, {{it is possible}} to find conditions required for cooperation of several hypercycles. However, in reality, the cooperation of hypercycles would be extremely difficult, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> the existence of a complicated multi-step biochemical mechanism or an incorporation of more than two types of molecules. Both conditions seem very improbable; therefore, the existence of coupled hypercycles is assumed impossible in practice.|$|E

25|$|Reprocessing can {{potentially}} recover up to 95% {{of the remaining}} uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new mixed oxide fuel. This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> breeder reactors, which are not commercially available.|$|E
25|$|The paleontological {{evidence}} {{consists of}} changes in the geographical distribution of fossils. During a glacial period cold-adapted organisms spread into lower latitudes, and organisms that prefer warmer conditions become extinct or are squeezed into lower latitudes. This evidence is also difficult to interpret <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> (1) sequences of sediments covering a long period of time, over a wide range of latitudes and which are easily correlated; (2) ancient organisms which survive for several million years without change and whose temperature preferences are easily diagnosed; and (3) the finding of the relevant fossils.|$|E
25|$|An {{elevation}} in serum bilirubin {{level of}} more than 2 times ULN with associated transaminase rise is an ominous sign. This indicates severe hepatotoxicity {{and is likely to}} lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped (Hy's Law). This is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or Gilbert syndrome) would not lead to jaundice. Other poor predictors of outcome are old age, female sex, high AST.|$|E

25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> {{breaking}} the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating {{depending on the}} area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use.

25|$|To create {{accurate}} maps, {{latitude and}} longitude must be accurately determined. Navigators {{had been able to}} work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a backstaff or quadrant. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> precise knowledge of the time difference between points {{on the surface of the}} earth. The Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan, {{adultery}} {{is a crime}} {{under the}} Hudood Ordinance, promulgated in 1979. The Ordinance sets a maximum penalty of death. The Ordinance has been particularly controversial <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> a woman making an accusation of rape to provide extremely strong evidence to avoid being charged with adultery herself. A conviction for rape is only possible with evidence from no fewer than four witnesses. In recent years high-profile rape cases in Pakistan have given the Ordinance more exposure than similar laws in other countries. Similar laws exist in some other Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Brunei.|$|E
