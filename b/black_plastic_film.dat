The experiments were carried out at the Western Iowa Experimental Farm, Castana, on Ida Silt loam soil during 1975 and 1976. Soil-water status in the experimental plots was altered by covering the inter-row strips with 4 -mM <b>black</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> and by irrigation in 1976. Relative Growth Rate and Relative Leaf Growth Rate declined with age of the plant because the level of self-shading increased. Net Assimilation Rate and Crop Growth Rate, calculated by using the regression procedure for the uncovered plots, showed a marked increase {{in the latter part}} of the growing season due to a combination of decreasing leaf area and increasing dry weights. Classical methods of analysis fail to show this feature because of the non-linear relationship between leaf area and dry weight. It is proposed that in the future more attention should be paid to the use of the appropriate mathematical function describing the changes of leaf area and dry weight with time.

Little information exists on Tb variation between either fruit species or cultivars of the same species. We therefore aimed to determine the lower base temperature for contrasting genotypes in precocity of peach, plum, grape, pear, and kiwi. Twigs 25 - 35 cm long for the following cultivars: peach, Tropic Beauty (TB) and Eragil (ER); plum, Gulf Blaze (GB) and Letícia (LE); grape, Chardonnay (CH) and Cabernet Sauvignon (CS); pear, Smith (SM) and Packham’s (PA); and kiwi, Golden King (GK) and Hayward (HA) were collected in orchards in Veranópolis, RS Estate, on 06 / 13 / 2014, with 0 h at temperatures ? 7. 2 °C (chilling hours; HC) in the field. Intact twigs packed in <b>black</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> were subjected to 1, 008 HC at 0 °C in incubators to overcome dormancy and then transferred to temperatures of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 °C on single-node cuttings planted in phenolic foam to define effective heat temperature for the genotypes. Over 110 d, budburst of the buds was evaluated in 2 - 3 -d intervals in the green-tip stage. The resulting inverse data of number of days to budburst (1 /days to budburst) was inserted into regression curves to estimate Tb for each genotype. Historical phonological series comprised of 10 years for the analyzed cultivars and meteorological data of the cultivation sites {{were used to determine}} thermal time (degree-days) for the fruit trees during the growing season, considering different phenological phases. Temperate fruit species exhibited different Tb behaviors: Tb was lower for early cultivars (TB and GB = 2. 2 °C; CH = 2. 1 °C; SM = 4. 4 °C; GK = 4. 3 °C) and higher for late cultivars (ER = 6. 3 °C; LE = 6. 2 °C; CS = 4. 3 °C; HA and PA = 8. 2 °C) for all cultures. The Tb f fruit cultivars related directly with genotype chilling requirements: the higher the chilling requirement, the higher the Tb of the cultivar. Cultivars of the same fruit species yielded a sum of degree-days almost equal to finalize the growing season, regardless of the degree of precocity (TB = 1720; ER = 1801; GB = 1680; LE = 1718; CH = 2310; CS = 2369; SM = 2096; PA = 2003 GD; GK = 2775; HA = 2691).

At the University of Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Fayetteville, AR studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of four nitrogen (46 - 0 - 0 urea fertilizer) fertigation rates (0. 75, 0. 50, 0. 25, 0. 0 kg N/day/ha) and red or <b>black</b> colored <b>plastic</b> mulch <b>films</b> on densities of twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), numbers of parasitized cotton aphids, and fruit yield weight. Foliar and petiole nitrogen content were evaluated in nitrogen fertigation trials. In the nitrogen fertigation experiment twospotted spider mites, cotton aphids and parasitized cotton aphids were sampled from the younger and older leaves of strawberry plants. Cowpeas, Vigna unguiculata L. Walp. (Fabales: Fabaceae), were planted and incorporated into the soil to supplement available nitrogen. Nitrogen fertigation treatments did not have the expected effect on foliar or petiole nitrogen levels. Preplanting nitrogen levels due to the cover crop of cowpeas, may have been provided sufficient nitrogen to the strawberry plants {{for the duration of the}} experiment to nullify the effect of the nitrogen treatments. Therefore, any significant differences in strawberry fruit yield, twospotted spider mite, cotton aphid, or parasitized aphid numbers would not be attributable to nitrogen fertigation treatments, and none were found. There were no significant differences among nitrogen fertilization treatments in the numbers of twospotted spider mites on the younger or older leaves except for one sample date, 8 January.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of a light filtering <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> (red to far red ratio modification) on gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides) growth and to investigate the possibility to use this film as a greenhouse cover material for compact gardenia pot plant production in a greenhouse. Experiments were carried out on gardenia cuttings and plants grown under low tunnels covered by a) a light filtering (light modification within the range of 600 to 750 nm) <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> b) a <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> with low radiation transmission or c) a common <b>plastic</b> <b>film.</b> The energy flux entering the low tunnels, within the range of 400 to 1100 nm, and the climate parameters, along with plant growth parameters (shoot length, leaf area, number of lateral shoots, number of nodes, leaf and root dry weight) were measured. Cuttings rooted under the light filtering <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> receiving light with high R/FR and B/R ratio, were found 68 % shorter, and had 21 % and 29 % lower leaf area and dry weight, respectively, compared to cuttings grown under common <b>plastic</b> <b>film.</b> Developed plants grown under the light filtering <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> were found 59 % shorter, produced no lateral shoots, and had lower leaf area, dry weight and node number compared to plants grown under common covering material. So, light filtering <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> with high R/FR and B/R ratio, could be promising for greenhouse covering, as an alternative method to chemical growth regulator use, for compact gardenia pot plant production. The effect on lateral branching though, may become a serious problem to the final compact plant formation. For this reason photoselective <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> with different R/FR and B/R ratios must be tested...|$|R
