50|$|In 1949, Lifson joined Katzir’s {{department}} at the Weizmann Institute, {{while at the same}} time pursuing doctoral studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under Katzir’s guidance. He earned his Ph.D. in 1954, focusing in his thesis on polyelectrolyte solutions. The research he conducted on this topic in the 1950s still serves as a cornerstone for understanding the behavior of charged <b>macromolecules,</b> <b>biological</b> and synthetic, in water solutions. The activity of such <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> <b>as</b> DNA, RNA, enzymes and other proteins is altered by temperature, salinity and other external conditions. Lifson used the methods of statistical mechanics to investigate the structural changes of these molecules in solution.|$|R

40|$|The {{root system}} of {{transgenic}} tobacco plants expressing the enhanced {{green fluorescent protein}} (EGFP) {{under the control of}} the 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter were colonized with the endomycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices. Translocation of EGFP protein from the root to the fungus was registered by light and confocal microscopy. Immunolocalization also showed the presence of EGFP in the mycelium of Glomus intraradices. Carboxyfluorescein feeding experiments on wild-type mycorrhized plants evidenced the transport of fluorescein, a symplasmic tracer, from the plant to the fungus. Our results suggest that endomycorrhiza possess the capacity to exchange functional <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> <b>as</b> evidenced by the transport EGFP from the plant to the fungal symbiont...|$|R
50|$|The Gaussian {{network model}} (GNM) is a {{representation}} of a <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> <b>as</b> an elastic mass-and-spring network to study, understand, and characterize the mechanical aspects of its long-time large-scale dynamics. The model has {{a wide range of}} applications from small proteins such as enzymes composed of a single domain, to large macromolecular assemblies such as a ribosome or a viral capsid. Protein domain dynamics plays key roles in a multitude of molecular recognition and cell signalling processes.Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker domains, induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics.The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains.|$|R
40|$|Large tetragonal hen {{egg white}} {{lysozyme}} single crystals (up to 16 mm 3) {{can be obtained}} by the counter-diffusion method, using high concentration silica gels. The protein crystal lattice is able to incorporate large amounts of silica while still maintaining its short-range crystallographic order. The crystal morphology is controlled by the concentration of the silica gel, which can reduce surface energy anisotropy {{to such an extent that}} spherical single crystals can be obtained as growth forms. The mechanical properties and the stability of the crystals against dehydration are improved by the incorporated hydrophilic silica polymeric network. This makes it possible to record full diffraction data sets with a resolution better than 1. 5 Å from crystals glued to glass fibers. Such reinforcement of the crystals facilitates their handling at ambient conditions and opens new possibilities for the measurement of physical properties of large <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> <b>as</b> well as for their technologica...|$|R
50|$|Toxins can {{be small}} molecules, peptides, or {{proteins}} that {{are capable of}} causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> enzymes or cellular receptors. Toxins vary greatly in their toxicity, ranging from usually minor (such as a bee sting) to almost immediately deadly (such as botulinum toxin).|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{developments}} {{within the}} field of DCC is the use of proteins (or other <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> such <b>as</b> nucleic acids) to influence the evolution and generation of components within a DCL. Protein-directed DCC provides a way to generate, identify and rank novel protein ligands, and therefore have huge potential in the areas of enzyme inhibition and drug discovery.|$|R
50|$|Tandem mass tags (TMT or TMTs) are {{chemical}} labels {{used for}} mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantification and identification of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> proteins, peptides and nucleic acids. TMT {{belongs to a}} family of reagents referred to as isobaric mass tags. They provide an alternative to gel- or antibody-based quantification but may also be used in combination with these and other methods.|$|R
50|$|Although many {{molecular}} simulations involve <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> proteins, DNA, and RNA, {{the parameters}} for given atom types are generally derived from observations on small organic molecules {{that are more}} tractable for experimental studies and quantum calculations. Different force field parameters {{can be derived from}} dissimilar types of experimental data, such as enthalpy of vaporization (OPLS), enthalpy of sublimation, dipole moments, or various spectroscopic parameters.|$|R
50|$|RasMol is a {{computer}} program written for molecular graphics visualization intended and used mainly to depict and explore <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> structures, such <b>as</b> {{those found in the}} Protein Data Bank. It was originally developed by Roger Sayle in the early 1990s.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{free zinc}} levels and imaging of zinc fluxes remains {{technically}} difficult due to low levels {{and the presence}} of interfering cations such as Mg and Ca. We have developed a series of fluorescent zinc indicators based on the superb sensitivity and selectivity of a protein, human apo-carbonic anhydrase II, for Zn(II). These indicators transduce the level of free zinc as changes in intensity, wavelength ratio, lifetime, and/or anisotropy; the latter three approaches permit quantitative imaging of zinc levels in the microscope. A unique attribute of sensors incorporating <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> <b>as</b> transducers is their capability for modification by site-directed mutagenesis. Thus we have produced variants of carbonic anhydrase with improved affinity for zinc, altered selectivity, and enhanced binding kinetics, all of which are difficult to modify in small molecule indicators...|$|R

DELPHI is also implemented into an accessible web-server. DELPHI has also been utilized to build a server that predicts pKa's of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> proteins, RNAs and DNAs which can be accessed via web.|$|R
40|$|In {{the real}} {{cellular}} conditions, the <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> <b>as</b> DNA and proteins, live in {{high concentrations of}} biomolecules, salts and so on. In particular organisms and cellular systems, which have adapted to extreme environmental conditions, accumulate particular organic solutes, known as osmolytes, at moderate to high concentrations to raise the osmotic pressure in the cytoplasm. This molecular crowding affects stability and activity of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> The goal of this work is to study the simultaneouseffect of a natural osmolyte and polyamine on the stability of DNA. Particularly, we report a calorimetric study of the dependence of the thermalstability of a calf-thymus DNA (ct-DNA) on changing the osmolyte concentration {{in the presence of}} a constant concentration of a 1, 5 -diaminopentane, commonly known as cadaverine, which belongs to the class of natural polyamines. The osmolytes utilised were betaine, d-arabitol, l-arabitol and d-sorbitol. The effect on the DNAthermalstability of cadaverine and of each osmolyte separately was also reported for comparison. Our data show that cadaverine does not lose its own ability to protect DNA by the destabilising action of high concentration of osmolyte molecules synthesised in conditions of environmental stress...|$|R
40|$|Every {{action in}} biology is {{performed}} by dynamic proteins that convert between multiple states {{in order to}} engage their functions. Often binding to various ligands {{is essential for the}} rates of desired transitions to be enhanced. The goal of computational biology is to study these transitions and discover the different states to fully understand the protein's normal and diseased function, design drugs to target/bias specific states, and understand all of the interactions in between. We have developed a new methodology that is capable of calculating the absolute free energy of proteins while taking into account all the interactions with the solvent molecules. The efficiency of the new scheme is an order of magnitude greater than any existing technique. This method is now implemented in the massively parallel popular MD program package NAMD. This now makes it possible to calculate the relative stability of different conformational states of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> <b>as</b> well as their binding free energies to various ligands...|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} of contrast variation (or contrast matching) {{relies on the}} differential scatter of hydrogen vs. deuterium. Figure 1 shows the scattering length density for water and various <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> <b>as</b> {{a function of the}} deuterium concentration. (Adapted from.) Biological samples are usually dissolved in water, so their hydrogens are able to exchange with any deuteriums in the solvent. Since the overall scatter of a molecule depends on the scatter of all its components, this will depend on the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium in the molecule. At certain ratios of H2O to D2O, called match points, the scatter from the molecule will equal that of the solvent, and thus be eliminated when the scatter from the buffer is subtracted from the data. For instance the match point for proteins is typically around 40-45% D2O, and at that concentration the scatter from the protein will be indistinguishable from that of the buffer.|$|R
50|$|CHAPS is a {{zwitterionic}} surfactant used in {{the laboratory}} to solubilize <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> proteins. It may be synthesized from cholic acid and is zwitterionic due to its quaternary ammonium and sulfonate groups; it is structurally similar to certain bile acids, such as taurodeoxycholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid. It {{is used as a}} non-denaturing solvent in the process of protein purification and is especially useful in purifying membrane proteins, which are often sparingly soluble or insoluble in aqueous solution due to their native hydrophobicity.|$|R
50|$|SAXS and USAXS {{belong to}} a family of X-ray {{scattering}} techniques {{that are used in}} the characterization of materials. In the case of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> proteins, the advantage of SAXS over crystallography is that a crystalline sample is not needed. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods encounter problems with macromolecules of higher molecular mass (> 30-40 kDa). However, owing to the random orientation of dissolved or partially ordered molecules, the spatial averaging leads to a loss of information in SAXS compared to crystallography.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Subgraph {{isomorphism}} {{and maximum}} common subgraph isomorphism algorithms from graph theory provide {{an effective and}} an efficient way of identifying structural relationships between <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> They thus provide a natural complement to the pattern matching algorithms {{that are used in}} bioinformatics to identify sequence relationships. Examples are provided of the use of graph theory to analyse proteins for which three-dimensional crystallographic or NMR structures are available, focusing {{on the use of the}} Bron-Kerbosch clique detection algorithm to identify common folding motifs and of the Ullmann subgraph isomorphism algorithm to identify patterns of amino acid residues. Our methods are also applicable to other types of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule,</b> such <b>as</b> carbohydrate and nucleic acid structure...|$|R

50|$|Structural {{bioinformatics}} is {{the branch}} of bioinformatics which {{is related to the}} analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> such <b>as</b> proteins, RNA, and DNA. It deals with generalizations about macromolecular 3D structure such as comparisons of overall folds and local motifs, principles of molecular folding, evolution, and binding interactions, and structure/function relationships, working both from experimentally solved structures and from computational models. The term structural has the same meaning as in structural biology, and structural bioinformatics {{can be seen as a}} part of computational structural biology.|$|R
5000|$|SCP-ISM, or Screened Coulomb Potentials Implicit Solvent Model is a {{continuum}} approximation of solvent effects {{for use in}} computer simulations of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> such <b>as</b> proteins and nucleic acids, usually {{within the framework of}} molecular dynamics. It is based on the classic theory of polar liquids, as developed by Peter Debye and corrected by Lars Onsager to incorporate reaction field effects. The model can be combined with quantum chemical calculations to formally derive {{a continuum}} model of solvent effects suitable for computer simulations of small and large molecular systems.|$|R
5000|$|The Anisotropic Network Model was {{introduced}} in 2000 (Atilgan et al., 2001; Doruker et al., 2000), inspired by the pioneering work of Tirion (1996), succeeded {{by the development of}} the Gaussian network model (GNM) (Bahar et al., 1997; Haliloglu et al., 1997), and by the work of Hinsen (1998) who first demonstrated the validity of performing EN NMA at residue level. It represents the <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> <b>as</b> an elastic mass-and-spring network, to explain the internal motions of a protein subject to a harmonic potential. In the network each node is the Cα atom of the residue and the springs represent the interactions between the nodes. The overall potential is the sum of harmonic potentials between interacting nodes. To describe the internal motions of the spring connecting the two atoms, there is only one degree of freedom. Qualitatively, this corresponds to the compression and expansion of the spring in a direction given by the locations of the two atoms. In other words, ANM is an extension of the Gaussian Network Model to three coordinates per atom, thus accounting for directionality.|$|R
40|$|Characterization and {{differentiation}} of isomers in <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> using mass spectrometry {{is one of}} the most significant challenges facing scientists in the field. The capability of high-resolution MS instruments along with the development of new fragmentation methods now provides the ability to indirectly differentiate between some isomers. This ability has enabled mass spectrometry to evolve into a multidisciplinary technique incorporating areas such as pharmaceutical research, proteomics, polymer science, medicine, environmental chemistry, and recently archeology.

Through a process of discovery that involved extensive theoretical and literature based analysis coupled with laboratory validation and extension of current dielectrophoresis knowledge, it was concluded that DNA studied in this research exhibited both negative and positive dielectrophoresis depending upon the frequency of the applied electric field. Such knowledge may lead to the application of dielectrophoresis separation techniques for DNA. &KC qWOJT...|$|R

The forces of penetration and the free energies of rupture of lipid bilayers during nanotube penetration were studied using nonequilibrium, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for pure POPC and POPC/cholesterol bilayers. The presence of cholesterol did not alter the magnitude of the rupture force and minimally increased the estimated free energy of rupture. However, the ability of the nanotube to disrupt the membrane leading to membrane poration increased with increasing cholesterol content...|$|R
40|$|The temperature-pressure {{behavior}} of proteins {{seems to be}} unique among the <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Thermodynamic <b>as</b> well as kinetic data show the typical elliptical stability diagram. This may be extended by assuming that the unfolded state gives rise to volume and enthalpy-driven liquid-liquid transitions. A molecular interpretation follows from the temperature and the pressure dependence of the hydration and cavities. We suggest that positron annihilation spectroscopy can provide additional quantitative evidence for the contributions of cavities to the dynamics of proteins. Only mature amyloid fibrils that form from unfolded proteins are very resistant to pressure treatment. status: publishe...|$|R
