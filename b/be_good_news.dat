25|$|Rising {{demand for}} {{biofuels}} {{is expected to}} <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the biotechnology sector, with the Department of Energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm productivity, biotechnology {{plays a crucial role}} in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the promise}} of {{competitive}} markets to lower consumer prices, for the most part, has yet to materialize. Data from the United States, for example, indicates that while Pennsylvania and Connecticut have fairly stable residential prices since restructuring, most other states have witnessed price increases after the year 2000. While this may <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> in terms of conservation and demand-side management (C) objectives, it has made competitive markets unpopular among consumers and politically troublesome. For example, as consumer prices rose during Ontario's experiment with deregulation, Premier Ernie Eves, under surmounting political pressure, intervened into the market by freezing retail prices in November 2002.|$|E
500|$|Asda {{paid the}} bill within hours, {{and claimed that}} Bloomsbury would be in breach of {{contract}} {{if it did not}} allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda's orders was still in place as, [...] "Unfortunately, we've now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they'll have to come and make peace with us... It could <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for all their disappointed customers, because they don't {{have to go to a}} soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of Harry Potter at an independent or specialist bookstore instead." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Every morning <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> {{every child}} that <b>is</b> born <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> every just man <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> every singer <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> because every singer is one less soldier." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nod {{came back}} and told this news to Thumb, who was sitting with a great strip of his jacket bound round {{his head like a}} Turk's turban. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> brother," [...] he said--"it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> What stories we shall have to tell when we are old!" ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> and a gospel. The Bible {{was written}} to bring <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> and {{therefore}} with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> it begins, and with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> it ends.|$|R
500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's just {{as likely}} to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> he is running for as bad," [...] said the Story Girl, who was no believer in meeting trouble half way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for you, I think,' {{answered}} Demi, {{smiling as}} he threw away his paper {{and went to}} sit {{beside her on the}} little sofa which just held two.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{panelist}} {{is given}} a current topic, and must argue whether the topic <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> or bad news. Usually, the panelist must argue the opposite; for example, [...] "Why <b>is</b> it <b>good</b> <b>news</b> that British students' test scores are going down?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{miss your}} husband in our meetings," [...] said Mr. Sewell; [...] "it will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> {{for us all}} when he comes home; {{he is one of}} those I depend on to help me preach." ...|$|E
60|$|The exile's letters {{said very}} little about his health, which {{in the sense of}} no news his mother held to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> but they were full {{concerning}} the monuments and the ethnological interest of life in Egypt.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} do, Colonel Quaritch, {{if you had}} killed {{the only thing you}} loved in the whole world?" [...] she asked dreamily. [...] "Oh, what am I saying?--I am off my head. Leave me--go and tell Ida; it will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Ida." ...|$|E
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> {{and on the}} {{strength}} of it Carl ordered some dessert, which cost him five cents additional.|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>were</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> indeed," [...] {{the king}} said; [...] "but it can scarce be possible, seeing {{that we have}} no men-at-arms in the neighbourhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Of course. No <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> I’ll wager my new touring-car {{that our}} Jane is sound asleep and dreaming of the angels, this very minute.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a {{very good}} fellow," [...] said Arthur: [...] "but I confess it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for me, if he got his Commission, and his Marching Orders, all at once! I wish him all happiness--with one exception. Good night!" [...] (We had reached home by this time.) [...] "I'm not good company to-night-- better be alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. That is {{the very}} thing that we mus'n't do. For {{anything}} we know, there may be natives about; and some of us might get stuck full of their arrows before we could get out of range. This will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> {{and there will be no}} longer any need for your being kept on short allowance of water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That can I. Times are dull at present. After '15 Paris swarmed with Scotsmen who {{had fled}} to save their heads; but of late years but few have come over, and the Scotch regiments have {{difficulty}} in keeping up their numbers. Since the last of them marched for the frontier I have been looking after empty benches, and it will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for me when I hear {{that the war is}} over and they are on their way back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> and bad," [...] said Asmund, [...] "since Ospakar {{will ask}} a great weregild[*] for these men, and thou wilt be outlawed, Eric." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> indeed,' I said. 'If it does {{but come}} on to snow to-night we may carry our scalps back to the {{settlement}} yet.' ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> {{so far as}} it went, and I {{asked again}} if Thomas Halstead had also been spared, since he, too, was an Englishman.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis a {{long time}} since we have seen you, monsieur," [...] the queen said graciously, [...] "but we have heard of you from the marshal's despatches, and were glad to see that your {{regiment}} bore itself as well in the field of battle as in the park of Versailles. What news do you bring? Nothing of importance, I hope, for there can hardly <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> when the marshal has so scanty a force with which to guard the frontier." ...|$|E
60|$|Finished my Turnpike {{business}} {{by getting the}} exceptionable clauses omitted, which would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to Darnick. Put all the Mirror in proof and corrected it. This is the contribution (part of it) to Mr. Reynolds' and Heath's Keepsake. We dined at Richardson's with the two chief Barons of England[177] and Scotland.[178] Odd enough, the one being a Scotsman and the other an Englishman. Far the pleasantest day we have had; I suppose I am partial, but I think the lawyers beat the bishops, and the bishops beat the wits.|$|E
6000|$|You may {{say this}} is bad news. I {{do not believe it}} is. I believe it is good news, and the very best of news: but if it is bad news, I cannot help it. I did not make it so. God made it so. And God must know best. [...] God is love. And we are His children, and He loves us. And {{therefore}} His ways with us must be good and loving ways, and any news about them must <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> and a gospel, though we cannot see it so at first.|$|E

5000|$|... Per Stig Møller, Foreign Minister of Denmark, {{stated that}} [...] "the Serb voters {{are to be}} congratulated for this {{election}} result, which <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Serbia's European prospects, but also likely <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the EU and all of Europe".|$|R

60|$|My amiable Miss Green, I beg {{you to give}} me news of your health, and if it may <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> And {{when you}} shall have seen Lloyd, {{to tell me how}} his reports of the South Seas and our new {{circumstances}} strike such an awfully old person as yourself, and to tell me if you ever received a letter I sent you from Hawaii. I remember thinking--or remember remembering rather--it was (for me) quite a long respectable communication. Also, you might tell me if you got my war-whoop and scalping-knife assault on le nommé Hyde.|$|E
60|$|You {{say nothing}} of yourself, which I shall take to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Archer's note has gone. He is, in truth, a very clever fellow that Archer, and I believe a good one. It is a {{pleasant}} thing {{to see a man}} who can use a pen; he can: really says what he means, and says it with a manner; comes into print like one at his ease, not shame-faced and wrong-foot-foremost like the bulk of us. Well, here is luck, and here are the kindest recollections from the canary-bird and from King Lear, from the Tragic Woman and the Flimsy Man.|$|E
6000|$|... "This will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Mr. Playmore," [...] he said. [...] "Our {{excellent}} friend, the lawyer, is sorely {{afraid that}} our discoveries may compromise your position with your husband. On the one hand, he is naturally anxious to spare Mr. Eustace the distress which he must certainly feel, if he read his first wife's confession. On the other hand, it is impossible, in justice (as Mr. Playmore puts it) to the unborn children of your marriage, to suppress a document which vindicates {{the memory of}} their father from the aspersion that the Scotch Verdict might otherwise cast on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> We <b>are</b> hauling off the danger, {{whatever}} it may be," [...] he said, as he felt the mark: [...] "and now for the compass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Willoughby!" [...] cried Sir John; [...] "what, is HE in the country? That <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> however; I {{will ride}} over tomorrow, {{and ask him}} to dinner on Thursday." ...|$|R
