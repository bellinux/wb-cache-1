50|$|The {{peninsula}} changed rapidly {{during the}} 1800s {{and became one}} of the premier industrial centres of Sydney. Industries clustered around Mort Bay included shipbuilding, a metal foundry, engineering, <b>boilermaking</b> and the Mort's Dock and Engineering Company works which opened in 1855—in 1958 Mort's Dock closed and is the site of Mort Bay Park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boilermaking,</b> welding, {{and fitting}} tubes {{can be a}} {{full-time}} year round project at power plants, since stress fractures, leaks, and rust and corrosion cause a continual need for repair or replacement, and power plants often operate at very high steam pressures. Other boilermakers might work seasonally or on an individual project such as re-fitting a boiler in a seagoing vessel, or in the one-time remodeling of a steam plant.|$|E
50|$|Filler alloys {{have a lower}} {{melting point}} than the base metal, so that the joint may be made by {{bringing}} the whole assembly up to temperature without everything melting as one. Complex joints, typically for jewellery or live steam <b>boilermaking</b> may be made in stages, with filler metals of progressively lower melting points used in turn. Early joints are thus not destroyed by heating to the later temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Fairbairn {{was born}} in the Polygon in Ardwick, near the centre of Manchester. He was the third of eight {{surviving}} children of Sir William Fairbairn (1789-1874). His father was a Scottish engineer who moved to Manchester in the early 19th century, where he designed bridges, and established a business, William Fairbairn & Sons, that was involved in iron founding, <b>boilermaking,</b> ship building, and manufacturing steam locomotives. He was a nephew of Peter Fairbairn of Leeds - also an engineer like his brother - and first cousin of MP Andrew Fairbairn.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>boilermaking</b> company Babcock & Wilcox, {{established}} in 1866, {{set up their}} first overseas operation in London in 1881. In 1891 the American shareholders sold {{the majority of their}} interest in the UK operations to the public. The parent company retained control over their intellectual property in the United States and Cuba. The new independent British company, Babcock & Wilcox Limited, assumed control over the Babcock & Wilcox patents and licenses {{in the rest of the}} world. It had already established itself in Western Europe, Australia and the Middle East.|$|E
5000|$|In 1895, Babcock & Wilcox Ltd {{opened a}} new <b>boilermaking</b> works, based on the 33 acre site of the Porterfield Forge on the {{opposite}} side of the River Clyde near Renfrew. The Renfrew Works grew to over 200 acre by the 1960s. The workload expanded as a result of the two world wars and the supply of defence equipment became another major business area. During the 1940s, the workforce at Renfrew peaked at approximately 10,000. In the 1960s, the company became involved in the development of the nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom.|$|E

The company has been continuously profitable and always paid dividends until (at least) 1939. Jurenka led Deutsch Babcock {{until his death in}} 1942. He was responsible for a company culture that was unusual for its time.

50|$|Deutsche Babcock AG (full name: Deutsche Babcock & Wilcox Dampfkessel Werke Aktien-Gesellschaft) was a German {{manufacturing}} {{company based in}} Oberhausen in the Ruhr District, {{the center of the}} German economy. The company was established in 1898 as a German subsidiary of the British <b>boilermaking</b> company Babcock & Wilcox, Limited. In the beginning of the 20th century and the interwar period Deutsche Babcock expanded its business across the German Empire and the countries of Eastern Europe and, to a lesser extent, Scandinavian countries. Financial success and military conflicts between Germany and the United Kingdom led to de facto independence of Deutsche Babcock from its British parent, although the British owned the controlling interest in Deutsche Babcock until 1975.|$|E
50|$|Jenkinson junior {{was born}} in Dunedin in 1858 and appears on the Presbyterian baptism roll of that year. He was educated at various schools in the Otago region, and {{completed}} his studies under J. B. Park, of the South School, Dunedin. On leaving school in 1875, he was employed by Sparrow and Co., at the Dunedin Foundry, and served an apprenticeship of five years to <b>boilermaking</b> and iron shipbuilding. Jenkinson occupied rooms {{on the third floor}} of a building in The Octagon, Dunedin where a fire on 8 September 1879 killed thirteen people, and after narrowly escaping through the staircase, he returned upstairs with his room mate, where they found a woman and brought her out.|$|E
50|$|Storey {{was born}} at or near Huskisson, New South Wales, Australia to English {{immigrant}} parents, William John, a shipbuilder, and Elizabeth Graham. His family moved to Balmain when he was six, but his father died soon afterwards. He was educated at Darling Road Superior Public School and at night school. At fourteen he was apprenticed to <b>boilermaking</b> with Perdriau and West and then worked at Mort's Dock. He helped found the Balmain Cricket Club in 1897 and was a leading all-rounder for its top grade team. He {{was a member of}} the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron Ship Builders of New South Wales. In 1908 Storey was a founder of the Balmain District Rugby League Football Club.|$|E
5000|$|James Vincent [...] "Vince" [...] Hayes (born 24 March 1879), {{also known}} as Vic Hayes, was an English footballer who {{primarily}} played as a full-back. Born in Miles Platting, Manchester, he was trained in <b>boilermaking</b> in his early years. He made his debut for Newton Heath in February 1901. At Newton Heath, which was renamed Manchester United in 1902, he suffered several injuries. He broke both legs in 1905, and shortly after recovering, broke one again. He left United for Brentford in May 1907, but returned to United in June 1908. He helped the club win the FA Cup in 1909. He left United in November 1910 after scoring two goals in 128 appearances in his two spells at the club.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Trevithick {{had already}} used a return flue {{with his first}} 1802 Pen-y-darren engine and 1803 Coalbrookdale {{locomotive}} design. These boilers were heavily built of cast iron, short and flat-ended. His 1805 [...] "Newcastle" [...] locomotive (actually built in Gateshead) began to show one characteristic feature of the return-flued boiler, a prominent dome shape to resist steam pressure in the solid end opposite both furnace and chimney. In this case, the <b>boilermaking,</b> now of wrought iron plates, must have been complicated by Trevithick's single long-travel horizontal cylinder (9 x 36 in diameter×stroke) which emerged through this domed end. This did make work easier for the fireman though, as {{he was no longer}} trying to reach a firedoor beneath the long crosshead of the piston.|$|E
5000|$|For {{much of the}} Victorian [...] "age of steam", {{the only}} {{material}} used for <b>boilermaking</b> was the highest grade of wrought iron, with assembly by rivetting. This iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks, such as at Cleator Moor (UK), noted for the high quality of their rolled plate and its suitability for high-reliability use in critical applications, such as high-pressure boilers. In the 20th century, design practice instead moved towards the use of steel, which is stronger and cheaper, with welded construction, which is quicker and requires less labour. It should be noted, however, that wrought iron boilers corrode far slower than their modern-day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion. This makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to those of welded steel boilers.|$|E
50|$|After {{returning}} to New Zealand in 1884, Jenkinson {{turned his attention}} to farming, and later on to gold digging. Subsequently, he went to Wellington, where he engaged in his trade, and assisted to form the first Wellington Boilermakers' Union. On {{returning to}} his old employers in Dunedin he was re-elected president of the Dunedin Boilermakers' Union, and assisted in forming the Trades Council. In 1886, he accepted employment in the Addington Railway Workshops, but left in the following year as a protest against the system of piecework, which was shortly afterwards abolished. Jenkinson returned to the Addington Workshops in 1888, and took an active part {{in the formation of the}} Christchurch Boilermakers' Union, of which he was secretary for several years, and afterwards president and also treasurer. He advocated and inaugurated scientific lectures under the auspices of the Union, and was successful in having the study of <b>boilermaking</b> promoted in the Canterbury School of Engineering. Jenkinson assisted in forming the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, and was a delegate from the Canterbury branch, at the first conference. He was one of the founders of the Canterbury Trades Council, and was successively its vice-president, president, and treasurer. Jenkinson helped to form the first Labour Day Demonstration Committee, of which he was treasurer for many years and a trustee. He was the first president of the Kingsley Club, which was formed for social unity, and he is president and honorary life member of the Tailoresses' Union.|$|E

40|$|Labour commodification is a {{core process}} in {{building}} capitalist society. Nonetheless, it is given remarkably little attention in labour and social historiography, because {{assumptions about the}} process have obscured its historical character. Abandoning these assumptions, a close study of labour commodification in the <b>boilermaking</b> trades of late colonial New South Wales (Australia) illustrates the historical character of the process. In these trades, labour commodification was deeply contested at the most intimate level of class relations between workers and employers. This contest principally {{took the form of}} a struggle over the scheme of occupational classification used as the basis of pay rates. It was a highly protracted struggle, because workers developed strategies that kept the employers 2 ̆ 7 efforts at bay for four decades. Employer efforts to intensify the commodity character of boilermakers 2 ̆ 7 labour were largely ineffective, until they were given great assistance {{in the early twentieth century}} by the state arbitration system...|$|E
