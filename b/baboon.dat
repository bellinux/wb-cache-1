5|$|The species inhabits a {{strip of}} 25 {{equatorial}} African countries, very nearly ranging from the east to west coasts of the continent. The exact boundaries of this strip are not clearly defined, as the species' territory overlaps with that of other <b>baboon</b> species. In many places, this has resulted in cross-breeding between species. For example, considerable hybridization has occurred between the olive <b>baboon</b> and the hamadryas <b>baboon</b> in Ethiopia. Cross-breeding with the yellow <b>baboon</b> and the Guinea <b>baboon</b> has also been observed. Although this has been noted, the hybrids have not as yet been well studied.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive <b>baboon</b> is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive <b>baboon</b> in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The <b>baboon</b> forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive <b>baboon</b> searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its wide}} range, the olive <b>baboon</b> {{can be found}} in a number of {{different}} habitats. It is usually classified as savanna-dwelling, living in the wide plains of the grasslands. The grasslands, especially those near open woodland, do make up a large part of its habitat, but the <b>baboon</b> also inhabits rainforests and deserts. Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, both support olive <b>baboon</b> populations in dense tropical forests.|$|E
40|$|Trichuris trichiura is {{a common}} {{intestinal}} nematode parasite of captive <b>baboons.</b> We evaluated the efficacy of fenbendazole formulated in a commercial primate diet (FBZ-PD) for treating specific pathogen-free (SPF) <b>baboons</b> (Papio cynocephalus anubis) naturally infected with Trichuris trichiura. Twenty-nine <b>baboons,</b> housed indoors in 3 separate rooms, were fed FBZ-PD for 5 d, whereas 4 <b>baboons</b> housed in another isolated area served as untreated controls. The efficacy of FBZ-PD was measured as {{reduction in the number}} of T. trichiura eggs in host feces after treatment as determined by quantitative fecal flotation examination. All <b>baboons</b> that received FBZ-PD stopped shedding T. trichiura eggs by 7 d after initiation of treatment, and remained negative until at least 119 d after treatment. However, eggs of T. trichiura were present in the feces of 3 (10. 3 %) experimental <b>baboons</b> at 154 d after treatment. Untreated control <b>baboons</b> shed T. trichiura eggs throughout the entire study. Our results indicate that FBZ-PD was efficacious for treating SPF <b>baboons</b> infected with T. trichiura...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn multi-male, multi-female {{groups of}} mammals, males usually compete aggressively over access to females. However, species vary in the {{intensity}} of male contest competition, which {{has been linked to}} differences in testosterone and glucocorticoid profiles. Chacma (Papio ursinus) and Guinea (P. papio) <b>baboons</b> constitute an intriguing model to examine variation in male competition and male endocrine correlates, because of the differences in their social systems. Chacma <b>baboons</b> live in stable female-bonded groups with linear male dominance hierarchies and a high male mating skew, whereas Guinea <b>baboons</b> live in male-bonded, multi-level societies. We recorded male behavior and assayed testosterone (fT) and glucocorticoid metabolite (fGC) levels from fecal samples in one population of each species. Male chacma <b>baboons</b> were more frequently involved in agonistic interactions, and dominance relationships were more consistent than in Guinea <b>baboons,</b> where we could not detect linear hierarchies. Notably, male chacma <b>baboons</b> were also more aggressive towards females, indicating an overall higher aggressiveness in this species. In contrast, male Guinea <b>baboons</b> showed higher levels of affiliative interactions and spatial tolerance. High-ranking and consorting male chacma <b>baboons</b> showed elevated fGC levels and also tended to show elevated fT levels, but there was no effect of consortship in Guinea <b>baboons.</b> Agonism was not related to hormone levels in either species. Thus, predictors of fT and fGC levels in Guinea <b>baboons</b> seem to differ from chacma <b>baboons.</b> Our results support the view that different social systems create differential selection pressures for male aggression, reflected by different hormone profiles...|$|R
5|$|The olive <b>baboon</b> (Papio anubis), {{also called}} the Anubis <b>baboon,</b> {{is a member of}} the family Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys). The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons, being found in 25 {{countries}} throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara. It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat color, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.|$|E
5|$|The olive <b>baboon</b> {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the <b>baboon.</b> At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|The olive <b>baboon</b> {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each <b>baboon</b> has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives form their own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
40|$|Simian T-cell leukemia viruses (STLVs) are the simian {{counterparts}} {{of human}} T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLVs). A novel, divergent type of STLV (STLV-L) from captive <b>baboons</b> {{was reported in}} 1994, but its natural prevalence remained unclear. We investigated the prevalence of STLV-L in 519 blood samples from wild-living nonhuman primates in Ethiopia. Seropositive monkeys having cross-reactive antibodies against HTLV were found among 22 out of 40 hamadryas <b>baboons,</b> 8 of 96 anubis <b>baboons,</b> 24 of 50 <b>baboons</b> that are hybrids between hamadryas and anubis <b>baboons,</b> and 41 of 177 grivet monkeys, but not in 156 gelada <b>baboons.</b> A Western blotting assay showed that sera obtained from seropositive hamadryas and hybrid <b>baboons</b> exhibited STLV-L-like reactivity. A PCR assay successfully amplified STLV sequences, which were subsequently sequenced and confirmed as being closely related to STLV-L. Surprisingly, further PCR showed that {{nearly half of the}} hamadryas (20 out of 40) and hybrid (19 out of 50) <b>baboons</b> had STLV-L DNA sequences. In contrast, most of the seropositive anubis <b>baboons</b> and grivet monkeys carried typical STLV- 1 but not STLV-L. These observations demonstrate that STLV-L naturally prevails among hamadryas and hybrid <b>baboons</b> at significantly high rates. STLV- 1 and - 2, the close relative of STLV-L, are believed to have jumped across simian-human barriers, which resulted in widespread infection of HTLV- 1 and - 2. Further studies are required to know if STLV-L is spreading into human populations...|$|R

50|$|Socially, <b>baboons</b> live in harems, {{with one}} {{dominant}} male and one subordinate male with several females and juveniles. These groups are usually small, but join with larger groups {{to form a}} troop; these groups sleep or forage together. The Guinean troops are large multiple-male, multiple-female troops with 50-300 <b>baboons.</b> The harems consist of two to five females which mate with the dominant male. <b>Baboons</b> are not very good climbers, so they spend {{the majority of their}} time foraging on the ground. Guinean <b>baboons</b> forage along the ground during the day, but almost always climb trees or cliffs when sleeping. Guinea <b>baboons</b> run along the ground in a quadrupedal pattern.|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{juvenile}} <b>baboons</b> are less efficient foragers than adult <b>baboons</b> owing to their small size, {{lower level of}} knowledge and skill, and/or lesser ability to maintain access to resources. We predict that as re-sources {{are more difficult to}} extract, juvenile <b>baboons</b> will demonstrate lower efficiency than adults will because of their lower levels of experi-ence. In addition, we hypothesize that juvenile <b>baboons</b> {{will be more likely to}} allocate foraging time to easier-to-extract resources owing to their greater efficiency in acquiring those resources. We use feeding efficiency and time allocation data collected on a wild, free-ranging, non-provisioned population of chacma <b>baboons</b> (Papio hamadryas ursinus) in the Moremi Wildlife Reserve, Okavango Delta, Botswana to test these hypotheses. The major findings of this study are: 1. Juvenile <b>baboons</b> are significantly less efficient foragers than adult <b>baboons</b> primarily for difficult-to-extract resources. We propose that this age-dependent variation in efficiency is due to dif-ferences in memory and other cognitive functions related to locating food resources, as is indicated by the greater amount of time juvenile <b>baboons</b> spend searching for food. There is no evidence that smaller body size or competitive disruption influences the differences in return rates found be-tween adult and juvenile <b>baboons</b> in this study. 2. An individual baboon’s feeding efficiency for a given resource can be used to predict the duration of its foraging bouts for that resource...|$|R

Previous research has considered transposed letter effects as strong evidence for orthographic processing (Grainger, 2008). <b>Baboons</b> were asked to classify strings of letters as either words or non-words by selecting certain shapes (for example, a circle for a word and a square for a non-word). The <b>baboons</b> were shown words they had previously learned and non-words. The non-words were created by using four-letter words, previously learned by the <b>baboons,</b> and either transposing the two middle letters or replacing the two middle letters with different letters (double substitute non-words). <b>Baboons</b> classified TL non-words as words significantly more often than double substitute non-words.|$|R

5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. The olive <b>baboon</b> eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and rhizomes.

In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.|$|E

40|$|<b>Baboons</b> are dietary generalists, {{consuming}} a {{wide range}} of food items in varying proportions. It is thus difficult to quantify and explain the dietary behavior of these primates. We present stable carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopic data, and percentage nitrogen (%N), of feces from chacma <b>baboons</b> (Papio ursinus) living in two savanna environments of South Africa: the mountainous Waterberg region and the low-lying Kruger National Park. <b>Baboons</b> living in the more homogeneous landscapes of the Waterberg consume a more isotopically heterogeneous diet than their counterparts living in Kruger Park. Grasses and other C 4 -based foods comprise between 10 – 20 % (on average) of the bulk diet of Kruger Park <b>baboons.</b> Carbon isotopic data from the Waterberg suggest diets of 30 – 50 % grass, which is higher than generally reported for <b>baboons</b> across the African savanna. Based on observations of succulent feeding, we propose that <b>baboons</b> in the Waterberg consume a mix of C 4 grasses and CAM-photosynthesizing succulents in combined proportions varying between 5 – 75 % (average, 35 %). Fecal d 15 N of <b>baboons</b> is lower than that of sympatric ungulates, which may be due to a combination of low levels of faunivory, foraging on subterranean plant parts, or the use of human foods in the case of Kruger Park populations. Fecal N levels in <b>baboons</b> are consistently higher than those of sympatric ungulate herbivores, indicating that <b>baboons</b> consume a greater proportion of protein-rich foods than do other savanna mammals. These data suggest that chacma <b>baboons</b> adapt their dietary behavior so as to maximize protein intake, regardless of their environment...|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and <b>baboon</b> spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
