50|$|After {{an attempt}} to defuse one bomb by {{remote-controlled}} robot fails, setting it off and damaging the ship, Fallon decides to split up his team with each man working simultaneously {{on each of the}} remaining devices at different points around the ship, Fallon going first with each stage of the defusing operation and informing his men of each move <b>by</b> <b>radio</b> <b>link,</b> with the aim that if he fails and his bomb explodes, his men will know what went wrong and continue the process onwards, with his second in command taking up the lead, until the devices are disarmed. However, if two more bombs go off, the ship will sink. Fallon proceeds to disarm the bomb he is working on, apparently successfully, with his men following each step. However, it contains a hidden secondary mechanism and one of his men, close friend Charlie Braddock (David Hemmings), accidentally triggers it, resulting in his death when it explodes, causing further damage to the ship. A disillusioned Fallon at this point abandons the operation and advises the ship's captain, Alex Brunel (Omar Sharif), to advise the shipping line to pay the ransom to avoid any more carnage, but when negotiations with Juggernaut break down at the last minute, Fallon is ordered by the captain to continue disarming the remaining bombs.|$|E

Channel aware technology and service flow priority {{are used in the}} proposed scheme to achieve the highest performance index. A series of simulation is conducted under the scenarios of constant-bit-rate (CBR) voice traffic, variable-bit-rate (VBR) video traffic, and VBR data traffic.

40|$|Mobile Ad Hoc Network {{is a type}} of {{wireless}} network without a fixed topology consist a set of self organized nodes which are randomly, frequently and unpredictably mobile. In MANETs packet transmission is affected <b>by</b> <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> fluctuations. Hop count is a simple routing metric that calculate the distance between a source and destination on the number of routers in the path. Routing protocols for ad hoc networks have less channel fading. The minimum hop count is not enough for a routing protocol to achieve a good performance. MANET is an open environment and it is susceptible to many security attacks due to dynamic topology and lack of centralized monitoring authority. Anonymous routing protocols conceal the identities about the route, source and destination to provide security and privacy from intruder’s attacks. So in this paper, channel adaptive protocol with improved node security, extensions to a multipath routing protocol to accommodate channel fading and node security is introduced. The resulting protocol is referred to as Channel Adaptive routing protocol with node security (CARNS). Using channel state information (CSI), a pre-emptive handoff strategy is applied to maintain reliable and stable connections. Paths are reusable, rather than simply regarding them as useless. In this paper we provide performance analysis of CARNS, as well as comparison between CARNS with AODV and AOMDV.

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} sonar (SAS) {{technology has}} rapidly progressed {{over the past}} few years with a number of commercial systems emerging. Such systems are typically based on an autonomous underwater vehicle platform containing multiple along-track receivers and an integrated inertial navigation system (INS) with Doppler velocity log aiding. While producing excellent images, blurring due to INS integration errors and medium fluctuations continues to limit long range, long run, image quality. This is particularly relevant in mine hunting, the main application for SAS, where it is critical to survey the greatest possible area in the shortest possible time, regardless of sea conditions. This thesis presents the simulation, design, construction, and sea trial results for a prototype "active beacon" and remote controller unit, to investigate the potential of such a device for estimating SAS platform motion and medium fluctuations. The beacon is deployed by hand in the area of interest and acts as an active point source with real-time data uploading and control performed <b>by</b> <b>radio</b> <b>link.</b> Operation is tightly integrated with the operation of the Acoustics Research Group KiwiSAS towed SAS, producing one-way and two-way time of flight (TOF) data for every ping by detecting the sonar chirps, time-stamping their arrival using a GPS receiver, and replying back at a different acoustic frequency after a fixed time delay. The high SNR of this reply signal, combined with the knowledge that it is produced by a single point source, provides advantages over passive point-like targets for SAS image processing. Stationary accuracies of < 2 mm RMS have been measured at ranges of up to 36 m. This high accuracy allowed the beacon to be used in a separate study to characterise the medium fluctuation statistics in Lyttelton Harbour, New Zealand, using an indoor dive pool as a control. Probability density functions were fitted to the data then incorporated in SAS simulations to observe their effect on image quality. Results from recent sea trials in Lyttelton Harbour show the beacon TOF data, when used in a narrowband motion compensation (MOCOMP) process, provided improvements to the quality of SAS images centred on frequencies of 30 kHz and 100 kHz. This prototype uses simple matched-filtering algorithms for detection and while performing well under stationary conditions, the fluctuations caused by the narrow sonar transmit beam pattern (BP) and changing superposition of seabed multipath often cause dropouts and inaccurate detections during sea trials. An analysis of the BP effects and how the accuracy and robustness of the detection algorithms can be improved is presented. Overcoming these problems reliably is difficult without dedicated large scale testing facilities to allow conditions to be reproduced consistently...|$|E
