5|$|In 1806, German <b>botanist</b> Carl Ludwig Willdenow gave it {{the botanical}} name Ficus australis in Species Plantarum, {{but this is a}} nomen illegitimum as the species already had a validly {{published}} name. Italian <b>botanist</b> Guglielmo Gasparrini broke up the genus Ficus in 1844, placing the species in the genus Urostigma as U.rubiginosum. In 1862, Dutch <b>botanist</b> Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel described Urostigma leichhardtii from material collected from Cape Cleveland, Queensland, noting it had affinities to F. rubiginosa. In 1867, he placed Urostigma as a subgenus in the reunited Ficus, which resulted in the taxon becoming Ficus leichhardtii. Miquel also described Ficus leichhardtii variety angustata from Whitsunday Island, later classified as F. shirleyana by Czech <b>botanist</b> Karel Domin. Queensland state <b>botanist</b> Frederick Manson Bailey described Ficus macrophylla variety pubescens in 1911 from Queensland, Domin later renaming it Ficus baileyana. All these taxa were found to be indistinguishable from (and hence reclassified as) F.rubiginosa by Dixon in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest fungi {{were first}} {{mentioned}} by Flemish <b>botanist</b> Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over {{the next couple}} of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French <b>botanist</b> Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), erroneously suggested that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.|$|E

5|$|In his {{landmark}} Flora Australiensis, English <b>botanist</b> George Bentham {{published the}} first key for the nine described species of Brachychiton, and relegated {{them to a}} section of Sterculia. Hence the Queensland bottle tree became Sterculia rupestris. Von Mueller maintained his recognition of Brachychiton as a separate genus. German <b>botanist</b> Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Sterculia in 1891, {{on the grounds that}} the name Clompanus took precedence. He republished the Queensland bottle tree as Clompanus rupestris. German <b>botanist</b> Karl Moritz Schumann gave it its current binomial name in 1893, which was accepted by Achille Terraciano of the Orto botanico di Palermo and subsequent authorities, and remains current.|$|E

5|$|Acacia pycnantha {{was first}} {{formally}} described by <b>botanist</b> George Bentham in the London Journal of Botany in 1842. The type specimen was {{collected by the}} explorer Thomas Mitchell in present-day northern Victoria between Pyramid Hill and the Loddon River. Bentham thought it was related to A. leiophylla, which he described in the same paper. The specific epithet pycnantha {{is derived from the}} Greek words pyknos (dense) and anthos (flowers), a reference to the dense cluster of flowers that make up the globular inflorescences. Queensland <b>botanist</b> Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma pycnanthum in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name is treated as a synonym of its original name.|$|E

40|$|<b>Botanists</b> are an {{overlooked}} {{group of}} informants in ethnobotanical studies. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess their potential as sources of original ethnobotanical information. Wild food plants remembered by Polish <b>botanists</b> from their childhood were freelisted by 71 <b>botanists.</b> The results were compared with several ethnobotanical studies: three from the 21 st century and one from the mid- 20 th century. The <b>botanists</b> listed 123 species (mean of 9. 3 species per individual). Although the average number of personal freelists was slightly lower for <b>botanists</b> than for local key informants in two of the other studies (11 and 13, respectively), the total list of species was longer than in any other Polish ethnobotanical study. Two of the ethnobotanical studies supplied richer material on past famine plants, whereas the <b>botanists</b> mentioned many alien plants and plants from urban habitats not mentioned in the ethnographical study. It can be concluded that <b>botanists</b> are possibly the best source of information for studies of contemporary or new uses of plants, but are inadequate for uses that are dying out. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 168, 334 – 343.

5|$|In 1891, German <b>botanist</b> Otto Kuntze {{challenged}} the generic name Banksia L.f., {{on the grounds}} that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.serrata as Sirmuellera serrata. English <b>botanist</b> James Britten proposed the genus name Isostylis in 1905, and hence called it Isostylis serrata, for the same reasons as Kuntze. The challenges failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E
