40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} visa liberalisation between Russia and the European Union, which constitutes a key aspect of the parties’ diplomatic cooperation. This work sets out to identify the main results of Russia/EU cooperation. The authors have conducted a brief historical analysis of this area of relations. The visa “regionalisation” is considered {{in the context of}} identifying the key actors of the EU — Russia negotiations: the Kaliningrad region, Germany, Poland, and Lithuania. In their analysis, the authors rely mostly on primary sources: intergovernmental agreements on simplified <b>border</b> <b>traffic,</b> border-crossing statistics for the Kaliningrad region in the framework of the local <b>border</b> <b>traffic,</b> expert interviews, and related analytic reports. Specifically, local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> is viewed as the most effective form of interaction in the field of visa regime simplification and border territory development. An assessment of the positions of key negotiators shows that local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> between the Kaliningrad region of Russia and the Polish border voivodeships is a success, which stresses the need for a prompt transition to a visa-free regime with the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|Polish and Russian {{cross-border}} cooperation {{is governed by}} lawful agreements. The enlargement of the Schengen Area {{had a significant impact}} on Kaliningrad Oblast relations and {{cross-border cooperation}} with its neighbours. The introduction of visas between Poland and Russia hindered and restricted local border trade which had for years been the only measure mitigating social and economic problems of the cross-border regions. Nevertheless, <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> between Poland and Kaliningrad grew steadily, to exceed four million in 2012. Poland and Russia, supported by Germany, applied to the EU for small <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> to cover the entire territory of the Oblast. According to the European Commission, the proposed solution would be a European exception. The agreement on small <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> came into force on July 27, 2012, covering the entire area of the Kaliningrad Oblast and selected Polish poviats of Pomerania and Warmia-Mazuria voivodeships. Towards the end of the first quarter of 2013, the number of Poles crossing the border showed a rising tendency, and starting from the second through the third quarter of 2013, the number of Russians coming to Poland grew more dynamically. The visits of Kaliningrad residents, apart from commercially oriented ones, also include recreation, tourism, medical tourism visits, etc. Kaliningrad citizens looking for leisure, recreation and entertainment come to participate in great sporting and cultural events in Gdańsk, Sopot and Gdynia. The local self governments of poviats covered by small <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> noted a clear upturn in the economies and trade of their regions. The development of cross-border cooperation, including small <b>border</b> <b>traffic,</b> has not resulted in attracting a substantial number of Polish tourists to the Kaliningrad Oblast, but it has provided such a possibility. This region is quite expensive for the average Pole. However, as scientists from Kaliningrad projected, with the easing of the visa system and the development of transport and tourist infrastructure the role of tourism shows a growing trend...|$|R

40|$|This article {{sets out}} to analyse the Polish-Russian {{agreement}} on small <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> {{in the context of}} relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation. The analysis focuses {{on the role of the}} Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation in relations between the EU and Russia and conditions of the Polish-Russian agreement on small <b>border</b> <b>traffic.</b> The methodology employed is based on analysing primary (documents) and secondary (scholarly publications, press articles) sources. The article also addresses the “Kaliningrad question” — one of the most important issues in Russia-EU relations. The analysis shows that the signing of the Polish-Russian agreement on small <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> should be viewed as a success. Based on the agreement, the inhabitants of borderlands in Poland and Russia (the Kaliningrad region) can cross the border without obtaining an entry visa. For the inhabitants of the borderlands, the agreement brings a range of significant advantages relating to the intensification of social, cultural, touristic, and economic contacts. It is worth noting that the agreement is one of very few examples of EU —Russia cooperation, especially in context of deterioration thereof observed over the last several years. ...|$|R

40|$|Local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> (LBT) is a {{tool for}} {{cooperation}} between the EU member states and neighbouring countries. It emerged as a measure to mitigate the barrier effect of the EU’s external border. In 2006, the European Parliament authorised the EU member states to conclude bilateral agreements on a simplified border crossing regime in border areas. This article analyses local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> as a cross-border cooperation tool. The territory described in the study includes the external borders of the EU (and Norway) with the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. The article will {{be of interest to}} specialists in international and, particularly, in cross-border cooperation. The authors analyse the mechanism of local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> and identify possible trends based on the general socioeconomic situation and foreign policy background in Russia, Belarus, and the EU (Norway). The article employs the cartographic method to enhance the visual component of the study. It is concluded that the LBT mechanism is effective and it has a positive effect on the development of border contacts between countries. There is a need to continue the dialogue between Russia, Belarus and the EU countries on both expanding the geographical scope of the LBT mechanism and ensuring its qualitative development. ...|$|R
