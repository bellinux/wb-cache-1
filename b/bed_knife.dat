50|$|Most of {{the graves}} were looted. The buried {{clothing}} and footwear is colorful, with various ornaments of bronze, bone and stone: plaques, buttons, necklaces, pendants, mirrors, cowrie shells. The accompanying tools are rare: Needles and needle <b>beds,</b> <b>knives</b> and axes-celts. Even less common are weapons: arrowheads, daggers, bow end caps. In some graves are horse harnesses, whip handles. There are bronze objects, fewer iron and precious metals.|$|R
60|$|First I gave Steele my earnest {{counsel and}} then as stiff an {{argument}} as I knew how to put up, all anent the absolute necessity of his eternal vigilance. If he got shot in a fair encounter with his enemies--well, that was a Ranger's risk and no disgrace. But to be massacred in <b>bed,</b> <b>knifed,</b> in the dark, shot in the back, ambushed in any manner--not one of these miserable ends must be the last record of Vaughn Steele.|$|R
5000|$|The {{grass of}} that land is {{as tall as}} a tree. He is then found by a farmer who was about 72 ft. tall, judging from Gulliver {{estimating}} a man's step being 10 yd. He brings Gulliver home and the farmer's daughter Glumdalclitch cares for Gulliver. The giant-sized farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant shows make Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to {{the queen of the}} realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the Queen of Brobdingnag's service {{to take care of the}} tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, <b>beds,</b> <b>knives</b> and forks, the Queen of Brobdingnag commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his [...] "traveling box".|$|R

60|$|Young Rivera {{was given}} his {{instructions}} and dispatched south. When he returned, {{the line of}} communication was reestablished, and Juan Alvarado was dead. He {{had been found in}} <b>bed,</b> a <b>knife</b> hilt-deep in his breast. This had exceeded Rivera's instructions, but they of the Junta knew the times of his movements. They did not ask him. He said nothing. But they looked at one another and conjectured.|$|R
50|$|Around 11:00 am {{the same}} day, Susairaj {{went to a}} nearby mall and {{purchased}} bags, air freshener, curtains, <b>bed</b> sheets & <b>knife.</b> She later told police that she did this on Jerome's instructions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not go, Myles," [...] cried Gascoyne, [...] "he is {{a villain}} and a traitor, and would betray thee to thy death. I saw {{him when he}} first gat from <b>bed</b> hide a <b>knife</b> in his doublet." ...|$|R
60|$|Science, in {{the form}} of Dr. Shustoff, now hinted that {{electricity}} or magnetic force was {{at the bottom of the}} annoyances, a great comfort to the household, who conceived that the devil was concerned. The doctor accompanied his friends to their country house for a night, Maria was invited to oblige with a dance, and only a few taps on windows followed. The family returned to town till 21st January. No sooner was Mrs. Shchapoff in <b>bed</b> than <b>knives</b> and forks came out of a closed cupboard and flew about, occasionally sticking in the walls.|$|R

When I got to Clarke's room I found him lying on the <b>bed</b> with a <b>knife</b> sticking in him. As it is we are doubtful about pulling him through." ...|$|R

"I {{never saw}} any good come of favoring a snake," [...] Hiram grumbled; but yet he did not make any protest against my proposition, and I pulled the gag {{from the mouth of}} the man who had worked us so much injury, saying at the same time as I seated myself near the <b>bed,</b> holding the <b>knife</b> which had been taken from its sheath: ...|$|R
60|$|And in this {{lies the}} {{grotesque}} horror of this sombre story. The last extremity of sailors, overtaking {{a small boat}} or a frail craft, seems easier to bear, because of the direct danger of the seas. The confined space, the close contact, the imminent menace of the waves, seem to draw men together, in spite of madness, suffering and despair. But there was a ship--safe, convenient, roomy: a ship with <b>beds,</b> <b>bedding,</b> <b>knives,</b> forks, comfortable cabins, glass and china, and a complete cook's galley, pervaded, ruled and possessed by the pitiless spectre of starvation. The lamp oil had been drunk, the wicks cut up for food, the candles eaten. At night she floated dark in all her recesses, and full of fears. One day Falk came upon a man gnawing a splinter of pine wood. Suddenly he threw the piece of wood away, tottered to the rail, and fell over. Falk, too late to prevent the act, saw him claw the ship's side desperately before he went down. Next day another man did the same thing, after uttering horrible imprecations. But this one somehow managed {{to get hold of}} the broken rudder chains and hung on there, silently. Falk set about trying to save him, and all the time the man, holding with both hands, looked at him anxiously with his sunken eyes. Then, just as Falk was ready to put his hand on him, the man let go his hold and sank like a stone. Falk reflected on these sights. His heart revolted against the horror of death, and he said to himself that he would struggle for every precious minute of his life.|$|R
25|$|Katie {{returns to}} the bedroom and sits down against the <b>bed</b> with the <b>knife</b> in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Amber comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard {{screaming}} after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber {{out of the house}} before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth.|$|R
50|$|Polansky {{survived a}} major scare as an 18-year-old. While in Mexico for a Davis Cup tie {{as a team}} hitting partner, he woke up sleepwalking and jumped or fell from a three-story room {{suffering}} serious injuries. Later, {{he said that he}} saw a dark figure approaching his <b>bed</b> wielding a <b>knife</b> and only thought about escaping through the window. He recovered miraculously to be playing tennis just four months later.|$|R
50|$|Andy Warhol {{would later}} use {{balloons}} {{in a similar}} way, but filled with helium rather than suspended in a stream of compressed air. Indeed, his first balloon, made in 1965, corresponded to an unfulfilled project described by Manzoni in a letter as ‘a cluster of pneumatic cylinders, elongated in shape, like steel, which would vibrate in the blowing of the wind.’ Damien Hirst has used ping pong balls suspended in compressed air, but {{within the context of}} floating above a <b>bed</b> of sharp <b>knives</b> or a skeleton.|$|R
50|$|After going downstairs on {{the final}} night and waking Micah with a scream, only Katie is shown {{returning}} to the bedroom, covered in blood and holding a large bloody kitchen knife. She sits beside the <b>bed,</b> holding the <b>knife</b> and rocking herself for hours. The next day, her friend Amber calls and leaves a message, expressing concern. That night, Katie is still sitting and rocking by the bed, and Amber can be heard entering the house. During this short period, Katie stops rocking, but when Amber screams (presumably after finding Micah's body) and {{runs out of the}} house, she resumes her motion.|$|R
6000|$|To {{the river}} Willems turned his eyes like a captive that looks fixedly {{at the door}} of his cell. If there was any hope in the world it would come from the river, by the river. For hours {{together}} he would stand in sunlight while the sea breeze sweeping over the lonely reach fluttered his ragged garments; the keen salt breeze that made him shiver now and then under the flood of intense heat. He looked at the brown and sparkling solitude of the flowing water, of the water flowing ceaseless and free in a soft, cool murmur of ripples at his feet. The world seemed to end there. The forests of the other bank appeared unattainable, enigmatical, for ever beyond reach like the stars of heaven--and as indifferent. Above and below, the forests on his side of the river came down to the water in a serried multitude of tall, immense trees towering in a great spread of twisted boughs above the thick undergrowth; great, solid trees, looking sombre, severe, and malevolently stolid, like a giant crowd of pitiless enemies pressing round silently to witness his slow agony. He was alone, small, crushed. He thought of escape--of something to be done. What? A raft! He imagined himself working at it, feverishly, desperately; cutting down trees, fastening the logs together and then drifting down with the current, down to the sea into the straits. There were ships there--ships, help, white men. Men like himself. Good men who would rescue him, take him away, take him far away where there was trade, and houses, and other men that could understand him exactly, appreciate his capabilities; where there was proper food, and money; where there were <b>beds,</b> <b>knives,</b> forks, carriages, brass bands, cool drinks, churches with well-dressed people praying in them. He would pray also. The superior land of refined delights where he could sit on a chair, eat his tiffin off a white tablecloth, nod to fellows--good fellows; he would be popular; always was--where he could be virtuous, correct, do business, draw a salary, smoke cigars, buy things in shops--have boots [...] . be happy, free, become rich. O God! What was wanted? Cut down a few trees. No! One would do. They used to make canoes by burning out a tree trunk, he had heard. Yes! One would do. One tree to cut down [...] . He rushed forward, and suddenly stood still as if rooted in the ground. He had a pocket-knife.|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{claimed to}} have mystical powers, and {{thought he was a}} messiah. He prophesised that he would be [...] "King of the World" [...] by 2000. He claimed to be a reincarnation of Jesus, Buddha, and Hitler. As his erratic and bizarre {{behavior}} became more pronounced, such as claiming voices were telling him to kill people, his friends started to ignore him. One friend eventually had to obtain a restraining order against Smith. His appearance became more and more unkempt, with long hair and a wild beard. He visited Heather and Sheila MacRae in Miami, and was asked to leave by Sheila's new husband after he woke up to find Smith standing over their <b>bed</b> with a <b>knife.</b> Heather saw him again in Los Angeles in 1972, when he [...] "looked really scary ... just totally looked insane, and would say weird things." ...|$|R
60|$|So we {{were left}} together, this murderous renegade and I--he sitting {{at the end of}} the <b>bed,</b> {{sharpening}} his <b>knife</b> upon his boot in the light of the single smoky little oil-lamp. As to me, I only wonder now, as I look back upon it, that I did not go mad with vexation and self-reproach as I lay helplessly upon the couch, unable to utter a word or move a finger, with the knowledge that my fifty gallant lads were so close to me, and yet with no means of letting them know the straits to which I was reduced. It was no new thing for me to be a prisoner; but to be taken by these renegades, and to be led into their Abbey in the midst of their jeers, befooled and out-witted by their insolent leaders--that was indeed more than I could endure. The knife of the butcher beside me would cut less deeply than that.|$|R
5000|$|Molanus {{is today}} mainly remembered by art historians for {{being one of}} the first {{authorities}} to turn the Council of Trent's short and inexplicit decrees on sacred images (1563) into minutely detailed instructions for artists, which were then widely enforced in Catholic countries mostly. His views on the older, originally Byzantine, depiction of the Nativity of Jesus in art are typical:The Virgin is shown pale with pains, the midwives prepare a small (narcotic) drought for the childbirth. Why this? Is it because the Virgin Mary would have held back from any pain of childbirth, when in fact she brought forth her divine son without pain? And what pertains to the midwives who are mentioned in the apocryphal Book of the Infancy? Jerome says: There was no midwife! No obtrusiveness of women intervened! She, the Virgin, was both mother and midwife! I saw in not a few places the picture of the blessed Virgin lying on a bed, depicting childbirth, and she was suffering pains from this birth, but that is not true. How stupid! Those artists ought to be laughed at who paint Mary in the very act of childbirth pains, accompanied with pain, midwife, <b>bed,</b> little <b>knives</b> (to cut the umbilical cord), with hot compresses, and many other appurtenances[...] [...] [...] Rather, those pictures should be promoted which show the birth of Christ in which the Blessed Virgin Mary with arms folded and on bended knee before her little son, as though he was just now brought forth into the light.|$|R
50|$|Paranormal Activity: In {{one version}} of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the {{screaming}} and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the <b>bed</b> with the <b>knife</b> in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie {{comes out of the}} bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.|$|R
50|$|Sources of rags {{often appear}} as waste from other {{manufacturing}} such as denim fragments or glove cuts. Fibres from clothing {{come from the}} cotton boll. The fibres can range from 3 to 7 cm in length as they exist in the cotton field. Bleach and other chemicals remove the colour from the fabric {{in a process of}} cooking, usually with steam. The cloth fragments mechanically abrade into fibres, and the fibres get shortened to a length appropriate for manufacturing paper with a cutting process. Rags and water dump into a trough forming a closed loop. A cylinder with cutting edges, or knives, and a <b>knife</b> <b>bed</b> is part of the loop. The spinning cylinder pushes the contents of the trough around repeatedly. As it lowers slowly over a period of hours, it breaks the rags up into fibres, and cuts the fibres to the desired length. The cutting process terminates when the mix has passed the cylinder enough times at the programmed final clearance of the <b>knives</b> and <b>bed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] he said, smiling whimsically back at me. The machine started. The <b>bed</b> of the <b>knife</b> fell, and {{the grass}} shivered and dropped over. I watched {{the heads of the}} daisies and the splendid lines of the cocksfool grass quiver, shake against the crimson burnet, and drop-over. The machine went singing down the field, leaving a track of smooth, velvet green {{in the way of the}} swath-board. The flowers in the wall of uncut grass waited unmoved, as the days wait for us. The sun caught in the uplicking scarlet sorrel flames, the {{butterflies}} woke, and I could hear the fine ring of his [...] "Whoa!" [...] from the far corner. Then he turned, and I could see only the tossing ears of the horses, and the white of his shoulder as they moved along the wall of high grass on the hill slope. I sat down under the elm to file the sections of the knife. Always as he rode he watched the falling swath, only occasionally calling the horses into line. It was his voice which rang the morning awake. When we were at work we hardly noticed one another. Yet his mother had said: ...|$|R
40|$|A 22 -year-old man {{was found}} dead in his room, lying on his <b>bed,</b> witha kitchen <b>knife</b> embeddedinhis thorax. The {{external}} examination revealed only 1 deep incised horizontal wound in the third left intercostal space beside the sternum. There were no hesitation marks or defense injuries. On both flexor sides of the wrists, the forearms, and the arms and on {{the right and the left}} side of the neck, there were several old transversal cut scars. At the autopsy, once the single-edged knife was removed, and after a median sternotomy, the penetration depth of the stab wound revealed an incision of the left pleura, the pericardium, and the transfixed heart, from the anterior to the posterior side, ending on the seventh thoracic vertebra. Toxicological screening resulted as negative. Death occurred as a result of hemorrhagic shock after deep myocardial injuries. A psychiatric history of paranoid schizophrenia; the old scars, which were marks of previous attempted suicides; and the position of the weapon suggested that it was a suicide caused by a single strong stab wound in the cardiac region. This unusual manner of self-stabbing with a single stab to the heart without hesitation wounds was important to exclude other causes of death...|$|R
50|$|Janet, a girl at {{finishing}} {{school who}} 6 years ago saw her mother stab {{her father to}} death, is plagued by nightmares. (Her mother, following the tragedy, was committed to an asylum.) Miss Lewis, a teacher, takes Janet home; {{and in the absence}} of Henry Baxter, Janet's guardian, they are met by John (the chauffeur), Mrs. Gibbs (the housekeeper), and Grace Maddox (an attractive nurse-companion hired by Henry). Miss Lewis leaves Janet in Grace's care. The nightmares continue: a white-shrouded woman roams the corridors, inviting Janet to burst into her parents' room where she finds the same woman on the <b>bed</b> with a <b>knife</b> in her chest. When Henry returns he finds Janet under sedation; her doctors recommend psychiatric care; but he refuses, and Janet tries to commit suicide. Henry's wife comes to tea, and because she seems to be the woman in Janet's nightmares, Janet stabs the woman to death and is promptly committed to an institution. The woman in white is revealed to be Grace, disguised with a wig and mask and in cahoots with Henry. They marry, but Grace begins believing that Henry is trying to drive her mad. Under the impression that Janet has escaped from the asylum, Grace stabs Henry to death, expecting Janet to be blamed. Janet, however, never left the asylum, and Grace is brought to justice.|$|R

We landed provisions, two <b>beds,</b> plates, <b>knives,</b> forks, candles, cooking utensils, and were ready for a start at 6 P.M.; but the wind meanwhile had come on to blow at such a rate that I thought better of it, and we stopped.

One would have thought the Cagliaritans were in a conspiracy to frighten the two poor fellows, who (I believe) will be safe enough if they do not go into the marshes after nightfall.
