50|$|Most {{red wine}} is aged for some period before bottling, though this {{can vary from}} a few days, {{in the case of}} Beaujolais Nouveau to 18 months or more in the case of top <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>reds.</b> Aging can take place in {{stainless-steel}} or concrete tanks, or in small or large oak barrels. The latter impart some flavour to the wine as a function of their age and size (small, new barrels give more flavour than large, older barrels).|$|R

50|$|The Liv-ex Fine Wine Investables Index is {{designed}} to track the wines commonly found in a wine investment portfolio.

5000|$|In 2007, the Impala {{received}} the FlexFuel 3.5-liter V-6 and Flex Fuel rear badge for the LS, LT, LTZ, & Touring. A new 3.9-liter V-6 with Active Fuel Management was available. The SS retained the same drivetrain {{and did not}} receive the FlexFuel feature due to the high-performance nature of the powertrain. A tire-pressure-monitoring system, cruise control and a CD player were standard on all models, and a factory spoiler was an available option. The LT had 16-inch, five-spoke alloy wheels. The generation-7 OnStar system with turn-by-turn navigation was included when the available directions and connections service was selected. The SS had standard leather-appointed seats and XM Satellite Radio, with XM being optional on LS, LT, and LTZ trims. A new Luxury Edition package featuring leather seating, folding rear seat, and rear spoiler was offered on the LT. There were four new exterior colors—Precisions Red, Imperial Blue Metallic, <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>Red,</b> and Red Jewel Tintcoat, {{as well as a}} Regency-outfitted [...] "Impala RSS".

40|$|HPLC with fluorescence, PDA {{and mass}} spectrometric {{detection}} {{were used to}} analyse the (poly) phenol content of a <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>red</b> wine, POM Wonderful pomegranate juice and three other beverages advertised as being made from 100 % pomegranate juice. The red wine and POM Wonderful juice contained characteristic anthocyanin profiles with the latter also being characterised {{by the presence of}} ellagitannins and the former by flavan- 3 -ols monomers and procyanidin dimers and trimers. The three other pomegranate products all contained the expected ellagitannins but their anthocyanin profiles were a mixture of red wine and pomegranate anthocyanins. They also contained flavan- 3 -ol monomers and procyanidin dimers and trimers, components not usually detected in 100 % pomegranatebeverages. The HPLC-based procedures, therefore, provide a straight-forward means of accessing the authenticity of pomegranate-based products with the ready detection of constituents derived from red grapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of the food dyes sunset yellow, <b>bordeaux</b> <b>red,</b> and tartrazine yellow on the cellular cycle of Allium cepa L. Each dye was evaluated at the doses of 0. 4 and 4. 0 mL, at the exposure times of 24 and 48 hours in root tip cells of Allium cepa L. Slides were prepared and cells were analyzed during the whole cell cycle for cellular aberrations totaling 5, 000 total cells for each dose evaluated. The mitotic index was calculated, and statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-squared test (p < 0. 05). The results showed that the three dyes used under the evaluated doses and exposure times were cytotoxic to the cells of the system-test used. Further cytotoxicity studies should be conducted for additional results and a proper evaluation of the effect of these three dyes on a cellular level...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} influence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on ester levels in <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>red</b> wines. These wines were made in five Bordeaux areas in two vintages, using three yeast strains. Malolactic fermentation (MLF) was carried out using industrial starters or indigenous strains, each in triplicate. Ester concentrations were determined by liquid-liquid-extraction- or HS-SPME-GC/MS at various stages in the winemaking process. The levels of most compounds were slightly impacted by LAB, depending on grape variety. Nevertheless, branched hydroxylated esters, such as ethyl 2 -hydroxy- 3 -methylbutanoate and ethyl 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylpentanoate were the only compounds to be strongly influenced by the bacteria strain, regardless of matrix composition or the yeasts used for alcoholic fermentation. Moreover, the effect observed after MLF persisted over time, for at least 12 months. These esters are apparently important markers of LAB esterase activity. To our knowledge, {{this was the first}} time they had been identified in this role...|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{online auction}} prices for premium <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>reds</b> {{sold on the}} German eBay site. Our data set reports a total of 2133 {{transactions}} completed during November and December 2003. First, we estimate a model which includes only fundamental quality attributes such as vintage conditions, appellation, vineyard classification, and chateau reputation. In a second step, we add quality and reputation indicators due to wine critic Robert Parker. In the third model, we add online-auction specific variables {{to see whether they}} have any impact on the final auction price. We evaluate seller reputation scores, auction length, timing of the auction end (day of week, time of day), number of bids, unknown bidder identities (private auctions), initial price per bottle and whether information on Parker ratings is stated in the offer. Our application is unique because eBay auctions (especially for premium wine) have not been analyzed in this detail in the literature. The inclusion of online-auction specific variables adds virtually nothing the overall goodness of fit. However, we observe significant but small effects for auction length, the number of bids, and private auctions. In contrast to many other studies, we estimate an insignificant seller reputation effect on final auction prices...|$|R
