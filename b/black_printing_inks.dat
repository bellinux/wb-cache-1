The best-studied ligands for the AhR include polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, the most potent of which is 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). However, as new AhR ligands are identified and characterized, their structural and physiochemical diversity continues to expand. Our identification of AhR agonists in crude extracts from diverse materials raises questions as to the magnitude and extent of human exposure to AhR ligands through normal daily activities. We have found that solvent extracts of newspapers from {{countries around the world}} stimulate the AhR signaling pathway.

25|$|In {{a letter}} of November 1937, to art {{historian}} Gunnar Jungmarker (1902–1983) at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Billman reveals {{that he is in}} an artistic crisis. The black and white woodcut restricts his expression - too brutal contrasts between black and white surfaces. It was not until 1940 he was able to present a woodcut with several grey tones, developed from the ordinary <b>black</b> <b>printing</b> <b>ink.</b> Gunnar Jungmarker called this type of woodcut: grisaille woodcut. A time-consuming printing process, exclusively for handprinting, with several grey-wood blocks (1-4) aside from the black and white key block. These first free grisaille woodcuts (made before the work with Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in 1945) are based on self-perceived events for example from Billman's sailor years 1926-32, European travels 1936-39 and trips around Sweden during the war years. Some shining grisaille woodcuts are French Restaurant (1940), Artist Family (1941), Wilderness Kitchen (1942), Around a Guitar Player (1942), Stairway in the South (1942), Stormy Day, Dieppe sept. 1939 (1944) or Tropical Harbour (1945).|$|R

In addition, DMSO extracts of printed newspaper induced cytochrome P 450 1 A associated 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity in zebrafish embryos in vivo.

Depending on the materials used for Braille, it can be formed or printed in different ways: embossing, screen printing, thermoforming, digital printing. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of thermal properties of screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and inks with thermo-powder on the qualitative parameters of Braille. Screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and inks with thermo-powder were chosen for the research. Carrying out the qualitative analysis of printouts with Braille, the thermal stability was evaluated by analyzing the thermograms obtained with derivatograph Q- 1500. This paper presents the findings of the thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of printouts printed on paperboard Plike and using traditional screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> with thermo-powder. Based on the testing findings it is determined that thermal stability of printouts <b>printed</b> with thermo-powder <b>ink</b> is higher than printed with screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks.</b> It is determined that the appropriate temperature range of screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> with thermo-powder drying is 98 ºC – 198 ºC because in this case better relief of Braille dots is obtained.

The first edition, <b>printed</b> in gold <b>ink</b> [...] "containing real gold" [...] using one copper plate engraving and black ink using a second copper plate engraving, produced a few hundred copies. Water coloring was used to complete the game board, making a brilliant, colorful, and expensive product fit for the nobility. Later in 1800, a second edition was printed, probably for rich but common folk. Only one copper plate was used to <b>print</b> <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> and no water coloring was used. The game must have become quite popular in England as a third edition was printed using two copper plates, one for black, and the second for green lines to indicate blank spaces. Water colors were added to make a beautiful product. Laurie and Whittle published all three editions in 1800. On all three editions George Fox was listed as the inventor and the game honored the Duchess of York. In the first edition, gold not only added color and price but homage to royalty. In all three editions, the paper was glued to linen so it could fold up and be inserted into a heavy attractively labeled cardboard case.|$|R
