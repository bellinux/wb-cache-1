40|$|Research {{into the}} {{psychology}} of theatrical dancers has indicated that as a group, dancers may be a high-risk population for psychological disorders. The majority of this research however, has only sampled <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers.</b> In consideration {{of the fact that}} contemporary dance is philosophically and aesthetically different from ballet, it is proposed that the experience of contemporary dancers may be different from that of <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers</b> and thus their psychological experience and potential problems may also be different. It is suggested, therefore, that results from studies on <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers</b> may not generalize to contemporary dancers. In support of this proposition, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore the notion that there is a difference in the psychological distress, potentially experienced by <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers</b> compared to contemporary dancers...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} musculoskeletal disorders and anatomical regions which are most frequently injured in <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers.</b> Methods: Published (AMED, CiNAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, psycINFO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library) and grey literature databases (OpenGrey, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials and the UK National Research Register Archive) were searched from their inception to 25 th May 2015 for papers presenting data on injury prevalence in <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers.</b> Two reviewers independently identified all eligible papers, data extracted and critically appraised studies.

Period prevalence of musculoskeletal injury was 280 % (95 % CI: 217 %- 343 %).

No papers explored musculoskeletal disorders in retired <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers.</b> Conclusions: Whilst we have identified which regions and what musculoskeletal disorders are commonly seen <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers.</b> The long-term injury impact of musculoskeletal disorders in re-tired <b>ballet</b> <b>dancers</b> remains unknown...|$|R
