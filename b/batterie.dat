5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande <b>batterie</b> of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{guns were}} placed into storage in Bizerte. In January 1940 France {{gave them to}} Finland, after refusing to sell seven to the Finns {{in the summer of}} 1939. Of the twelve main guns, eight made it to Finland, while four were seized by Germany when it invaded Norway in April 1940 and {{captured}} them on board SS Nina in Narvik harbor. The Germans emplaced all four guns, after rebuilding them to accept German ammunition, in armoured turrets in <b>Batterie</b> Mirus on Guernsey. The Finns used four guns in coastal artillery positions at Isosaari and Mäkiluoto. Two other guns were used to repair Soviet TM-3-12 railway guns abandoned at Hanko when the Soviets evacuated in 1941. After the war these handed over to the Soviet Union, where they were kept operational until the 1990s. The remaining two guns were kept as spares for the others, one of which was used to replace one gun damaged during tests with 'super charges' in the 1970s. One gun turret is now a memorial at Isosaari while the remaining spare barrel is preserved at the Finnish Coast Artillery Museum at Kuivasaari.|$|E
25|$|Heavier {{artillery}} {{was initially}} installed in open positions. 150mm Krupp field guns were installed in open emplacements in 1894, allowing fire in two directions. Battery C15 {{was placed on}} the ridge between Righi and the Aiguille, firing north and south. Battery C10 with two 105mm guns and the <b>Batterie</b> Aiguille with the same equipment were placed near the summit. The <b>Batterie</b> de l'Observatoire, located above the Galerie des Mordes, was equipped with four 120mm guns. The <b>Batterie</b> Rossignol placed two 120mm pieces each facing north and south, while the <b>Batterie</b> de Plan 2 and the <b>Batterie</b> de Righi each mounted two 120mm pieces. These were replaced in 1923 by Model 1912 120mm howitzers with a higher rate of fire.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{measures}} {{included the}} replacement of the summit batteries with two 81mm fortress mortars, entirely buried in the mountain's peak. A battery of twinned 120mm mortars was added in the 1960s. Both batteries remained in service until 1994. These batteries covered the entire Savatan massif. The abandoned <b>Batterie</b> de Plex was replaced by the <b>Batterie</b> Dailly Nord, which remained operational until the end of 2003.|$|E
25|$|The fort is {{maintained}} by the Association du Fort et de la <b>Batterie</b> des Ayvelles, and may be visited.|$|E
25|$|One of the French {{artillery}} pieces {{brought to}} the island and installed in <b>Batterie</b> Strassburg at Jerbourg Point in 1942 may have been sabotaged in France, as the breach exploded on the 22cm gun when it was fired, killing several German marines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>batterie</b> site {{is located}} at the end of Noirmont Point, a rock {{headland}} which overlooks St. Aubin's Bay, Elizabeth Castle, and the harbours of Saint Helier. It {{was a part of the}} Atlantic Wall system of coastal fortifications, and most of the concrete structures remain today. The 3rd Battery of Naval Artillery Battalion 604 were stationed here.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January 1941 Heavy Battery (schwere <b>Batterie)</b> 833 {{was created}} at the Bergen {{training}} ground {{and ordered to}} be combat ready by 15 February 1941. On 2 April 1941 it was expanded into Heavy Artillery Battalion (schwere Artillerie Bataillon) 833. The original <b>Batterie</b> 833 was redesignated as the first battery of the new battalion and a new second battery was formed, each battery having two howitzers, with orders to be combat ready by 1 May 1941 in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. Initially a single battery was to be deployed against the Soviet fortress at Brest-Litovsk, but that was changed by 14 May 1941 when the other battery was ordered to attack the Soviet border fortifications near Lviv. The first battery was assigned to IV Army Corps of 17th Army of Army Group South near Lviv while the second battery was ordered to support the attack by the 4th Army of Army Group Center against the Brest Fortress. The batteries were issued 60 and 36 rounds respectively.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July 1942 Heavy Artillery Battalion 833 {{was ordered}} to form another battery {{with one or two}} Karl-Geräte. This was done by 15 August as schwere <b>Batterie</b> 628 (Karl) with two weapons, {{although}} sufficient personnel to man three guns was to be furnished by Heavy Artillery Battalion 833. On 22 July the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH)) issued an order to send the battery to Army Group North to support its planned offensive, Operation George (Unternehmen Georg), against Leningrad. The order for Georg, dated 22 August, specified Battery 628 with three guns, presumably with two operational guns and one in reserve was to participate. Army Group North reported the battery's arrival on 1 and 2 September 1942, but the Soviets preempted Georg with heavy attacks against the German forces besieging Leningrad so the Karl-Geräte didn't get into action.|$|E
500|$|In 1942 four Sd.Kfz. 8 {{connected}} together {{were used}} to pull a trailer carrying a 30.5cm gun barrel for <b>Batterie</b> Mirus.|$|E
500|$|The 80 guns of Napoleon's grande <b>batterie</b> drew {{up in the}} centre. These {{opened fire}} at 11:50, {{according}} to Lord Hill (commander of the Anglo-allied II Corps), while other sources put the time between noon and 13:30. The grande <b>batterie</b> was too far back to aim accurately, and the only other troops they could see were skirmishers of the regiments of Kempt and Pack, and Perponcher's 2nd Dutch division (the others were employing Wellington's characteristic [...] "reverse slope defence").|$|E
500|$|Gorgon {{arrived at}} Dover on 6 June 1918 where {{she spent the}} next five weeks working up. Her first {{engagement}} was on 26 July when she fired eight rounds at a range of [...] at a German howitzer battery to calibrate her guns and fire control system, which provoked a response from the German [...] gun of <b>Batterie</b> Pommern south of Ostende. Three days later, she accompanied [...] on a bombardment of <b>Batterie</b> [...] "Tirpitz". She spent the next {{month and a half}} either out on patrol in the English Channel or preparing for the bombardment scheduled for the end of September in support of a major offensive along the coast.|$|E
500|$|Ohmsen {{had taken}} {{command of the}} Crisbecq Battery , also known as Marine Küsten <b>Batterie</b> [...] "Marcouf" [...] (Naval Coastal Battery Marcouf) or Seeziel <b>Batterie</b> [...] "Marcouf" [...] (Sea Target Battery Marcouf), on 1 February 1944. His command, {{including}} himself, consisted of three officers, 24 non-commissioned officers and 287 men of the Kriegsmarine. The unit was subordinated to the Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung 260 (M.A.A. 260—260th Naval Coastal Artillery Battalion). The battery's personnel was further augmented {{by members of the}} 6./Grenadier-Regiment 919 (6th Company, 919th Grenadier Regiment) of the 709. Infanterie-Division (709th Infantry Division) for ground defense under the command of Leutnant Geissler, which brought the overall manpower of the battery close to 400 men.|$|E
500|$|The {{main house}} forms an [...] "H"-shape, with a north and a south wing {{joined in the}} middle, all facing onto an upper {{courtyard}}. The upper courtyard was key to {{the way that the}} main house functioned: it linked almost all the ground floor rooms in the house, as well as providing access to the cellars, and gave an impressive view of the turret towers. In the south wing was the hall and the buttery, with the red and white chambers above them. Probably when Plas Mawr was first built, and certainly by 1665, the hall would have been used to meet ordinary visitors and for servants' meals, rather than forming the main room of the house; the wooden benches and table on display are original to the property. Traditionally, the service rooms in houses had been placed {{at the far end of}} the main hall, but Plas Mawr departed from this design. The service area, including the kitchen and pantry, was instead placed in the centre of the building, between the parlour and the hall; this radical redesign was copied at nearby Hafod Lwyfog. The restored kitchen is equipped with a <b>batterie</b> de cuisine, with a combination of original and replica equipment.|$|E
500|$|Through Turkish ambassadorial {{visits and}} other contacts, Europeans gained {{a fascination with}} the [...] "barbarous", noisy sound of these bands, {{and a number of}} European courts {{established}} [...] "Turkish" [...] military ensembles in the late-17th and early 18th centuries. The music played by these ensembles, however, were not authentically Turkish music, but rather compositions in the prevalent European manner. The general enthusiasm quickly spread to opera and concert orchestras, where the combination of bass drum, cymbals, tambourines, and triangles were collectively referred to as [...] "Turkish music". The best-known examples include Haydn's Symphony No. 100, which acquired its nickname, [...] "The Military", from its use of these instruments, and three of Beethoven's works: the [...] "alla marcia" [...] section from the finale of his Symphony No. 9 (an early sketch reads: [...] "end of the Symphony with Turkish music"), his [...] "Wellington's Victory"—or Battle Symphony—with picturesque sound effects (the bass drums are designated as [...] "cannons", side drums represent opposing troops of soldiers, and ratchets the sound of rifle fire), and the [...] "Turkish March" [...] (with the expected bass drum, cymbals, and triangle) and the [...] "Chorus of Dervishes" [...] from his incidental music to The Ruins of Athens, where he calls for the use of every available noisy instrument: castanets, cymbals, and so forth. By the end of the 18th century, the <b>batterie</b> turque had become so fashionable that keyboard instruments were fitted with devices to simulate the bass drum (a mallet with a padded head hitting the back of the sounding board), cymbals (strips of brass striking the lower strings), and the triangle and bells (small metal objects struck by rods). Even when percussion instruments were not actually employed, certain alla turca [...] "tricks" [...] were used to imitate these percussive effects. Examples include the [...] "Rondo alla turca" [...] from Mozart's Piano Sonata, K. 331, and part of the finale of his Violin Concerto, K. 219.|$|E

2500|$|Lighter {{guns were}} {{installed}} for local defense. From 1907 the <b>Batterie</b> Aiguille {{at the east}} end of the Aiguille crest covered the direction [...] of Javerne with 75mm guns. Two more guns installed in an open position between Righi and the Aiguille in 1909 formed the <b>Batterie</b> Golèze, covering the area of Demècre. The exposed nature of this battery led to its replacement with a rock-protected position in the 1940s, remaining in service until all 75mm guns were withdrawn in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, on 27 June the Germans {{used their}} biggest gun {{of the world}} <b>Batterie</b> Pommern, nicknamed [...] "Lange Max". This gun from Krupp was able to shoot 750kg shells from Koekelare to Dunkirk, which is about 50km away.|$|E
2500|$|Open heavy gun {{positions}} were {{judged to be}} relatively safe from opposing artillery fire, given their altitude above any potential opposing batteries, which would interfere with an optimal firing trajectory for an attacker. [...] However, after the First World War, confidence in this approach lessened. The open {{positions were}} abandoned in the 1930s, replaced by artillery galleries under rock protection. At the Battery Rossignol, elevation , a gallery was excavated of sufficient size to allow towed artillery to be moved, with branching galleries on either side mounting Bofors 105mm guns {{with a range of}} [...] in ten armored positions. [...] Four guns, aimed to the north, constituted the Batteries des [...] Four more, aimed to the south, were the <b>Batterie</b> de Plex, and two aimed to the east were the <b>Batterie</b> de Rosseline.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Batterie</b> Lothringen was a World War II coastal {{artillery}} battery in Saint Brélade, Jersey, {{named after}} the SMS Lothringen, and constructed by Organisation Todt for the Wehrmacht during the Occupation of the Channel Islands. [...] The first installations were completed in 1941, {{around the same time}} as the completion of the nearby Battery Moltke, in St. Ouen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mission for}} Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater and [...] No.3 Commando was to conduct two {{landings}} [...] east of Dieppe to silence the [...] "Goebbels" [...] coastal battery near Berneval. The battery could fire upon the landing at Dieppe [...] to the west. The three [...] and four [...] guns of 2/770 <b>Batterie</b> {{had to be}} out of action by the time the main force approached the main beach.|$|E
2500|$|Dailly was {{the scene}} of an {{ammunition}} explosion on 28 May, 1946, when about 5500 105mm shells, amounting to 449 tons, exploded in three separate magazines successively. The blast threw all four 105mm guns of the <b>Batterie</b> de Plex from their emplacements and damaged six more. The 120mm guns of the C10 battery were also damaged. Six construction workers were killed, part of a crew working on a funicular shaft linking Dailly to the upper part of Savatan. The explosion was attributed to decomposition of nitrocellulose propellant. Two similar explosions happened at Grisons in June 1946 and at Blausee-Mitholz in 1947, where 9 persons were killed in the village. The damage to Dailly resulted in a comprehensive modernization of the fort, with additions of 81mm and 120mm mortars, removal of obsolete weapons and the installation of two modern 150mm gun turrets. An underground caserne for 650 men was built at this time, with NBC protection. The four 105mm guns of the Batteries des [...] and the two 105mm guns of the <b>Batterie</b> de Rosseline were repaired and upgraded, but the four guns of the south battery were never replaced, as their rock cover was judged to be insufficient.|$|E
2500|$|Battery 628 was {{initially}} ordered to the Vistula Front on 7 March, {{but this was}} countermanded on 11 March when it was rerouted towards Remagen, where the Allies had recently captured the Ludendorff Bridge. [...] Karl-Batterie 638 arrived on 20 March, but after only 14 rounds that missed all of the bridges and only damaged a handful of random houses, the weapon had to be moved to the rear for repairs. <b>Batterie</b> 428 was also ordered towards Remagen on 11 March, but was rerouted to the 1st Army sector instead.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1917 Krupp {{completed}} {{the construction of}} [...] <b>Batterie</b> Pommern at Koekelare with Lange Max, the biggest gun of the world, an adaptation of its [...] type. The gun played {{an important part in}} the German defence of Flanders and was used to bombard Dunkirk [...] distant, to stop the unloading of supplies and was sometimes used for diversionary operations. The gun fired its first shot at Dunkirk on 27 June and obtained a direct hit; during the Third Battle of Ypres the gun was also used to shell Ypres.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 1944 {{a battery}} {{was ordered to}} be created {{immediately}} with one 54cm Karl-Gerät {{and sent to the}} 9th Army to help it suppress the Warsaw Uprising. The next day the Kommando für Sonder-Geräte formed the Army Artillery Battery (Static) 638 Heeres-Artillerie <b>Batterie</b> (bodenständige) with 60cm Karl-Gerät Nr. VI [...] "Ziu" [...] since no 54cm weapon was available and a firing table hadn't yet been computed. It arrived at the Warsaw West train station at 0700 on 17 August 1944, although the ammunition train didn't arrive until the following morning.|$|E
2500|$|Better {{suited for}} use against naval targets were the four heavy naval {{batteries}} installed by mid-September: Friedrich August with three [...] barrels; Prinz Heinrich with two 28cm guns; Oldenburg with two 24cm weapons and, largest of all, Siegfried (later renamed <b>Batterie</b> Todt) {{with a pair}} of [...] guns. Fire control for these weapons was provided by both spotter aircraft and by DeTeGerät radar sets installed at Blanc Nez and Cap d’Alprech. These units were capable of detecting targets out to a range of , including small British patrol craft inshore of the English coast. Two additional radar sites were added by mid-September: a DeTeGerät at Cap de la Hague and a FernDeTeGerät long-range radar at Cap d’Antifer near Le Havre.|$|E
2500|$|Surplus naval {{mountings}} {{were used}} to reinforce German coast defenses from Norway to the French Atlantic coast. These included guns from incomplete or disarmed ships like the aircraft carrier [...] or the battleship [...] For example, {{three or four of}} the Graf Zeppelins Dopp MPL C/36 mounts equipped both batteries of Naval Artillery Battalion (Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung) 517 at Cap Romanov near Petsamo, Finland while two of the Gneisenaus Drh. LC/34 mounts were emplaced on the west coast of Denmark at Esbjerg where they equipped <b>Batterie</b> Gneisenau of Naval Artillery Battalion 518. All told, a total of 111 SK C/28 guns were employed on coast defense duties in a variety of mounts, 28 in Norway, 12 in Denmark, 24 in the German Bight, 8 in the Netherlands, and 39 in Belgium and the Atlantic coast of France.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{studies were}} carried out for a {{fortification}} at Savatan in 1890. It became clear that a position in the higher Dailly massif to the south would protect forces on the Savatan plateau and would complement a battery {{on the opposite side of}} the valley at Scex. A small hotel on the site of an old weather observation station on the Dailly massif was chosen for the barracks. Robert Weber was the architect in charge of the works. Initial work installed two 150mm mortars on Dailly at an altitude of about , which remained in place until the 1920s. A single 120mm howitzer in an armored turret was installed on the summit, remaining in place through the 1940s. For local defense, two 84mm guns were placed in concreted casemates near an observation point in 1894, called the <b>Batterie</b> de la Galerie de Morcles.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 March Hitler ordered SS General Hans Kammler {{to attack}} the bridge with V2 {{ballistic}} missiles. The German General Staff was shocked that Hitler would order {{the use of the}} inaccurate weapons on German soil when they would very likely kill German citizens and troops. On 17 March, <b>Batterie</b> SS Abt. 500 at Hellendoorn in the Netherlands, about [...] to the north, fired eleven V2 rockets at the bridge. It was their first and only use against a tactical target and the only time they were fired on a German target during the war. The inaccurate missiles landed as far away as Cologne, [...] to the north. One struck the town of Oedingen, destroying a number of buildings, killing three U.S. GIs and a number of German residents, and wounding many others. One missile struck the 284th Combat Engineers Command Post in Remagen at 12:20 PM, missing the bridge by about [...] Those present said it felt like an earthquake. The blast damaged or destroyed buildings in a [...] radius, killing three soldiers and wounding 30 more.|$|E
2500|$|Only two {{operational}} M-Gerät {{were available}} {{at the beginning of}} World War I, although two additional barrels and cradles had apparently been produced by that time. The two operational M-Geräte formed the Kurze Marine Kanone <b>Batterie</b> (KMK) No. 3; the 42cm contingent contained four additional Gamma Geräte organized in two batteries, and one more Gamma became operational two weeks into the war as [...] "half-battery". They were used to destroy the Belgian forts at Liège, Namur, and Antwerp, and the French fort at Maubeuge, as well as other forts in northern France. Bertha proved very effective against older constructions such as the Belgian forts designed in the 1880s by Brialmont, destroying several in a few days. The first shot in anger of an M-Gerät was fired against Fort Pontisse on the outskirts of Liege on August 12. The most spectacular success was against the nearby Fort Loncin, which exploded after taking a direct hit to its ammunition magazine. The concrete used in the Belgian forts was of poor quality, and consisted of layers of concrete only, with no steel reinforcement.|$|E
