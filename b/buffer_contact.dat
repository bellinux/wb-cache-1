40|$|In this paper, the {{identification}} problem is discussed for clearance-type nonlinearity, a common situation in many practical applications, and this clearance {{may lead to}} difficulties in predicting the system response. The proposed approach is applied to an experimental problem, by using a recently developed method, termed nonlinear subspace identification (NSI). The experimental application described hereafter is a multi-storey building and the nonlinearity of the structure is represented by a buffer mounted on a lower deck with a certain gap, introducing a nonlinear asymmetric behaviour when the amplitude of the motion exceeds the fixed limit. Since NSI is able to treat many nonlinearities at the same time, several ad hoc functions are defined and adopted {{in order to identify}} the clearance-type characteristic, showing advantages with respect to the traditional polynomial approach. The asymmetric characteristic of the <b>buffer</b> <b>contact,</b> its intrinsic nonlinearity and the multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system create an interesting miscellanea of the typical elements, which are often difficult to identify in nonlinear dynamics...|$|E
40|$|We report {{synthesis}} of phase pure multiferroic YMnO 3 thin films on sapphire (0001) with conducting ZnGaO <b>buffer</b> <b>contact</b> layer. Films were prepared by using pulsed laser deposition technique and characterized using x-ray diffraction(XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive absorption spectroscopy (EDAX) and magnetic field dependent dielectric measurement techniques. Structural characterizations indicated phase purity and epitaxial {{nature of the}} films. The dielectric response indicated an anomaly in dielectric constant and tand {{in the vicinity of}} 30 K, well below the bulk Neel temperature ~ 70 K. This anomaly in dielectric constant and tand and its magnetic field dependence is explained as an influence of strain due to lattice mismatch between the substrate and YMnO 3 film. A substantial enhancement in magnetocapacitance was also observed for magnetic field applied parallel to ab plane of the film. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} tune the multiferroic property of YMnO 3 via changes in ferroelastic route. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in J. Appl. Phy...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, we {{have seen}} {{significant}} progress towards understanding the role of proteins in both physiological and pathological processes. Especially neurotrophic factors have increasingly come into focus {{for the treatment of}} neurodegenerative diseases, however still no satisfying delivery strategies for long-term applications have been established. Most proteins possess a hydrophilic character and can therefore be retarded by encapsulation into more hydrophobic matrix materials. It was the aim of this thesis to establish physiological triglyceride matrices as a suitable alternative to commonly used polymeric carriers for the long-term controlled release of protein drugs. The success in comprehensively achieving this goal was to a great extent based on the parallel investigation into both mechanistic and application based aspects. Visualization of internal processes inside the matrices at all stages by confocal microscopy {{played a major role in}} advancing both fields of work and thoroughly understanding the system. First, in a comparison with the so far used manufacturing methods, PEG co lyophilization was developed as a new strategy with superior performance in finely and homogenously distributing lysozyme as a model protein in lipid matrix material with complete retention of activity. The method was designed as a one-pot procedure, where protein was micronized in a first step due to freezing�induced aqueous phase separation in the presence of PEG, and then dispersed in the solid state in a solution of the lipid in an organic solvent. Confocal microscopy pointed to the fine and homogenous distribution being the crucial prerequisite for long-term delivery. With this, a reduction in matrix size to dimensions of 1 mm diameter and 1 mm height was feasible, for the first time enabling their investigation in the animal brain, where they showed excellent biocompatibility. BDNF and IL- 18 were incorporated by this method into glyceryl tripalmitate under complete retention of activity as demonstrated by BDNF-ELISA and a cell based IL 18 bioassay. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying release from a drug delivery device is crucial for developing strategies to tailor the release profile and being able to react to drug stability problems. It could be demonstrated by diffusion studies of fluorescently labelled BSA, excipient PEG and release buffer visualized with the help of confocal microscopy that buffer could only penetrate into the matrices, where excipient or protein starts to dissolve and diffuses out. A linear concentration gradient of diffusing protein was formed between a buffer penetration front and the matrix surface until the buffer reached the centre of the device. The power law was an adequate mathematical model for the description of release profiles of FITC-BSA and lysozyme at loadings between 1 and 8 %, with data being linear to time 0. 45 for up to 60 % cumulative release. At 3 - 5 % protein loading, a percolation threshold could be identified, predicting the loading, above which complete release of the matrices is possible due to the formation of a continuous network of pores. Buffer penetration and drug diffusion, the two crucial mechanisms for release identified by confocal microscopy, were further investigated for their dependence on matrix and drug properties. It could be demonstrated, that wettability of the matrix governed the buffer penetration velocity. This could be employed to tailor the release profile in a time range of more than 14 months by varying matrix lipophilicity through changing the chain length of the fatty acid in the triglyceride. However, this was only possible when the incorporated drug was a protein, being able to reduce <b>buffer</b> <b>contact</b> angles via its own surface active properties. Non-surface active model substances, such as FITC-dextrans remained trapped within the triglyceride, due to their inability to induce wetting and buffer penetration. This, however, could be triggered by the addition of the surfactants Tween® 20 and 81 at time points up to 57 days after initial incubation, leading to a complete release of the matrix loading. Apart from drug surface activity, another important characteristic was its molecular weight, being decisive for the diffusion step during release. An impact could be proven not only for seven different model proteins (lysozyme, trypsin, ovalbumin, BSA, ADH, catalase, thyroglobulin) but also for FITC-dextrans of different molecular weights in the presence of surfactant in the release buffer. As a conclusion, with the work described in this thesis, lipid matrices could be established as a controlled release systems for long-term delivery of protein drugs. Concomitantly, it presents a fundamental insight into both release mechanisms and potential applications. It thus can provide a basis for a better understanding also for other kinds of matrix geometries and lipophilic materials, for which diffusion is the major release controlling factor...|$|E

40|$|Described here is {{fabrication}} of a pH-sensitive, optically transparent transducer {{composed of a}} planar indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode overcoated with a poly(aniline) (PANI) thin film and a porous sol-gel layer. Adsorption of the PANI film renders the ITO electrode sensitive to pH, whereas the sol-gel spin-coated layer makes the upper surface compatible with fusion of phospholipid vesicles to form a planar supported lipid bilayer (PSLB). The response {{to changes in the}} pH of the <b>buffer</b> <b>contacting</b> the sol-gel/PANI/ITO electrode is pseudo-Nernstian with a slope of 52 [*]mV/pH over a pH range of 4 – 9.

Due to its lateral continuity and lack of defects, the PSLB blocks the pH response of the underlying electrode to changes in the pH of the overlying buffer.

The major problem to investigate the behavior of blood in contact with pegylated surfaces is the complexity of the medium and especially the presence of albumin in large excess. In a model approach, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the fate of albumin, fibrinogen, and γ-globulins at physiological concentrations in pH[*]=[*] 7. 4 isotonic HEPES <b>buffer</b> after <b>contact</b> with SiTiO 2 chips coated with diblock poly(DL-lactic acid) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) s and triblock poly(DL-lactic acid) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) -block-poly(DL-lactic acid) copolymers.

OWLS gave access to the mass and the thickness of adhering protein layers that resist washing with HEPES buffer. Protein depositions were detected regardless of the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) segments on surfaces. Adsorption depended on the protein, on the surface and also on the presence of the other proteins. Unexpectedly any surface coated with a layer of adsorbed albumin prevented deposition of other proteins, including albumin itself. This outstanding finding suggests that it was the presence of albumin adsorbed on a surface, pegylated or not, that made that surface compatible with other proteins. As a consequence, dipping a device to be in contact with the blood of a patient in a solution of albumin could be a very simple means to avoid further protein deposition and maybe platelets adhesion after in vivo implantation...|$|R

We showed that the electrochemical swelling of this multilayer system depends on the ionic properties of the <b>contacting</b> <b>buffer.</b> A model was developed to explain the influence of ionic strength, the pH value, and the charge of the counterions in the buffer on the swelling behavior, by relating the swelling of the multilayer to the exchange of counterions and water molecules between the buffer and the multilayer. Changing the salts in the buffer, while maintaining the same ionic strength, showed that the swelling of the multilayer {{is related to the}} counterions' molecular mass, hydration properties, and binding strength to PAH. The hydration efficiency of different monovalent anions follows the Hofmeister series, decreasing from kosmotropic ions to chaotropic ones. In contrast, the strong binding affinity of divalent anions causes them to diverge from the Hofmeister series and to release ferrocyanide from the multilayer...|$|R
40|$|IBIC (Ion Beam Induced Charge) {{technique}} {{has been used}} in order to characterize single crystal epitaxial CVD diamond film with respect to homogeneity and stability of the response (in terms of charge collection efficiency, cce) as a function both of counting rate and of the number of counts per unit surface area. The maximum shift of cce peak, under a 1. 2 MeV proton microbeam, is 1. 5 % for counting rates from 43 to 4330 Hz, while the homogeneity, evaluated as the standard deviation with respect to the average value of cce over strip-like regions 60 - 100 μm wide and 800 - 1200 μm long, is 0. 5 %. Counting rates per unit surface area were between 30 and about 15, 000 Hz/mm 2. A total number of counts per unit area up to 9 10 6 counts/mm 2 was reached without noticing any polarization effect due to trapped charge. Moreover, the functionality of a new kind of bulk electrode, realized by a boron doped <b>buffer</b> layer laterally <b>contacted</b> with Ag paste, has been checked by measuring cce at different proton ranges.

40|$|Ion-mediated (Ca(2 +)) {{changes in}} viscoelastic, {{structural}} and optical properties of negatively charged solid supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) on SiO(2) surfaces were studied {{by means of}} quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring and optical reflectometry. Despite the sensitivity of QCM-D to viscoeleastic/structural variations, it has not often been used to probe such changes for SLBs. SLBs were prepared from binary phospholipid mixtures of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC, neutral) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-(1 '-rac-glycerol) (POPG, negatively charged) on SiO(2) sensor surfaces in a Ca(2 +) -containing buffer. Interestingly, for bilayers containing POPG fractions above 35 %, large QCM-D dissipation shifts occurred, when Ca(2 +) was removed from <b>buffer</b> in <b>contact</b> with the SLB (while maintaining 100 mM NaCl). The accompanying frequency changes were small. These Ca(2 +) mediated QCM-D responses are reversible, and a signal for considerable changes in the viscoelastic and structural properties of the SLB. Variation of Ca(2 +) -concentration revealed a threshold concentration of around 0. 4 mM for {{the changes in the}} SLB to occur. Below this value, at > 35 % POPG concentration in the SLB, the SLB appears to become more weakly attached to the SiO(2) substrate, which is partly attributed to a weakening of the POPG-substrate interaction in the absence of Ca(2 +). A consequence of this is an oscillation-amplitude dependent dissipation, which we attribute to slip of the bilayer at higher oscillation amplitudes. Complementary experiments using a combined QCM-D/reflectometry instrument showed that the Ca(2 +) -induced changes in the viscoelastic/structural properties of the SLB are accompanied by changes in the optical properties. We discuss different scenarios to explain the observed reversible effect of Ca(2 +) -ions on the dissipative and optical properties of the mixed SLBs. Based on our results we propose the observed phenomenon to be a combination of geometric changes, internal structural changes, changes in the interfacial water layer, and a slip mechanism, i. e. friction between the SLB and the substrate...|$|R
