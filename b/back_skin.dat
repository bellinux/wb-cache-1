25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by hitting {{it with the}} hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the <b>back</b> <b>skin</b> and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your <b>back,</b> <b>skin</b> from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was fine. Now half your body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} have suggested specific differences in <b>back</b> and belly <b>skin</b> in anurans which appear {{to influence the}} quality of reflex responses obtained from various areas of the animals body. The present investigation represents a comparative morphological study of <b>back</b> and belly <b>skin</b> in control and skin-grafted Rana pipiens, with special regard to the neuroepithelial relationships. A distinct difference in pigmentation of <b>back</b> and belly <b>skin</b> was observed. Intra-epithelial Merkel cells were present in all skin samples studied. The origins of the numerous unclassifiable cells in the Merkel cell region are discussed {{in relation to a}} presumed coordinating function of the Merkel cell during epithelial differentiation. Epitheliomesenchymal interactions were observed in the richly innvervated dermal regions. Two types of morphologically different intra-epithelial nerve endings were observed. These observations are discussed in relation to earlier observations on vertebrate skin and in relation to misdirected reflex responses obtained in skin-grafted anurans. ...|$|R

50|$|Human dermal fibroblast-derived Muse {{cells are}} {{shown to be}} a {{practical}} source for melanocyte induction. A cytokine induction system consisting of Wnt3a, SCF, ET-3, bFGF, linoleic acid, cholera toxin, L-ascorbic acid, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, insulin, transferrin, selenium, and dexamethasone was applied to both human dermal fibroblast-derived Muse and non-Muse cells. Only Muse cells differentiated into L-DOPA reactive functional melanocytes. A three-dimensional culture model was used to assess Muse cell-derived melanocytes. In that model, the dermis was mimicked by collagen type 1 and normal human dermal fibroblasts, while epidermis was mimicked by keratinocytes and Muse cell-derived melanocytes. Furthermore, Muse cell-derived melanocytes showed melanin production. Moreover, when Muse cell-derived melanocytes was transplanted onto the <b>back</b> <b>skin</b> of severe combined immunodeficient mice, they integrated to the basal layer of the epidermis producing melanin in vivo.|$|E
5000|$|Lard can be {{obtained}} from any part of the pig where there is a high concentration of fatty tissue. The highest grade of lard, known as leaf lard, is obtained from the [...] "flare" [...] visceral fat deposit surrounding the kidneys and inside the loin. Leaf lard has little pork flavor, making it ideal for use in baked goods, where it is valued for its ability to produce flaky, moist pie crusts. The next-highest grade is obtained from fatback, the hard subcutaneous fat between the <b>back</b> <b>skin</b> and muscle of the pig. The lowest grade (for purposes of rendering into lard) is obtained from the soft caul fat surrounding digestive organs, such as small intestines, though caul fat is often used directly as a wrapping for roasting lean meats or in the manufacture of pâtés.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms are {{different}} {{for every person}} {{depending on the type}} of rat-bite fever with which the person is infected. Both spirillary and streptobacillary rat-bite fever have a few individual symptoms, although most symptoms are shared. Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary rat-bite fever is generally diagnosed in patients in Africa. Rat-bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open sore. A rash can also spread around the area and appear red or purple. Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary rat-bite fever include chills, fever, vomiting, headaches, and muscle aches. Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the <b>back.</b> <b>Skin</b> irritations such as ulcers or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet. Wounds heal slowly, so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months.|$|E
