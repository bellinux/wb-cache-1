5|$|According to legend, Boyce {{was lost}} on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout {{came to his}} aid, guiding {{him back to his}} destination. The <b>boy</b> then refused Boyce's tip, {{explaining}} that he was merely doing his duty as a <b>Boy</b> Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden-Powell, who {{was the head of the}} <b>Boy</b> Scout Association at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the <b>Boy</b> Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around American Indian lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.|$|E

5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger <b>Boy,</b> or Merit Rewarded, Messenger <b>Boy,</b> Game of the Telegraph <b>Boy,</b> and The Office <b>Boy</b> allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office <b>Boy,</b> spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced him toward the goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American capitalist system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a <b>boy</b> lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the <b>boy,</b> it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The <b>boy</b> is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the <b>boy</b> going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the <b>boy</b> looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the <b>boy</b> as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the <b>boy</b> gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the <b>boy</b> lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the <b>boy</b> walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
