40|$|Phthalic {{acid esters}} {{may be used}} as {{plasticizers}} in food-packaging materials that have direct contact with food. Under normal conditions of use small amounts of the plasticizers would be expected to migrate into the food. The safe use of the phthalic acid esters under these conditions is based on available toxicity data, as well as regulations which, in general, specify the maximum extractable fraction of plasticizer that may enter food. Before the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1958, sanctions were granted for the use of five phthalates in food-packaging material (diethyl phthalate, <b>butylphthalyl</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>glycolate,</b> ethylphthalyl ethyl glycolate, diisooctyl phthalate, and di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate), with the limitations that they be used in accordance with good manufacturing practice for food packaging materials, and that di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate and diisooctyl phthalate be used with foods of high water content. Foods of high water content were defined as those from which no fat would be extractedwhen the food was pressed against filter paper; under the conditions of this test, if a water spot was formed the food was considered aqueous and if a fat spot was formed the food was considered fatty. The restriction was applied to di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate and to diisooctyl phthalate because the available toxicological data would not support un...|$|E

Materials with high ethanol concentrations show weight loss and shrinkage; those with lower ethanol concentrations show little change. The experimental material in this investigation was found useful for func-tional impression-taking. Previous studies have described the compo-sition and structure of tissue conditioners' and their Theological properties. 2 However, because these materials on a denture are constantly in contact with aqueous solu-tions or water itself, it seemed desirable {{to examine the effects}} of prolonged immersion in water. Materials and Methods Four proprietary materials studied in the previous investigations were examined. The materials were designated A, * B,t C,t D,ยง and a fifthFl which has become unavailable in the United Kingdom. Also studied was an experimental material (E). A poly (ethyl methacrylate) polymer powder, # and a liq-uid that contained 92 % <b>butyl</b> phthalyl <b>butyl</b> <b>glycolate</b> and 8 % ethanol were used. In each instance, a specimen was prepared in a strip- 7 cm x 2. 54 cm X about 0. 1 cm-with the use of a mixture of 3 gm polymer powder to 2 ml liquid. Strips were immersed in water 15 minutes after mixing. DIFFUSION OF ETHANOL IN TISSUE CONDI-TIONER GELS. -When a set tissue conditioner Received for publication May 20, 1970...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a short {{review of the}} available carcinogenicity tests which {{have been carried out}} on various phthalate esters prior to the availability of the National Cancer Institute bioassay studies. All of these studies suffer from diverse limitations in design or reporting when compared to more recent experimental protocols and reports. There are three papers related to di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, one to di-n-butyl phthalate, two to butyl benzyl phthalate, one to ethyl phthalyl ethyl glycolate and another to <b>butyl</b> phthalylbutyl <b>glycolate</b> (1). Di(2 -ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) The first experiment was carried out in 1953 in Sherman rats. Groups of 32 male and 32 female rats were administered 0. 04, 0. 13 or 0. 4 % DEHP in the diet for a maximum of two years. The doses were equivalent to 0. 20, 60 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively. Controls (number unspecified) received basal diet alone. After one year, 42 % of the control rats and the same percentage of rats at the highest dose level survived. The various groups were reduced to a maximum of eight males and eight females per group {{at the end of one}} year. Two groups of 32 males and 32 females (F 1 progeny) were generated from the control and high dose P generation and at 15 days of age were maintained at a dose level of 0. 4 % DEHP in the diet for one year, at which time the animals were killed. Some tumors were observed in the animals surviving longer than a year, but they were equally scattered among the different groups, so that, on the basis of this experiment, it was not possible to conclude either a negative or positive carcinogenic response to this chemical (2). The small number of animals, poor survival and limited reporting make this experiment inadequate in terms of a carcinogenicity bioassay. *International Agency for Research on Cancer, 150 cour...|$|R
