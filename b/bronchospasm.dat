5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant <b>bronchospasm</b> (or prophylactically in patients with a history of <b>bronchospasm</b> secondary to acetylcysteine). It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|Patients in {{respiratory}} distress {{should be}} observed for <b>bronchospasm</b> and secondary pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and <b>bronchospasm.</b> Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bronchospasms</b> {{appear as}} the feature of asthma, chronic {{bronchitis}} and anaphylaxis. <b>Bronchospasms</b> are a possible {{side effect of}} some drugs: pilocarpine (which is used to treat illness resulting from the ingestion of deadly nightshade, {{as well as other}} things), beta blockers (used to treat hypertension), a paradoxical result of using LABA drugs (to treat COPD) and other drugs. <b>Bronchospasms</b> can present as a sign of giardiasis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bronchospasms</b> are one {{of several}} {{conditions}} associated with cold housing.|$|R

5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and <b>bronchospasm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and <b>bronchospasm.</b> If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated <b>bronchospasm.</b> Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016, the European Medicines Agency {{recommended}} to withdraw fusafungine {{from the market}} due to rare but severe allergic reactions (mainly <b>bronchospasms).</b>|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the things}} that can cause <b>bronchospasms</b> are: {{consuming}} foods, taking medicines, allergic responses to insects, and fluctuating hormone levels, particularly in women.|$|R
50|$|The {{most serious}} {{possible}} side effects include cardiac arrhythmias and severe <b>bronchospasms.</b> Timolol {{can also lead}} to fainting, congestive heart failure, depression, confusion, worsening of Raynaud's syndrome and impotence.|$|R
25|$|Contaminants in {{the water}} can cause <b>bronchospasm</b> and {{impaired}} gas exchange, and can cause secondary infection with delayed severe respiratory compromise.|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} <b>bronchospasm</b> (due to any cause – allergic asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It {{is also one of}} the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate asthma attacks).|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine is used {{to treat}} a number of {{conditions}} including: cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, and superficial bleeding. It has been used historically for <b>bronchospasm</b> and hypoglycemia, but newer treatments for these that are selective for β2 adrenoceptors, such as salbutamol are currently preferred.|$|E
50|$|Lornoxicam has {{side effects}} {{similar to other}} NSAIDs, most {{commonly}} mild ones like gastrointestinal disorders (nausea and diarrhea) and headache. Severe but seldom side effects include bleeding, <b>bronchospasms</b> and the extremely rare Stevens-Johnson syndrome.|$|R
30|$|In {{the era of}} CTA ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) imaging {{has become}} the second-line imaging {{technique}} for suspected PE. As many other conditions such as pneumonia or <b>bronchospasms</b> may cause perfusion defects in lung scintigraphy ventilation imaging is used routinely to match/mismatch these defects [31].|$|R
50|$|<b>Bronchospasms</b> are {{a serious}} {{potential}} complication of placing a breathing tube during general anesthesia. When the airways spasm or constrict {{in response to}} the irritating stimulus of the breathing tube, it is difficult to maintain the airway and the patient can become apneic.|$|R
25|$|Clinical {{cases have}} been {{associated}} with acute fever, myalgias, <b>bronchospasm,</b> pruritic rashes, lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules associated with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated creatinine kinase levels. Symptoms may last as long as five years. Segmental necrotizing enteritis has been reported on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Another primary condition, called Katayama fever, {{may also}} develop from {{infection}} with these worms, {{and it can}} be very difficult to recognize. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, the eruption of pale temporary bumps associated with severe itching (urticarial) rash, liver and spleen enlargement, and <b>bronchospasm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include {{worsening}} <b>bronchospasm,</b> irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It {{can be used}} during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear. It is a short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist which works by causing airway smooth muscles to relax.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{ethiofencarb}} {{can cause}} muscle weakness, dizziness, flushness, excess salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, blurred vision, slurred speech and twitching. If {{a very high}} dose of ethiofencarb is administered then seizures, comas or hypertension could result. In severe cases, dyspnea, <b>bronchospasms</b> and bronchorrhea with impending pulmonary edema {{have been known to}} occur.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{typically}} {{occur within}} 10-30 minutes of ingesting {{the fish and}} generally are self-limited. People with asthma are more vulnerable to respiratory problems such as wheezing or <b>bronchospasms.</b> However, symptoms may show over two hours after consumption of a spoiled dish. They usually last for about 10 to 14 hours, and rarely exceed one to two days.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical <b>bronchospasms,</b> urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.|$|R
25|$|Dexamethasone is used {{to treat}} many {{inflammatory}} and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and <b>bronchospasm.</b> Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids.|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol's low {{toxicity}} makes it safe for other animals {{and thus is}} the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species. It is usually used to treat <b>bronchospasm</b> or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a bronchodilator in horses with recurrent airway obstruction; {{it can also be}} used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxically yet uncommonly, {{indometacin}} {{can cause}} headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including angioedema, sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia {{as well as}} acute <b>bronchospasm),</b> severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and photosensitivity are also possible side effects.|$|E
50|$|Inducing an {{abortion}} without medical supervision by self-administering abortifacient over-the-counter drugs or drugs obtained illegally or by using drugs not indicated for abortion but known {{to result in}} miscarriage or uterine contraction. Drugs that cause uterine contractions include oxytocin (synthetic forms are Pitocin and Syntocinon), prostaglandins, and ergot alkaloids. Risks include uterine rupture, irregular heartbeat, a rise in blood pressure (hypertension), a drop in blood pressure (hypotension), anemia requiring transfusion, cardiovascular problems, pulmonary edema, and death, as well as intense <b>bronchospasms</b> in women with asthma.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, EIC, HDI and TDI {{have been}} {{described}} as potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Brown et al. 1982), with similar effects as nerve gasses such as sarin. This enzyme is essential for the breakdown of the nervous transmitter acetylcholine in the synapses (Rhoades & Pflanzer 2003). The symptoms after exposure to an airborne acetylcholinesterase inhibitor vary from pupil constriction (myosis), bronchoconstriction and chest tightness for a minor exposure, through coughing and shortness of breath for moderate exposures, to severe bronchorrhea and <b>bronchospasms</b> and potential coma and rapid death for individuals exposed to a high dose (Rhoades & Pflanzer 2003).|$|R
50|$|It usually {{resolves}} {{with conservative}} therapy stopping oral ingestions, i.e. nil per os and a nasogastric tube, but may require colonoscopic decompression which is successful in 70% of the cases. A {{study published in}} the New England Journal of Medicine showed that neostigmine is a potent pharmacological way of decompressing the colon. According to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), it should be considered prior to colonoscopic decompression. The use of neostigmine is not without risk since it can induce bradyarrhythmia and <b>bronchospasms.</b> Therefore, atropine should be within immediate reach when this therapy is used.|$|R
25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{concern for}} asthmatic divers is that pulmonary obstruction, air trapping and hyperinflation may increase risk for pulmonary barotrauma, and the diver may {{be exposed to}} environmental factors that {{increase the risk of}} <b>bronchospasm</b> and the development of an acute asthmatic attack which could lead to panic and drowning. As of 2016, there is no epidemiological evidence for an increased relative risk of pulmonary barotrauma, decompression sickness or death among divers with asthma. This evidence only accounts for asthmatics with mild disease and the actual risk for severe or uncontrolled asthmatics, may be higher.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam therapy, {{compared}} with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy {{in an analysis of}} 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, <b>bronchospasm,</b> delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.|$|E
25|$|A {{continued}} lack {{of oxygen}} in the brain, hypoxia, will quickly render a person unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg. An unconscious person rescued with an airway still sealed from laryngospasm stands {{a good chance of}} a full recovery. Artificial respiration is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point the person stands a good chance of recovery if attended to within minutes. More than 10% of drownings may involve laryngospasm, but the evidence suggests that it is not usually effective at preventing water from entering the trachea. The lack of water found in lungs during autopsy does not necessarily mean there was no water at the time of drowning, as small amounts of freshwater are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Hypercarbia and hypoxia both contribute to laryngeal relaxation, after which the airway is effectively open through the trachea. There is also <b>bronchospasm</b> and mucous production in the bronchi associated with laryngospasm, and these may prevent water entry at terminal relaxation.|$|E
50|$|Tubocurarine has a time {{of onset}} of around 5 minutes which is {{relatively}} slow among neuromuscular-blocking drugs, and has a duration of action of 60 to 120 minutes. It also causes histamine release, now a recognized hallmark of the tetrahydroisioquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents. Histamine release is associated with <b>bronchospasms,</b> hypotension, salivary secretions, making it dangerous for asthmatics, children, {{and those who are}} pregnant or lactating. However, the main disadvantage in the use of tubocurarine is its significant ganglion-blocking effect, that manifests as hypotension, in many patients; this constitutes a relative contraindication to its use in patients with myocardial ischaemia.|$|R
40|$|Lower {{respiratory}} {{troubles in}} mature sports horses mainly include viral diseases (influenza, rhinopneumonia); bacterial diseases (that are generally due to commensal bacteria invading the {{lower respiratory tract}} because of an impairment of the pulmonaty defences); inflammatory processes (mainly in horses suffering from heaves and inflammatory airway disease) and exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhages. Dysfunction such as hypersecretion of mucus, <b>bronchospasms,</b> bronchial hypereactivity and oedema may complicate any of this diseases. Treatments focusing on the etiological agents (anti-viral therapy, modulation of immunity, and antibiotic therapy), on the associated symptoms (anti-inflammatory, bronchodilators, regulator of the muco-ciliary clearance) and on the nursing and general management (rest and environmental hygiene) are described in this reviewPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of {{overdose}} are due {{to excessive}} pharmacodynamic actions on β1 and also β2-receptors. These include bradycardia (slow heartbeat), severe hypotension with shock, acute heart failure, hypoglycemia and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. Activated charcoal is useful to absorb the drug. Atropine will counteract bradycardia, glucagon helps with hypoglycemia, dobutamine can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a β2-mimetic as hexoprenalin or salbutamol will terminate <b>bronchospasms.</b> Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3-30 mg/L in overdose victims.|$|R
