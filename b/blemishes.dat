25|$|During the 1970s, two {{changes were}} made to the system. Firstly, the Internally Flawless grade was added, as GIA noticed that many {{diamonds}} were being aggressively cut to remove any surface <b>blemishes,</b> and thereby reducing the cutting quality ("make") of the diamonds. The Internally Flawless grade gave diamond manufacturers a choice to leave <b>blemishes</b> {{on the surface of the}} stone, and achieve a grade higher than VVS1. The second change made to the grading system was the introduction of the I3 grade. This change was made in response to a growing number of diamonds of very low clarity being cut.|$|E
