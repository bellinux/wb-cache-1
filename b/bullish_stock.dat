It was never disclosed to anyone what happened to the great fortune he had made in the crash of 1929, but he had lost it all. It is possible that Livermore turned prematurely <b>bullish</b> and bought <b>stocks</b> and commodities long before the market finally bottomed in the summer of 1932.

40|$|Since China {{joined the}} World Trade Organization in 2001, the {{pressure}} for bank reforms has mounted as China ought to have fully opened up its financial market to foreign competition by 2006. Efficiency is key for domestic banks {{to survive in a}} liberalised environment, but it appears that the last hope for raising bank efficiency is through ownership reform. Whether ownership reform and foreign competition can solve China's banking problem remains to be tested. This paper aims to answer this question using a non-parametric approach to analyse the efficiency changes of 15 large commercial banks during 1998 - 2005. We find that ownership reform and foreign competition have forced Chinese commercial banks to improve performance, as their total factor productivity rose by 5. 6 per cent per annum. This coincides with the recent <b>bullish</b> Chinese <b>stock</b> markets led by three listed state-owned commercial banks. Despite such encouraging results, we remain cautious about the future of Chinese banks, as the good results may have been artificially created with massive government support and the fundamentals of the banks may be still weak.

But less {{attention has been paid}} to the feature attacks more commenting else, namely that there are extensive periods of time when equity prices rise and fall colloquially, these periods of time referred to as bull and bear markets respectively. The purpose of this research is to study the betas in the bull and bear market condition for a sample of stocks in the Karachi Stock Market (KSE), major stock market in Pakistan. The data consist of daily returns of two major sectors (Petroleum & Commercial banks) of KSE during the period of February 1997 to December 2007. The data pertains to the daily adjusted closing prices of 15 scripts that form a part of KSE index. This paper investigates whether betas of bull and bear market are statistically different from each other? KSE does not integrate any distribution so we use t-statistics. Analysis shows that beta is higher when the market is bearish than that when market is <b>bullish</b> for nine <b>stocks</b> while the reverse is true for other six stocks...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{have criticized}} Professor Siegel for being <b>bullish</b> on the <b>stock</b> market back in 2000. In a BusinessWeek {{interview}} in May 2000 {{when asked about}} the stock market, he replied:"Seven percent per year average real returns on stocks is what I find over nearly two centuries. I don't see persuasive reasons why it should be any different from that over the intermediate run. In the short run, it could be almost anything."That being said, Professor Siegel was spot on when he also said in the same interview:"I have voiced my concern about the technology sector, and I sometimes advise people to shade down from that sector relative to its percentage in the & Poor's 500-stock index. I really am concerned with these companies that have p-e ratios of 90, 100, and above. I still think stocks, as a diversified portfolio, are the best long-run investment. I will say that indexed bonds at 4% are an attractive hedge at the present time. To get a 4% real rate of return, although it's not as high as 6.5% to 7% that we talked about in stocks, as a guaranteed rate of return is certainly comforting against any inflation." ...|$|R
50|$|Edmund C. Lynch gained special notoriety when he foresaw the {{impending}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and advised Merrill Lynch's clients to sell {{many of their}} stock holdings in 1928. As many Americans were enjoying the soaring stock market in 1928, Lynch was convinced a disaster was near. His famous letter to all of Merrill Lynch's clients warned:"Now {{is the time to}} get out of debt. We think you should know that with a few exceptions all the larger companies financed by us today have no funded debt. This is not the result of luck but of carefully considered plans on the part of their managements and ourselves to place these companies in an impregnable position. The advice that we have given important corporations can be followed to advantage by all classes of investors. We do not urge you to sell securities indiscriminately, but we advise you in no uncertain terms that you take advantage of present high prices and put your own financial house in order. We recommend that you sell enough securities to lighten your obligations, or better yet, pay them entirely."Lynch's concern for the <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market was so strong that he went to the White House in 1928 and warned President Calvin Coolidge of his intuition. During his meeting with the President, Lynch famously even offered to make President Coolidge a partner of his firm, but the President turned down his offer.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} investor’s behaviour of representative bias in bullish and or bearish in Indonesian stock market. Representative bias is indicated by three variables: gambler’s fallacy, halo effect, and familiarity effect. This research will prove that during the trading in stock market, investors act irrationally and cause representative bias. It will result negative impact on investor’s portfolio. This research uses a quantitative approach to T-Test model. Data were collected with questionnaire dan distributed to investors directly (personally) and indirectly (google form). The sample used in this research were 378 respondents. First, questionnaire was analyzed using frequency distribution. Second, questionnaire was assessed using Likert Scale and analyzed using one sample t-test dan paired t-test to answer the hypothesis and research questions. The result is gambler’s fallacy exists in investors when they trading in <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market, {{but it does not}} exists in bearish stock market. Halo effect does not exists in investors when they trading in bullish and bearish stock market. While, familiarity effect exists in investors when trading in bullish and bearish stock market. In <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market, familiarity effect was greater than bearish stock market. Based on the result of this research can be seen that, in general, investors in Indonesian stock market are irrational in the process of decision making. In the bullish market, representative bias potentially greater than in the bearish market as indicated by the occurrence of gambler’s fallacy and familiarity effect. While in the bearish market, representative bias occurs as indicated in familiarity effect...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} analysts with a <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> {{recommendation}} {{have an interest}} in not being subsequently contradicted by negative firm-specific news. As a result, these analysts report downward-biased earnings forecasts so that the company is less likely to experience a negative earnings surprise. Analogously, analysts with a bearish recommendation report upward biased earnings forecasts so that the firm is less likely to experience a strong positive earnings surprise. Consistent with this notion, we find that stock recommendations significantly and positively predict subsequent earnings surprises, as well as narrow beats versus narrow misses. This predictability is concentrated in situations where the motivation for such behavior is particularly strong. Stock recommendations also predict earnings-announcement-day returns.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the martingale difference hypothesis (MDH) and the random walk hypothesis (RWH) for nine conventional and nine Islamic stock indices: Asia-Pacific, Canadian, Developed Country, Emerging, European, Global, Japanese, UK, and United States. It investigates whether Islamic stock indices are more, less, or as efficient as their conventional counterparts. We test four sub-periods of <b>bullish</b> and bearish <b>stock</b> markets, together with the financial meltdown and its recovery, over the period 1997 - 2012. We use the Escanciano and Lobato 2 ̆ 7 s (2009) automatic portmanteau test (AQ) and Deo 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) test for the MDH. We also apply the automatic variance ratio test (AVR) developed by Choi (1999) and Kim (2009) for the RWH. Over the period from 1997 to 2012, we find that three conventional indices (Europe, Japan, and UK) are efficient, but {{that none of the}} Islamic indices are efficient in these markets. During the recent financial crisis, our results indicate slightly more efficiency for the Islamic indices than their conventional counterparts. Our study finds that overall the conventional indices are more efficient than their Islamic counterparts. Nevertheless, during periods of general downturns the Islamic indices have shown the same level of efficiency as their counterparts. Furthermore, it appears that during the last two sub-periods under study, the Islamic indices have moved toward efficiency, displaying the same level of efficiency as their counterparts...|$|R

The {{forecasts of}} institutional investors, surveyed by Business Week, imply that they too believed that the market was in a bubble in the late 1990 s, but they expected the bubble to burst. Institutional investors were bearish in the late 1990 s, but turned <b>bullish</b> after the <b>stock</b> market decline of 2000, while individual investors turned bearish. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, was concerned about the irrational exuberance of investors on December 5, 1996, when the S&P 500 Index was at 744 and the Nasdaq Index was at 1, 300. A year later Mark Geist, president of Montgomery Asset Management, was eqQally concerned. "More than the absolute numbers it's the pattern of those numbers that concerns us, " he said in an interview with Wyatt, "If investors are expecting those kinds of returns and they don't achieve them, the danger is that they will have a kIlee-jerk reaction and pull money out of the market" (1997).

40|$|Computational {{semantic}} analysis {{was applied for}} measurements of pessimistic sentiments from business news.

It was found that the number of pessimistic and optimistic macroeconomic news is very sensitive to the sharp changes of the market indices at the extreme market conditions. A new sentiment indicator was constructed for quantitative measurements of the pessimistic investor sentiments. The proposed sentiment indicator is called a Panic Indicator. We found that the Panic Indicator is appropriate for the explanation {{of the relationship between the}} negative public information and stock index declines (S&P-TSX), as well as the sharp changes of VIX index. The proposed Panic Indicator would be useful for stock price modeling, the quantified description of the pessimistic opinions, and computational trading algorithms...|$|E
40|$|When {{stock prices}} rise, so does {{aggregate}} consumer spending. A traditional {{explanation for this}} phenomenon is based on wealth effects. However, movements {{of the stock market}} may affect consumer spending indirectly, by influencing consumer confidence. A <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market may make consumers feel more optimistic {{about the future of the}} aggregate economy, and hence increase their spending. This paper investigates the existence of the consumer confidence channel of asset price transmission in Canada. The analysis is based on the indices of consumer confidence from the Conference Board of Canada and the Toronto Stock Exchange index. The results are supportive of the consumer confidence channel at the national level. There is also evidence of asymmetric effects of stock price changes on confidence changes: declines of the stock index have larger and statistically more significant effects relative to its increases.

40|$|Two {{years have}} now elapsed since the tech-stock share bubble burst – most notably on the NASDAQ in New York, but engulfing other {{high-tech}} markets as well. In Britain, {{as in other}} countries, the overall stock market environment has been relatively bearish in the intervening period. The two events are not causally linked, in that the subsequent decline in established and blue-chip markets is not directly attributable to contagion spreading from the high-tech sector. Yet, taken together, these events have served to divert the attention of both the academic and the policy communities from the wider implications of the ‘new economy’. The ‘new economy’ became so associated {{with the image of}} an ever more <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market that the mere presence of falling share prices has stalled the debate about what the ‘new economy’ is, what benefits it could bring, and how it could be integrated into existing economic structures. I suggest that the time is now right to revisit that debate and, in so doing, to reclaim the discussion of the ‘new economy’ from the share price bubble with which it has been popularly linked...|$|E
40|$|Chinese {{mutual funds}} are growing rapidly, which have {{achieved}} a phenomenal amount of return in 2006. However, figures may lead to an overoptimistic view of Chinese mutual fund market; hence overestimate fund managers' performance. This study attempts to provide a true and fair opinion in this regard with realistic data. This dissertation studies performance of Chinese equity mutual funds over the period from 29 th July 2005 to 29 th June 2007, testing if the sample equity funds could beat the market. This research also examines if Chinese fund managers have selection abilities and market timing abilities. Jensen's Alpha, Treynor Index and Sharpe Ratio {{are used in the}} experiment to evaluate the overall performance. Then Fama Decomposition model and Treynor & Mazuy model are employed to assess the fund manager's ability to select undervalued stocks and time the market. A hypothesis test is incorporated in this research to examine the validity of data results. The conclusion of this study is consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis, i. e. Chinese equity mutual funds cannot beat the market, but it does not suggest that Chinese market is strong-form efficient. Actually, fund managers can neither select undervalued stocks nor time the market. They primarily earn profits from bearing high risk and good luck. In addition, the current <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market has also made a considerable contribution...|$|E
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s the ‘new economy ’ became synonymous with <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> markets and in-credible riches created by dotcom entrepre-neurs {{out of thin}} air. Simultaneously, and with {{considerably}} less fan-fare, the use of information and communication technology (ICT) progressed in Finnish busi-ness. As late as 1995, firms with Internet access accounted for only one fourth of total business employment. By {{the end of the}} decade, this technology was nearly completely diffused. Up until the mid- 1990 s the ICT–performance literature tended to conclude that ICT did not have measurable impacts. Many later studies find that ICT is indeed positively linked to per-formance. Since previous literature has been recently reviewed by, e. g., Dedrick et al. (2003) and Pilat (2003), we will only discuss it briefly. Macro-level studies show that ICT has consid-erable economic effects through the expansion of ICT-related production of goods and services as well as via capital deepening. In the U. S., these effects are primarily driven by the use of ICT (Jorgenson, 2001; Oliner and Sichel, 2000), whereas in Finland they are primarily driven by the provision of ICT (Jalava, 2002; Jalava and Pohjola, 2002).

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the circumstances and events surrounding bull runs in Malaysia from 1990 to 2015. The research question posed here is: What were the historical circumstances and events surrounding bull runs in Malaysia? Design/methodology/approach – Case study approach is used. This research resorts to multiple resources such as academic journals, macroeconomic statistics, official publications, stock broker reports, annual reports of listed companies as well as articles from regional newspaper and magazines. Findings – The results show that the bull runs in recent years happened with lower volatility after the Asian Financial Crisis. It can be conjectured that the specific environment in which the bull runs occurred can be somewhat different from period to period. Based on stylised facts and historical evidence, this study identified five major themes that were behind the bull markets in Malaysia, which include capital flow, spill-over effect from global development, change in ratings, speculative activities and investors’ sentiment, as well as government policies announcement. The findings have practical implications for investors who seek to understand and predict stock market boom through lessons learned from historical perspective. Research limitations/implications – The analysis in this paper may have limitation, as the facts gathered are from secondary sources, which sources are derived from the observations of others. Therefore, secondary sources inevitably reflect the assumptions and biases of the people who wrote them. As the availability of data is limited by factors that are not under the control of the researcher, results may likely be limited in their generalizability. This case study does not attempt to establish causality or relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock prices. Further studies would therefore be necessary to examine the evolving nature of the relationship that may exist. Practical implications – The findings of this study have significant policy implications for Malaysia, and also for other emerging markets. First, a prudent macroeconomic measures and concerted stance on fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy to improve fundamentals and smooth volatility in the business cycle is vital for a <b>bullish</b> <b>stock</b> market. Second, the stock market derived significant benefits from openness to foreign capital and its resilience can be enhanced by fostering deeper and more liquid capital markets with diverse institutional investors, including domestic and foreign participants. Third, the environment that affects a stock market could be related to the political, regulatory and global environments. Malaysia stock market is susceptible to extreme events, capital flow, speculative activities and government interventions. Having a good grasp of which themes are operative at any point in time is central to investment decision making. Continuous rebalancing of portfolios based on information arriving in the market is also vital. Originality/value – Previous studies on Malaysian stock market movement focus on quantitative analysis based on macroeconomic variable. This research is original in terms of giving background information and additional context to explain phenomena missed by quantitative research methods. The construction of quantitative model is also constraint by the measurability of non-quantitative data and data with different frequencies (such as annual, quarterly and monthly data). Therefore, it is important to contemplate the importance of non-quantitative factors, such as political, legal, regulatory and governance considerations. This study seeks to fill in this void...|$|E
