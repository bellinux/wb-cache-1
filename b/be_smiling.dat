5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central front face may <b>be</b> <b>smiling.</b> Sometimes, the back face may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata (matted hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to <b>be,</b> <b>smiling</b> at passersby.|$|E

2500|$|During a 2011 interview, Pratchett {{discussed}} his process for writing, and mentioned a self-invented goddess of writers called Narrativia, whom he believed to <b>be</b> <b>smiling</b> upon him throughout his career.

Pratchett stated that he had picked the name at random, and was later [...] "astonished when he noticed what it sounded like backwards. Suddenly, he knew of what this particular horseman would be a harbinger." [...] In a direct quote Pratchett revealed his satisfaction with this coincidence, [...] "I thought chaos – yes!

2500|$|Der Spiegel {{published}} three {{photos of}} U.S. soldiers posing with {{the bodies of}} Afghans they had killed. One of the photos shows SPC Jeremy Morlock {{next to one of}} them. He appears to <b>be</b> <b>smiling</b> and raising the head of a corpse by the hair. Other images published later in Rolling Stone include one of two unidentified Afghans cuffed together around a milestone and wearing a cardboard handwritten sign made out of a MRE package box that read [...] "Talibans are Dead". Other photos were taken of mutilated body parts, among them one of a head being maneuvered with a stick. Two videos were also published, one of two possibly armed Afghans on a motorcycle gunned down by members of another battalion of the 5th Stryker brigade called [...] "Motorcycle Kill", and one called [...] "Death Zone" [...] of gunsight footage with jeerings heard in the background showing two Afghans suspected of planting an IED killed in an airstrike with Apocalyptica single [...] "En Vie" [...] as a soundtrack. Senior officials at NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Kabul have compared the pictures published to the images of U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in Abu Ghraib in Iraq.|$|E
