50|$|The {{bill would}} revise the {{additional}} requirement {{that such a}} reasonable charge be paid to a third party unaffiliated with the creditor. Requires the charge to be: (1) a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> third party <b>charge</b> not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate; or (2) a fee or premium for title examination, title insurance, or similar purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bill would}} modify the {{conditions}} under which federal departments and agencies may exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from an income verification requirement that, at the time a refinancing is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan and all applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments. Repeals the exception for <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> third party <b>charges</b> not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate from the requirement that total points and fees not exceed 3% of the total new loan amount. (Thus subjects such charges to the same 3% ceiling.) ...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on a novel}} {{first class}} algebra, we develop an {{extension}} of the pure spinor (PS) formalism of Berkovits, in which the PS constraints are removed. By using the homological perturbation theory in an essential way, the BRST-like charge Q of the conventional PS formalism is promoted to a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> nilpotent <b>charge</b> ˆ Q, the cohomology of which is equivalent to the constrained cohomology of Q. This construction requires only a minimum number (five) of additional fermionic ghost-antighost pairs and the vertex operators for the massless modes of open string are obtained in a systematic way. Furthermore, we present a simple composite “b-ghost ” field B(z) which realizes the important relation T(z) = { ˆ Q, B(z) }, with T(z) the Virasoro operator, and apply it to facilitate the construction of the integrated vertex. The present formalism utilizes U(5) parametrization and the manifest Lorentz covariance is yet to be achieved...|$|R
5000|$|The most unscrupulous type {{of music}} {{publisher}} is the songshark, who does little if any real [...] "legwork" [...] or promotion on behalf of songwriters. Songsharks make their profit not on royalties from sales, but by charging inexperienced writers for [...] "services" [...] (some real, such as demo recording or musical arranging, some fictional, such as [...] "audition" [...] or [...] "review" [...] fees) a legitimate publisher would provide without cost to the writer, {{as part of their}} job. (By comparison, a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> publisher who <b>charges</b> admission to a workshop for writers, where songs may be auditioned or reviewed, isn't wrong to do so.) ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to understand however that this case and Sidebottom before it, established one of the two limbs of the modern day <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> intentions test. The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> test comprises two tests. One objective (as this case and Sidebottom established) and one subjective test. Greenhalgh v Ardene Cinemas established the subjective limb of the <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> test. The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> test is thus a hybrid of these two methods of assessment.|$|R

5000|$|The shelter rule is a {{doctrine}} {{in the common}} law of property under which a grantee who has received an interest in property from a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser will also be protected as a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser, even if the grantee would not legally qualify for this status. The grantee is [...] "sheltered" [...] from other claims by the grantor's status as an actual <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser.|$|R
50|$|Examples of <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> errors include clerical, calculation, {{computer}} malfunction and programming, {{and printing}} errors. An error of legal judgment is NOT a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> error, nor {{is a failure}} to provide notices or other material information.|$|R
50|$|In American law, a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> {{purchaser}} who unknowingly {{purchases and}} subsequently sells stolen goods will, at common law, {{be held liable}} in trover for the full market value of those goods as of the date of conversion. Since the true owner retains legal title, the seller is liable even in a chain of successive <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchasers (i.e., the true owner can successfully sue the fifth <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser in trover). However, the problem of successive <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchasers can be remedied: If the jurisdiction recognises an implied warranty that the seller has title to the property (Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States), then the <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser can sue the seller for breach of that implied warranty. Courts of equity traditionally also recognise various other exceptions, likely giving rise to the idea embodied in the modern UCC.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> {{residence}} test, {{like the}} physical presence test, comprises {{one way that}} an individual can qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. In order {{to qualify for the}} <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> residence test, an individual needs to reside in a foreign country for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year. In addition, the <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> residence test takes into account factors such as the individual's intention, the purpose of the trip, and the length and nature of the stay. There are special deductions and exclusions that accompany this only if the individual is a U.S citizen or U.S resident Alien and has a tax treaty. The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> residence is not always the same as the domicile. The domicile is defined as one's permanent home.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bona</b> <b>fides</b> is a Latin phrase meaning [...] "good faith". Its {{ablative}} case is <b>bona</b> <b>fide,</b> meaning [...] "in good faith", it {{is often}} used as an adjective to mean [...] "genuine". While today fides is concomitant to faith, a more technical translation of the Latin concept would be something like [...] "reliability", {{in the sense of}} a trust between two parties for the potentiality of a relationship. In ancient Rome <b>bona</b> <b>fides</b> was always assumed by both sides, had implied responsibilities, and both legal and religious consequences if broken. Fides was one of the original virtues to be considered a religious [...] "divinity" [...] in Roman paganism.|$|R
