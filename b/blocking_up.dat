5|$|The {{experience}} encouraged Gaunt {{to further}} expand Dunstanburgh's defences {{over the next}} two years. A wide range of work was carried out {{under the direction of the}} constable, Thomas of Ilderton, and the mason Henry of Holme, including <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> the entrance in the gatehouse to turn it into a keep. In 1384 a Scottish army attacked the castle but they lacked siege equipment and were unable to take the defences. Gaunt lost interest in the property after he gave up his role as the Lieutenant of the Marches. Dunstanburgh Castle remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster, but the Duchy was annexed to the Crown when Gaunt's son, Henry IV, took the throne of England in 1399.|$|E
5|$|When {{civil war}} broke out in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of Charles and those of Parliament, Camber Castle had not been entirely closed and was {{being used as a}} royal munitions store. The citizens of Rye sided with Parliament, which agreed that the weapons and stores in the castle should be removed and taken to the town for safe-keeping. Concerned that it might be seized by Royalist forces, Parliament went on to dismantle the castle over the next year, stripping the lead from the roof, <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> the gunports and demolishing the living accommodation. As a result, Camber Castle was not used by the Royalists during the Second English Civil War in 1648, despite several other of the Device Forts along the south coast being occupied.|$|E
25|$|However, Operation Tracer in Gibraltar {{was never}} activated. In May 1943 Allied armies {{completed}} {{the capture of}} North Africa, and on 17 August they drove the last Axis forces out of Sicily, rendering the threat to Gibraltar negligible. On 24 August 1943, the Director of Naval Intelligence sent a highly classified, one-time pad message in which he ordered one last wireless communications exercise, as well as <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> of the chambers and distribution of the provisions that had been stored there. The manual for Operation Tracer is at the Naval Intelligence Division, #1001107/42. It elaborates on the selection of personnel, as well as heating, lighting, and sanitation. In addition, it has a dozen appendices on food, clothing, utensils, tools, equipment, furniture, cooking, stationery, games, library, sundries, medical stores, and surgical instruments. The manual also discusses the challenges encountered in constructing the covert facility.|$|E

2500|$|In an October 1960 {{letter to}} his {{colleague}} Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering creative block: [...] "Well then - a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease. It’s a warning bell: something is <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> his system." [...] Unclear about the script, its title, and his protagonist’s profession, he scouted locations throughout Italy “looking for the film” {{in the hope of}} resolving his confusion. Flaiano suggested La bella confusione (literally The Beautiful Confusion) as the movie’s title. Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on 8½, a self-referential title referring principally (but not exclusively) to the number of films he had directed up to that time.|$|E

60|$|After {{the rain}} of ashes came {{a shower of}} blazing stones, which fell uninterruptedly, setting fire to {{all parts of the}} city and <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> the streets with burning masses. And then a fresh storm of ashes {{sweeping}} down would partly smother the flames, but, <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> the doorways, would stifle those within the houses. And to add to the horror, the volumes of smoke that poured from the mountain caused a darkness deeper than night to settle on the doomed city, through which the people groped their way, except when lighted by the burning houses. What horror and confusion in the streets! Friends seeking each other with faces of utter despair; the groans of the dying mingled with the crash of falling buildings; the pelting of the fiery stones; the shrieks of women and children; the terrific peals of thunder.|$|E
