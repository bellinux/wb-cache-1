500|$|Breaking {{from his}} 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain {{supported}} the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, saying {{not to do}} so would amount to a tax increase. Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which would involve legalization, guest worker programs, and <b>border</b> <b>enforcement</b> components. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House. In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an [...] "amnesty" [...] program, and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate.|$|E

2500|$|Bloomberg was a {{supporter}} of immigration reform to secure the rights of illegal immigrants, who comprise {{a large part of}} the population of New York City.

[...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. <b>Border</b> <b>enforcement</b> meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates.
