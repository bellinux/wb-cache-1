5|$|A recent (2015) {{application}} of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information {{for days at}} a time; these could allow sensitive quantum data to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> to a hard disk-like device and shipped around the country.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E
5|$|For home storage, most cultivars {{of apple}} {{can be held}} for {{approximately}} two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5°C). Some, including 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji', can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> {{up to a year}} without significant degradation.|$|E
5000|$|Versioned file content <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in {{a master}} {{directory}} hierarchy whose top levels are called [...] "depots".Text file revisions <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> as RCS deltas, and binary file revisions <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in their entirety.|$|R

Prinergy also has archival and retrieval capabilities.|$|R
5|$|Sounds can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> as Programs, {{which include}} the {{instrument}} source, effects types, and settings. There are 400 storage locations – 4 banks with 100 programs in each – {{all of which can}} be overwritten with user programs. There are 300 independent storage locations for Synth patches.|$|E
5|$|The {{market for}} sodium is {{volatile}} {{due to the}} difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent {{the formation of a}} surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide.|$|E
5|$|A $1 million {{insurance}} policy was secured against the diamond with Lloyd's of London. The terms set by Lloyd's stipulated {{that it could}} only be publicly worn for thirty days in any given year, that it <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in a vault, and that Taylor was to be accompanied by armed guards when wearing it in public. Taylor would later have a replica made of the diamond that cost $2,800.|$|E
50|$|MAPPER's data <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> as a {{character}} representation, rather than, say, binary values. Even numeric fields <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> as text.|$|R

5000|$|Data <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in a vEB tree as follows: The {{smallest}} value {{currently in}} the tree <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in [...] and largest value <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in [...] Note that [...] <b>is</b> not <b>stored</b> {{anywhere else in the}} vEB tree, while [...] is. If T is empty then we use the convention that [...] and [...] Any other value x <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in the subtree [...] where [...] The auxiliary tree [...] keeps track of which children are non-empty, so [...] contains the value j if and only if [...] is non-empty.|$|R
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Canning is {{a process}} during which the enzymes in {{vegetables}} are deactivated and the micro-organisms present killed by heat. The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration. The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used {{in order to prevent}} the mechanical breakdown of the product and to preserve the flavor as far as is possible. The can is then able to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> at ambient temperatures for a long period.|$|E
5|$|Carrots can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> {{for several}} months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can {{be placed in a}} bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E

5|$|Commercially, apples can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> {{for some}} months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide}} and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, it should not <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with {{a short list of}} other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Ice had to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method {{for doing this}} was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

5000|$|Storage Method: Describes {{the form}} in which files <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in the repository. A {{snapshot}} indicates that a committed file(s) <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in its entirety—usually compressed. A changeset, in this context, indicates that a committed file(s) <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> {{in the form of}} a difference between either the previous version or the next.|$|R
5|$|In the Republic of China, {{nuclear waste}} storage {{facility}} was {{built at the}} Southern tip of Orchid Island in Taitung County, offshore of Taiwan Island. The facility was built in 1982 and it is {{owned and operated by}} Taipower. The facility receives nuclear waste from Taipower's current three nuclear power plants. However, due to the strong resistance from local community in the island, the nuclear waste has to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> at the power plant facilities themselves.|$|E
5|$|Machines that {{generated}} static electricity {{with a glass}} disc were popular and widespread in Europe by 1740. In 1745, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek discovered independently that the electric charge from these machines could <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in a Leyden jar, named after the city of Leiden in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Norway {{prohibited}} {{nuclear warheads}} to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> on its soil, preventing Banak from serving in {{a role as}} a base for US nuclear-armed bombers. NATO's military interest for Banak peaked during the late 1960s. Increased range of Soviet aircraft during the 1970s diminished the need for troops in Finnmark; combined with Norwegian tension and nuclear policies, this caused the United States to favor Vestfjorden and Troms over Banak as the primary areas of defense.|$|E
50|$|Symbolic names <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in the COFF {{symbol table}}. Each symbol table entry {{includes}} a name, storage class, type, value and section number. Short names (8 characters or fewer) <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> {{directly in the}} symbol table; longer names <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> as an offset into the string table {{at the end of}} the COFF object.|$|R

5000|$|Chavannes {{used the}} term [...] "vital force" [...] to {{describe}} the intellectual, emotional and sexual energy stored within the body. Intellectual vital force, he believed, <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in the brain, emotional vital force <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> behind the heart, and sexual vital force <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in the genitalia. Memory {{is the result of}} modifications to a person's vital force.|$|R
5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in quantities {{large enough to}} meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{radioactive}} waste at Hanford {{was supposed to}} <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in the planned Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, but after that project was suspended, Washington State sued, joined by South Carolina. Their first suit was dismissed in July 2011. In a subsequent suit, federal authorities were ordered to either approve or reject plans for the Yucca Mountain storage site.|$|E
5|$|Some site opponents assert that, {{after the}} {{predicted}} containment {{failure of the}} waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> {{in such a way}} as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.|$|E
50|$|The line {{index and}} data <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> on {{separate}} disk pages {{except for the}} smallest (one page) files, where the line index and data <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> together.|$|R
