In addition, the filter paper storage demonstrated a faster absorption of free amino nitrogen and a highest level of higher aliphatic alcohols production during propagation than other preservation methods, which {{can be attributed to}} intensive cell growth during propagation.

40|$|New {{malting barley}} {{varieties}} are annually tested for their malting and brewing potential {{according to a}} field trial set-up combined with quality evaluation on pilot scale. To assess the effects of trial year and location on quality evaluation data, a data base consisting of quality data from Dutch malting and brewing trials of new malting barley varieties during the period 1989 - 1995 was analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. It was also determined which parameters gave little or no discrimination among varieties over the years. The analysis showed that strong annual effects occurred over the period observed. A considerable list of 23 analytical parameters from barley, malt, wort, and <b>beer</b> <b>analysis</b> were relevant to explain 50 % {{of the variance in}} the data set. Seven parameters showed hardly any variation and possessed no discriminative value. This indicated that the number of parameters could be diminished to some extent without losing resolving power with respect to quality evaluation. A further reduction is possible when, of two parameters showing high positive or negative correlations, only one is analyzed. Quality data from different trial locations were prone to annual effects. The trends observed showed clustering of data from particular trial locations with discrimination among locations in certain years. From this evaluation, it could not yet be concluded whether or not a limitation in the number of trial sites is feasible. The evaluation offers an approach towards further increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of existing trial systems. © 1998 by the American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc...|$|E

A central composite circumscribed design was employed to study {{the effect of the}} experimental variables on the extraction of 28 representative volatile compounds of beer flavour profile. The parameters of the models were estimated by multiple linear regressions. The strongest influence in the volatile extraction yield was the volume of the sample (V) and the extraction temperature (T), with a positive and a negative effect, respectively. The performance characteristics of the optimised method were also determined, showing adequate linear ranges, repeatability, detection and quantification limits. The optimised methodology was applied to the same beer sample stored during 5 months at three different temperature conditions (4, 20 and 40 °C). Sampling was performed monthly, and the results showed that the concentration of most volatile compounds decreased during beer storage, although the rate of decrease was clearly higher at room temperature (20 °C) compared with refrigeration conditions (4 °C). Accelerated ageing conditions (40 °C) showed the most different volatile profile. Sensory analysis also revealed large differences in the overall quality of the samples, showing that even at room temperature the aroma profile of beer is greatly modified during its shelf life. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
