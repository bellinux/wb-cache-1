500|$|The {{vice presidential}} {{nomination}} was considered no president {{had failed to}} complete his elected term. [...] Not much attention {{was given to the}} choice, and the specifics of how Tyler came to gain it are unclear. [...] Chitwood pointed out that Tyler was a logical candidate: as a Southern slaveowner, he balanced the ticket and also assuaged the fears of Southerners who felt Harrison might have abolitionist leanings. Tyler had been a vice-presidential candidate in 1836, and having him on the ticket might win Virginia, the most populous state in the South. One of the convention managers, New York publisher Thurlow Weed, alleged that [...] "Tyler was finally taken <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get nobody else to accept"—though he did not say this until after the subsequent break between President Tyler and the Whig Party. Other Tyler foes claimed that he had wept himself into the White House, after crying at Clay's defeat; this was unlikely, as the Kentuckian had backed Tyler’s opponent Rives in the Senate election. Tyler's name was submitted in the balloting, and though Virginia abstained, he received the necessary majority. Tyler, as president, was accused of having gained the nomination by concealing his views, and responded that he had not been asked about them. His biographer, Robert Seager II, held that Tyler was selected because of a dearth of alternative candidates. Seager concluded, [...] "He was put on the ticket to draw the South to Harrison. [...] No more, no less." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ros-Lehtinen opposed President Donald Trump's 2017 {{executive}} order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. She stated that [...] "I {{object to the}} suspension of visas from the seven named countries <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Solving the {{unbounded}} {{knapsack problem}} can be made easier by throwing away items which will never be needed. [...] For a given item i, suppose we could find a set of items J such that their total weight {{is less than the}} weight of i, and their total value is greater than the value of i. [...] Then i cannot appear in the optimal solution, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> always improve any potential solution containing i by replacing i with the set J. [...] Therefore, we can disregard the i-th item altogether. [...] In such cases, J is said to dominate i. [...] (Note that this does not apply to bounded knapsack problems, since we may have already used up the items in J.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore. He knew darn well I was doing it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use a little money these days. Who can't?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton's {{style and}} {{thinking}} were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed {{to those of}} Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book Heretics, Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: [...] "The same lesson [...] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. [...] It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw." [...] More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in Orthodoxy concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: [...] "Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde." ...|$|E

But three or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow, and if you keep on, I think our best way is to do the same.' ...|$|R
30|$|One {{week after}} the second CS, the patient {{underwent}} the surgery. <b>Because,</b> intraoperatively, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not find out the tumor at the preoperative marking site, we resected the transverse colon at the distance of 5  cm from the marking and dissected the marginal and intermediate lymph nodes. Consequently, partial surgical resection of the transverse colon and D 2 lymph node dissection were performed.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'd better go," [...] said I, and Menendez, in no good humor, put {{his boat}} about. We found the other boat aground, {{in the very}} worst way. The old Minorcan {{said that he could}} see that sand-bar through the water, and that they might as well have run up on dry land. Better, for that matter, <b>because</b> then <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have pushed her off.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, we're not babies," [...] said Dot, earnestly. [...] "We're quite grown up. And we {{came here}} <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not help it. In a few minutes we will go away again into the next Valley." ...|$|E
5000|$|Looking {{back with}} 20/20, I wish that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have had better {{communication}} with ElcomSoft, Dmitry Sklyarov and the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) before {{the whole thing}} went public.

50|$|Note however, {{that many}} of these values have been {{truncated}} because they contain repeating fractions. When we try to store these in our fixed point format, we're going to lose some of our precision (which didn't seem all that precise when they were just integers). This is an interesting problem <b>because</b> <b>we</b> said <b>we</b> <b>could</b> fit 256 different values into our 8 bit format, and we're only trying to store values from a range with 161 possible values (0 through 160). As it turns out, the problem was our scale factor, 11, which introduced unnecessary precision requirements. The resolution of the problem is to find a better scaling factor.

60|$|The cravings of {{his heart}} in this respect are evident, we think, {{throughout}} his career; {{and if we have}} dwelt with more significancy than others upon his intercourse with the beautiful Horneck family, it is <b>because</b> <b>we</b> fancied <b>we</b> <b>could</b> detect, amid his playful attentions to one of its members, a lurking sentiment of tenderness, kept down by conscious poverty and a humiliating idea of personal defects. A hopeless feeling of this kind--the last a man would communicate to his friends--might account for much of that fitfulness of conduct, and that gathering melancholy, remarked, but not comprehended by his associates, during the last year or two of his life; and may {{have been one of the}} troubles of the mind which aggravated his last illness, and only terminated with his death.|$|R
5000|$|All {{four members}} {{moved into a}} squat in Peckham and spent a year living hand-to-mouth and writing {{original}} material. Bob Dalton later commented [...] "it was actually the perfect situation <b>because</b> all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> afford to do was write songs 24/7. All that time was the making of us. We became strong writers and strong players." [...] Their demo tape eventually secured them a management deal with Martyn Mayhead (at WEA Records), and shortly afterwards a recording contract with Virgin Records.|$|R

Following the race, the Renault driver blamed damp patches {{on the track}} for the incident, adding that [...] "It's a shame <b>because</b> I'm sure <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have done something today."
