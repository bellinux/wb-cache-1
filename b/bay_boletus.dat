40|$|There is {{an obvious}} need to develop {{efficient}} countermeasure agents for use in emergency situations or as adjuncts to radiotherapy to protect healthy tissues {{from the consequences of}} an irradiation. To this end, we have investigated the capacity of norbadione A, a polyphenol extracted from the edible mushroom <b>Bay</b> <b>boletus</b> to reduce the toxicity of ionizing radiation towards cultured cells and whole-body exposed mice. Results indicate that this compound could slightly enhance the resistance of TK 6 lymphoid cells to radiation and increase the survival rate in lethally irradiated mice. However, norbadione A was found to be cytotoxic at concentrations over 30 &μυ;M in vitro. The acute toxicity of this compound also precluded its use at higher doses for enhanced in vivo radioprotection. Norbadione A may nevertheless serve as lead for development of less toxic analogs with potentially cytoprotective/ radioprotective activities. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers...|$|E
50|$|Two of {{the best}} common edible boletes, however, are the <b>bay</b> bolete (<b>Boletus</b> badius), whose pores bruise blue-green, and the orange birch bolete, which is a Leccinum with an orange cap and which bruises a bluish grey.|$|R
50|$|Norbadione A is a pigment {{found in}} the <b>bay</b> bolete {{mushroom}} (<b>Boletus</b> badius). A polyphenol, norbadione A is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. The molecule has also been reported as a potassium salt from the mushrooms Pisolithus tinctorius (horse dung fungus) and Chalciporus piperatus.|$|R
