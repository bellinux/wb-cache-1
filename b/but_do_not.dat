Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> swim together parallel {{to each other}} (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> accept the domain method.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes {{that require}} a {{cofactor}} <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel FaurÃ© {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. FaurÃ©'s reasons for composing the work are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> appear to have {{had anything to do}} with the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
