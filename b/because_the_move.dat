2500|$|Koga did karate for {{two years}} in {{elementary}} school, and judo in his second year of junior high school. He had not shown much interest in sumo but was asked by his parents to take part in sumo competitions. It was at one such competition in Fukuoka that he was spotted by the wrestler Kaiki, later Tomozuna Oyakata. After being introduced to him by a mutual acquaintance in Nōgata, the young Koga was recruited to Tomozuna stable upon graduation from junior high. Kaiki thought so highly of the apprentice that he promised Koga's parents that he would become a sekitori by the age of 20. [...] However, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> had been set up by others around him, and he had not ever had the ambition to be a rikishi himself, Koga initially had doubts that {{he would be able to}} succeed in sumo.|$|E
50|$|In the Cambridge rules, this capture is not possible. The move is legal, but {{it captures}} {{only the two}} leapers, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> is not a legal move {{for any of the}} other target pieces. In the absence of the two black leapers, the same move would capture the other five pieces.|$|E

It has 12 congregations in the Canton, in Brig, Visp, Leuk-Les-Brains, Sierre, Crans-Montana, Sion, Coude Rhone Martigny-Saxon, 2 Rivers, Monthey, Haut-Lac.|$|E

50|$|Just as Shazam {{had gotten}} {{lost in the}} wake of Carl Wayne's {{departure}} and Wood's new, wild on-stage persona, Looking On was also not a hit. Fly chose not to promote it extensively, in part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Move</b> had fled the company to join EMI's new Harvest Records label shortly after sessions for the album were completed.|$|E
5000|$|The Sultan was mollified {{somewhat}} when {{during the}} governorship of Sir Laurence Guillemard there was intense activity to decentralise powers from the centre at Kuala Lumpur {{back to the}} individual States comprising the Federated Malay States. But {{he did not see}} the scheme materialise. Neither did his successor <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> was still going on when the Japanese invaded Malaya.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the [...] "Flash" [...] {{was done}} twice. Once {{as a full}} horn line, and a second time a soloists does it {{in the center of}} a {{rotating}} block. This is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> is 5 counts and the title of the show that year was [...] "Five!" [...] Both times, the visual can be viewed on the DVD in the upper right hand corner.|$|E

5000|$|The Reform (1859) in {{his right}} hand has a {{parchment}} unrolled and in left an open book covered with a robe, and wearing a skirt, it looks like progress <b>because</b> <b>the</b> folds <b>the</b> <b>move</b> of their clothes and his hair is wavy.|$|R
50|$|The 2003 season had {{drastic changes}} <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>move</b> of {{television}} coverage to the lower-rated Speed Channel. Robbins ended {{his involvement with}} ASA.|$|R
5000|$|At first glance, {{it might}} seem that Black can simply interpose a piece between White's bishop and his king to block the check (for example, 3...Bd7 or 3...Nc6 or 3...c6). But any piece so {{interposed}} immediately [...] "disappears" [...] when it transfers to board B. And Black cannot escape check by fleeing to the opposite board via 3...Kd7, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> is not a legal move on board A. Therefore, it is checkmate.|$|E
5000|$|Joining the Atlantic 10 Conference {{presented}} some challenges, including schedule adjustments, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> came a {{year ahead}} of schedule. [...] For example, the Bulldogs {{were scheduled to}} play an exhibition game against the defending Atlantic 10 champions, the Dayton Flyers, but the game had to be rescheduled as a conference game later in the season. Other teams had to redo their schedules {{in a matter of}} weeks after their previously finalized schedules were already released.|$|E
5000|$|March {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Brighton in November 2011. At {{the time of his}} transfer it was reported by the Brighton Argus that March had also been offered a contract with Millwall and a trial with Newcastle United. [...] Lewes manager Steve King suggested that March had been attracted to Brighton because of the style of football they were playing under manager Gus Poyet and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> to another East Sussex club would allow him to remain close to his family.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{heavy rain}} forced the Jaipur to be <b>moved</b> from <b>the</b> turf to the sloppy main track. <b>Because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> <b>the</b> stakes race lost its Grade III status for that renewal.|$|R

50|$|In August 21, {{the rain}} was {{expanded}} to Gyeonggi and Gangwon <b>because</b> <b>the</b> rainfall <b>moved</b> north. A reservoir in Yeongcheon was destroyed <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> rain, and in Daegu, one child disappeared, and another died <b>because</b> <b>the</b> river overflowed.|$|R
50|$|Nadi Township was {{established}} in 1947. Around that time the colonial government of Fiji established offices on the higher grounds of Nadi. A few businesses were then established around the government offices to service them, and other business organisations {{from other parts of}} Fiji followed suit. Some concerned citizens of Nadi attempted to move the town centre to Martintar because the existing centre was prone to flooding, but this did not eventuate <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> Nadi Township had already developed strong roots in its existing location.|$|E
50|$|On this {{particular}} move, the voting was {{further complicated by}} a large faction in favor of 19...Nd4, with a counterattack, {{and this was the}} recommendation of both Felecan and Paehtz. The winning total of 35% for 19...Qb4 was the lowest winning total for any move of the game, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> essentially forced Kasparov to intensify his attack on the kingside. Note that a queen trade was strategically out of the question for White, as it leads to a favorable endgame for Black.|$|E
50|$|His {{next move}} {{was due to}} be to Southern League team Bath City, but <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> from Wales to England counts as an {{international}} transfer under FIFA rules there was a delay {{while he waited for}} the international transfer window to open. During this time he temporarily signed for Carmarthen Town, before finally being able to move to Bath in September 2003. Two months later, in November 2003, he moved to Aylesbury United who were playing in the Ryman League at the time. In January 2004 he had an unsuccessful trial with Queens Park Rangers and was later released by Aylesbury. Later he returned to Wales and joined Carmarthen Town for a second spell at the club.|$|E
50|$|Sine-Saloum {{has long}} been feared by even Europe's most {{distinguished}} mariners <b>because</b> <b>the</b> sandbanks <b>move,</b> particularly in Sangomar. This danger to outsiders has long protected the region and preserved its individual villages.|$|R
50|$|Strongly near-sighted wearers {{of contact}} lenses do not {{experience}} chromatic aberration <b>because</b> <b>the</b> lens <b>moves</b> with <b>the</b> cornea, {{as the eye}} turns, and always stays centered {{in the middle of}} the wearer's gaze.|$|R
50|$|Trilobite faunas of the {{continental}} shelves of Baltica and Laurentia are still very different in the Ordovician, but Silurian faunas show progressive mixing of species from both sides, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> continents <b>moved</b> closer together.|$|R
5000|$|Jennifer {{was born}} in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Her mother was English and {{her father was a}} Brazilian of Spanish and Irish ancestry. She and her older brother Michael were raised in New Rochelle, New York, and Wilton, Connecticut. When she was 14, the family moved to New York City. On Easter Sunday, 1962, O'Neill {{attempted}} suicide <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> would separate her from her dog Mandy and horse Monty — [...] "her whole world". That same year, she was discovered by the Ford modeling agency. By age 15, while attending the prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan, she was appearing on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Seventeen, earning $80,000 a year in 1962.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, {{nine years}} after the 1989 Revolution, the Cartea Românească {{building}} was returned to its rightful owner; the Ministry of Culture {{had to take the}} statue into its patrimony, and subsequently moved it in front of a house where Caragiale lived once, on Maria Rosetti Street. In 2002, Dinu Săraru, chairman of the National Theatre Bucharest, oversaw the statue's move to a new location on University Square, in front of the Theatre's building. After Săraru resigned from office, on 11 February 2006, it was moved back to Maria Rosetti Street, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> had not been approved and, as such, was technically illegal. A statue of the major Romanian actor Grigore Vasiliu Birlic, is planned to take its place in University Square.|$|E
50|$|The {{programme}} {{remained in}} limbo until Television New Zealand, {{in association with}} Channel 4, commissioned Worzel Gummidge Down Under in 1987, which was shot on location in New Zealand and ran for two series totaling 22 episodes. Only Pertwee and Stubbs remained from the original cast, with Bruce Phillips joining the cast as the Crowman (Geoffrey Bayldon declined to reprise the role, partly because he didn't want to be typecast in the part, but also <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> to New Zealand was not convenient for him) and Olivia Ihimaera-Smiler, daughter of prominent Māori author Witi Ihimaera joining {{as one of the}} children. The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson received an early credit for his work providing special effects for the series.|$|E
2500|$|During World War I the Irish Sea {{became known}} as [...] "U-boat Alley", <b>because</b> <b>the</b> U-boats <b>moved</b> their {{emphasis}} from the Atlantic to the Irish Sea after the United States entered the war in 1917.|$|R
5000|$|The I-94 derecho was a {{progressive}} derecho that <b>moved</b> through <b>the</b> Upper Mississippi Valley on July 19, 1983. It is so called <b>because</b> <b>the</b> derecho <b>moved</b> through Minnesota and Wisconsin with I-94 as its axis.|$|R

Lt Col. Lawal Jafaru Isa though a Muslim did not have a problem participating as a special guest of honor. That was good judgment <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> ensured that Christians began to trust him and had good faith in the government to defend all lives of the citizens irrespective of ethnic background. The good intention of Lt Col. Lawal Jafaru Isa in uniting all residents in the state created a model for subsequent governors to follow, which is to act with urgency in any occurrence of even the slightest of crisis.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The first Brewers uniforms were [...] "hand-me-downs" [...] {{from the}} Seattle Pilots. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> to Milwaukee {{received}} final approval {{less than a}} week {{before the start of the}} season, there was no time to order new uniforms. Selig had originally planned to change the Brewers' colors to navy blue and red in honor of the minor league American Association's Milwaukee Brewers, but was forced to simply remove the Seattle markings from the Pilots' blue-and-gold uniforms and sew [...] "BREWERS" [...] on the front. However, the outline of the Pilots' logo remained visible. The uniforms had unique striping on the sleeves left over from the Pilots days. The cap was an updated version of the Milwaukee Braves cap in blue and yellow. Ultimately, it was decided to keep blue and gold as the team colors, and they have remained so ever since.|$|E
5000|$|Our Bodies, Ourselves is a {{book about}} women's health and {{sexuality}} produced by the nonprofit organization Our Bodies Ourselves (originally called the Boston Women's Health Book Collective). First published in 1971, it contains information related to many aspects of women's health and sexuality, including sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity, birth control, abortion, pregnancy and childbirth, violence and abuse and menopause. The most recent edition of the book was published in 2011. This informational book about women’s health advised women to claim their sexuality for their own pleasure, and included chapters about reproductive health and rights, and lesbian sexuality and independence. This was revolutionary <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> toward women’s active engagement with their actual sexual desires was contradicting the popular gendered myth of [...] “women as docile, and passive,” and “men as active and aggressive” in a sexual relationship.|$|E
5|$|Downhill it is {{much easier}} to topple over <b>the</b> front wheel <b>because</b> <b>the</b> incline <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the pedals to try to keep m as far back as possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{resultant}} force and torque {{can be determined}} for any configuration of forces. However, an interesting special case is a torque-free resultant. This is useful, both conceptually and practically, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> body <b>moves</b> without rotating {{as if it was}} a particle.|$|R
30|$|Periodontal {{problems}} will not develop in space closure <b>because</b> <b>the</b> tooth has <b>moved</b> {{along with its}} bone and surrounding tissues.|$|R
