40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) located in the central barrel of ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is {{electron}} identification for separation from pions at momenta pt > 1 GeV/c, since in this momentum range the measurements of the specific energy loss (dE/dx) of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is no longer sufficient. Furthermore, it provides a fast trigger for high transverse momentum charged particles (pt > 3 GeV/c) and makes {{a significant contribution to}} the optimization of the tracking of reaction products in heavy-ion collisions. Its whole setup comprises 18 supermodules out of which 13 are presently operational and mounted cylindrically around the beam axis of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A supermodule contains either 30 or 24 chambers, each consisting of a radiator for transition radiation creation, a drift and an amplifying region followed by the read-out electronics. In total, the TRD is an array of 522 chambers operated with about 28 m 3 of a Xe-CO 2 [85 - 15 %] gas mixture. During the work of this thesis, the testing, commissioning, operation and maintenance of detector parts, the gas system and its online quality monitor, improvements on the detector control user-interface and studies about a new pre-trigger module for data read-out have been accomplished. The TRD gas system mixes, distributes and circulates the operational gas mixture through the detector. Its overall optimization has been achieved by minimizing gas leakage, surveying, controlling, maintaining and continuously improving it as well as designing and carrying out upgrades. Gas quality monitors of the type GOOFIE" (Gas prOportional cOunter For drIfting Electrons) can be used in gaseous detectors as on-line monitors of the electron drift velocity, gain and gas properties. One of these devices has been implemented within the TRD gas system, while another one surveys the gas of the TPC. Both devices had to be adapted to the specific needs of the detectors, were under constant surveillance and control, and needed to be further developed on both hardware and software side. To improve the operation of the TRD, modifications on its DCS software (Detector Control System) used for monitoring, controlling, operating, regulating and configuring of hardware and computing devices have been carried out. The DCS is designed to enable an operator to interact with equipment through user interfaces that display the information from the system. The main focus of this work was laid on the optimization of the usability and design of the user interface. The front-end electronics of the TRD require an early start signal (pre-trigger") from the fast forward detectors or the Time-Of-Flight detector during the running periods. The realization of a new hardware concept for the read-out of the TRD pre-trigger system has been studied and first tests were performed. This new module called PIMDDL (Pre-trigger Interface Module Detector Data Link) is meant to acquire all data necessary to simulate and predict the full pre-trigger functionality, and to verify its proper operation. Furthermore, it shall provide all functionalities of the so-called Control <b>Box</b> <b>Bottom</b> as well as keep the functionalities of the already existing PIM (Pre-trigger Interface Module) in order to combine and replace these two modules in the future...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{sediment}} samples drilled during ODP Leg 170 at Sites 1039 and 1040 were analyzed with organic geochemical and organic petrological methods. These methods included determination of organic carbon, sulfur and iron contents, Rock-Eval pyrolysis on sediments and kerogen concentrates {{as well as}} gas chromatographic studies of the soluble organic matter n-alkane and fatty acid distributions. With these studies information about type, origin and preservation of the organic matter was obtained. Some results were used as input parameters for the numerical modeling of temperature and subsidence history as well as hydrocarbon generation. The seismic profile SO 81 - 200 was used together with organic geochemical data for the numerical modeling of hydrocarbon generation and migration of different models with different heat flow histories. In an area off Costa Rica which was studied by 3 D-seismic investigations (3 D <b>box)</b> <b>bottom</b> simulating reflectors (BSRs) were found. These BSRs are an indicator for gas hydrates but they show a small-scale patchy distribution in the 3 D box. Pressure and temperature was calculated to test the assumption that variations in pressure/temperature ratios are the cause for the patchy BSR distribution. Studies on the organic matter revealed {{that most of the}} organic matter incorporated in the sediments overlying the Cocos plate is of marine origin and has a suitable potential for generating hydrocarbons. For the generation of methane and oil kinetics for Type II kerogen were used. The subducting sediments were treated as one sedimentary unit with a mean organic carbon content (TOC) of 0. 5 % and a hydrogen index (HI) value of 270 mg HC/g TOC. Except for the wells drilled during ODP Leg 170 there are no other wells available which could contribute suitable calibration parameters. Therefore several models with changing input parameters were calculated to determine the influence of single parameters on the result and to give a range for the amount of hydrocarbons generated and their migration velocity. In addition the possible influence of frictional heating along the decollement (boundary separating the upper and lower converging plates) was studied. The calculated temperature distribution for the present day exhibits a disturbance in temperature equilibrium for all models. The isotherms are heavily bended downwards and especially those below the decollement do not show a balancing of the thermal field until the coast of Costa Rica is reached. The additional heat due to frictional heating between the two plates has no significant influence on temperature distribution and hence on hydrocarbon generation. The amount of organic carbon subducted off Costa Rica which could generate hydrocarbons is huge in all models. The amount of methane which could be generated from the organic matter which is in the field of hydrocarbon generation today or has already passed through this field within the studied profile is in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 3 * 10 E+ 12 m^ 3 per kilometer of trench length. Migration velocities of hydrocarbons (oil and methane) are in the models with very high (120 mm/a) and high (90 mm/a) subduction velocities lower than the respective subduction velocity. Therefore migrating hydrocarbons do not reach the sea floor. For the model with a low subduction velocity (30 mm/a) migration velocity of methane is higher than the subduction velocity {{in some parts of the}} profile. Despite this fact methane does not reach the frontal zone of the subduction complex because the very high migration velocities only occur in some parts of the sediments and velocities are not constantly higher than the subduction velocity. This means that the oil reaches the gas zone and is converted to methane. Therefore oil discoveries cannot be expected at convergent margins with high subduction velocities, at least not in the subducting plate. Gas discoveries are possible, especially if the hanging wall rocks are of higher porosity and permeability. The patchy distribution of BSRs within the 3 D box cannot be explained with sudden changes in temperature/pressure ratios, at least not for the studied model. At three points of the 3 D box pseudo wells (vertical one-dimensional cuts) were constructed and temperature/pressure ratios determined. The temperature/pressure ratios show that large parts within the sediments are suitable for gas hydrate formation. Some parts of the upper region (to the coast) and some parts of the lower region (to the MAT) of the 3 D box exhibit temperature/pressure ratios unsuitable for gas hydrate formation. Faults which could serve as migration paths for warm fluids which can destroy gas hydrates were not visible in the first seismic interpretations...|$|E

The distance between the queen and nurse bees can be increased by placing the brood nest at the very top of the hive, with the honey supers between the brood nest and the queen excluder. If any swarm cells are present, these must be destroyed by the beekeeper. The relative absence of queen pheromone in the top box usually prompts the nurse bees to create emergency cells. After 7-10 days, the beekeeper destroys the emergency cells, and then either removes the queen excluder (thereby ending the [...] "demaree") or repeats the process a second or a third time until the swarming impulse is over.|$|R
