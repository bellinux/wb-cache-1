40|$|Comprehensive {{cultural}} competency includes {{knowledge and}} awareness of culturally based healing and wellness practices. Healthcare providers {{should be aware of}} the individual patient’s beliefs, culture, and use of culturally based health practices because patients may adopt such practices for general wellness or as adjunct therapies without the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> with their healthcare provider. This article describes the culturally based traditional healing curriculum that has been implemented in the University of New Mexico Public Health and General Preventive Medicine Residency Program in order to fulfill this knowledge necessity. Curricular elements were added in a stepwise manner starting in 2011, with the full content as described implemented starting in 2013. Data were collected annually with evaluation of the full curriculum occurring in 2015. New Mexico has a diverse population base that includes predominantly Hispanic and Native American cultures, making the inclusion of curriculum regarding traditional healing practices very pertinent. Residents at the University of New Mexico were educated through several curricular components about topics such as Curanderismo, the art of Mexican Folk Healing. An innovative approach was used, with a compendium of training methods that included learning directly from traditional healers and participation in healing practices. The incorporation of this residency curriculum resulted in a means to produce physicians well trained in approaching patient care and population health with knowledge of culturally based health practices in order to facilitate healthy patients and communities...|$|E
40|$|AimTo {{identify}} {{patient and}} carer expectations regarding information {{necessary for the}} first therapeutic leave. This {{is part of a}} Patient Education Program on therapeutic leave for patients with brain injury. Patients and methodsQuestionnaires designed by the multidisciplinary team were given to 30 hospitalised patients and their families before or after the first leave. A semi-quantitative, 4 level scale was used to evaluate the relevance of information received before the first leave, and the choice of information methods. ResultsTwenty patients (5 before and 15 after the first leave) and 16 carers (5 before and 11 after) filled in the questionnaire. The results highlighted a need for information on medication (15 / 20; 75 % patients– 12 / 16; 75 % carers) and what to do if a problem arose (11 / 20; 55 % patients– 11 / 16; 68. 8 % carers). Carers reported a need for information regarding emotional (12 / 16; 75 %), cognitive and behavioural (10 / 16; 62. 5 %) disorders. Discussion with a professional was the preferred method of information (7 / 17; 41. 2 % patients– 10 / 16; 62. 5 % carers) followed by an information leaflet (5 / 17; 29. 4 % patients– 3 / 16; 18. 8 % carers) and a presentation by a professional (4 / 17; 23. 5 % patients– 2 / 16; 12. 5 % carers). These methods were preferred to a presentation from a professional from out with the hospital (1 / 1; 5. 9 % patients– 1 / 16; 6. 3 % carers).

40|$|Classroom {{discussion}} {{has long been}} an important pedagogical tool in fields such as the social sciences and the humanities because it allows students to critically examine ideas {{about what it means to}} be a human living within communities of other humans. It allows students to formulate ideas and judgments and to reconsider these formulations as time passes and new information is revealed. Within the field of mathematics, however, professors typically rely on lectures to ensure coverage. While students are asked to think critically, they are likely asked to do so within the context of homework problems. The primary question we consider in this essay is whether class discussion enriches student thinking and problem-solving processes within the field of mathematics. The University Honors Program at Southern Polytechnic State University has found itself engaged in answering questions concerning the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> as a tool for critical thinking, creative thinking, and problem solving since its inception in 2003. At that time an honors committee, composed of seven people representing the four schools, honed the policies and procedures for the University Honors Program. This committee set curriculum guidelines designed to ensure that courses involve substantially more tangible content than typical courses at the same level in at least four of the following seven areas: creative thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, oral or written communication, collaborative work, experiential learning, and interdisciplinary components. For the humanists and social scientists on the committee, the idea of discussion- based classes in which students actively engage in the exchange of ideas generated through creative thought, critical thought, and problem solving seemed a promising solution for meeting many of these guidelines. The scientists and mathematicians instead saw the use of mathematical problems and assigned laboratory experiments as an optimal way to engage students in creative thought, critical thought, and problem solving. These differences in pedagogy spurred quite a bit of discussion among the honors committee members about the different methods the various fields use to emphasize student engagement in learning. No standard for the use of discussion was created. However, many of the reasons articulated for using discussion-based pedagogy are supported by research on discussion-based classes. Stephen D. Brookfield and Stephen Preskill list many benefits in Discussion as a Way of Teaching, such as: 1. Discussion helps students develop critical thinking skills as they scrutinize their own assumptions as well as the assumptions of others. 2. It helps to create intellectual agility since students must think on their feet and react to unanticipated comments. 3. Discussion helps students develop skills of synthesis and integration because they must listen and speak as they work to understand how information is related. (24 – 35). Discussion-based pedagogy functions in a similar manner to the Saxon Math Pedagogy, which draws on research showing that continual practice and review help students to demonstrate more thorough understanding of the material being taught (Mayfield and Chase). Just as, in class discussion, students are continually engaged with ideas that are reviewed and refined as the semester progresses. Not until the honors office received the evaluations for L. R. Ritter’s fall of 2007 Honors Calculus One class did members of the honors community reevaluate discussion-based pedagogy. Evaluations for Ritter’s class revealed not only that students in the Honors Calculus One class thought Ritter was one of the best mathematics instructors with whom they had ever worked but also that they felt the discussions were stimulating and contributed to the quality of the class. The director decided to create a more formal study concerning the use of discussion as a tool for learning. In August 2008, the honors program hosted workshops and roundtables on the use of discussion, and these activities led William Griffiths also to implement discussion within the Honors Calculus One class. Ritter and Griffiths, along with Nancy Reichert, Director of the University Honors Program, have been involved in both initiating and documenting this process of implementation. At the heart of our study is exploration of the following questions: What does it mean to run a “discussion-based” mathematics class? How is this discussion balanced with other techniques such as lecture or individual problem-solving? What pre-existing, cultural understandings about a field’s knowledge base and its pedagogy lead to the ways in which both teacher and students approach learning? Our answers are drawn from the multiple perspectives of the teachers, students, and honors director...|$|E

40|$|This {{quantitative}} study looked into class discussion strategies used by adult ESL learners. Findings revealed several <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> class <b>discussions</b> for adult learners. Among {{some of them}} are, adult learners practice turn-taking skills in a non-combative environment. The sharing of ideas allowed freedom of thoughts among the learners. On the other hand, adult learners also learn to agree or disagree politely using turn-taking strategies. Finally, the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> class <b>discussions</b> may go beyond classroom needs such as improving critical thinking skills among learners. This ability is seen when learners participate in group work and discussions. Learners gain accessibility to participate comfortably in discussions when they are pun in a non-combative environment. This will thus give them the freedom to discuss any topics openly. This freedom will further enhance their general participation in the discussion.

The group helped them to improve communication, support and mutual relationships, and to better cope with the pain. Reported beneficial factors were experi-encing communality, having a place to discuss things with each other, gaining insights, and learning from fellow-sufferers and their own family.

The results from the land use change and SWAT analyses are used to assess the economic <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> SLM. <b>Discussion</b> paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; A. 2 Sustainable Natural Resource Policies; CRP 2; CRP 5; Land Resource Management for Poverty ReductionEPTD; PIMCGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM); CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{goes beyond}} the {{existing}} literature and explores the innovative topic of designing criterion-referenced assessment for online discussion forums. There are several <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> embedding online <b>discussion</b> forums into subjects including engaging students in collaborative learning, and encouraging deeper analysis, critical thinking and reflection. Using the assessment principles of validity, reliability and transparency, this paper offers a range of practical strategies to tutors who plan to develop criterion-referenced assessment as opposed to norm-referenced assessment for online discussion forums, applies the assessment principles {{in the context of}} an undergraduate law subject, and exemplars a rubric for an online discussion forum in a work placement subject.

40|$|Audio/video {{discussion}} {{has been used}} increasingly in online courses due to its affordances in enhancing online communication. However, whether learners of different characteristics can benefit from this discussion modality has not been investigated extensively. This study examined whether gender {{plays a role in}} learners’ preferences and perceptions <b>of</b> audio/video <b>discussion</b> as compared to text discussion. The survey data of thirty-six participants’ perceptions were collected and studied after they participated in an audio/video discussion activity. The findings show that females preferred audio/video discussion more than males did, and more females reported that audio/video discussion strengthened their connection with peers. The top three <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> audio/video <b>discussion</b> perceived by females and males are presented in this paper. Overall, using audio/video discussion to augment online communication and to connect learners is likely to be more effective and perceived more positively by female students than male students. The findings in this study could provide implications for sound pedagogical decisions that satisfy student preferences...|$|R
3000|$|Additionally, several {{students}} {{from both sides}} were selected and {{invited to participate in}} individual interviews. The criteria for selection included students’ levels of online participation, gender, and group membership. We first invited volunteers and then we hand-picked some other students to fulfill the criteria. Eleven students (seven from Hong Kong and four from Taiwan) participated in the individual interviews sessions that lasted for 45 to 60  min. Through the interviews, we probed deeper into students’ experiences and perceptions <b>of</b> various technologies, <b>discussion</b> forums and Facebook in particular, in support of their learning. The interview questions were semi-structured with some customized questions based on the students’ online participation and probing questions based on their interview responses. For instance, for a girl who was quite active in online discussion, the questions asked included What {{do you see as the}} major <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> online <b>discussion?</b> What are the factors that motive you to participate?
