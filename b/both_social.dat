5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on <b>both</b> <b>social</b> and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|Jesse Louis Jackson Jr. (born March 11, 1965) is {{a former}} American politician, having served as a Democratic Congressman {{representing}} Illinois's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 until his resignation in 2012. He {{is the son of}} activist and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and, prior to his career in elected office, worked for his father in both the elder Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign and his social justice, civil rights and political activism organization, Operation PUSH. Jackson's wife, Sandi Jackson, served on the Chicago City Council. He served as a national co-chairman of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign. Jackson established a consistent liberal record on <b>both</b> <b>social</b> and fiscal issues, and he has co-authored books on civil rights and personal finance.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling <b>both</b> <b>social</b> interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E

5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are <b>both</b> <b>social</b> and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E

25|$|It {{is in the}} Upanishadic {{period that}} Sramanic {{theories}} influence the Brahmanical theories. While the concepts of Brahman and Atman (Soul, Self) can be consistently traced back to pre-Upanishadic layers of Vedic literature, the heterogeneous nature of the Upanishads show infusions of <b>both</b> <b>social</b> and philosophical ideas, pointing to evolution of new doctrines, likely from the Sramanic movements.|$|E

25|$|Liberals {{were the}} primary advocates of <b>both</b> <b>Social</b> Security and Medicare, which are often {{targeted}} as significant expansions of government that has overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries.

25|$|In Europe, social liberal parties tend to {{be small}} or {{medium-sized}} centrist and centre-left parties. Examples of successful European social liberal parties, which have participated in government coalitions at national or regional levels, are the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom, Democrats 66 in the Netherlands and the Danish Social Liberal Party. In continental European politics, social liberal parties are integrated in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group in the European Parliament, which is the fourth biggest group at the parliament and includes <b>both</b> <b>social</b> liberal parties and market liberal parties.|$|E

25|$|Le Guin {{exploits}} {{the creative}} {{flexibility of the}} science fiction and fantasy genres to undertake thorough explorations of dimensions of <b>both</b> <b>social</b> and psychological identity and of broader cultural and social structures. In doing so, she draws on sociology, anthropology, and psychology, leading some critics to categorize her work as soft science fiction. She has objected to this classification of her writing, arguing the term is divisive and implies a narrow view of what constitutes valid science fiction. There are also the underlying ideas of anarchism and environmentalism that make repeated appearances throughout Le Guin's work.|$|E
25|$|Females {{maintain}} <b>both</b> <b>social</b> {{relationships and}} hygiene through grooming. Grooming occurs regardless of climate or season. Females which are matrilineally related groom {{each other more}} often than unrelated individuals. Females will also groom unrelated females to maintain group cohesion and social relationships between different kinships in a troop. Nevertheless, a female will only groom {{a limited number of}} other females, even if the group expands. Females will also groom males, usually for hygienic purposes, but it can serve to attract dominant males to the group. Mothers pass their grooming techniques to their offspring most probably through social rather than genetic means.|$|E
