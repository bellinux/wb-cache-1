40|$|AIM To {{assess the}} ease of {{insertion}} of I-gel and ProSeal LMA and incidence of post op complications. Study design-A prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical performance of I-gel and ProSeal LMA. METHODS After induction and good muscle relaxation LMA/I-gel was introduced as per randomised computer allocation. After insertion, nasogastric tube was inserted through the gastric channel. Parameters monitored were heart rate, nubp, SpO 2, ETCO 2 at 1, 5 minutes after insertion of the device and thereafter every 5 minutes {{till the end of}} surgery. In case of failure, airway was secured with an endotracheal tube. Ease of gastric tube insertion was noted at the end of surgery; postop complications were noted. Blood staining of the device, injury to the lips, teeth, and tongue were noted. Incidence of sore throat 24 hrs. after surgery was also noted. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS software. RESULTS Age, height, weight and BMI were comparable in <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> The airway characteristics was also comparable in <b>both</b> the <b>groups.</b> Ease <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> was also the same for <b>both</b> the <b>groups,</b> but the time taken was much lesser for I-gel <b>group.</b> The ease <b>of</b> insertion of gastric tube was much easier for the I-gel <b>group.</b> Blood staining <b>of</b> the device was more with the ProSeal LMA group. There was no injury to any of the structures mentioned above. Postop sore throat was more in the ProSeal LMA group. CONCLUSION From our study, we conclude that the airway can be secured much faster with I-gel than ProSeal LMA. Postop sore throat was much less for I-gel than ProSeal LMA. Both were comparable in number of attempts of insertion, gastric tube introduction. Trauma to the airway structures was also minimum with both I-gel and ProSeal LMA...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is about financing practices of Pakistani-immigrant and indigenous-owned small travel agents. The study provides {{an understanding of}} the capital structures of businesses owned by <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> and compares these to draw similarities and differences between <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> The research integrates the "ethnic enclave" immigrant theory, the capital structure theory in particular the Pecking Order Hypothesis, the role of "networks" in business financing, and the business life-cycle theories. The research question and the research hypotheses emerged from the literature reviewed. Ten case studies, five Pakistani businesses and five indigenous businesses, confirmed the hypotheses which formed the basis of a survey of a large sample of sixty businesses, thirty in each group. The case study data is considered invaluable since it provided the real evidence of the sensitive nature of financial information in these businesses. The methodology adopted was a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The findings of the study show that there are more similarities than differences among the capital structures <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> businesses. The nuclear family plays a crucial role throughout the life-cycle of the business in <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> The role <b>of</b> family labour is not as prominent as among other industries such as Confectionery, Tobacconists, and Newsagents (CTN's). Informal sources of finance are preferred over formal sources by <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> businesses due to their availability and lower cost. The Pecking Order Hypothesis theory applies to <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> businesses. The main sources of formal finance were high street banks, bank overdrafts and loans. Pakistani businesses were not disadvantaged in any way by the formal providers of finance. This {{research is}} the first to report on the comparative capital structures among <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> businesses. However, although considerable contribution has been made by this research to the small business finance literature further research should be conducted into the area...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the previous 12 months (current IPV) on newborn’s health, pregnancy outcomes and couple’s reproductive behaviours were different for postpartum (PP) women as compared to women who had undergone an elective abortion (EA) in Trieste (Italy). This study is part of an unmatched case–control study. The major findings are that current IPV was positively associated with previous stillbirth among <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> women, but the association was only marginally significant. Among EA women only, current IPV was significantly associated with previous miscarriages (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 41; 95 %CI, 1. 13 – 5. 14). In <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> women, current IPV was associated with a lack of joint couple decision making about contraception; however, the magnitude of this effect was higher among PP women. This study reveals that IPV was associated with poor obstetrical history among <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> women.
