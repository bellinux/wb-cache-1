Many Republican conservative activists hated the center-hugging 'compassionate conservative.' Others favored it, but only as a rhetorical Trojan Horse.

[...] Herman Cain criticized the idea of [...] "compassionate conservatism" [...] as leading to the Bush administration's increased government spending, saying that it [...] "completely betrayed conservative voters and their decades of grassroots activism," [...] and [...] "alienated the party's conservative base," [...] noting Bush policies such as the Medicare prescription-drug benefit, which increased {{the size of the}} Medicare program by around $500 billion. In 2006, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg has written that compassionate conservatism as implemented by George W. Bush differs markedly from the theoretical concept: [...] "As countless writers have noted in National Review over the last five years, most conservatives never really understood what compassionate conservatism was, beyond a convenient marketing slogan to attract swing voters. The reality — as even some members of the <b>Bush</b> <b>team</b> will sheepishly concede — is that there was nothing behind the curtain." [...] Similarly, conservative commentator Fred Barnes wrote: [...] "Bush has famously defined himself as a compassionate conservative with a positive agenda.

International Politics, 44 (6), 666 - 691 RAE 2008 Because American {{populism}} {{has traditionally}} been associated with indigenous themes and inward perspectives, {{it has never been}} thought to be particularly relevant to the United States' outlook upon the international order or its understanding of the generic requirements of foreign policy-making. However, recent developments surrounding the formulation and prosecution {{of the war on terror}} have cast doubts on this negative correlation. Using four thematic and analytical categories, the article reveals President Bush's close dependency upon characteristically populist principles in the way that the issue was presented to, and mediated with, the American public. It surveys the way that the <b>Bush</b> <b>team</b> employed populist narratives in advocating the need for alternative channels of international action outside both the customary agencies of collective security and the established conventions of international law. Although the usage of populist techniques was initially effective, the administration subsequently experienced some of the defects that have traditionally afflicted populism as an agency of political transformation.

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (May 2003), v. 2 no. 5 North Korea's surprise admission last October {{to a secret}} nuclear weapons program based on uranium enrichment triggered a cascading breakdown of the 1994 Agreed Framework structure that had kept North Korea's more advanced plutonium-based nuclear program in check. By year's end North Korea had expelled United Nations inspectors and removed monitoring equipment at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and begun preparations to restart its plutonium reprocessing facility. This twin proliferation danger surpasses even {{the apex of the}} 1993 - 4 North Korean crisis that nearly triggered a U. S. military attack. The Bush administration's de facto policy of hostile neglect toward North Korea has contributed to this crisis. Although North Korea's uranium-based program began well before the <b>Bush</b> <b>team</b> took office, the administration bears some responsibility for inciting acceleration of this program and for fostering the fragile conditions under which the program's revelation quickly precipitated a complete breakdown of U.

40|$|Wednesday, November 29, 2000 WRITER: Kathy R. Pharr, 706 / 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Prof. Ron Carlson, 706 / 542 - 5186 (O); (706) / 548 - 6771 (H) UGA LAW PROFESSOR URGES <b>BUSH</b> <b>TEAM</b> TO RETHINK STRATEGY ATHENS, Ga. - If Governor George Bush {{wants to}} win the {{mounting}} public relations war over the protracted presidential election, he should rethink his strategy and drop his appeal to the U. S. Supreme Court, says Professor Ron Carlson, a nationally renowned trial law expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s within the purview - {{the discretion of the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>team</b> - to decide between now and Friday to let the case go, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 If they dismiss the appeal, they will gain in terms of the public perception that they are finally cutting off this process. The cost to the Bush side is the appearance of doing what they 2 ̆ 7 re accusing Gore of doing - that is, extending the process with legalisms. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says Bush has little to gain by having his attorneys argue before the Supreme Court on Friday, because the court may very well hear the arguments and determine the issue raised is moot. 2 ̆ 2 I think the most likely scenario is that the Supreme Court will find the issue to be moot because the appealing party has no damages to claim, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Whatever adversity occurred to them {{as a result of the}} Florida Supreme Court decision has now been removed by this second certification. They did not lose in the end, at least in the view of the Florida officials that were responsible for the recount being reported. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson predicts that the spotlight will quickly shift from the U. S. Supreme Court - which has authorized an audio recording of Friday 2 ̆ 7 s oral arguments to be broadcast via radio on a tape delay, a move Carlson heralds as 2 ̆ 2 an extremely healthy and totally appropriate development 2 ̆ 2 - to the Florida trial courts, where Vice President Al Gore has announced he will contest election results in at least three counties. 2 ̆ 2 A contest is a trial in every sense of the word, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 I expect there will be opening statements, there will be direct and cross-examination of witnesses, there will be closing arguments, and then a decision by a judge. What we have here is an extended process at best. I expect these trials to be nationally televised, given the national interest in these issues, and I would expect it to be extended well beyond the deadline for certifying of electors. The public does not yet understand the lengthy process that a contest entails, but as the outlines become fully and starkly known, it will be a public relations disaster. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in trial practice, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials. He may be reached for further contact at (706) 542 - 5186 (O) or (706) 548 - 6771 (H). #...|$|E
