5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E

5|$|In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men {{cut down}} trees, burned down {{vegetation}} and dug away {{the earth to}} reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. He reported his findings to Raffles, including various drawings. Although the discovery is only mentioned by a few sentences, Raffles has been credited with the monument's recovery, as one who had <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world's attention.|$|E
5|$|Producer Nancy Tenenbaum {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the short film. After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. He <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned {{the rights to the}} film in 1995. Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with Out of Sight.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, {{developed into a}} subtropical depression on June1. Operationally, it {{was treated as a}} frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Mick Foley faced Ric Flair in a 2-Out-of-3 Falls Match. Foley gained the {{advantage}} after he executed a Double Underhook DDT. Foley {{then began to}} taunt Flair and took out Mr. Socko, a dirty sock puppet, dressed like Flair. Foley controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the Figure-Four Leglock, but Flair countered with an inside cradle over Foley to win the first fall. Frustrated, Foley grabbed a trash can from under the ring and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring to hit Flair with it. But, Flair avoided the attacked, as he tripped Foley to apply the Figure-Four Leglock. At the end, Foley got disqualified when he hit Flair with the trash can. The referee awarded Flair the win. After the match, Foley attacked Flair with a barb-wired bat, leaving Flair busted open.|$|E
5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|During the Abbasid Revolution, however, he {{was forced}} to submit to the Abbasid armies under Abu Muslim. As one of Abu Muslim's vassals, he {{supported}} the latter in his quarrel with the Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775). After the Caliph had Abu Muslim murdered in 755, Khurshid supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of Sunbadh, who entrusted part of Abu Muslim's treasure to Khurshid's keeping. When Sunbadh's revolt was defeated, Sunbadh fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid's cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure. Al-Mansur sent his son and heir, al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), to recover the treasure of Abu Muslim. Khurshid denied having it, and al-Mansur tried to unseat Khurshid by crowning one of his cousins as ispahbadh. This did not have the desired effect of challenging the loyalty of Khurshid's subjects, but Khurshid was eventually forced to accommodate the Abbasids by accepting an increase in the annual tribute, which <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level paid to the Sassanids.|$|E

25|$|Three Icelandic Nazi sympathizers visited Friedrich Christian in 1939 {{and asked}} him to become king of Iceland when Germany took control of their country, as they hoped would happen in order to win Iceland's {{independence}} from Denmark. Friedrich Christian treated this as a realistic prospect and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Joseph Goebbels. In his 1952 autobiography, Zwischen Krone und Kerker, the prince recalled that Goebbels had reacted favorably to the idea, but Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop did not.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the song was mostly positive, although many critics doubted that Rouvas would make a significant comeback. Others were not impressed by the modern dance style and sexual content. Although he had {{stepped down from the}} stage for many months, he still maintained a strong fanbase who were anxious for a new release, also contributing to the demand of the song. The single was very well received by the commercial audience who quickly <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the charts for 10 weeks due to very fast sales.|$|E
25|$|The work survives in {{a single}} manuscript, of the later 9th century, now in the Palatine Library in Heidelberg; it {{contains}} several works.
