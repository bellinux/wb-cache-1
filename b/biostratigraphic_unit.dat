40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} {{interdisciplinary}} researches on the Pliocene sequences {{of the middle}} Ombrone Basin and the Roccastrada area are presented. The most interesting acquisition is that the sedimentary and palaeogeographic evolution of the two areas has developed through two sedimentary cycles.

That sounds good, but it means that two sites, both measured to be at the exact base of the Ectasian, might differ in age by over 50 My. Since the Ectasian is only 200 My long, these differences dramatically influence its timescale.

Although radiocarbon dating of the carbonate-rich lacustrine sediments remains problematic, a basic chronological framework for the section is established. Two major litho- and <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>units,</b> a Farmdalian zone (ca. 30, 000 to 24, 000 yr B. P.) and a Holocene zone (ca. 11, 000 yr B.

Pollen and sedimentary data indicate a period of basin-wide drying preceding this unconformity. The sustained absence of sediment accumulation within this playa-like basin suggests that early Woodfordian conditions were increasingly arid with strengthened surface winds. Before this, persistent shallow water marshland dominated the local basin-bottom vegetation. Regional upland vegetation was an open grassland-sage steppe throughout the Farmdalian with limited populations of spruce, juniper, aspen, birch, and boxelder in riparian settings and escarpments. Throughout the Holocene, water levels within the basin fluctuated. Changes in wetland vegetation resulting from water level fluctuation have increased during the last 3, 000 yr indicating that periodic episodes of wetland loss and rebound are not unique to postsettlement conditions but are an ongoing phenomenon at Cheyenne Bottoms...|$|R

The basic categories of stratigraphic units are: 1) material; 2) non-material; 3) hybrid. Examples are the well-known rock (lithostratigraphic), time (geochronologic), and time-rock (chronostratigraphic) <b>units,</b> respectively. <b>Biostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> (biozones) are used to describe and correlate time-rock units. Lesser-known categories include magnetostratigraphic, lithodemic, pedostratigraphic, diachronic, and unconformity-related units.

All words in formal units are capitalized, except for species names in biozones. Only the geographically derived name in informal units is generally capitalized. Inadequate distinction between time and place words, both formal and informal, leads to unnecessary confusion. Misuse of early versus lower, late versus upper, and Ma for Myr is epidemic. Web sites and publications such as lexicons, geologic time scales, and correlation charts are recommended as initial sources of strati-graphic information.
