5000|$|<b>Biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET film (BOPET) is used {{successfully}} {{in a wide}} range of applications, due to its excellent combination of optical, physical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, as well as its unique versatility.|$|E
50|$|PET film is {{the most}} common film used in {{laminated}} sailcloth.It is an extruded and <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> version of PET fiber. In the US and Britain, the most well-known trade names are Mylar and Melinex.|$|E

50|$|Headquartered in Wigton, Cumbria, {{the company}} is {{exclusively}} focused on speciality films, including <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropylene (BOPP), used in many wrapping applications and for banknote production in Canada, Australia, Britain and other countries. Total annual film capacity currently stands at more than 120,000 tonnes.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the drawing}} is completed, {{the film is}} [...] "heat set" [...] or {{crystallized}} under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above 200 C. The heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane. The orientation of the polymer chains {{is responsible for the}} high strength and stiffness of <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET film, which has a typical Young's modulus of about 4 GPa. Another important consequence of the molecular orientation is that it induces the formation of many crystal nuclei. The crystallites that grow rapidly reach the boundary of the neighboring crystallite and remain smaller than the wavelength of visible light. As a result, <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET film has excellent clarity, despite its semicrystalline structure.|$|E
50|$|Orientation on a {{commercial}} scale can be achieved using either of two processes: a tenterframe or a bubble process. Tenterframe technology is used to produce a variety of “heat-set” products, with <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropylene (BOPP) being the most common (heat-setting is a process whereby a film is reheated in a constrained state such that the shrink properties are destroyed).|$|E
50|$|PEN film is {{extruded}} and <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> {{version of}} PEN fiber. Just as PEN fiber {{is stronger than}} PET fiber, PEN film is stronger than PET film. However, PEN film is rarely used in standard sailcloth styles because it shrinks more rapidly than PET, is less resistant to abuse, and reduces the working life of the sail.|$|E
50|$|The Al Ghurair Group founded Dubai Poly Film, a {{manufacturer}} of <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropylene, in 1998.

50|$|The {{adhesive}} is coated onto {{a flexible}} material (the backing) such as paper, foil, fabric, or plastic film (such as <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride) to provide strength {{and protect the}} adhesive from degradation by environmental factors including humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet light. Backing tensile strength, elongation, stiffness, and tear resistance can be matched to the intended use of the tape. The adhesive can be bound to the backing through surface treatments, primers, heating, or UV curing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET film can be metallized by vapor {{deposition}} of {{a thin film}} of evaporated aluminium, gold, or other metal onto it. The result is much less permeable to gases (important in food packaging) and reflects up to 99% of light, including much of the infrared spectrum. For some applications like food packaging, the aluminized boPET film can be laminated {{with a layer of}} polyethylene, which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance. The polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the PET side shiny.|$|E

5000|$|The 30.5 m {{diameter}} balloon {{was made}} of [...] metalized [...] <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET film ("Mylar") material, and {{it was used to}} redirect transcontinental and intercontinental telephone, radio, and television signals. The satellite also aided the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure due to its large area-to-mass ratio. As its shiny surface was also reflective in the range of visible light, Echo 1A was easily visible to the unaided eye over most of the Earth. The spacecraft was nicknamed a 'satelloon' by those involved in the project, as a portmanteau of satellite-balloon.|$|E
50|$|Drafting {{film is a}} {{sturdier}} {{and more}} dimensionally stable substitute for drafting paper sometimes used for technical drawings, especially architectural drawings, and for art layout drawings, replacing drafting linen for these purposes. Nowadays it is almost invariably made of transparent <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polyethylene terephthalate, which should last several centuries under normal storage conditions, {{with one or two}} translucent matte surfaces provided by a coating. However, some older drafting films are cellulose acetate, which degrades in only a few decades due to the vinegar syndrome. Uncoated films are preferred for archival, because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{begins with a}} film of molten polyethylene terephthalate (PET) being extruded onto a chill roll, which quenches it into the amorphous state. It is then <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> by drawing. The most common way of doing this is the sequential process, in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction, i.e. orthogonally to the direction of travel, in a heated oven. It is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously, although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate. Draw ratios are typically around 3 to 4 in each direction.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 ICI {{developed}} <b>Biaxially</b> <b>Oriented</b> Polypropylene, which, {{because of}} its clarity, gloss, sparkle, crispness and grease resistance, resembled cellulose film rather than polyethylene {{to which it is}} chemically related. In 1963 British Rayophane and British Sidac merged under the British Sidac name and, four years later entered into a joint venture with ICI to manufacture BOPP on the Wigton site. A new £3m factory was built to be operated by this new company called Sidex Ltd. In 1973 British Sidac became a wholly owned subsidiary of the UCB Group of Belgium. In 1982, the British Sidac plant at St Helens was closed and in 1987, UCB Films acquired La Cellophane Espanola.|$|E
50|$|The U 47 {{used the}} M 7 capsule {{originally}} {{developed for the}} CMV 3 microphone ("Neumann bottle"). Its PVC membranes unfortunately tended to dry out with age, however, and in 1960 the M 7 was superseded by the K 49, a capsule with similar acoustical design but membranes made of age-resistant <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET film. The U 47's circuitry {{was based on the}} Telefunken VF 14 M vacuum tube (a specially-selected VF 14; the VF 14 was an RF pentode for various functions in military field radios); the discontinuation of the U 47 was caused primarily by the decision by Telefunken to halt production of the VF 14. In some ways the functional successor to the U 47 was the U 67.|$|E
50|$|Polymer {{banknotes}} are banknotes {{made from}} a polymer such as <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropylene (BOPP). Such notes incorporate many security features not available in paper banknotes, {{including the use of}} metameric inks. Polymer banknotes last significantly longer than paper notes, causing a decrease in environmental impact and a reduced cost of production and replacement. Modern polymer banknotes were first developed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and The University of Melbourne. They were first issued as currency in Australia during 1988 (coinciding with Australia's bicentennial year). In 1996 Australia switched completely to polymer banknotes. Other countries that have switched completely to polymer banknotes include; Brunei, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Kuwait and Vietnam. The latest countries to introduce polymer banknotes into general circulation include: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Nigeria, Cape Verde, Chile, The Gambia, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago, Republic of Maldives, Israel and Nepal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract−In {{order to}} {{understand}} the bowing phenomenon in the tentering process of <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropy-lene film, a simple mathematical model has been developed by considering the overall continuity equation and relevant momentum equations. The model has been solved analytically by employing a lubrication approximation for an iso-thermal, Newtonian fluid with variant densities depending upon the external deformation. Both velocity and stress pro-files in the tenter process and also birefringence and extinction angle profiles can be calculated accordingly. Geometrical bowing is strongly dependent upon the degree of volume change during extensional deformation. Theoretical pre-diction is compared with experimental birefringence data with two types of PP resins and two different operation conditions to give us excellent agreement. It can be said that this model is applicable to other <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> film processes such as PET...|$|E
