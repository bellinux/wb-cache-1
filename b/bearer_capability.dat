Objective of {{this thesis}} are load control and {{performance}} control concepts for broadband switching systems. Focus is the services integrating network technology B-ISDN using ATM as transfer mode. The studied mechanisms and concepts are principally of generic nature. Specifically {{they are designed}} within the envisaged context of B-ISDN, due to its extensive vision with respect to service integration, Quality of Service (QoS) support and ATM <b>bearer</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Area of application is implicitly the network control plane, but interactions between user and control plane have to be considered, too. The prime scope are switching nodes between access and core network domain, i. e., B-ISDN switches which have to provide user-to-network and network-to-network signalling protocol functions. Thus, beside service distinction call type differentiation is also covered due to the considered network positioning...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} Online Social Networks (OSNs) prompts {{the need for}} effectively accessing and utilizing social networking information. In numerous applications, users need to make trust and/or access control decisions involving other (possibly stranger) users, and one important factor is often the existence of common social relationships. This motivates the need for secure and privacy-preserving techniques allowing users to assess {{whether or not they}} have mutual friends. This paper introduces the Common Friends service, a framework for finding common friends which protects privacy of non-mutual friends and guarantees authenticity of friendships. First, we present a generic construction that reduces to secure computation of set intersection, while ensuring authenticity of announced friends via <b>bearer</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Then, we propose an efficient instantiation, based on Bloom filters, that only incurs a constant number of public-key operations and appreciably l ow communication overhead. Our software is designed so that developers can easily integrate Common Friends into their applications, e. g., to enforce access control based on users' social proximity in a privacy-preserving manner. Finally, we showcase our techniques {{in the context of an}} existing application for sharing (tethered) Internet access, whereby users decide to share access depending on the existence of common friends. A comprehensive experimental evaluation attests to the practicality of proposed techniques. Copyright 2013 ACM...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Bearer</b> <b>Capability</b> is {{augmented}} by the Higher Layer Compatibility (HLC) Information Element (another {{field in the}} Q.931 SETUP message), which informs the network of the use that the caller intends {{to make of the}} channel.|$|E
50|$|For example, if a <b>Bearer</b> <b>Capability</b> of Speech is specified, {{then the}} network is free to select a set of {{facilities}} {{that are able to}} provide this service (including, in this case, analogue trunks and routes involving echo cancellers or DCME).|$|E
50|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, a <b>Bearer</b> <b>Capability</b> of Unrestricted Digital Information is specified, then the network is {{required}} {{to set up the}} call using only end-to-end digital facilities (without the use of robbed-bit signalling, echo cancellers, DCME nor A-law to mu-law conversion), or reject the call if no end-to-end digital circuit is available.|$|E
40|$|Mobile world's {{rapid growth}} has spurred {{development}} of new protocols and new algorithms to meet changing operation requirements such as mobile networking, and quality-of-service support. A key requirement in the <b>bearer</b> <b>capabilities</b> is the handover. The freedom {{to be able to}} make and receive calls anywhere, at any time, creating a totally new dimension in human communications has frequently been advertised as the main advantage of new wireless systems. Handovers are a key concept in providing this mobility. It makes it possible for a user to travel from one cell to another while having a seamless connection. Network operators give emphasis to optimize handover, since it is strongly related to dropped calls, network overload and subsequently users' criticism. The ability of a cellular network to perform efficient handovers is crucial to offer attractive services as real-time applications or streaming media as planned in third generation networks. Since signal propagation and pathloss are complex in nature, we can expect unnecessary and wrong handoff executions. Both UMTS and those of the second generation (GSM) systems will require redefined handoff algorithms of active connections as the smooth mobility support and continuous connection are essential issues for obtaining high performance and increasing user satisfaction. In this paper we present a set of intelligent algorithms using the mobile terminal (MT) location information and area awareness to assist safe handoff decisions. The implemented algorithms are validated by means of cellular network simulators that clearly show the impact of these techniques to major system performance metrics...|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} critical feminist {{engagement with}} human security by interrogating the taken-for-granted {{category of the}} 'human' therein. Failure to reflectively deconstruct this category has contributed to human security's reproduction of dominant norms and the emptiness of its apparent radical promise. The article shows how the 'human' has historically been constructed as an exclusionary - and fundamentally gendered - category, and examines its construction in human security discourse and the capabilities approach in which the latter is rooted, {{as well as its}} discursive effects. The article troubles the model of the autonomous, rational human subject who is the <b>bearer</b> of <b>capabilities,</b> which human security inherits from the liberal humanist tradition of thought, and which obscures the matrices of power through which individuals become socially differentiated. It then considers the implication of human security in demarcating differences as 'morally relevant', including its instrumentalization in the 'war on terror'...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} make a {{contribution}} to the study of personhood in EU free movement law by linking a historical and doctrinal analysis with the internal transformation of the homo economicus in economic liberalism. It is argued that a shift can be observed in the government of mobility from ‘freeing up’ the ability of the worker as a relatively passive subject tied to external economic mechanisms to the targeting of the individual him/herself as a responsible, active <b>bearer</b> of economic <b>capability</b> or ‘human capital’, whereby past socio-economic conduct and prospective economic activity serve as the thresholds for the entitlement to rights. The essence of the ‘new’ homo economicus of EU free movement law is situated at the intersection of the social and economic, serving as a rational frame for the government of the European mover {{on the basis of a}} mutual responsibility between the Union citizen and his/her host Member State towards social and economic activity, self-sufficiency and integration...|$|R
50|$|A {{bearer channel}} is a DS-0 that carries call content i.e. {{one that does}} not carry {{signaling}}. In the common-channel signaling scheme for telecommunications, signaling is sent out-of-band, while all other traffic rides bearer channels. When a call is set up, the <b>Bearer</b> <b>Capability</b> is negotiated, and this is used to determine what type of traffic is sent across the bearer channel.|$|E

In the call control protocol, more than one CC entity are defined. Each CC entity is independent from each other and communicates with the correspondent peer entity using its own MM connection. Different CC entities use different transaction identifiers.|$|E

40|$|ATM network handles {{cells of}} {{different}} classes {{in various ways}} {{in order to provide}} the different services with their respective QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. A possible way to provide this is to use buffers in nodes by giving priority to cells relating to the most demanding <b>bearer</b> <b>capability.</b> When time priority is used, the next cell to be transmitted, if more then one is waiting in a queue, is the one with highest priority. In order to decrease the loss probability of high priority cells at the expense of cells with lower priorities, two loss priority schemes have been proposed in literature: Threshold and Push out. Since throughput is slightly greater in the push out scheme while buffer management complexity increases when passing from threshold to push out, it seems natural to prefer the threshold scheme. In this paper a limiting removal depth in push out scheme called L push out, is proposed. The most attractive feature in limiting push out, is the decreasing of buffer management complexity since {{only a small part of}} the buffer seems to be necessary to reach both loss rates using the push out strategy. Approximation analysis was used for random traffic and simulations for bursty traffk. 1...|$|E
