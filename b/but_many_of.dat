5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the most {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Baden was not {{originally}} intended to be surrendered {{under the terms of}} the Armistice, but was substituted for the battlecruiser Mackensen, which lay incomplete and could not put to sea. As a result, instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918, Baden left Germany on 7 January 1919. The Royal Navy inspected the ship on 9 January, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the technical instruments, including gunnery equipment, had been removed before the ship left Germany.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches.

Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the clubs survive to this day.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E

Perelman's Stability Theorem implies that all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the M_αs are homeomorphic. The Diffeomorphism Stability Question asks whether all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the M_αs are diffeomorphic. We {{answer this question}} affirmatively in the special case {{when all of the}} singularities of the limit space occur along smoothly and isometrically embedded Riemannian manifolds of codimension ≤ 4. We then describe several applications. For instance, if the limit space is an orbit space whose singular strata are of codimension at ≤ 4, then all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the M_αs are diffeomorphic...|$|R

5|$|James Whale (22 July 1889– 29 May 1957) was an English film {{director}}, theater {{director and}} actor.

Whale also directed films in other genres, including {{what is considered}} the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936).

5|$|Of {{the eleven}} poems the Gosen Wakashū {{attributed}} to Narihira, several were really by others—for example, two were actually by Fujiwara no Nakahira {{and one by}} Ōshikōchi no Mitsune. The Shin Kokinshū and later court anthologies attribute more poems to Narihira, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these were likely misunderstood to {{have been written by}} him because of their appearance in The Tales of Ise. Some of these were probably composed after Narihira's death. Combined, poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies total 87.|$|E

The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

The Phillips building at No.101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30million expanding and refurbishing the premises.

5|$|The 1931 British Census {{recorded}} {{more than}} 1,000 Cypriot-born people, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{these were the}} children of British military personnel serving in the Mediterranean. However, some Greek Cypriots did migrate to the UK in the 1920s and 1930s, often finding jobs in the catering industry in Soho. By {{the start of the}} Second World War, there were around 8,000 Cypriots in London. More Cypriot immigrants arrived during the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA)'s campaign for Cypriot independence from Britain and union with Greece, which started in 1955. In the four years of conflict, an average of 4,000 Cypriots left the island per year for the UK, because of violence on the island and the fear felt by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in mixed villages where they formed minorities. Migration peaked following independence in 1960, with around 25,000 Cypriots migrating in the year that followed. Many migrants joined family already living in Britain. Further migration accompanied the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. Home Office figures show that roughly 10,000 Cypriots fled to the UK, the majority of them refugees, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them subsequently returned to the island.|$|E
