5|$|Ancient Chinese Daoism, {{ancestor}} worship, and foreign-originated <b>Buddhism</b> {{were the}} most prominent religious practices in the Song period. Daoism developed largely from {{the teachings of the}} Daodejing, attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ("Old Master"), considered one of the Three Pure Ones (the prime deities of Daoism). <b>Buddhism</b> in China, introduced by Yuezhi, Persian, and Kushan missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese <b>Buddhism.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen <b>Buddhism</b> emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of <b>Buddhism</b> goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren <b>Buddhism</b> was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
