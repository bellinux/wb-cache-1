They can help provide a more comfortable sleep for those recovering from surgery, aiding circulation, breathing and swelling. Adjustable beds used in hospitals and homecare are similar in basic functionality, but hospital beds must be able to withstand more rigorous and regular cleaning in order to reduce contamination. Therefore, any electrical <b>bed</b> <b>components</b> used in the hospital environment need to meet minimum waterproofing standards in order to withstand the cleaning process.

40|$|Binary fuels of a {{fluidized}} bed combustor or gasifier are solids {{composed of two}} groups of particles. Their optimal handling {{in the same bed}} becomes rather difficult if their hydrodynamic properties differ by two orders of magnitude or more. Both of these fuel classes are directly fed into the reactor in most cases but the rather homogeneous fuel originally fed switches into a binary character inside the reactor in some others.

Design criteria and procedure are formulated as well. One of the known calculation methods is proposed to be applied for assuring a segregated bed by means of choosing the <b>bed</b> <b>components,</b> geometry, and gas velocity conveniently.

40|$|Purpose: The {{fundamental}} {{aim of this}} research was to determine the biomechanical characteristics of the medical bed made of carbon steel and an assessment of its stability. To define the biomechanical characteristics of the bed design, the finite element method (FEM) was applied. Additionally, the risk analysis was conducted according to the directives of ISO 14971 standard. Design/methodology/approach: The research was carried out on the typical rehabilitation bed. To define the biomechanical characteristics of this equipment, the finite element method was applied. Geometric model of medical bed, was discretized by means of SOLID 95 element. Appropriate boundary conditions imitating phenomena in the real system with appropriate accuracy were established. The aim of biomechanical analysis was calculation of displacements and stresses in the bed’s construction elements in a function of the applied loading. In order to carry out calculations, 3 models of diverse variants of loading were selected – safe working load - model 1, transverse stability - model 2 and longitudinal stability - model 3. Findings: The analyses showed the difference in displacements, strains and stresses in the characteristic points depending on the selected loading. That also helped to determine maximal loading causing the exceeding of the yield stress of the <b>bed’s</b> <b>components.</b> Research limitations/implications: The limitations were connected with simplification of numerical model of femur {{as well as with the}} selected boundary conditions. Practical implications: The obtained results can be useful in the designing process (modification of requirements regarding design and construction, as well as materials used in the production of the device, and reduction of risk as far as possible to the patient). They prove that 3 D geometrical analysis works quite well for assistive medical devices design.

40|$|Windrow-composted {{livestock}} manure {{has been shown}} to be less hazardous to the environment compared to manure directly applied to cropland and other agricultural areas. Although offsite contaminant losses through runoff and leaching can occur during the composting process, these losses are suspected to increase under different compost moisture conditions and as composted materials mature. This research quantified the effects of windrow-composted {{livestock manure}} and straw <b>bedding</b> <b>components</b> on runoff and infiltration characteristics from laboratory rainfall simulations. Compost samples collected on three dates at approximately the beginning (day 0), middle (day 30), and end (day 60) of a June-July 2004 field research windrow composting period were used for this rainfall simulation study. Replicated compost windrow-shaped cross-section samples were constructed in a specially-designed Plexiglas container apparatus for viewing and recording infiltrated leachate wetting front position boundary movement from simulated rainfall events. Runoff and leachate samples were collected and analyzed for drainage volumes and concentrations and total mass losses of sediment, nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N), and ortho-phosphorus (PO 4 -P) during and following rainfall simulation trials. Leachate wetting front position boundary movement was significantly lower for day 60 compost samples compared among day 0 and day 30 compost sample material. Drainage volume analysis results indicated significantly higher average runoff versus leachate volumes within all compost sampling dates, and runoff volumes were significantly higher among day 30 and day 60 compost samples compared to runoff volumes from day 0 compost samples. Average sediment, NO 3 -N, and PO 4 -P concentrations were significantly higher in leachate versus runoff within all compost sampling dates. Conversely, the total mass losses of these contaminants were significantly higher in runoff compared to leachate within all compost sampling dates. Results of this study suggest that biological and mechanical functions of the composting process reduced compost sample aggregates and increased compost bulk density. We hypothesize that these changes in compost material structure and porosity volume decreased infiltration and increased runoff sediment, NO 3 -N, and PO 4 -P losses during the second and final compost sampling stages of a field windrow composting period...|$|R

40|$|Steep {{mountain}} streams have irregular bed topography, {{where the}} mean flow velocity is heavily {{affected by the}} coarsest <b>bed</b> <b>components</b> and by their arrangement to form step pools, cascades, and rapids. According to literature findings the mean flow velocity is often related with water discharge, channel slope, and grain-size related variables through power relationships. Several approaches consider dimensionless hydraulic geometry terms to develop the analysis {{over a wide range}} of channel sizes and hydraulic conditions. The aim of this research is to test the performance of some literature formulas to directly compute the mean flow velocity (V) in step-pool sequences. The study area deals with two fish ladders located in the Vanoi torrent (Trento Province, Italy), which were built by mimicking the steppool morphology. Three reaches were selected to cover different channel slopes (2. 6 - 10 %). Data collection entailed three main phases: (1) topographical surveys, (2) granulometric analysis, and (3) flow discharge measurements (salt dilution method). Geometric and hydraulic variables were measured for the following step-pool cross sections: step head, pool center, and intermediate position between pool end next step. Particular attention has been reserved to determine the effective mean flow velocity over the whole path of each step pool sequence. The performance of different literature equations to predict V has been verified. The relations have been shared in three groups: dimensional (V), dimensionless with respect to the grain size (V*) or to a combination of grain size and slope (V**). In general, the V group of equations has produced the highest errors between computed and measured values. The dimensionless V*, V** groups have shown the best performance. In particular the V* equations, which use unit discharge and channel slope, have provided the better fitting, and the lowest root mean square error. The results highlight the difficult to estimate flow velocity in step-pool sequences, and the attitude of this channel-bed morphology to be highly dissipative. The good performance of some dimensionless equations to predict V could also support the hydraulic designer in case the ‘morphological rebuilding’ of mountain creeks is opportune. Further analyses are required to better understand the flow behavior in streams where very rough bed forms and hydraulic drops are the primary sources of flow energy dissipation...|$|R

Increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with HF often represents a combi-nation of increased left-sided filling pressures (passive com-ponent) and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) attributable to functional and structural abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular <b>bed</b> (reactive <b>component).</b> The latter may be reversible with standard HF treatment in the earlier stages, when remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature has not set in, and abnormalities in pulmonary arterial tone are the major driver for elevated PVR.

The dynamics of such seabeds may interfere with different offshore activities and are therefore of interest to both scientists and offshore developers. State-of-the-art echo sounding accuracy allows {{for the analysis of}} bed form dynamics on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, the superimposition of bed forms complicates the automated determination of morphodynamic parameters of individual <b>bed</b> form <b>components.</b> In this research we present the extension and comparison of two well-known, automated signal-processing methods for the 1 -D and 2 -D separation of bathymetric data derived from multibeam echo soundings into different components that each represents a bed form of a particular length scale. One method uses geostatistical filtering, and the other uses a Fourier decomposition of the bathymetric data. The application of both methods in two case studies of the North Sea shows that both methods are successful and that results correspond well. For example, megaripples up to 0. 83 m height could be separated from 1. 49 - 2. 28 m high sand waves, and regionally averaged lengths and heights of sand waves, as calculated in either method, differ only 0. 42 - 8. 2 % between methods. The obtained sand wave migration rates differ 7 - 11 % between methods.

Experiments examine the formation and motion of ceramic molten pools in disrupted reactor core regions. The MP- 2 experiment assembly consisted of: (1) a rubble bed of enriched UO{sub 2 } and ZrO{sub 2 } simulating severely disrupted reactor core regions, (2) a ceramic/metallic crust representing blockage formed by early phase melting, relocation, and refreezing of core components, and (3) an intact rod stub region that remained in place below the blockage region.

Melting of the debris <b>bed</b> ceramic <b>components</b> was initiated {{near the center of}} the bed. The molten material relocated downward, refreezing to form a ceramic crust near the bottom of the rubble bed.

40|$|When the {{distributed}} rock stress {{around the}} roadways exceeds {{the strength of}} the rock, the rock is failed and a softening zone is formed. Roof deformation developed in the roof and ribs of the roadways are highly controlled by the depth of softening zones. The rock failure process starts from a point ahead of the face and grows into the roof, floor and ribs by advancing roadway. The maximum stress that can be transferred through the failed rocks would be equal to its residual confined strength. Therefore, rock stress is moved above failed zone and will create new failure zone if it is higher than the confined strength of rock at that depth.

Variations in coarseness and thickness of clastic beds in different sections within the I. F. are interpreted as reflecting proximal to distal locations relative to channel-feed systems on the fan. On the outcrop scale, the background (elastic-free) chemical sediment appears as blackish, laminated magnetite. Thin sections, however, reveal that it actually consists of regular sub-millimeter alternations between magnetite and chert. These magnetite-chert microlaminations are analogous {{to those of the}} Hamersley Basin in Western Australia (Trendall and BIocldey 1970) and similarly may reflect annual varvings...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A {{comprehensive}} {{computer simulation}} program that {{can deal with}} a wide range of different operating conditions in fluidized bed combustion and gasification has been developed. It includes the possibility of simulating operations with various types of coal, charcoal or wood and can predict the behaviour of a real unit by giving several important performance parameters, such as: (a) Emulsion and bubble gas composition profiles throughout the <b>bed</b> height. The <b>components</b> included are: CO 2, CO, 02, N 2, H 2 0, H 2, CH 4, SO 2, NO, C 2 H 6, H 2 S, NH 3 and Tar. (b) Gas phase composition throughout the freeboard height. (c) Solid compositions of the coal (or any other carbonaceous material), limestone and inert in the bed and throughout the freeboard. The considered components are: C, H, 0, N, S, ash, volatiles, moisture in the coal, CaCO 3, CaO, CaSO 4, moisture in the limestone, Si 0 2, and moisture in the inert. (d) Temperature profiles of all phases throughout the bed and the freeboard. (e) Solid particle size distributions in the bed and in the freeboard sections. The considered effects are: elutriation, entrainment, attrition and recycling in all the three possible types of solid phases present; (f) Heat transfered to water/steam inside the tubes, steam production and tube surface temperatures in the case of boiler simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{two-phase}} flow systems which are anticipated to be utilized in future spacecraft thermal management systems requires a knowledge of two-phase flow and heat transfer phenomena in reduced gravities. This program was funded by NASA headquarters in response to NRA- 91 -OSSA- 17 and was managed by Lewis Research Center. The main objective of this program was to design and construct a two-phase test loop, and perform a series of normal gravity and aircraft trajectory experiments to study the effect of gravity on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and onset of instability. The test loop was packaged on two aircraft racks and was also instrumented to generate data for two-phase pressure drop. The normal gravity tests were performed with vertical up and downflow configurations to bound the effect of gravity on the test parameters. One set of aircraft trajectory tests was performed aboard the NASA DC- 9 aircraft. These tests were mainly intended to evaluate the test loop and its operational performance under actual reduced gravity conditions, and to produce preliminary data for the test parameters. The test results were used to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} normal gravity models for prediction of the two-phase friction pressure drop. It was shown that the two-phase friction multipliers for vertical upflow and reduced gravity conditions can be successfully predicted by the appropriate normal gravity models. Limited critical heat flux data showed that the measured CHF under reduced gravities are of the same order of magnitude as the test results with vertical upflow configuration. A simplified correlation was only successful in predicting the measured CHF for low flow rates. Instability tests with vertical upflow showed that flow becomes unstable and critical heat flux occurs at smaller powers when a parallel flow path exists. However, downflow tests and a single reduced gravity instability experiment indicated that the system actually became more stable with a parallel single-phase flow path. Several design modifications have been identified which will improve the system performance for generating reduced gravity data. The modified test loop can provide two-phase flow data for a range of operating conditions and can serve as a test <b>bed</b> for <b>component</b> evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Mixing {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the most significant factors, affecting both performance and scale-up of a gas-solid reactor system. This paper presents an experimental investigation on the particle mixing in a multiple spouted bed. Image processing technique was used to extract the real-time information concerning the distribution of particle <b>components</b> (<b>bed</b> materials and tracer particles). A more accurate definition of the tracer concentration was developed to calculate the mixing index. According to the visual observation and image analysis, the mixing mechanism was revealed and the mixing rate was evaluated. Based on these results, the effects of operation parameters on the mixing rate were discussed in terms of the flow patterns. It is found that the detection of the pixel distribution of each component in RGB images is not affected by the interference of air void, thus maintaining good measurement accuracy. Convective transportation controls the particle mixing in the internal jet and spout, while shear dominants the particle mixing in the dense moving region. Global mixing takes place only when the path from one spout cell to the other is open. This path can be formed either by the bubbles or particle circulation flows. The mixing rate is linked to the bubble motion and particle circulation. Provided that there are interactions between the spout cells, any parameters promoting the bubble motion and circulation can increase the mixing rate. Finally, a mixing pattern diagram was constructed to establish the connection between the flow structure and mixing intensity...|$|R
