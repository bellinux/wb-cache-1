5|$|Steel alloys {{used for}} dive {{cylinder}} manufacture are authorised by the manufacturing standard. For example, the US standard DOT 3AA requires {{the use of}} open-hearth, <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen,</b> or electric steel of uniform quality.

5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking (BOS), {{developed in the}} 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. <b>Basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
40|$|International audienceStarting from a micelle-templated {{material}} with Si/Al = 2. 5 in the H form, three samples {{have been obtained}} by means of partial cationic exchange, with LiCl, NaCl and CaCl 2 alcoholic solutions. Their surface properties have been characterized by means of FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules, namely CO, CO 2 and methylacetylene. Spectroscopic results showed that, though having a chemical composition close to that of cations exchanged Y zeolites, such materials exhibit different basic properties: in particular, no carbonate formation has been detected upon CO 2 adsorption, ruling out the occurrence of <b>basic</b> <b>oxygens</b> at the surface. These features have been ascribed to the amorphous nature of the walls to be contrasted with the crystalline structure of zeolites...|$|R
40|$|Nickel acetylacetonate {{was used}} as a {{precursor}} for the preparation of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with metal content between 0. 4 and 3 wt %. The nature of the interactions between the metal complex and the support has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies. The spectral features point to modifications of the precursor in the adsorbed state. IR results indicate that the interaction between acetylacetone and the support involves coordinately unsaturated (cus) Al 3 + sites, hydroxyls of the support surface, and probably also <b>basic</b> <b>oxygens.</b> A model for these interactions is proposed.

5|$|Further {{refinements}} in the process, such as <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods {{by further}} lowering the cost of production and increasing {{the quality of the}} final product. Today, steel {{is one of the most}} common man-made materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide, {{dissolved}} in a <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace used for making steel, {{acts as a}} fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E

It is the largest steel-making plant in Alabama, employing 2,000 workers as of September 2006, down from a peak of 45,000 during World War II. With a single blast furnace and three <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> process furnaces, amongst other various mills and production facilities, the plant produces 2.4 million tons of raw steel per annum and 640,000 tons of seamless tubular and sheet products, mainly for purchase by the booming oil industry.|$|E
40|$|Palladium {{supported}} on different shaped iron oxides has been synthesized and tested in glycerol hydrogenolysis {{in order to}} investigate the morphological effect of the support on catalytic performance. The plate-like iron oxide support exhibits a much higher activity due {{to the presence of}} more <b>basic</b> sites (<b>oxygen</b> vacancies) on its predominant polar surface.

25|$|Finally, the <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{process was}} {{introduced}} at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; {{a modification of}} the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), {{reducing the amount of}} nitrogen uptake into the steel. The <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> process is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an electric arc furnace. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-quality}} {{flake graphite}} product that closely resembles natural flake graphite {{can be made}} from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace, and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.|$|E
2500|$|Bessemer steel became brittle {{with age}} because {{nitrogen}} was introduced when air was blown in. [...] The Bessemer process was also restricted to certain ores (low phosphate hematite).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interaction of}} ethylene and ethane with a Cu-tricarboxylate complex and show that at low loadings the lighter molecule has a higher binding energy {{as a result of}} an increased interaction with the framework Cu and stronger hydrogen bonding with the <b>basic</b> framework <b>oxygens.</b> This leads to selective adsorption of ethylene by a factor of about 2 at low pressure, which is overcome by the stronger van der Waals interaction of ethane at high loadings, explaining recent literature data.

40|$|The {{intramolecular}} proton-transfer {{process in}} malonaldehyde is studied by ab initio methods in its ground electronic state {{and in its}} excited r - r* triplet state. The transfer barrier is considerably higher in T 1, which is attributed {{in part to the}} virtual disappearance of the hydrogen-bonding interaction present in the ground state. The weakening of this H bond in the excited state is associated with a less acidic protondonor OH group and less <b>basic</b> acceptor <b>oxygen.</b> The r - r* excitation adds antibonding character to the C=O bond. which causes it to elongate.
