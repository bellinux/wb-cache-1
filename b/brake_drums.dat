25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear <b>brake</b> <b>drums,</b> which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E

25|$|Douglas {{was more}} than a simple {{assembly}} plant for parts imported from Piaggio; many of the models made by Douglas had a high percentage of content manufactured by Douglas (eg cylinder heads, gear clusters, <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> and other mechanical parts) or by UK supply companies (eg seats, carburetors, tyres, and some electrical components were made in the UK). Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).|$|E
25|$|Only a minor {{facelift}} with revised grille and taillight trim {{marked the}} 1970 Electra 225. The big news {{was under the}} hood, where a new 370-horsepower 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This was the final year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> and high compression engines. New this year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield.|$|E
25|$|For 1949, minor {{modifications}} to the <b>brake</b> <b>drums,</b> switching from vanes to slits for cooling, along with small changes to the cockpit control layout and a repositioned oil header-tank resulted in a car {{sometimes referred to as}} the 4CLT/49. It was never known as such by the factory. The Ascari/Villoresi/Parnell trio, joined by Juan Manuel Fangio and Toulo de Graffenried, took up where they had left off the previous season, winning nine of the first fifteen races of 1949, including de Graffenried's victory in the British Grand Prix. However, {{the second half of the}} season only saw three further wins, as increasingly competitive Ferrari and Talbot cars squeezed out the Maseratis in most major races.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Design of new fixture is a {{modified}} {{over the old}} fixture due to some drawback. The old fixture is not suitable for drum having slot on top face. This {{is because of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is seated on fixture ring instead of button so there is no gap maintained. Without sufficient gap it is difficult to machine the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> bore(pilot diameter), as well as <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> surface in single set up to achieve the concentricity. Also current fixture is complicated in design and there is more work in fitting the button to fixture ring. So we designed new lathe fixture over the old fixture. In new modified lathe fixture, pads are provided instead of buttons and it could be suitable for <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> having slot on the top face and other drum also. By trail run this lathe fixture is more comfortable than old fixture. So this fixture can be used in <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> (cargo) manufacturing companies because of its simple design and less cost...|$|R

25|$|For {{bands that}} include a front {{ensemble}} (also known as the pit or auxiliary percussion), stationary instrumentation may include orchestral percussion such as timpani, tambourines, maracas, cowbells, congas, wood blocks, marimbas, xylophones, bongos, vibraphones, timbales, claves, guiros, and chimes or tubular bells, concert bass drums, and gongs, {{as well as a}} multitude of auxiliary percussion equipment. Drum sets, purpose-built drum racks, and other mounted instruments are also placed here. Until the advent of the pit in the early 1980s, many of these instruments were actually carried on the field by marching percussionists by hand or on mounting brackets. Some bands also include electronic instruments such as synthesizers, electric guitars, and bass guitar, along with the requisite amplification. If double-reed or string instruments are used, they are usually placed here, but even this usage is very rare due to their relative fragility. Unusual percussive instruments are sometimes used, including <b>brake</b> <b>drums,</b> empty propane tanks, trashcans, railroad ties, stomping rigs, and other interesting sounds.|$|E
500|$|Following Varèse's example, {{a number}} of other {{important}} works for percussion ensemble were composed in the 1930s and 40s: Henry Cowell's Ostinato Pianissimo (1934) combines Latin American, European, and Asian percussion instruments; John Cage's First Construction (in Metal) (1939) employs differently pitched thunder sheets, <b>brake</b> <b>drums,</b> gongs, and a water gong; Carlos Chávez's Toccata for percussion instruments (1942) requires six performers to play a large number of European and Latin-American drums and other unpitched percussion together with a few tuned instruments such as xylophone, tubular chimes, and glockenspiel; Lou Harrison, in works such as the Canticles nos. 1 and 3 (1940 and 1942), Song of Queztalcoatl (1941), Suite for Percussion (1942), and—in collaboration with John Cage—Double Music (1941) explored the use of [...] "found" [...] instruments, such as <b>brake</b> <b>drums,</b> flowerpots, and metal pipes. In all of these works, elements such as timbre, texture, and rhythm take precedence over the usual Western concepts of harmony and melody.|$|E
2500|$|The present-day {{instruments}} {{fall into}} four categories. [...] First are the campanas (Brea and Millet 1993:181), which are instruments of metal struck with metal beaters. Preferably, <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> from older model American vehicles (1950s or older) are used. Originally, before <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> were available, frying pans were used (Pérez I 1988:310, Pérez II 1988:23, etc.) and possibly plow blades as well (Pérez I 1988:106 and 134).|$|E
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{generally}} can {{be found}} on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years the needs for heavy duty brakes have been increasing. Since the {{performance}} of a braking system has direct influence on the safety of an automobile, an accurate design of <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is very important at present. The <b>Brake</b> <b>Drum</b> of TATA INDICA car is working well under certain load conditions. The required size of the break drum to be used in newly introduced TATA NANO car, the adoptability of the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is tested under different load conditions with the help of Finite element analysis. The analysis is carried out using a FEM package, ANSYS 10. The results shown that the size of the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> required for NANO car is smaller than the size that is being used in INDICA car with lesser brake load than the later one...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the <b>brake,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes on the <b>drum</b> allows <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and <b>braking</b> force. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear <b>brakes,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|R

2500|$|Massive {{brake shoes}} were {{mechanically}} operated via cable controls: the brakes were effective but without servo-assistance required significant muscle {{power from the}} driver. [...] The car's light alloy [...] "Roue Royale" [...] wheels measured [...] in diameter and were cast in one piece with the <b>brake</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Brakes were {{hydraulically-operated}} [...] drums, {{which were}} generally considered the Toronado's weak link. Being a rather heavy car, after several panic stops, the <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> would overheat, resulting in considerable fade and long stopping distances. The 1967 addition of vented front disc brakes {{as an option}} provided substantial improvement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are best}} suited for slower, {{moderate}} use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load. Under such heavy <b>braking,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.|$|R

40|$|John Thousand of Wolverine Western Corp. put his {{aerospace}} {{group to}} work on an unfamiliar job, designing a <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> using computer design techniques. Computer design involves creation of a mathematical model of a product and analyzing its effectiveness in simulated operation. Technique enables study of performance and structural behavior {{of a number of}} different designs before settling on a final configuration. Wolverine employees attacked a traditional <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> problem, the sudden buildup of heat during fast and repeated braking. Part of <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> not confined tends to change its shape under combination of heat, physical pressure and rotational forces, a condition known as bellmouthing. Since bellmouthing is a major factor in braking effectiveness, a solution of problem would be a major advance in automotive engineering. A former NASA employee, now a Wolverine employee, knew of a series of NASA computer programs ideally suited to confronting bellmouthing. Originally developed as aids to rocket engine nozzle design, it's capable of analyzing problems generated in a rocket engine or automotive <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> by heat, expansion, pressure and rotational forces. Use of these computer programs led to new <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> concept featuring a more durable axle, and heat transfer ribs, or fins, on hub of drum...|$|R
2500|$|Many of Harrison's {{early works}} are for {{percussion}} instruments, often {{made out of}} what would usually be regarded as junk or found objects [...] such as garbage cans and steel <b>brake</b> <b>drums.</b> He also wrote a number of pieces using Schoenberg's twelve tone technique, including the opera Rapunzel and his Symphony on G (Symphony No. 1) (1952). Several works feature the tack piano, a kind of prepared piano with small nails inserted into the hammers to give the instrument a more percussive sound.|$|E
2500|$|At first, the {{instruments}} of the group were a pilón, some bocúes, a cowbell and a güiro. Later, two redoblantes were added, the number of bocúes was increased and the cowbell and güiro were replaced by frying pans. [...] Later still, the frying pans were replaced by the campanas (automobile <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> or other pieces of metal chosen for their distinct sound qualities). Also added were the quinto and the requinto.
