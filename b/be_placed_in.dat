5|$|A segment with Raven {{took place}} where he demanded to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the main event for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Larry Zbyszko disagreed, {{resulting}} in Raven attacking him before security pulled Raven off. Rhino then came out and stated that he deserved the title shot more than Raven.|$|E
5|$|Although both {{hydrogen}} and helium are in the s-block, neither of them behaves similarly to other s-block elements. Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus excelsus was the {{original}} type species of Brontosaurus, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs reclassified Brontosaurus as a synonym of Apatosaurus in 1903, transferring the species B.excelsus to A.excelsus. In 2015 Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct enough to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> its own genus, so they reclassified it back into Brontosaurus.|$|E
50|$|The eight known species <b>in</b> {{this family}} <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> four genera. Hemipristis <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the {{subfamily}} Hemipristinae, while Chaenogaleus, Hemigaleus, and Paragaleus <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the subfamily Hemigaleinae.|$|R

A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E
5|$|Covina, California. A {{replica of}} San Lorenzo Head 5 was donated to Covina in 1989, {{originally}} intended to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Jalapa Park.

5|$|In {{his opening}} statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed {{to act as}} general counsel and to allow his name to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Rialto's literature, and that the {{agreement}} explicitly provided that Burton would never represent Rialto before any federal agency.|$|E
5|$|The Brhadaranyaka and the Chandogya {{are the two}} {{earliest}} Upanishads. They are edited texts, some {{of whose}} sources are much older than others.

50|$|The {{classification}} {{of some of}} the species in this genus has been confused. P. yaravi has been moved to Neblinichthys. P. sabaji <b>was</b> arbitrarily <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> this genus (as opposed to Hemiancistrus), but may even represent its own genus; later, it has <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Hemiancistrus but (Armbruster et al. 2015) <b>placed</b> the species <b>in</b> the genus Peckoltia. Peckoltia bachi <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the genus Peckoltichthys and Peckoltia snethlageae and Peckoltia feldbergae <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the genus Ancistomus.|$|R
25|$|In August 2015, compost bins <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> two {{residence}} {{halls and}} after a successful year, compost bins <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> 9 other residence halls in August 2016.|$|R

5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} {{specimens}} is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, {{followed by a}} very thorough drying. The specimens must then <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> an environment that consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{relatives}} of the garden warbler outside the sister group {{are believed to be}} the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which should probably <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E

50|$|Shortly before flight, the {{jellyfish}} {{samples were}} loaded into {{a total of}} 10 Nizemi cuvettes containing ASW and <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Type I containers. For the behavior study, a group of normal ephyrae {{and a group of}} ephyrae without statoliths <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the Biorack 22 °C incubator. The third group of ephyrae <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the Biorack 1-G centrifuge. Two groups of polyps were used for the development study. One group <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the incubator and the other <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the 1-G centrifuge. A similar set of equipment was maintained at the KSC ground-control facility.|$|R
25|$|Mulrunji <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the two-cell lockup {{which was}} the back section of the Palm Island Police Station. Fellow Palm Islander Patrick Bramwell <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the {{adjoining}} cell.|$|R
5|$|There's no {{question}} in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> harm's way.|$|E
5|$|When {{specimens}} are to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> {{any size}} of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents {{the development of}} Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.|$|E
5|$|When the African river {{martin was}} first {{discovered}} in the 19th century, Gustav Hartlaub {{thought it was a}} roller, and later authors either placed it in its own family, or with the woodswallows. Study of the anatomy revealed that the species was closest to the swallows and martins, but that it possessed a number of distinctive features, such as its robust legs and feet and stout bill. These indicated that it should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a separate subfamily. The two river martin species are usually considered to belong to a single genus, Pseudochelidon, due to their having a number of structural similarities. However, Brooke proposed that the white-eyed river martin <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a separate monotypic genus Eurochelidon.|$|E
50|$|In the APG III {{classification}} system, it <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> {{the family}} Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It has also <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the former family Convallariaceae.|$|R

50|$|The genus Nephrolepis {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> this family, but because its exact phylogenic {{placement}} is uncertain, it has <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> its own family, Nephrolepidaceae, pending more complete data.|$|R
