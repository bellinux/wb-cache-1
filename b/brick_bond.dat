5000|$|The Hickory Ridge slave {{plantation}} {{was built}} in 1749 for Greenberry Ridgeley on a 500-acre tract he inherited from his father Henry Ridgley, who also settled the lands and mill site that became Savage, Maryland. Originally called [...] "White Hall", the building is a two-and-a-half-story structure made of flemish <b>brick</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Christ Church Guilford, {{historically}} {{known as}} the [...] "Old Brick Church," [...] is an historic Episcopal church located at Guilford, now part of Columbia, in Howard County, Maryland. The small Georgian church was completed in 1809. It was constructed of handmade brick laid in English garden wall <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> with unmarked joints.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1870s the Customs House Reserve was {{extended}} when portion 5 of Section 46 {{the site of}} the former Royal Fitzroy Hotel was acquired. A single storeyed <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> store was constructed on this site. Further additions were made to this building in 1879. The building was known as the [...] "Fitzroy Bond", and included frontages to both Quay and Little Quay Streets.|$|E
50|$|The Shaw Mansion is an Italianate style {{house in}} the George's Creek Valley of Allegany County, Maryland, built in 1872. The house is {{significant}} as an unusually large and well-preserved example of the style for its area, with stone trim, detailed <b>brick</b> <b>bonding,</b> cast-iron mantels {{and much of the}} original interior woodwork.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{materials used}} for the house were Dutch <b>bricks</b> (Flemish <b>bond)</b> and Indiana limestone. The general contractor was from Chicago, William Mavor (1848-1904).|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} was built using iron beams and wooden joists which were protected by 2" [...] hollow tiles. The {{exterior of the}} building consisted of red pressed face <b>brick</b> <b>bonded</b> with lime and cement mortar, common hard burned clay brick and rubble stone. The floors in the office areas were generally oak and corridor floors were marble with marble wainscoting up {{to a high of}} 4 feet.Construction of the {{building was}} at times halted due to an insufficient quantity of mules.|$|R
50|$|The mosque, originally, had two minarets {{but only}} one minaret remains standing; the minaret is 14 meters in height and 3.5 meters in diameter. The superb, varied bands of raised brick {{patterns}} and inscriptions in Kufic and Naskhi scripts make this minaret the finest of the Seljuk period still standing. The upper section is missing and the lowest section of the remaining shaft has been restored with plain <b>brick</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E
50|$|The brick {{church has}} a steep gabled roof and is laid in English garden wall <b>brick</b> <b>bond.</b> The structure, two bays wide and three bays deep, faces east with twin {{entrance}} {{doors in the}} north and south bays. Each bay is rectangular, surmounted by a Federal-style transom and reached by two stone steps. The nave windows are rectangular, holding twelve-over-twelve lites and, decorated with splayed brick flat arched lintels. The interior contains a gallery which extends around three sides of the church.|$|E
50|$|The {{plantation}} comprises approximately 1100 acre and {{consists of}} several outbuildings {{in addition to the}} main house. The frame structures have beaded clapboard siding and wood-covered gable rooflines. The main structure is symmetrical in its front, southern facade and possesses the end chimneys so characteristic of southern Colonial structures. It has a unique T-Shaped plan and the brick foundation walls are constructed mainly of Flemish bond, {{with the exception of a}} few areas where an English <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> is possible evidence of additions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bricks</b> were <b>bonded</b> {{together}} using a clay slurry, called butter clay or navanita mattika. This {{was composed}} of finely crushed dolomite limestone mixed with sieved sand and clay.|$|R
50|$|Walton Castle was a Saxon Shore type fort, {{probably}} {{built in}} the late 3rd century. Much of {{our knowledge of the}} fort derives from an outline drawing and plan of 1623, as well as some 18th-century literary accounts. The 1623 drawings show a plan similar to Burgh Castle to the north. Forward projecting curvilinear towers are present at the corners of the fort. The walls have flint facing with <b>brick</b> <b>bonding</b> courses. The presence of forward-projecting towers with rounded corners is thought to be good evidence for a construction date contemporary with other Saxon Shore forts such as Burgh Castle and Othona.|$|R
50|$|It is a -story Flemish <b>bond</b> <b>brick</b> {{house of}} the early 18th century.|$|R
50|$|With a wall to Quay Lane is {{the former}} two {{storeyed}} <b>brick</b> <b>Bond</b> Store. The corrugated iron roof of this building has slightly overhanging eaves which are lined with diagonal timber boarding. The ground floor is rendered brick and the upper floor is face brick with white tuck pointing. Six paned vertical sash windows with heavy timber frames and mullions are found on all facades and these are awned with corrugated iron awnings supported on substantial timber brackets with infill battening in some places.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{built as}} a hunting lodge it was a {{slightly}} rectangular building fashioned of red brick with diamond patterning known as diapering formed from blue-black headers incorporated into the <b>brick</b> <b>bond.</b> Kiplin had four towers, which unusually, were not placed {{at the corners of}} the structure, but at the centre of each of the four walls - the north and south towers containing staircases, whilst the east and west comprised part of the rooms in which they were contained. At the summit of each tower is an ogee dome.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Reserve for Government Buildings {{was divided}} into the Customs House Reserve and the Post and Telegraph Reserve. In 1905, the Commonwealth subdivided the Customs Reserve further, returning the portion which included the Quarters to the State. Also in 1905, palm trees were planted {{to the north and}} the east of the Customs House.In 1921, the Commonwealth Bank leased the Customs House for 10 years, moving the Customs Service back into the adjacent timber building. The Customs House has since been altered several times for multiple occupancy, housing various other government departments. The <b>brick</b> <b>Bond</b> Store, on the south-east corner of the site addressing Sydney Street, was constructed about 1935.|$|E
50|$|The Mathews House {{stands on}} the north side of NY/VT Route 67, just west of State Line Road in southwestern Shaftsbury and {{northeast}} of Walloomsac, New York. The house is a three story, five bay wide, brick Federal style dwelling with a gable roof. It features pattern <b>brick</b> <b>bonding,</b> laid in a modified Flemish pattern, and a full Doric order frieze and cornice. As built, its main facade was originally to the north, but it has essentially identical northern and southern entrances, set in round-arch openings with fanlights above and flanking sidelights. The interior retains much original woodwork, including paneling, fireplace surrounds, and moulded door surrounds.|$|R

50|$|Within four years, {{increased}} use of the Port resulted in the pre-fabricated building becoming inadequate and cramped conditions dictated {{the need for a}} new building. However, on 14 August 1862 the timber buildings comprising the Customs House including the Bond Store and Quarters were burnt down. As a result, tenders were called on 27 September 1862 for a new Customs building and this was constructed in the following year. The 1863 Customs House was a single storeyed, masonry building with a slate roof, a storage basement and a colonnaded porch facing Quay St. However the shallow foundations of the building were sunk in clay and the shifting of this strata was to lead to the eventual failure of the structure. A two storeyed <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> store facing Quay Lane was constructed as part of this phase of development.|$|E
50|$|The {{decoration}} is {{of greater}} importance than the primary structure. The diversity of patterns, materials, and combination of materials {{employed in the}} decoration represent a compendium of decorative techniques from around the country. Exposed brick is found only in the arcades, although possibly this area originally had a plaster coat as is employed extensively {{in the rest of}} the structure. The plaster is carved in a variety of decorative designs, including geometric patterns; floral motifs in high relief; simulated <b>brick</b> <b>bond,</b> and brick end-plugs - in some areas arranged to configure rectangular kufic inscriptions. On the sanctuary walls and dome, traces indicate that plaster was painted in a vivid array of colors. The lofty stucco mihrab describes an uncommon proportion, reaching the zone of transition. Across the interior of the dome, decorative terracotta elements form eight radial ribs; diverse painted plaster patterns fill the interstices. The northern entrance portal is lavishly decorated with mosaic faience, glazed and unglazed terracotta.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the north}} of the hall is the coach house and stable block which are {{connected}} to the hall with high brick wall on the west and service building to the east. The stable and coach house are in an L shape and range to the north and the east of the courtyard and are both Grade II listed buildings. The east block which was the stable block has a wooden clock turret with a bell under a leaded cupola over a crow-stepped gabled bay. Either side are this central bay there are smaller crow-stepped gabled bay. The building is built in red Norfolk brick with a tile and pantile (Rear) roof. The northern side building was the coach house and coachman’s cottage. The building is over three storeys and has three bays with equal sized crow-stepped gables. With dormers. It is built in red brick with some diaper decorative pattern built into the <b>brick</b> <b>bond.</b> The roof is of plain red tile with fish tail tiles to the front ...|$|E

50|$|The ground {{supporting}} an adobe structure {{should be}} compressed, as {{the weight of}} adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively. Modern construction codes call {{for the use of}} reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of <b>brick,</b> <b>bond</b> beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.|$|E
5000|$|The T.B. Perry House is a {{historical}} residence located in Albia, Iowa, United States. Theodore Perry was a local attorney and businessman who served two terms in the Iowa Senate. He is also responsible {{for a couple of}} buildings in the Albia Square and Central Commercial Historic District. [...] This house is a High Victorian eclectic style structure. It is one of four large brick houses in Albia known as the Four Sisters. They all feature a running <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> on their exterior walls. It is an unusual architectural feature for southern Iowa in the period they were built, and it also suggests they have the same architect and/or brick mason. The Elbert-Bates House is another house in this group. The Perry house was designed by Charles A. Dunham from the prominent Burlington, Iowa architectural firm of Dunham & Jordan. It is noteworthy for its elaborate roofing system. It features five dormer windows, two hip-and-deck roofs, three gable roofs, and two hipped roofs. The steeply pitched roof also has finials, pendants, and brackets with a modified frieze under the eaves. Other elements of the richly ornamented exterior include barge boards on the second story and entry gables, and a front porch with Gothic tracery millwork. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
40|$|In Ottoman bath architecture, {{the dome}} is the spherical {{structural}} component covering the square planned dressing hall, {{warm and hot}} spaces. In this study, the relationship between bond type, dome span, dome height, dome thickness, {{and the number of}} oculi of domes in some Ottoman baths located in Western Anatolia (Turkey) were investigated for the purpose of evaluating construction techniques and architectural characteristics. The studied domes were constructed with brick and lime mortar as binder. In the construction of domes, whole and half bricks with different dimensions were used. In all domes, the surfaces were covered with brick-lime plaster, a thin layer on the interior and a thick layer on the exterior. Terracotta pipes placed in the <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> or the openings made through the <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> constituted oculi for lighting. Depending on the <b>brick</b> <b>bond,</b> a linear relationship was determined between the span, height, and number of oculi, whereas a mathematical ratio between 1 : 10 and 1 : 12 was determined between the span and thickness of the domes. It has also been noted that as the dome span increases, so does the height, thickness at the springing level and the number of oculi. The domes examined with these properties should be seen as historical documents representing the construction technology of the 15 th century. Therefore, these properties of domes must be preserved and special care needs to be taken as not to lose the original qualities of these domes during conservation works...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of the reinforcement of masonry structures by FRP sheets (Fiber Reinforced Polymer), the use of “Fiber Anchor ” is an innovative performing solution to increase the peak load and the dissipation capability of the strengthened system. To analyze the performance of this new technology an experimental campaign composed by 36 tests has been conducted. Six series of CFRP to <b>brick</b> <b>bonded</b> joint fastened by different configurations of fiber anchor have been tested. To deeply describe the measure fields, the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) has been used. The strain fields obtained in the series not fastened by anchors have permitted to define the bond stress field and the advancement of the stress transfer zone. The DIC appears as a performing methodology to use in a lot of civil engineering experimental problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hwangtoh (loess) has {{pozzolanic}} {{properties that}} mean {{it can be}} used as a cement admixture when activated at high temperatures, and that {{it can be used}} in combination with building materials such as fly ash or blast furnace slag. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the compressive strength and the <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> strength of various mortars containing hwangtoh, and also to find the optimum mixing conditions for the use of hwangtoh. It was found that the mortars’ strength properties are significantly influenced by the water/cement ratio W/C and the activated hwangtoh substitution ratio. We recommend the following materials and mixing conditions: W/C 60 %, a cement substitution ratio of activated hwangtoh of 20 ~ 25 %, and the addition of 10 % blast furnace slag to improve the compressive strength of such mortars...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a methodology}} for the simulation of masonry wall failure and debris scatter. The {{aim of this}} work is to develop simulation techniques {{which can be used}} to assess and improve the design of building structures subject to high explosive loading. Masonry walls are constructed from bricks that are modelled as individual parts with tiebreak and single surface contact types. A key requirement of this work is to accurately predict the final landing position and scatter pattern of any bricks. If the acceleration of a separated brick is significantly high, the trajectory and final landing position of the brick will be influenced by air-drag. In this work we simulate the air-drag force using a user FORTRAN subroutine and demonstrate its accuracy with comparison to theory. The strength of the mortar-masonry <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> is validated by comparison with laboratory experiments conducted in previous work showing close agreement. A series of simulations are then presented which demonstrate the failure and debris scatter of a simplified building structure. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Flexural bond {{strength}} {{is a significant}} factor that governs the mortar to <b>brick</b> <b>bond</b> performance under different loading conditions for masonry walls and columns. Bond testing is a fairly recent addition to the masonry designer?s tool box, with the dominant test over the last 150 years being the compression test. Several methods {{have been developed to}} test the masonry bond, with the bond wrench from Australia being one of the simpler tests to perform on a masonry stack. The original bond wrench evolved from the beam tests, as outlined in ASTM E 518, with the aim of improving the statistical information measured from the manufactured masonry prisms. There have been different bond wrenches developed in Australia and the USA. Four bond wrenches have been studied in the last decade at TAMU, termed the ASTM Wrench, the Australian Wrench, the TAMU Balanced Wrench and the TAMU Unbalanced Wrench. An extensive set of results shows a difference exists in the bias and precision results for standard masonry prisms tested with different wrenches. This study?s aim is to compare the Australian Bond Wrench results to the ASTM E 518 Beam Test results to gain an understanding of the statistical properties for the results from the different tests. The tests used a standard Western King sized clay brick manufactured in Texas. A total of fifty masonry prisms were built and tested in the same weather conditions. Each prism consisted of six bricks with five joints, and the mortar used was 1 : 1 : 6 with Portland cement to lime to sand. Each test group had 25 replicates. The results show that the mean flexural strength values of Australian Bond Wrench were determined to be statistically higher than ASTM E 518 beam mean flexural strength values. A reasonable conclusion is that results obtained using ASTM E 518 were low because the results reflect the failure in a weaker joint in the prism and not average results for all joints. The Australian Bond Wrench measures the capacity of each joint in the prism. Further research can be conducted with the use of Texan red brick. Other bond wrenches can be compared with these methods to analyze the presence of bias between the different results...|$|E
