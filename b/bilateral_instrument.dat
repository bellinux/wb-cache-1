40|$|The {{increasing}} {{degradation of}} marine ecosystems {{has led to}} multiple calls for greater protection through the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). If created at the ecosystem or ecoregion level, MPAs will likely straddle maritime boundaries and therefore necessitate international cooperation. International environmental law and international {{law of the sea}} may facilitate cooperation between States in creating transboundary MPAs. The extent to which this body of law is actually or potentially useful for the establishment of transboundary MPAs is examined {{in the context of the}} East African Marine Ecoregion, focusing on Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania. A general survey and assessment of the applicable global, regional, and <b>bilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> in relation to the three States is conducted. Although some global instruments are relevant in the East African context, regional and <b>bilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> are more conducive to the establishment of transboundary MPAs. The article concludes that although a trilateral agreement between Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania would be an ideal vehicle for the establishment of a transboundary network of MPAs addressing both national and ecoregional conservation interests, a separate solution at each border will be the first step towards this goal.

40|$|The {{developing}} and {{least developed countries}} in the South and Southeast Asia have emerged as dynamic hosts of foreign direct investment; and inbound FDI growth surpassed that {{of the developing world}} during the decade 2001 - 2010. Yet foreign investment continues to flow quite unevenly into individual countries in the region, although majority of the Asian countries do emphasize liberalization unilaterally, bilaterally under the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) and the bilateral trade agreement (BTA), and regionally under the regional trade agreement (RTA). Under such scenarios, this study empirically assesses FDI determinants with a specific focus on the FDI effects of BIT, BTA, and RTA as well as of factors pertaining to institutional quality. Gravity-type econometric results of unbalanced panel data uncover that BIT, BTA, and RTA promote FDI insignificantly. It appears that the role of <b>bilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> in stimulating the inflow of foreign capital diminishes if liberal FDI policies already exist in the host country.

40|$|Principle of {{the peace}} full uses of outer space {{is one of the}} basic {{principle}} of international law. It is currently the only legal obstacle for placement and use of the weapons in outer space. Today the international community is faced with the shift from the currently passive use of outer space to active military use of outer space of a destructive nature. Therefore, the principle of peaceful uses of outer space should be examined from the standpoint of contemporary international law.

40|$|ABSTRACT The widely debated {{mechanism}} "avoided deforestation " (REDD), {{would benefit}} developing countries that reduce their deforestation rates, thereby generating {{at least two}} positive impacts: (i) a greater effectiveness of the global climate change mitigation efforts, and (ii) expected positive side effects on, e. g., biodiversity conservation. Several proposals were designed for the mechanism, which implementation is challenging: firstly, sophisticated tools available to measure the reduction of emissions (e. g. remote sensing) might be ineffective when combined with national baselines; secondly, predictive baselines lack accuracy because of insufficient knowledge concerning the causes of deforestation, and the unpredictable evolution of key variables (e. g. agricultural commodity prices); thirdly, historical baselines lack legitimacy because they only refer to past trends; and fourthly, a reduction in deforestation rates is hardly connectable to specific public policies. Based on our analysis, we recommend not promoting any mechanism within the Kyoto Protocol based on financial rewards for assumed national emissions reductions from deforestation. Two reasons justify our perspective: not only would the mechanism probably generate fake reductions ("hot air"), but undesirable side effects would also appear. Instead, we encourage use of funds made available as carbon finance (broadly speaking) for reinforcing multi- and <b>bilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> that relate to forest management in developing countries, {{with a focus on}} the correction of governance deficiencies. In addition, we support any initiative that mitigates perverse incentives from public policies in tropical and industrialized countries...|$|R

40|$|It is {{hotly debated}} today whether the {{reduction}} of tropical deforestation should be supported by a mechanism within the Convention for Climate Change. This mechanism, known as “avoided deforestation,” would benefit developing countries that voluntarily reduce their deforestation rates, thereby generating at least two positive impacts: (a) {{an increase in the}} financial resources available to curb tropical deforestation, with expected positive side effects on biodiversity conservation, the environmental services provided by these forests, and sustainable development as a whole; and (b) a greater effectiveness of the global fight against climate change, because tropical deforestation contributes extensively to world carbon emissions. Several proposals were designed for such a mechanism, yet their implementation poses significant methodological problems: first, sophisticated tools available to measure {{the reduction of}} emissions might be ineffective when combined with baselines on a national level; secondly, baselines calculated ex ante lack accuracy because of insufficient knowledge concerning the direct and underlying causes of deforestation; thirdly, baselines calculated ex post lack legitimacy because they only refer to past trends; and fourthly, it is challenging to relate a reduction in deforestation rates to public policy options in the host country. Drawing lessons from our analysis of the methodological problems for the implementation of the mechanism, we recommend not promoting any mechanism based on financial rewards for an assumed voluntary reduction of national tropical deforestation rates. Two reasons justify our perspective: not only would the mechanism probably generate fake reductions (“hot air”), but undesirable side effects—detailed in this paper—would also appear. Instead, we encourage industrialized countries to better use already existing multi- and <b>bilateral</b> <b>instruments,</b> which focus on the correction of governance deficiencies in countries home to tropical forests.

Arguably, the George W. Bush administration favored intense bilateralism over multilateralism, or even unilateralism, for similar reasons.

40|$|The {{interaural}} {{level difference}} (ILD) {{is an important}} cue for the localization of sound sources. Just noticeable differences (JND) in ILD were measured in 12 normal hearing subjects for uncorrelated noise bands with a bandwidth of 13 octave and a different center frequency in both ears. In one ear the center frequency was either 250, 500, 1000, or 4000 Hz. In the other ear, a frequency shift of 0, 16, 13, or 1 octave was introduced. JNDs in ILD for unshifted, uncorrelated noise bands of 13 octave width were 2. 6, 2. 6, 2. 5, and 1. 4 dB for 250, 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz, respectively. Averaged over all shifts, JNDs decreased significantly with increasing frequency. For the shifted conditions, JNDs increased significantly with increasing shift.

40|$|Objective: Hearing {{instruments}} with adaptive {{directional microphone}} systems attempt to maximize speech-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thereby improve speech recognition in noisy backgrounds. When instruments with adaptive systems are fitted bilaterally, {{there is the}} potential for adverse effects as they operate independently and may give confusing cues or disturbing effects. The present study compared speech recognition performance in 16 listeners fitted bilaterally with the Phonak Claro hearing instrument using omni-directional, fixed directional, and adaptive directional microphone settings as well as mixed microphone settings (an omni-directional microphone on one side and an adaptive directional microphone on the other). Design: Under anechoic conditions, speech was always presented from a loudspeaker {{directly in front of the}} listener (0 degree azimuth) whereas noise was presented from one or two loudspeakers arranged either symmetrically (0, 180, 90 + 270 degrees) or asymmetrically (170 + 240 degrees and 120 + 190 degrees) in the horizontal plane. Adaptive sentence recognition in noise measurement was supplemented by quality ratings. Results: With symmetrical omni-directional settings (Omni/Omni), performance was poorer than a control group of 14 listeners with normal hearing tested unaided: Aided listeners required 4. 3 dB more favorable SNR for criterion performance. In all loudspeaker arrangements in which directional characteristics could be exploited, performance with symmetrical adaptive microphones (Adapt/Adapt) was similar to the control group. The mixed microphone settings did not appear to confer any particular disadvantage for speech recognition from their asymmetric nature, always giving scores significantly better than Omni/Omni. Quality rating scores were consistent with speech recognition performance, showing benefits in terms of clarity and comfort for the Adapt/Adapt and Fixed/Fixed microphone conditions over the Omni/Omni and mixed microphone conditions wherever directional characteristics could be used. Similarly, the mixed microphone conditions were rated more comfortable and quieter for the noise than Omni/Omni. Conclusions: It is concluded that <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>instruments</b> with adaptive directional microphones confer benefits in terms of speech recognition in noise and sound quality. Independence of the two adaptive control systems does not appear to cause untoward effects. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Although {{existing}} {{estimates of}} adaptation funding needs {{in developing countries}} are still very vague, they all indicate that they are and {{will be in the}} tens of billions €/&# 36; per annum. At the same time, many developing countries presently do not have the relevant 'absorptive capacity' – the capacity to carry out the adaptation measures needed −even if the funding were available. Most will unnecessarily have to suffer adverse impacts of climate change that could be avoided under an improved adaptation regime. The responsibility for these avoidable adverse impacts – whether {{due to a lack of}} funding or of absorptive capacity − will fall squarely on industrialised countries. Some stakeholders, mainly from the developed world, have been tempted to cite the lack of certainty about the adaptation funding needs of developing countries and their lack in absorptive capacity as reasons to postpone a debate of the thorny issue of international adaptation finance. This is short-sighted at best and disingenuous at worst. The two issues are intricately linked, and there is an urgent need to look into ways of simultaneously scaling up the provision of adaptation funds for developing countries of the appropriate kind, and the absorptive capacity to use these funds meaningfully. While this paper is about the former, the debate on how the funds are best spent on the ground is by no means of lesser importance. At present, all international adaptation funding instruments − except the recently operationalised Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund − are replenished through ODA-type bilateral donations. The level of international funding for adaptation in developing countries is woefully inadequate to meet projected needs. The current <b>bilateral</b> donation <b>instruments</b> are unlikely to ever be able to generate the required levels of funding, especially as it is meant to be additional to ODA (viz. experience with the Monterrey 0. 7 % GNI commitment for ODA). Moreover, adaptation funding is seen by most developing countries not as a matter of 'donations' but as one of costs imposed by developed countries, and as such as debt incurred by them. Accordingly, neither of the traditional ODA funding modes (grants or concessionary loans), are seen to be appropriate payment modes. Funding is expected, and must be 'acceptable', in the sense of being not only appropriate, but new and additional, predictable, equitable, and adequate...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the product}} of a long journey of reflection, which the authors planned as {{doctoral}} students at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence in 2006 and finally completed at the Edinburgh University School of Law in June 2011. The book examines the integration of environmental protection requirements into EU external relations focusing on unilateral, <b>bilateral</b> and inter-regional <b>instruments,</b> which have been less explored than the multilateral dimension of EU environmental policy. The book also explores for the first time the complex interplay and mutual influences between EU environmental integration initiatives and environmental multilateralism. On the one hand it identifies the legal and other instruments used by the EU to support the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements in third countries (particularly developing ones). On the other hand, it singles out the legal and other tools employed by the EU as a means to build partnerships with third countries in order to influence ongoing multilateral negotiations concerning the environment and sustainable development, or to contribute to the development of new international environmental norms in the absence of such multilateral negotiations. Ultimately, the book traces the significant evolution of the various tools deployed by the EU to integrate environmental concerns in its external relations, with a view to identifying emerging challenges and future directions.

First Version: August 31, 2006 Despite the {{increasing}} importance of services in national economies (accounting for about 50 - 70 % of internal product), in global economy (accounting for the 20 % of global trade) {{and in public}} opinion (i. e. US Concern about Mexican workers due to migration laws or {{the case of the}} “polish plumbers ” in France at the time of European Constitution referendum) there is no economic consensus about the way in what services should be considered in trade liberalization analyses. Some economists argue that trade in services is not really much different from trade in goods, while others claim for the existence of specificities. The double purpose of this paper is; first, to empirically determine to what extent trade in services differs from trade in goods and, second, to explore the potential complementarity between bilateral trade in goods and bilateral trade in services. For our first goal we regress a set of equations derived from the gravitational model and for the second we <b>instrument</b> <b>bilateral</b> trade for both services and goods in order to analyse potential causalities of each type of flow in the other. Main results show that “bilateral trust and contract enforcement environment”, “Networks”, “labor markets ” and “technology and technology of communication ” have more impact on service trade than on trade in goods; finally, after instrumenting for endogeneity, we found that bilateral trade in goods explains bilateral trade in services: the resulting estimated elasticity is close to 1. Reciprocally, bilateral trade in services affects positively bilateral trade in goods: a 10 % increase in trade in services raises traded goods by 4. 6 %...|$|R
40|$|In 2013 the OECD {{launched}} an unprecedented initiative {{in the field}} of international taxation focusing its activity and attention on a new emerging global issue: the erosion of the taxable bases in qualified tax jurisdiction, and the subsequent shifting of profits in fa-vour of others. This (apparently) new phenomenon is originated by the possibility given to the busi-nesses in general (and to MNEs – Multi National Enterprises - in particular) {{to make the most of}} domestic rules and of Double Taxation Conventions in order to allocate the prof-its they make in the most favourable jurisdiction. This strategy should not be confused with tax evasion or avoidance. The two latter situations are currently tackled by specific provisions in different tax systems ranging from tailor-made provisions to GAARs (- General Anti Avoidance Rules - where applicable) to the Abuse of Law doctrine. Base erosion, on the other hand, is a broader phenomenon: it occurs when a business scheme leads to remarkable savings in taxation via the proper application of domestic rules or DTCs (Double Taxation Conventions). In this respect, Academic literature has been warning policy makers and stakeholders from the risks of possible double non-taxation induced by the overlap of DTCs with domestic rules that has ben changed trough years. Traditionally, the OECD intervention in this respect has always maintained one prior-ity: the prevention of (international) double taxation via <b>bilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> (Treaties) inspired by the Model delivered and interpreted consistently with the Commentary also drafted by the OECD itself. The explosion of the global financial crisis and the subsequent increased need for an ever increasing amount of tax revenue by many States belonging to the OECD created however the most appropriate momentum for a change of perspectives. Following the historical momentum, OECD urged for the necessity of a shift of para-digm in international taxation: time has (allegedly) come for a move from the prevention of double taxation to the implementation of an actual taxation of MNEs and cross border profits. In this respect, DTCs, the Model and the Soft law should be interpreted in a way to make actual taxation of cross border income as a certain result, preventing therefore double non-taxation. Ambitious and bold as it is, the BEPS initiative started in 2013 with a number of doc-uments and some as 15 separate actions addressing specific and qualified situations orig-inating base erosion in respective tax jurisdictions: the issue of tax coordination and dou-ble deductions are two of them, with the first being actually a remedy (also) to the sec-ond. Double deduction occurs in cases in which a cost may be deducted in both tax juris-dictions by the same legal entity (a company or a group of companies, if group relief is allowed and the group of company is considered as a legal entity) thus determining and illogic, unfair and ultimately unacceptable reduction of the overall burden. The OECD Report in this respect lists a remarkable number of different cases and sit-uations in which this outcome may be achieved by the taxpayer, without falling into any case of avoidance or abuse. Despite the considerable technical differences, with a rea-sonable margin of appreciation it could be concluded that most of them are determined by legal mismatches of qualification between the two legal jurisdictions and concerning either the flow of income or the legal entity of the case. In this respect asymmetries may concern a legal entity qualified as transparent by a jurisdiction and not by the other, or a specific income considered as an interest paid in the source State (thus deductible for tax purposes) and as dividend in the residence State (thus enjoying a full – or partial – exemption from taxation. Similar asymmetries may also concern the notion of PE (Permanent Establishment) and the ways and means to tax profits attributable to it in the different tax jurisdictions: on the top of that, the existence (or not) of the PE in the view of the two different tax ju-risdictions may also lead to double non-taxation or double deduction of costs. Action n. 2 of the BEPS Report (on Double deductions) describes in details the differ-ent situations listed above and further ways and many o reach the same result without falling into a case of Abuse of law or tax avoidance, with some of the situations depicted that may also potentially be of some interest for the Italian legal system. As a matter of fact, in a recent past, the Italian Supreme Court decided some cases in a way to open a remarkable leeway for base erosion (or profit shifting) by the taxpayer, interpreting a DTC in a way which was perhaps not entirely consistent with the OECD guidelines applicable ratione temporis. The new BEPS initiative should help to prevent from other decisions to be taken in the same direction. While discussion on the BEPS rages on in every OECD Country (and beyond) the case of Italy is however peculiar for purely domestic reasons as well. The Italian Parliament approved very recently an Act (n° 23 passed in 2014) empow-ering the Government to reform the fiscal system making in more simple, accessible, less burdensome for the taxpayer. In this respect it also provided specific guidelines to be re-spected by the Government in its future regulatory activity (with a quasi-legislative effect). It’s noteworthy to read at Article 12 of the aforementioned Act that the Government will have to draft the future decrees “… consistently with the recommendations by supra-national organizations …”. Reference is made of course (and first of all) to the EU soft law, but there’s no literal or legal element excluding the BEPS initiative from that refer-ence. This would arguably be the first case in the recent tax history of the Country in which such a large reference is made to non domestic guidelines by the Italian Parlia-ment, allowing the Government to transform policy guidelines and soft law into legally binding provisions of the Italian law. Even if it’s still too early at this stage to assess whether the Government shall pick the opportunity and make use of this possibility or not, nonetheless it remains in line of prin-ciple the relevance of the opportunity, the impact of the OECD-inspired global order and, eventually, the attempt of making a sort of lex mercatoria fisci which has still to be however drafted in details...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{unprecedented}} bloom of investment arbitration, arbitrators and scholars have increasingly faced {{the challenge of}} systematizing the growing body of case law. The difficult task {{is complicated by the}} fact that there is no single investment agreement to apply, but a panoply of <b>bilateral</b> and regional <b>instruments,</b> with sophisticated clauses and technical specificities. Lawyers recur to a different methods to analyse and systematize the congeries of decisions. Traditionally in common law legal systems, a precedent or authority is a decision establishing a principle or a rule that courts will follow when deciding subsequent cases with analogues issues. Civil lawyers theoretically have a different approach as previous case law is not formally considered as a source of law. However, as a matter of fact civil lawyers do look and study previous jurisprudence. As every civil lawyer well knows, judges show reverential consideration for national supreme courts decisions. [1] Cases are relevant and have to be cited in the course of proceedings. This paper analyses the question whether the doctrine of binding precedent can be transplanted to investment arbitration. A traditional feature of arbitration is that tribunals are not bound by precedents. Thus, similar issues may be treated in an entirely different way with the consequent potential to generate conflicting rulings, and contribute to considerable uncertainty for investors and host states alike. [2] As arbitral panels have not a permanent nature, the issue of consistency becomes even more problematic. This paper argues that the doctrine of binding precedent should not be viewed as a panacea or an end in itself. On the contrary, it should be considered as a tool for creating consistency and predictability. Thus, this paper will argue that, due to the intrinsic characteristics of investment arbitration, the doctrine of persuasive precedent is a more attuned tool to achieve consistency and justice in concrete cases. This paper argues that precedents should not be binding, but considered as persuasive. The difference between the two concepts is subtle, but important. To clarify the idea a few metaphors may help. As a philosopher once put it, 'law is like art in that typically it is made to be interpreted. '[3] a binding precedent is like copying a statue. A persuasive precedent is very much like using the master's tools to create something new. Indeed, the most recent awards seem to validate the theory of persuasive precedent: on the one hand, arbitrators do analyze previous cases, on the other, they reaffirm their independence and lack of institutional subordination. This approach has to be welcomed as it can provide flexibility and high quality awards. The paper will thus focus on judicial reasoning and legal methodology with a look at the recent case la...|$|R
