50|$|The <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> (<b>bovine</b> <b>virus</b> diarrhea) {{is said to}} be recrudescent {{for some}} time after {{clinical}} signs have abated, because antibodies plateau c. weeks 10-12, and are not lifelong, auto infection may potentially occur in the acutely infected non-pregnant animal. However this is not thought to contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of the disease.|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of bovine pestivirus disease, {{in which there}} was high mortality (37 %) in 102 calves, was investigated. It was postulated that the severity of the outbreak may have been due to the presence of a highly virulent strain of <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus.</b> Nine calves from the field outbreak were transported to Massey University for detailed clinical, post-mortem and laboratory examination. Samples were also submitted from a further three animals on the farm. The results of immunological and virological studies indicated that seven calves had acute <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> infection and five calves had mucosal disease. Although the mucosal disease cases showed more severe clinical signs, lesions were widespread in both groups. A non-cytopathic <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> isolate from one calf was used as the challenge virus in a transmission experiment designed to investigate the pathogenicity of this strain. The 11 calves used in this experiment comprised of four unvaccinated, challenged calves, four vaccinated calves (two challenged, two in-contact), two unvaccinated, in-contact calves and a control (neither vaccinated nor in-contact). The experiment took place over a month, allowing multiple clinical examinations and sampling procedures to be carried out before necropsy. The challenge virus caused mild disease, with lesions similar to those reported in experiments in which Type 1 <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> isolates were used. Following experimental challenge, virus was not recovered from the calves, but a serological diagnosis of <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> infection was made by demonstrating a greater than fourfold rise in titre of <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> antibody in all challenged calves. There were only minor changes in haematological indices in challenged calves. The six challenged calves showed two distinctive lesions in intestinal sections. These were crypt necrosis (of glands of Lieburkuhn) and cryptal prolapse (herniation of crypts into the submucosal site of Peyer's patches depleted of lymphocytes). In the disease outbreak, these lesions were only observed in the mucosal disease cases. Focal haemorrhages at sites of lymphocytic nodules were found in the nasal cavity of all challenged and vaccinated calves in the transmission experiment, but not in the unvaccinated, in-contact calves or the control calf. These lesions have not been reported in natural infections. Vaccination was only partially protective, and there was evidence of spread of <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> infection to one vaccinated, in-contact calf. Scoring of histological lesions allowed a measurement of the effect of vaccination. There was a 60 % reduction in the total histological lesion score in the four vaccinated calves (two challenged, two in-contact) when compared with the four unvaccinated, challenged animals. It was concluded that the high mortality seen in the calves in the field outbreak was due to mucosal disease, and that this was consequential to a high infection rate in the dams during pregancy {{at a time when the}} foetuses were at risk of becoming persistently infected (45 - 125 days of gestation). The pathological "fingerprint" for <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> infection was found to be the concomitant finding of three lesions at necropsy. Firstly, erosive lesions in the squamous epithelium of the upper alimentary tract. Secondly, catarrhal enteritis, with the distinctive and characteristic microscopic lesions of crypt necrosis and cryptal prolapse. Thirdly, lymphoid tissue lesions, especially lymph node enlargement, lymphoid depletion and inflammation of Peyer's patches. Despite the difficulties in pathotyping the challenge virus in the transmission experiment, there was little evidence that it was a Type 2 strain. Genetic typing of this virus, by sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products, would be useful in determining its place in the phylogeny of bovine pestiviruses...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{studies on}} epidemiological aspects of infection of a dairy herd with <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus.</b> Serum neutralizing antibodies were measured and isolation of virus was attempted from animals in one commercial dairy farm and from bobby calves collected from dairy {{farms in the}} Manawatu Region for slaughter at a local abattoir. The work is presented in six chapters. The first chapter is {{a review of the}} literature relevant to the present work. The second is a description of the general materials and methods. The third, fourth and fifth give the results of the investigations carried out and the sixth is summary, a general discussion and conclusion of the major findings. References are cited at the end of the thesis. Appendices I and II describe the preparation of the media for cell culture, reagents and solutions, and publications related to the work. All of the replacement heifers and 97. 1 % of the adult milking herd had serum neutralizing antibodies to <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus.</b> There was no significant difference (p > 0. 05) in the geometric mean titres of each age group of the animals in the herd. The serum antibody titres of the cohort of one to four day old calves reflected those of their dams and declined steadily, with a half life of 25 days, so that by eight months of age, all calves tested negative. The serum neutralizing antibody titres in a group of bobby calves at a local abattoir were significantly lower (p < 0. 001) than those of the cohort of calves on the farm. <b>Bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> was isolated from blood samples from 21 of 340 (6. 1 %) animals and five (1. 4 %) of these animals were still infected when retested 12 months later. The distribution of serum neutralizing antibodies in infected animals ranged from < 0. 6 to 2. 7. Three of the persistently infected animals had no detectable neutralizing antibodies (titres < 0. 6) but two had titres of 0. 9 and 1. 8. The age of the infected animals ranged from one to more than eight years. Persistently infected animals provided an adequate mechanism for the maintenance of <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> in the herd. It is postulated that animals, in contact with persistently infected animals, may be reinfected when their antibody titres decline below protective levels. The viral interference assay and fluorescent antibody test were used to detect virus in cultures of blood samples. These two methods were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity and appeared to be equally suitable for virus isolation. In the present work there was 88. 4 % agreement between the two tests, while the viral interference assay was found to be relatively more sensitive but less specific than the fluorescent antibody test. The results of this work indicate that infection with <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> is endemic on the farm studied and that most animals become infected by the time they are twelve months old. However, depending on the particular management practices used, some groups of heifer calves may not be exposed to virus before they reach breeding age. It also appears that infection with <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> is common on many dairy farms in the Manawatu Region. If identification and elimination of persistently infected animals is an option for the control of <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> in an endemically infected population, a laboratory test with high specificity and sensitivity and which is easy to perform will be required. If eradication of BVDV from the farm is not practical then immunization of heifers around the age of 12 months, either by exposure to persistently infected animals in the herd or by using inactivated vaccines, may protect them against infection during the first breeding period thus minimizing foetal infection...|$|R

Two antigenically distinct genotypes of BVDV exist, types 1 and 2. According to the OIE (2008), bovine viral diarrhoea/mucosal disease (BVD/MD) and classical swine fever (CSF) are notifiable diseases and hence eradication programmes are underway in several countries worldwide.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{performed}} to gain {{knowledge about the}} quantitative distribution of <b>bovine</b> <b>virus</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus (BVDV) in tissues and white blood cells (WBC) at different intervals after acute infection. Ten specific pathogen-free calves were intranasally inoculated with 105 50 % tissue culture infective dose of the non-cytopathic BVDV strain 4800. Twelve hours after inoculation tonsil biopsies were taken and WBC were collected daily for virus isolation and titration. Each day one calf was killed and virus isolations and titrations were performed {{from a range of}} tissues. The results indicate that BVDV first replicates in nasal mucosa and to high titers in the tonsil. The virus then appeared to spread to the regional lymph nodes and then disseminates throughout the body. The virus titers were highest in tonsil, thymus and ileum and were low in the WBC. Also after in vitro infection virus titers in WBC were very low, whereas, they were high in epithelial cells. Although the WBC might not be as important as other cells for replication of BVDV, they {{may play a role in}} the spread of the virus throughout the body. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|To {{control the}} {{diseases}} caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1), bovine {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (BRSV), and <b>bovine</b> <b>virus</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus (BVDV), {{it is crucial to}} know their modes of transmission. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether these viruses can be transmitted by air to a substantial extent. Calves were housed in two separate isolation stables in which a unidirectional airflow was maintained through a tube in the wall. In one stable, three of the five calves were experimentally infected with BHV 1 and later with BRSV. In the BVDV experiment, two calves persistently infected with BVDV (PI-calves) instead of experimentally infected calves, were used as the source of the virus. In all the calves infections were monitored using virus and antibody detection. Results showed that all the three viruses were transmitted by air. BHV 1 spread to sentinel calves in the adjacent stable within three days, and BRSV within nine days, and BVDV spread to sentinel calves probably within one week. Although airborne transmission is possibly not the main route of transmission, these findings will have consequences for disease prevention and regulations in control programmes.

40|$|International audienceThe genus Pestivirus {{contains}} four recognized species: classical {{swine fever}} virus, Border disease <b>virus,</b> <b>bovine</b> viral <b>diarrhoea</b> <b>virus</b> types 1 and 2. All are economically important and globally distributed but {{classical swine fever}} is the most serious, concerning losses and control measures. It affects both domestic pigs and wild boars. Outbreaks of this disease in domestic pigs call for the most serious measures of disease control, including a stamping out policy in Europe. Since {{all the members of}} the Pestivirus genus can infect swine, differential diagnosis using traditional methods poses some problems. Antibody tests may lack specificity due to cross-reactions, antigen capture ELISAs may have low sensitivity, and virus isolation may take several days or even longer time to complete. PCR-based tests overcome these problems for the most part, but in general lack the multiplexing capability to detect and differentiate all the pestiviruses simultaneously. The assay platform described here addresses all of these issues by combining the advantages of real-time PCR with the multiplexing capability of microarray technology. The platform includes a TaqMan real-time PCR designed for the universal detection of pestiviruses and a microarray assay that can use the amplicons produced in the real-time PCR to identify the specific pestivirus...|$|R

For the differentiation of BVDV isolates, the 5 ’-UTR and Npro regions were selected. A 288 -bp fragment from 5 ’-UTR and 428 -bp fragment from Npro of the selected isolates were amplified by RT-PCR and subsequently sequenced and analysed by computer-assisted phylogenetic analysis. The isolates belong to BVDV- 1 genotype and the followin...|$|R
