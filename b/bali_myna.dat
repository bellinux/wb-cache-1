5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features.

Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E

50|$|In June 2011, West Bali National Park {{received}} 40 <b>Bali</b> <b>mynas</b> {{released from}} Surabaya Zoo and 20 from Taman Safari Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|A {{population}} of <b>Bali</b> <b>mynas</b> now {{exists on the}} island of Nusa Penida and its sister islands of Nusa Ceningan, Nusa Lembongan, which are 14 km off the south east coast of Bali. The islands have been transformed into an unofficial bird sanctuary by Friends of National Parks Foundation (FNPF), an Indonesian NGO based in Bali. This was achieved by FNPF working for many years with the 40+ villages on the islands and persuading every village to pass a traditional Balinese village regulation to protect birds, and effectively removing the threat of poachers. Since then, FNPF has rehabilitated and released several endangered birds onto the island of Nusa Penida, including many <b>Bali</b> <b>mynas</b> supplied from multiple breeders.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> is {{critically}} endangered, {{and the wild}} population has been close to extinction since at least 1994. As of 2015, less than 100 adults are assumed {{to exist in the}} wild, with about 1,000 believed to survive in captivity. The <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> is listed in Appendix I of CITES. Trade even in captive-bred specimens is strictly regulated and the species is not generally available legally to private individuals. However, experienced aviculturalists may become affiliated with captive-breeding programs, allowing them to legally keep this species. The number of captive birds bought on the black market is estimated to be twice the number of legally acquired individuals in the captive breeding programs.|$|E
50|$|The Potter Park Zoo's Feline and Primate Building houses three Amur (Siberian) tigers, three African lions, a snow leopard, lemurs, mandrills, and {{endangered}} tamarin monkeys. The Bird and Reptile House features {{a wide variety}} of reptiles such as boas, gila monsters, and emerald tree snakes, and birds such as macaws, eastern screech owls, kookaburras, {{and endangered}} <b>Bali</b> <b>mynas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Begawan Foundation {{began its}} Bali Starling Breeding Program in Begawan Giri in 1999 with two pairs, which {{had grown to}} a {{population}} of 97 in 2005. A release program was started on Nusa Penida, where 64 individuals were released in 2006 and 2007. Monitoring of the released birds suggests that their numbers had increased to +100 by 2009, and had spread across Penida, with small numbers also breeding on Ceningan and Lembongan. A number of further captive-bred individuals have since been rewilded, including 6 individuals on neighboring Nusa Lembongan. The foundation expects to release approximately 10 <b>Bali</b> <b>mynas</b> each year. The birds {{will continue to be}} sourced from different breeders to increase the genetic diversity of the growing wild population on Nusa Penida. Begawan Foundation field staff have monitored the released birds on a daily basis since their release and have a dedicated Field Officer since 2010. Findings are regularly reported their findings to the Forestry Department, with photos and films taken of the birds' activities.|$|R
50|$|Taman Safari I covers {{an area of}} 170 ha {{and houses}} a {{collection}} of 2,500 animals, including Bengal tigers, Malayan sun bears, giraffes, orangutans, hippos, zebras, cheetahs, elephants, and Komodo dragons. Some, such as the <b>Bali</b> <b>myna,</b> are involved in conservation projects. The majority of the species represented are Indonesian.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> is {{restricted}} to the island of Bali (and its offshore islands) in Indonesia, where it is the island's only endemic vertebrate species. (An endemic subspecies, the Bali tiger, has been extinct since 1937). The bird was discovered in 1910, and in 1991 was designated the faunal emblem of Bali. Featured on the Indonesian 200 rupiah coin, its local name is jalak Bali.|$|E
50|$|Some 160 {{species can}} be found inside the park, {{including}} the banteng, barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, hawksbill turtle, Indian muntjac, Java sparrow, Javan lutung, large flying fox, leopard cat, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, rusa deer, sacred kingfisher, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, water monitor, wild boar, yellow-vented bulbul and the critically endangered <b>Bali</b> <b>myna.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> is a medium-large bird around 25 cm in length. It {{is almost}} wholly white with a long, {{drooping}} crest, black wing-tips and tail tip. It has a yellow bill with blue bare skin {{around the eyes}} and legs. The black-winged starling (Sturnus melanopterus), a similar species, has a shorter crest and a much larger area of black on wings and tail, plus a yellow eye-ring (without feathers) and legs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> (Leucopsar rothschildi), {{also known}} as Rothschild's mynah, Bali starling, or Bali mynah, locally known as jalak Bali, is a {{medium-sized}} (up to 25 cm long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and fewer than 100 adults are assumed to currently exist in the wild.|$|E

50|$|Bali {{lies just}} {{to the west of}} the Wallace Line, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok. An {{exception}} is the yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered <b>Bali</b> <b>myna,</b> which is endemic. Others include barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, Java sparrow, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, woodswallow, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.|$|E
50|$|Mynas are not {{a natural}} group; instead, the term myna is used for any {{starling}} in the Indian subcontinent, regardless of their relationships. This range was colonized twice during the evolution of starlings, first by rather ancestral starlings related to the coleto and Aplonis lineages, and millions of years later by birds related to the common starling and wattled starling's ancestors. These two groups of mynas can be distinguished in the more terrestrial adaptions of the latter, which usually also have less glossy plumage except on the heads and longer tails. The <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> which is nearly extinct in the wild is highly distinctive.|$|E
50|$|The {{three species}} are all {{sedentary}} specialists of cold regions. Willow ptarmigan is a circumpolar boreal forest species, white-tailed ptarmigan is a North American alpine bird, and rock ptarmigan breeds in both Arctic and mountain habitats across Eurasia and North America. All, {{with the exception}} of the red grouse, have a white winter plumage that helps them blend into the snowy background. Even their remiges are white, while these feathers are black in almost all birds (even birds that are predominantly white, such as the <b>Bali</b> <b>myna)</b> because melanin makes them more resilient and thus improves flight performance. The Lagopus grouse apparently found it easier to escape predators by not being seen than by flying away.|$|E
50|$|The black-winged {{starling}} {{was once}} an abundant bird, {{so much so that}} it was considered a potential rival and threat to the threatened <b>Bali</b> <b>myna.</b> The species has declined, however, for much the same reasons as the Bali starling, principally collection for the caged-bird trade. The black-winged starling {{is one of the most}} popular species among collectors; in recent years the number of birds entering the trade has declined as they have become increasingly rare in the wild. In 2010 the species has been uplisted from endangered to critically endangered by the IUCN and it is believed that the population has declined by at least 80% over the last 10 years. The species is also potentially threatened by changes in agricultural processes, and scientists are also concerned about genetic variation being lost as escapees mix the three subspecies. Escapees of this species briefly formed a breeding population in Singapore, but that population is now thought to be extinct.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> (Leucopsar rothschildi Stresemann, 1912) was {{reported}} as an endemic bird from {{western part of}} Bali Island, and also as endangered species. The species lived in the lowland forest and used tree holes made by other animals as their nests. Besides L. rothschildi, there were two other species of birds found using the holes as their nest in the study site, namely Black-winged starling(Sturnus melanopterus (Daudin, 1800)) and Javan myna (Acridotheres fitscus (Wagler, 1827)). This paper deals with result {{of research on the}} competition of those three species of birds in obtaining tree hole for nesting, was carried out in West Bali National Park, Bali. Data demonstrated that there were no differences in the size of nest for the three species of birds, Javan myna lived in the habitat of coconut garden where <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> did not occupy it, and the habitat of Black-winged starling was overlapped with <b>Bali</b> <b>myna,</b> but <b>Bali</b> <b>myna</b> preferred living in denser vegetation. The reproduction of the three species of birds were dependent on the occurrence of other birds species belonging to Picidae and Capitonidae who were able to make holes on trees...|$|E
