5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, <b>bloodroot,</b> sensitive fern, sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others.

5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, <b>bloodroot,</b> blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E

60|$|A {{black ant}} went {{in one day}} and made a tour of {{exploration}} up and down, over chairs and tables, up the ceilings and down again, and, coming out, wrote an article for the Crickets' Gazette, in which he described the new abode as a veritable palace. Several butterflies fluttered in and sailed about and were wonderfully delighted, and then a bumble-bee {{and two or three}} honey-bees, who expressed themselves well pleased with the house, but more especially enchanted with the garden. In fact, when {{it was found that the}} proprietors were very fond of the rural solitudes of Nature, and had come out there for the purpose of enjoying them undisturbed; that they watched and spared the anemones, and the violets, and <b>bloodroots,</b> and dog's- tooth violets, and little woolly rolls of fern that began to grow up under the trees in spring; that they never allowed a gun to be fired to scare the birds, and watched the building of their nests with the greatest interest,--then an opinion in favour of human beings began to gain ground, and every cricket and bird and beast was loud in their praise.|$|R

[...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows, and this tree is {{an excellent source of}} wood for lumber or furniture. [...] Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. [...] Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash. [...] The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including <b>bloodroot</b> and wild geranium.|$|E

60|$|Insall {{was often}} there, and on Saturdays and Sundays he took Mrs. Maturin and Janet on long {{walks into the}} country. There were afternoons when the world was flooded with silver light, when the fields were lucent in the sun; and afternoons stained with blue,--the {{landscape}} like a tapestry woven in delicate grins on a ground of indigo. The arbutus, all aglow and fragrant beneath its leaves, the purple fringed polygala were past, but they found the pale gold lily of the bellwort, the rust-red bloom of the ginger. In the open spaces under the sky were clouds of bluets, wild violets, and white strawberry flowers clustering beside the star moss all a-shimmer with new green. The Canada Mayflower spread a carpet under the pines; and in the hollows where the mists settled, where the brooks flowed, where the air was heavy with the damp, ineffable odour of growing things, they gathered drooping adder's-tongues, white-starred <b>bloodroots</b> and foam-flowers. From Insall's quick eye nothing seemed to escape. He would point out to them the humming-bird that hovered, a bright blur, above the columbine, the woodpecker glued to {{the trunk of a}} maple high above their heads, the red gleam of a tanager flashing through sunlit foliage, the oriole and vireo where they hid. And his was the ear that first caught the exquisite, distant note of the hermit. Once he stopped them, startled, to listen to the cock partridge drumming to its mate....|$|R
2500|$|Prior to European {{settlement}} {{the area}} would have borne tallgrass prairie, with groves of trees growing where the lakes blocked {{some of the}} advancing wildfires. [...] Today the park is primarily forested with basswood, bur oak, and green ash with [...] a few stands of northern red oak. [...] Ironwood is abundant in the shrub layer and the understory is characterized by Virginia waterleaf. [...] Other wildflowers include nodding trillium, large-flowered bellwort, Dutchman's breeches, <b>bloodroot,</b> jack-in-the-pulpit, and starry false Solomon seal. [...] There are [...] of this habitat type, all of it secondary forest.|$|E
2500|$|Myrmecochory is the {{dispersal}} of seeds by ants. Foraging ants disperse seeds which have appendages called elaiosomes (e.g. <b>bloodroot,</b> trilliums, acacias, and {{many species of}} Proteaceae). [...] Elaiosomes are soft, fleshy structures that contain nutrients for animals that eat them. [...] The ants carry such seeds back to their nest, where the elaiosomes are eaten. [...] The remainder of the seed, which is hard and inedible to the ants, then germinates either within the nest or at a removal site where the seed has been discarded by the ants. [...] This dispersal relationship {{is an example of}} mutualism, since the plants depend upon the ants to disperse seeds, while the ants depend upon the plants seeds for food. [...] As a result, a drop in numbers of one partner can reduce success of the other. [...] In South Africa, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) has invaded and displaced native species of ants. [...] Unlike the native ant species, Argentine ants do not collect the seeds of Mimetes cucullatus or eat the elaiosomes. [...] In areas where these ants have invaded, the numbers of Mimetes seedlings have dropped.|$|E

60|$|April 26.--At sunrise, {{the pure}} clear {{sound of the}} meadow lark. An hour later, some notes, few and simple, yet delicious and perfect, from the bush-sparrow-towards noon the reedy trill of the robin. To-day is the fairest, sweetest yet--penetrating warmth--a lovely veil in the air, partly heat-vapor and partly from the turf-fires {{everywhere}} in patches on the farms. A group of soft maples near by silently bursts out in crimson tips, buzzing all day with busy bees. The white sails of sloops and schooners glide {{up and down the}} river; and long trains of cars, with ponderous roll, or faint bell notes, almost constantly on the opposite shore. The earliest wild flowers in the woods and fields, spicy arbutus, blue liverwort, frail anemone, and the pretty white blossoms of the <b>bloodroot.</b> I launch out in slow rambles, discovering them. As I go along the roads I like to see the farmers' fires in patches, burning the dry brush, turf, debris. How the smoke crawls along, flat to the ground, slanting, slowly rising, reaching away, and at last dissipating. I like its acrid smell--whiffs just reaching me--welcomer than French perfume.|$|E

50|$|Sanguinarine kills animal cells by {{blocking}} {{the action of}} Na+/K+-ATPase transmembrane proteins.
