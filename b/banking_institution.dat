5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new <b>banking</b> <b>institution</b> was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{vulnerability}} of <b>banking</b> <b>institutions</b> in terms of exposure to money laundering, satisfactory money laundering risk assessment is vital. In <b>banking</b> <b>institutions,</b> the frontline officers who are dealing with customers for banking activities such as opening an account, savings, withdrawal and remittance are the frontline of defense responsible to undertake money laundering risk assessment. A series of interviews conducted with compliance officers who supervise the assessment of money laundering risk and a central banker who supervise the regulation on anti-money laundering are analyzed {{in order to understand}} how frontline officers discharge their duties in assessing money laundering risk in Malaysian <b>banking</b> <b>institutions.</b> Interview findings suggest that money laundering risk is a real risk in the <b>banking</b> <b>institutions,</b> and the frontline officers should be adequately competent in discharging their duties. Even if the <b>banking</b> <b>institutions</b> are equipped with automated risk management solutions, manual (human expertise) is indispensable in assessing money laundering risk. Support provided by the compliance department is seen as complementary for the roles played by the frontline officers and monitoring ensued by the regulatory authority should have enhanced the compliance intensity in the <b>banking</b> <b>institutions...</b>|$|R

25|$|The state Bank of Indiana was a {{government}} chartered <b>banking</b> <b>institution</b> established in 1833 {{in response to}} the state's shortage of capital caused by the closure of the Second Bank of the United States by the administration of President Andrew Jackson. The bank operated for twenty-six years and allowed the state to finance its internal improvements, stabilized the state's currency problems, and encouraged greater private economic growth. The bank closed in 1859. The profits were then split between the shareholders, allowing depositors to exchange their bank notes for federal notes, and the bank's buildings and infrastructure were sold and reincorporated as the privately owned Second Bank of Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Corporation Bank, {{the oldest}} <b>banking</b> <b>institution</b> in the {{erstwhile}} undivided South Canara District of the Madras Presidency {{and one of}} the oldest banks in India, was founded on 12 March 1906 in the Temple Town of Udupi by a small group of philanthropists, as there was no such bank at Udupi, an important trading centre next to Mangalore. The first branch of a modern bank established in the district was the Bank of Madras, one of the three Presidency Banks, which set up its office in Mangalore in 1868, largely to cater to the business needs of a few British firms dealing in export of plantation products. Its agent used to visit Udupi once a fortnight or so, to do banking. Money remittances had to be made only through postal medium.|$|E
40|$|We use {{a classic}} Merton credit risk {{framework}} {{to argue that}} Islamic <b>Banking</b> <b>Institutions</b> (IBIs) face less incentive to take on risks than Conventional <b>Banking</b> <b>Institutions</b> (CBI). IBIs have less incentive for risk shifting both in and outside of distress situations. We test and confirm this prediction in an empirical analysis based on a dataset covering all CBIs, IBIs, and Islamic and conventional subsidiaries of mixed <b>banking</b> <b>institutions</b> in Pakistan. We find that full-fledged Islamic banks (IBs) are indeed more stable than conventional <b>banking</b> <b>institutions</b> (CBIs), and are better capitalized than their conventional counterparts. IBIs also have less volatile asset returns, less non-performing loans (NPLs) and lower loan loss provisioning. Similar results obtain for Islamic windows of mixed banks compared with conventional windows. The analysis suggests that the loss absorption capacity of Islamic banks leads to less risk taking and a more stable banking system...|$|R

25|$|Chile {{approved}} {{class actions}} in 2004. The Chilean model is technically an opt-out issue class action {{followed by a}} compensatory stage which can be collective or individual. This means that the class action is designed to declare the defendant generally liable with erga omnes effects {{if and only if}} the defendant is found liable, and the declaratory judgment can be used then to pursue damages in the same procedure or in individual ones in different jurisdictions. If the latter is the case, the liability cannot be discussed but only the damages. There under the Chilean procedural rules, one particular case works as an opt-out class action for damages. This is the case when defendants can identify and compensate consumer directly, i.e. because it is their <b>banking</b> <b>institution.</b> In such cases the judge can skip the compensatory stage and order redress directly. Since 2005 more than 100 cases have been filed, mostly by Servicio Nacional del Consumidor , the Chilean consumer protection agency. Salient cases have been the case Condecus v. BancoEstado, and SERNAC v. La Polar.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} passage of the National Bank Act by Congress in 1864, several banks were {{chartered}} in Erie. One of these, Dime Savings and Loan, was founded in 1866; it was reorganized as the Erie Trust Company in 1902. The economic boom following World War I set off a flurry of building activity in downtown Erie, including a ten-story skyscraper at 12th and State Streets. By the mid-1920s, the Erie Trust Company had become the dominant <b>banking</b> <b>institution</b> in the city and needed space to expand. The bank hired the New York City-architectural firm Dennison and Hirons in 1925 to design its new headquartersthe firm also designed the Home Savings Bank Building in Albany, New York. The Erie Trust Company Building was completed in 1928 at a cost of $2million. A year later, the stock market crashed sparking the Great Depression, and, by 1933, the Erie Trust Company went bankrupt. Its remnants and that of another defunct bank were reorganized into the National Bank and Trust, which continued to occupy its former headquarters now owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.|$|E
