5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes <b>B-cell</b> and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism.

Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the <b>B-cell</b> to function.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} CD 5 + and CD 5 - <b>B-cells</b> in production of rheumatoid factors (RF) was evaluated in polyclonally activated <b>B-cells</b> from patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Graves' disease (GD). In IgAN and RA, diseases in which RFs {{are believed to}} be involved in pathogenesis, there were 10 - and 4 -fold decreases respectively in CD 5 + IgG-RF-secreting <b>B-cells</b> compared with controls. Furthermore, the number of CD 5 - IgG-RF- and IgA-RF-secreting <b>B-cells</b> were increased 12 - and 14 -fold in IgAN and 9 - and 4 -fold in RA. Such abnormalities were not apparent in GD, in which RFs have not been implicated in pathogenesis. These findings are compatible with the concept of CD 5 + RF-secreting <b>B-cells</b> normally acting to prevent production of potentially pathogenic RFs by CD 5 - <b>B-cells.</b> When IgAN or RA patients' <b>B-cells</b> were activated in the presence of control instead of autologous CD 4 + cells, numbers of RF- secreting CD 5 - <b>B-cells</b> were reduced to the levels seen with control <b>B-cells</b> plus control T-helper cells. Presumably lymphokine secretion profiles of T-helper cells would be important in determining whether CD 5 + or CD 5 - <b>B-cells</b> are activated to secrete RFs, and perhaps therapeutic manipulation of these profiles could restore normal activity of CD 5 + <b>B-cells</b> in IgAN and RA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>B-cells</b> {{have been}} long {{accepted}} {{as the main}} cellular component in humoral responses. Their effector function is based on antibody and cytokine production. The development of donor-specific antibodies by <b>B-cells</b> has deleterious consequences in graft and patients survival. Recently, a new subset of IL- 10 -secreting <b>B-cells</b> with regulatory capacity in allergic and autoimmune diseases has been shown. Such regulatory function changes the apprehension of <b>B-cells</b> as effector cells and increases the complexity to the immuno-regulatory networks. New therapies targeting <b>B-cells</b> should consider that depleting <b>B-cells</b> potentially impairs regulatory <b>B-cells</b> (Bregs) and that modulating or favoring the maintenance and function of Bregs would be important for the achievement of humoral tolerance.

5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells.

Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} <b>B-cell</b> receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we address the {{important}} {{issue of whether}} <b>B-cells</b> protected from irradiation-induced cell death, may survive with elevated levels of DNA damage. If so, such cells would be at higher risk of gaining mutations and undergoing malignant transformation. We show that stimulation of <b>B-cells</b> with the TLR 9 ligands CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) prevents spontaneous and irradiation-induced death of normal peripheral blood <b>B-cells,</b> and of <b>B-cells</b> from patients diagnosed with Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The TLR 9 -mediated survival is enhanced by the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA). Importantly, neither stimulation of <b>B-cells</b> via TLR 9 alone or with RA increases irradiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA damage responses such as activation of ATM and DNA-PKcs. We prove that elevated levels of γH 2 AX imposed by irradiation of stimulated <b>B-cells</b> is not due to induction of DNA double strand breaks, but merely reflects increased levels of total H 2 AX upon stimulation. Interestingly however, we unexpectedly find that TLR 9 stimulation of <b>B-cells</b> induces low amounts of inactive p 53, explained by transcriptional induction of TP 53. Taken together, we show that enhanced survival of irradiated <b>B-cells</b> is not accompanied by elevated levels of DNA damage. Our results imply that TLR 9 -mediated activation of <b>B-cells</b> not only promotes cell survival, but may via p 53 provide cells with a barrier against harmful consequences of enhanced activation and proliferation. As CVID-derived <b>B-cells</b> are more radiosensitive and prone to undergo apoptosis than normal <b>B-cells,</b> our data support treatment of CVID patients with CpG-ODN and RA...|$|R
40|$|Key {{transcription}} factors {{control the}} gene expression program in mature pancreatic <b>b-cells,</b> but their integration into regulatory networks is little understood. Here, {{we show that}} Insm 1, Neurod 1 and Foxa 2 directly interact and together bind regula-tory sequences in the genome of mature pancreatic <b>b-cells.</b> We used Insm 1 ablation in mature <b>b-cells</b> in mice and found pronounced deficits in insulin secretion and gene expression. Insm 1 -dependent genes identified previously in developing <b>b-cells</b> markedly differ from the ones identified in the adult. In particu-lar, adult mutant <b>b-cells</b> resemble immature <b>b-cells</b> of newborn mice in gene expression and functional properties. We defined Insm 1, Neurod 1 and Foxa 2 binding sites associated with genes deregulated in Insm 1 mutant <b>b-cells.</b> Remarkably, combinatorial binding of Insm 1, Neurod 1 and Foxa 2 but not binding of Insm 1 alone explained a significant fraction of gene expression changes. Human genomic sequences corresponding to the murine sites occupied by Insm 1 /Neurod 1 /Foxa 2 were enriched in single nucleo-tide polymorphisms associated with glycolytic traits. Thus, our data explain part of the mechanisms by which <b>b-cells</b> maintain maturity: Combinatorial Insm 1 /Neurod 1 /Foxa 2 binding identifies regulatory sequences that maintain the mature gene expression program in <b>b-cells,</b> and disruption of this network results in functional failure...|$|R

40|$|<b>B-cells,</b> in {{addition}} to antibody secretion, have emerged increasingly as effector and immunoregulatory cells in several chronic inflammatory diseases. Although Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory complication of leprosy, the role of B- cell subsets has never been studied in this patient group. Therefore, {{it would be interesting}} to examine the contribution of <b>B-cells</b> in the pathogenesis of ENL. A case-control study design was used to recruit 30 untreated patients with ENL and 30 non-reactional lepromatous leprosy (LL) patient controls at ALERT Hospital, Ethiopia. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before, during and after treatment from each patient. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and used for immunophenotyping of B- cell subsets by flow cytometry. The kinetics of <b>B-cells</b> in patients with ENL before, during and after Prednisolone treatment of ENL was compared with LL patient controls as well as within ENL group. Total <b>B-cells,</b> mature <b>B-cells</b> and resting memory <b>B-cells</b> were not significantly different between patients with ENL reactions and LL controls before treatment. Interestingly, while the percentage of naive <b>B-cells</b> was significantly lower in untreated ENL patients than in LL patient controls, the percentage of activated memory <b>B-cells</b> was significantly higher in these untreated ENL patients than in LL controls. On the other hand, the percentage of tissue-like memory <b>B-cells</b> was considerably low in untreated ENL patients compared to LL controls. It appears that the lower frequency of tissue-like memory <b>B-cells</b> in untreated ENL could promote the B-cell/T-cell interaction in these patients through downregulation of inhibitory molecules unlike in LL patients. Conversely, the increased production of activated memory <b>B-cells</b> in ENL patients could imply the scale up of immune activation through antigen presentation to T-cells. However, the generation and differential function of these memory <b>B-cells</b> need further investigation. The finding of increased percentage of activated memory <b>B-cells</b> in untreated patients with ENL reactions suggests the association of these cells with the ENL pathology. The mechanism by which inflammatory reactions like ENL affecting these memory cells and contributing to the disease pathology is an interesting area to be explored for and could lead to the development of novel and highly efficacious drug for ENL treatment...|$|R

40|$|Wiskott–Aldrich {{syndrome}} (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency/platelet disease due to mutations of WASP, a cytoskeletal {{regulatory protein}} of blood cells.

Here we show a deficit of total <b>B-cells</b> in WAS patients of various ages and identify phenotypic perturbations involving complement receptors and CD 27. Whereas <b>B-cells</b> of normal healthy donors are overwhelmingly CD 21 /CD 35 -positive, <b>B-cells</b> expressing these receptors are significantly reduced in number in WAS patients, and their paucity may cause suboptimal antigen capture and presentation. The frequencies of IgD– and IgG+ patient <b>B-cells</b> were not different from healthy donors (although absolute numbers were decreased), indicating that isotype switching is occurring. In contrast, the frequency of cells positive for CD 27, the marker of post germinal centre <b>B-cells,</b> was significantly decreased even among isotype-switched cells, and <b>B-cells</b> resembling germinal centre progenitors (CD 10 +CD 27 –CD 38 bright) were more frequent in adult patients, suggesting impaired germinal centre maturation/differentiation.

For this reason we studied here by immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis whether FcRL 4 expressing <b>B-cells</b> are present in salivary gland tissue (labial and parotid) of pSS patients (n = 54) and non-pSS sicca patients (n = 16) and whether parotid gland MALT lymphomas in pSS patients (n = 49) also express this receptor. We also studied the effect of treatment (rituximab and abatacept) on the presence of FcRL 4 (+) <b>B-cells,</b> and whether numbers in labial gland biopsies at time of diagnosis of pSS can predict whether patients are at risk for MALT lymphoma development. We demonstrate that FcRL 4 (+) cells are present in salivary gland tissue of pSS patients where they are closely associated with ductal epithelial cells forming lymphoepithelial lesions. The glandular FcRL 4 (+) cells are highly proliferative, genuine PAX 5 (+) <b>B-cells.</b> These FcRL 4 (+) <b>B-cells</b> are far more frequent in parotid gland than in labial gland tissue (p = 0. 003). We further show that expression of FcRL 4 is present in pSS-related parotid MALT lymphomas. The FcRL 4 mRNA expression level in parotid MALT lymphoma is increased compared to parotid gland tissue of pSS patients without lymphoma (p = 0. 017). However, numbers of FcRL 4 (+) <b>B-cells</b> in labial gland biopsies taken at the time of pSS diagnosis, are not predictive for later development of MALT lymphoma.
