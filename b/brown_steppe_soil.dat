40|$|International audienceSoil {{alkalinisation}} generally {{constitutes a}} major threat to irrigated agriculture in the semi-arid regions of West Africa. The improvement of sodic soils is generally difficult and expensive. However, a recent study in the Niger valley in NIGER, reveals that a natural de-alkalinisation is possible under natural conditions in a semi-arid climate. Transformation of non-saline sodic soil into <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> type was recorded. On the same site, the cultivation of a Sahelian fodder grass, locally known as “Burgu” was used on the sodic soil/brown steppe soil transition zone to accelerate this natural de-alkalinisation and characterise its mechanisms. The geochemical properties of both soil types were monitored before cultivation and one year after continuous crop cultivation. After cultivation and regular irrigation, the chemical properties of the former sodic soils were close to those of the surrounding brown steppe soils, which are better suited for agriculture. This modification of the sodic soil properties can be attributed to (i) the large amount of water supplied during cultivation that induced salt leaching. This is the main phenomenon responsible for the changes observed; (ii) the root activity that modified the acid-base equilibrium and consumes alkalinity. The Residual Alkalinity (RA) concept was used to select chemical tracers of the concentration/dilution of the soil solution. Here, sodium amount and calcite + fluorite residual alkalinity (RAcalcite+fluorite) were the most adequate ones. These two tracers decreased proportionally under the influence of leaching, but the exchanges between cations and protons changed the RAcalcite+fluorite, without modifying the sodium amount. Their combined use allowed us to separate and quantify the uptake of the plant from the leaching in the de-alkalinisation process. This study highlighted that reclamation of this type of sodic soils is feasible. The use of the RA concept is advisable to design a sustainable management system for irrigated sodic or saline soils...|$|E

In the NE-part there are numerous occurrences of <b>steppe</b> <b>soils.</b> There are two reasons for these soil types: calcareous loess (the parent material), and specific climatic conditions, like temperature and rainfall. The consequence is a twice-yearly interruption of soil development (the summer drought and the winter freezing) which results in inhibited weathering without a B horizon.

40|$|Since Dokuchaev's {{investigations}} of Russian Chernozems, Central European Chernozems were established as <b>steppe</b> <b>soils,</b> with their pedogenesis dominated by humus accumulation {{as a result}} of dry continental climate and steppe vegetation, with carbonaceous parent material and bioturbation as other prerequisites. The WRB-FAO classification defined Chernozems by their morphological characteristics, but was biased by the climo-genetic formation model. However, the assumption that modern Central European Chernozems are relics of <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> conflicts with palaeobotanical evidence from an early reforestation that started in the Late Glacial, and also with pedological studies that dated Chernozem formation to the Early Holocene. In this review we compile the most important literature on pedogenesis of Central European Chernozems since the 1920 s, according to the soil forming factors climate, time, vegetation, relief and man. Our review demonstrates that there is no consensus on the factors controlling the formation, conservation and degradation of Central European Chernozems in published literature. We found that (1) no absolute time of formation could be stated so far, and that (2) Central European Chernozems formed not only under steppe but also under forest vegetation; (3) the spatial distribution of Chernozems and Phaeozems did not correlate with climate conditions or topographic position, and (4) until now no other factors were considered to be responsible for Chernozem development. Recent studies showed that these unknown factors could include anthropogenic activity and vegetation burning as they could form black soils or strongly affect the composition of soil organic matter.

As a result, the Chernozems lost about 40 % of their initial amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). The {{aim of this}} study was to remediate degraded arable soils and promote carbon sequestration by implementation of cover cropping and green manuring in Moldova. Thereby, the suitability of the legume hairy vetch (Vicia sativa) as cover crop under the dry continental climate of Moldova was examined. At two experimental sites, the effect of cover cropping on chemical and physical soil properties as well as on yields of subsequent main crops was determined. The results showed a significant increase of SOC after incorporation of hairy vetch mainly due to increases of aggregate-occluded and mineral-associated OC. This was related to a high above- and belowground biomass production of hairy vetch associated with a high input of carbon and nitrogen into arable soils. A calculation of SOC stocks based on equivalent soil masses revealed a sequestration of around 3 t C ha − 1 yr − 1 as a result of hairy vetch cover cropping. The buildup of SOC was associated with an improvement of the soil structure as indicated by a distinct decrease of bulk density and a relative increase of macroaggregates at the expense of microaggregates and clods. As a result, yields of subsequent main crops increased by around 20 %.

40|$|Degradation of steppes {{induced by}} {{overgrazing}} {{may affect the}} uptake of atmospheric methane (CH 4) by soil sinks.

In this study, we investigated the effects of grazing on CH 4 uptake during the growing season in three types of steppe (meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe and) in Inner Mongolia, China, to quantify and compare CH 4 uptake in steppe ecosystems under different grazing management conditions. The CH 4 fluxes were measured using an automatic cavity ring-down spectrophotometer at three steppe locations that differed primarily in grazing intensity. The results indicated that <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> were CH 4 sinks throughout the growing season. CH 4 uptake at all sites averaged 7. 98 kg CH 4 -C ha− 1 yr− 1 (ranging from 1. 53 to 18. 74 kg CH 4 -C ha− 1 yr− 1), of which approximately 43. 8 % occurred in the desert steppe. CH 4 uptake in the desert steppe increased 20. 4 % and 51. 2 % compared with the typical steppe and meadow steppe, respectively. Light grazing (LG) of steppe did not significantly change CH 4 uptake compared with un-grazed (UG) steppe, but moderate and heavy grazing (MG, HG) reduced CH 4 uptake significantly (by 6. 8 – 37. 9 %, P < 0. 05). These findings imply that reducing the grazing pressure on steppe would help increase the atmospheric CH 4 sinks in <b>steppe</b> <b>soils.</b> Our results suggest that HG exerts a considerable negative impact on CH 4 uptake in a continental steppe.

Parent material is Precambrian metamorphic bedrock, vegetation a mosaic of (semi) deciduous forest and savanna (cerrado type). The climate is tropical with 4 to 5 dry months in the winter. With direct calculation of CEC per kg clay (both: pH 7 and effective), attributing the CEC completely to the clay fraction, the following soil groups were keyed out: 8 Ferralsols, 6 Phaeozems, 1 Acrisol, 2 Lixisols, 2 Umbrisols, and 1 Regosol. It is astonishing to have Phaeozems. In our handbooks they are described as <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> making excellent farmland. On the contrary, in the study area, the forest Phaeozems are medium-fertile and used for shifting cultivation, and the savanna Phaeozems are not suitable for agriculture at all. Using regression analysis to split up the contributions of organic matter and clay to the CEC leads to a modified classification: 2 savanna Phaeozems and the 2 Lixisols shift to the Ferralsols. With that method many more horizons have low-activity clays. To avoid some major difficulties, which may occur with regression analysis, we used the direct calculation to detect the CEC per kg clay. Anyway, the WRB key has to state clearly the required calculation method. For the Phaeozems we suggest introducing a ferralic qualifier. Ferralic Phaeozems would intergrade to the already existing Mollic Ferralsols. We also suggest modifying the handbooks to emphasis the fact that Phaeozems are not always <b>steppe</b> <b>soils,</b> but may also occur in tropical forest and savanna, where they usually have low-activity clays and may be rather infertile...|$|R

To quantify the proportion of macro-aggregate-protected OC under different land use as function of land use intensity and time since land use change (LUC) from pasture to arable land in Siberian <b>steppe</b> <b>soils,</b> we determined OC mineralization rates of intact (250 – 2000  µm) and crushed (<  250  µm) macro-aggregates in long-term incubations over 401  days (20  °C; 60  % water holding capacity) along two agricultural chronosequences in the Siberian Kulunda steppe. Additionally, we incubated bulk soil (<  2000  µm) to determine the effect of LUC and subsequent agricultural use on a fast and a slow soil OC pool (labile vs. more stable OC), as derived from fitting exponential-decay models to incubation data. We hypothesized that (i)  macro-aggregate crushing leads to increased OC mineralization due to an increasing microbial accessibility of a previously occluded labile macro-aggregate OC fraction, and (ii)  bulk soil OC mineralization rates and the size of the fast OC pool are higher in pasture than in arable soils with decreasing bulk soil OC mineralization rates and size of the fast OC pool as land use intensity and time since LUC increase. Against our hypothesis, OC mineralization rates of crushed macro-aggregates were similar to those of intact macro-aggregates under all land use regimes. Macro-aggregate-protected OC was almost absent and accounted for <  1  % of the total macro-aggregate OC content and to a maximum of 8  ±  4  % of mineralized OC. In accordance to our second hypothesis, highest bulk soil OC mineralization rates and sizes of the fast OC pool were determined under pasture, but mineralization rates and pool sizes were unaffected by land use intensity and time since LUC. However, at one chronosequence mean residence times of the fast and slow OC pool tended to decrease with increasing time since establishment of arable use. We conclude that the tillage-induced breakdown of macro-aggregates has not reduced the OC contents in the soils under study. The decline of OC after LUC is probably attributed to the faster soil OC turnover under arable land as compared to pasture at a reduced plant residue input...|$|R

Since most of the nitrogen accumulated in these hot spots is finally lost through burning of the dried excrements by the farmers for heating and cooking purposes, the ecosystem faces a significant human perturbation of regional N cycling, which may contribute to an accelerated degradation of steppe in the Xilin river regio...|$|R
40|$|While litter {{decomposition}} is {{a fundamental}} ecological process, previous studies have mainly focused on the decay of single species. In this study, we conducted a litter-mixing experiment to investigate litter diversity effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an alpine <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> in Northern Tibet. Significant non-additive effects of litter diversity on GHG dynamics can be detected; these non-additive effects {{were the result of}} species composition rather than species richness. Synergistic effects were frequent for CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, as they were found to occur in 70. 5 % and 47. 1 % of total cases, respectively; antagonistic effects on CH 4 uptake predominated in 60. 3 % of the cases examined. The degree of synergism and antagonism may be significantly impacted by litter chemical traits, such as lignin and N, lignin: N ratio, and total phenols during decomposition (P < 0. 05). In addition, the relationship between chemical traits and litter-mixing effects changed over incubation time. Our study provides an opportunity to gain insight into the relationship between litter diversity and soil ecological processes. The results indicate that higher plant diversity may generally enhance CO 2 and N 2 O emissions while inhibiting CH 4 uptake; meanwhile, the direction and strength of nonadditive effects appear to be related to litter chemical traits...|$|R

40|$|Aims River {{floodplain}} meadow is biologically highly productive, but {{excessive grazing}} has degraded most of it. Our {{objective was to}} analyze changes of vegetation in a Xilin River Basin (Inner Mongolia) wetland meadow to provide information for the restoration and management of degraded wetland. Methods We compared fenced (non-grazed) and grazed sites within the wetland for vegetation and soil characteristics: plant community composition, aboveground biomass, plant height, internode length, leaf length and width of major species, plant community root biomass and distribution, soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil microbial biomass and soil carbon and nitrogen content. Important findings Grazing affects plant dominant species, gradually replacing original wetland plants with more drought-resistant ones. It also significantly reduces the aboveground and belowground biomass. Plants in degraded wetland meadow are smaller, thus resulting in the decline in community productivity; Grazing also causes a decrease in soil moisture. In the low flood plain, soil moisture and root biomass both increase with increasing soil depth; however, in the high flood plain, soil moisture does not change with soil depth and {{is similar to that}} of the typical <b>steppe.</b> <b>Soil</b> bulk density increases as soil is compacted by animal grazing and trampling. In high and low floodplain wetlands, the changes of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen between ungrazed and grazed sites are varied. In low floodplain wetlands, grazed areas have increased microbial biomass, while in high floodplain wetlands, grazed areas have significant less microbial biomass, carbon and nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{stable isotope}} {{analyses}} of worldwide reference curves, {{it has long}} been apparent that duration, intensity and climatic conditions of Pleistocene interglacial periods were significantly diverse. As a consequence of negligible fresh, detrital material admixture during interglacials, the soil formation intensity and maturity of various kinds of past soils have been holding vital information on the environmental conditions at the time the soils formed. This, in turn, means that several physicochemical properties of soils allow us to reconstruct past climatic regimes. Loess-paleosol sequences in Hungary (Central Europe) provide insight into the cyclic nature of glacial-interglacial variations of the last 1 million years. The paleosoils have been recognized as the product of warmer and moister interglacials, when the (glacial) loess material was altered by chemical weathering and pedogenic processes. The gradual change from oldest red Mediterranean soils via forest and forest-steppe <b>soils</b> to <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> represents well the continuous decrease of chemical alteration of interglacial paleosoils determined by environmental factors and duration of soil formation. Pedogene units from MIS- 21 to MIS- 5 strata were analysed {{in the course of this}} study. Major element analyses were carried out to get a proper picture on the paleoenvironmental conditions. Geochemical transfer functions have been applied to derive mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. These kinds of quantitative data on past climate and the stratigraphic data allow us to fit our pedostratigraphic units into a global context. The present paper is aimed at providing new information on the various climatic and environmental characteristics of Pleistocene interglacial periods and soil forming processes...|$|R

The analysis of land degradation in various land-use/cover patterns of Russia's vast forest zone (about 1050 million ha., or 63 % of the country) clearly demonstrates two human-induced problems, inappropriate technology and improper management, causing land degradation on 9 % of the territory. The study illustrates the high vulnerability of forest soils (in comparison to <b>steppe</b> grassland <b>soils)</b> after conversion to intensive cultivation. Thus, a balanced combination of forests and cropland {{has been found to}} be the most sustainable land use in the forest zone. ...|$|R
