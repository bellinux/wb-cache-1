5|$|A new {{government}} center {{was to be}} built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City <b>but</b> <b>several</b> key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.|$|E
5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan studies {{as an academic}} discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious movements in the United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> hundred remained until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E
5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Gešovski's killing, and the Serbian media pointed to the young Macedonian's death as proof that Tuđman's government had revived the fascist Ustaše, which controlled Croatia during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Charles Oman {{proposed}} that Beornred, who in 757 emerged {{for a short}} time as ruler of Mercia before being driven out by Offa, could be the same person as Beonna. An alternative theory suggests that Beonna and Beornred may perhaps have been kinsmen from the same dynasty with ambitions to rule in both Mercia and East Anglia. No known member of the Wuffingas dynasty had a name commencing with B, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> Mercian rulers, including Beornred, used the letter.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> years before puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production {{that lead to}} increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, {{relations}} {{were not always}} friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', {{such as the one}} concluded {{at the end of the}} war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave an indication of their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E

5|$|Having {{just been}} elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E
5|$|Hurd {{was cast}} after having {{appeared}} in other television shows by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf. Although Wolf promised her Jeffries would develop more over time, Hurd grew {{frustrated with the}} lack of material for her character. The show's producers hesitated to keep her as Munch's full-time partner and considered eliminating the character from the show altogether. Hurd eventually departed herself to join the drama television series Leap Years. The actress earned some critical praise for her performance as Jeffries, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> commentators said the character was never properly fleshed out.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the city}} bought the two private systems. Some {{elevated}} lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> connections were built between the IND and BMT; these now operate as one division called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, sharper curves, and stations {{are too small}} and therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. However, many passenger transfers between stations of all three former companies have been created, allowing the entire network {{to be treated as}} a single unit.|$|E

5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} are otherwise known mostly from the Eocene, <b>but</b> <b>several</b> sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E

In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
