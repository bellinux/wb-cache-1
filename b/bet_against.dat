5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office {{to learn of}} deals between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Capital asset {{pricing model}} (CAPM) implies {{positive}} {{relation between the}} beta of a stock and its future returns. However, empirical studies do not support this proposition because low-beta stocks do better and high-beta stocks worse than expected. Moreover, Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) show that a <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta (BAB) factor buying low-beta assets while shorting high-beta assets provides ro-bustly positive returns in the U. S. stock market from 1926 to 2012 {{as well as in}} 20 international stock markets, Treasuries, corporate credits, and futures. There is an ongoing effort to uncover the beta anomaly. In this quest, the behavioral finance approach seems most promising. While market frictions such as benchmarking and leverage constraints probably are important, there is also something about high-beta stocks that makes them attractive for individual investors. My paper takes a conservative approach in studying does the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta exists in the stock market by combining empirical elements that have produced modest results in the previous studies. If the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta is found, data mining etc. seem unlikely explanations. Secondly, I investigate whether high-beta stocks have certain characteristics that make them the most affected by investor sentiment, which measures the collective mood and trust of individual investors. Most importantly, I study does investor sentiment explain the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta phenomenon in the stock market. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: I use stock return data from CRSP between 1984 and 2011 to sort stocks into quintile portfolios based on beta. To find out whether the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta exists in the stock market I study the portfolio returns on both absolute and risk-adjusted basis. Secondly, I use an index of investor sentiment (Baker and Wurgler, 2007) to answer the question does investor sentiment explain the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta. First, I divide the sample period into high and low sen-timent, and secondly, utilize the index as an explanatory variable in multifactor regressions. MAIN FINDINGS: I find that the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta exist in the stock market. Empirical security market line is too flat and Sharpe ratios as well as CAPM alphas decline monotonically in beta. The results are generally robust to traditional multifactor models. Furthermore, investor sentiment influences the performance of the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta. Following high sentiment the returns are monotonically declining in the beta quintiles, and following low sentiment the pattern completely reverses. My results also reveal a "flight-to-quality" phenomenon within stocks. Lastly, the results are robust to controls for market, popular empirical style factors, and alternative measures of sentiment. Additional robustness checks show that investor sentiment influences the <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta also contemporaneously and that the results are not specific to the time period because investor sentiment influences also the BAB-factor returns during a longer time period from 1965 to 2011...|$|R

500|$|... "Damien" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a satire on religion, faith and the nature of good and evil, as well as a commentary on commercialism and the cult of celebrity in American culture. Parker said the writers sought to satirize the speed and ease at which the followers of Jesus lose faith in him and <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> him. Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the abandonment of Jesus demonstrates, [...] "Like many people in the real world, the faith of the town's people cannot withstand the hard times." [...] Parker said, [...] "Everybody puts their trust in Satan and ends up getting screwed. There is a bigger message – all in all, a pretty wholesome message. That's why South Park works. Sometimes we have a message." ...|$|E
500|$|Staff writer Larry Charles {{had written}} a script for an episode {{entitled}} [...] "The Bet". In the episode, which was also known as [...] "The Gun", Elaine would <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> Jerry on the ease of buying a handgun to protect herself. The episode's subplot revolved around Jerry's neighbour Kramer returning from a vacation in Puerto Rico, claiming {{he had sex with}} a stewardess on his flight home. George and Jerry would remain skeptical, and make a bet with him; eventually, George, Jerry and Elaine would go to the airport to check if Kramer was telling the truth. In writing [...] "The Bet", Charles had attempted to make a [...] "funny, dark-themed" [...] episode. Sets for the episode were built. Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key".|$|E
500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E

500|$|... "Lisa the Greek" [...] {{references}} {{both the}} Super Bowl and the National Football League (NFL). The episode aired {{only a few}} days before Super Bowl XXVI, and correctly predicted that the Washington Redskins would win the game. When a repeat of the episode re-aired the following year only days before Super Bowl XXVII, the staff redubbed the episode to mention the Dallas Cowboys instead of the Washington Redskins. The Cowboys won, making the episode accurate once again. It has continued to be accurate in later years when it has been redubbed (the last redubbing came on the week before Super Bowl XXIX to reflect an all-California Super Bowl, with the San Francisco 49ers in place of the Redskins and the San Diego Chargers in place of the Buffalo Bills), and Jean commented that he would always <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> Lisa's predictions, causing him to think [...] "Why didn't I take Lisa's advice?" [...] when he lost. As Lisa studies football at the Springfield library, she goes through the card catalog and finds an entry on Phyllis George, an American sportscaster. The title of the episode is a reference to the American bookie and sports commentator Jimmy [...] "the Greek" [...] Snyder. The Duff Bowl advertisement that airs during the Super Bowl halftime show is a reference to the Bud Bowl advertisements for Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser family of beers.|$|E
2500|$|Reluctance to <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> (hedge) desired outcomes. People are {{reluctant}} to <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> desired outcomes {{that are relevant to}} their identity. Gamblers exhibit reluctance to <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> the success of their preferred U.S. presidential candidates and Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball, and NCAA hockey teams. More than 45% of NCAA fans in Studies 5 and 6, for instance, turned down a [...] "free" [...] real $5 <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> their team. From a psychological perspective, such a [...] "hedge" [...] creates an interdependence dilemma—a motivational conflict between a short-term monetary gain and the long-term benefits accrued from feelings of identification with and loyalty to a position, person, or group whom the bettor desires to succeed. [...] In economic terms, this conflicted decision can be modeled as a trade-off between the outcome utility gained by hedging (e.g., money) and the diagnostic costs it incurs (e.g., disloyalty). People make inferences about their beliefs and identity from their behavior. If a person is uncertain about an aspect of her identity, such as the extent to which she values a candidate or team, hedging may signal to her that she is not as committed to that candidate or team as she originally believed. If the diagnostic cost of this self-signal and the resulting identity change are substantial, it may outweigh the outcome utility of hedging, and she may reject even very generous hedges.|$|E

25|$|Insurance is {{a method}} of {{shifting}} risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, {{which is similar to}} calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, the equivalent in gambling is simply <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|R

Those critical of Rose's behavior, including Ohio's own Hall of Fame baseball reporter, Hal McCoy, have observed that [...] "the major problem with Rose betting on baseball, particularly the Reds, is that as manager he could control games, make decisions that could enhance his chances of winning his bets, thus jeopardizing {{the integrity of the}} game." [...] The Major League Baseball rule that Rose violated prohibits any bet on a game the bettor is involved in, making no distinction between betting for or against one's team. The rule is: [...] "Rule 21 Misconduct, (d) Betting on Ball Games, Any player, umpire, or club, or league official, or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you <b>bet</b> <b>against</b> God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness.

40|$|This paper shows {{theoretically}} and empirically that beta- and volatility-based {{low risk}} anomalies {{are driven by}} return skewness. The empirical patterns con- cisely match the predictions of our model which generates skewness of stock returns via default risk.

Empirically, the profitability of <b>betting</b> <b>against</b> beta/volatility increases with firms' downside risk.
