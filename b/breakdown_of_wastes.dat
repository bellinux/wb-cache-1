This annual routine toxicity testing was scheduled to coincide with testing of NoxTech technology designed to reduce nitrous oxides NOx in plant air emissions. This type of NOx control involves injection of ammonia and natural gas directly into the boilers. Since there is potential for the presence of ammonia in wastewater during operation of the system toxicity testing was conducted during the NoxTech demonstration to show continued compliance with NPDES whole effluent toxicity WET limits. No ammonia was measured in Outfall 002 samples at the time of first use in the toxicity tests. Measurements of ammonia made following the corresponding 24 -h ur exposure periods were within the normal range for controls i. e. no ammonia added observed in previous ammonia related tests conducted by TVA. This presence of ammonia in old samples priorto test renewal is due to natural biological processes involving test organism metabolism and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> and excess food. Chronic testing of fathead minnows and daphnids using Outfall 002 samples collected February 11 - 16 showed no toxicity to test organisms. IC 25 values for both species were 100 percent effluent. Exposure of test organisms to intake samples resulted in no significant reductions in fathead minnow survival although variability of survival among replicates was very high ranging from 40 percent to 100 percent among the four replicates. Growth was significantly reduced from controls based on Homoscedastic t-Tests. Daphnids demonstrated no significant differences from control for survival or reproduction when exposed to intake samples. Fathead minnows were also exposed to UV treated Outfall 002 and intake samples since fish pathogens present in intake water have been the suspected cause of interference anomalous dose response and high variability among replicates as demonstrated by untreated intake samples in this test in previous WET testing at Kingston. Outfall 002 and intake samples treated by two minutes exposure to UV light prior to introduction of test organisms produced no significant reductions i...|$|E

40|$|A great {{challenge}} in wastewater bioremediation is the sustained activity of viable microorganisms, which {{can contribute to}} the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> contaminants, especially in alkaline pH conditions. Identification of extremophiles with bioremediation capability can improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment. Here, we report the discovery of an electrochemically active alkaliphilic halotolerant bacterium, Anditalea andensis ANESC-ST (=CICC 10485 T=NCCB 100412 T), which is capable of generating bioelectricity in alkaline-saline conditions. A. andensis ANESC-ST was shown to grow in alkaline conditions between pH 7. 0 - 11. 0 and also under high salt condition (up to 4 wt% NaCl). Electrical output was further demonstrated in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with an average current density of ~ 0. 5 µA/cm 2, even under the harsh condition of 4 wt% NaCl and pH 9. 0. Subsequent introduction of secreted extracellular metabolites into MFCs inoculated with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded enhanced electrical output. The ability of A. andensis ANESC-ST to generate energy under alkaline-saline conditions points towards a solution for bioelectricity recovery from alkaline-saline wastewater.

40|$|Abstract- Currently, much <b>of</b> our {{biodegradable}} <b>wastes</b> such as kitchen wastes, {{agricultural wastes}} & animal wastes {{are used to}} produce Biogas, a powerful greenhouse gas. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a treatment that composts these wastes {{in the absence of}} oxygen, producing a biogas {{that can be used to}} generate Heat & Power. Producing renewable energy from our biodegradable wastes helps to tackle the energy crisis. It is effectively a controlled and enclosed version <b>of</b> the anaerobic <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>wastes</b> which releases methane. AD produces a biogas made up of around 60 per cent methane and 40 per cent carbon dioxide (CO). As well as biogas, AD produces a solid and liquid residue called digestate which can be used as a soil conditioner to fertilise land. The amount of biogas and the quality of digestates obtained will vary according to the feedstock used. More gas will be produced if the feedstock is more liable to decompose.

A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters (air-tight tanks with different configurations). These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the microorganisms transform biomass waste into biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and digestate. The biogas is a renewable energy {{that can be used}} for heating, electricity, and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine, such as GE Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines. Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat.

These so-called “tubular” and “granular” microtextures are widely interpreted to represent bona fide microbial trace fossils; however, possible nonbiological origins for these complex alteration microtextures have yet to be explored. Here, we reevaluate the origin of these enigmatic microtextures from a strictly nonbiological standpoint, using a case study on submarine glasses from the western North Atlantic Ocean (DSDP 418 A). By combining petrographic and SEM observations of corrosion microtextures at the glass-palagonite interface, considerations of the tectonic setting, measurement of U and Th concentrations of fresh basaltic glass by ICP-MS, and theoretical modelling of the present-day distribution of radiation damage in basaltic glass caused by radioactive decay of U and Th, we reinterpret these enigmatic microtextures as the end product of the preferential corrosion/dissolution of radiation damage (alpha-recoil tracks and fission tracks) in the glass by seawater, possibly combined with pressure solution etch-tunnelling.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{landfilling}} <b>of</b> Municipal Solid <b>Waste</b> poses {{a threat}} to the environment in the form of landfill emissions. These emissions are a result <b>of</b> the biochemical <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> in the anaerobic landfill environment. A solution to this problem has been found {{in the form of the}} mechanical-biological treatment <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> This technology involves mechanical and biological processing <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> before it is placed in the landfill. The pretreatment accelerates the degradation <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> resulting in the landfilling of a more biologically stable product, resulting in a reduction of the emission potential of the landfill. This research aims at investigating the applicability and efficiency of a passively ventilated MBT windrow system under a sub-tropical climate. The research was conducted in two stages: the first stage focused on the implementation and analysis of the Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) process with aerobic windrows, employing the Dome Aeration Technology (OAT) (Mollekopf et al. 2002). Three OAT windrows were constructed at the Bisasar Road Landfill in Durban in order to study the efficiency of the process after different composting timeframes (8 and 20 weeks). The study proved that the use of the OAT technology is a viable option. The second stage was the analysis <b>of</b> this treated <b>waste</b> in an anaerobic environment, in order to simulate landfill conditions and, thus gain insight into the effect of MBP on landfill emissions. Six Iysimeters and 5 columns as well as numerous eluate tests were conducted in order to study the "post-Iandfilled" behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> and the effect that waste treatment, composting time and screening have on liquid and gaseous emissions. A basic cost estimate using the Clean Development Mechanism for financial assistance was conducted. The results of this research were then utilised to make recommendations on sustainable waste disposal options. The findings of the research were that although the MBT did not reduce emission levels sufficiently to allow for a 40 year landfill aftercare period, the benefit over the landfilling <b>of</b> untreated <b>waste</b> is significant...|$|R

Anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic substrates provides both a sustainable source of energy and a digestate with the potential to enhance plant growth and soil health.

There were 4 different treatments: composting pile without bacteria (T 0), composting pile with inoculation of amylase and protease producing bacteria (T 1), composting with inoculation of lipase and cellulase producing bacteria (T 2), and composting with inoculation all enzyme-producing bacteria (T 3). The result of biodegradation process of T 3 treatment reached the highest temperature (53 ° C) with the longest thermophilic phase compared to other treatments. The lower value of C/N ratio, the more stable the level of maturity of compost. The lowest of C/N ratio value was T 3 (10 %). T 3 treatment compared with other treatments can increase as much as 27 % content of nitrogen, 67 % of phosphorus and 33 % of potassium. All the treatments with bacterial inoculation (T 1, T 2, and T 3) are able to reduce the content of heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Cu) on municipal solid waste biodegradation. It can be concluded that the inoculation of potential enzyme-producing of bacteria on municipal solid waste biodegradation is effective to increase the nutrient content and decrease the heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|As a resource, {{waste is}} abundantly {{available}} but largely underexploited in South Africa. Through waste to energy transformation, waste {{offers a variety}} of benefits that could address socio-economic and environmental challenges such as energy poverty, decreasing landfill space and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As South Africa becomes more urbanised, the urban population will rapidly increase and greater effort will be required to manage waste and provide energy services. Municipalities have the potential to deal with these challenges and realise many benefits by transforming and valorising waste through waste-to-energy (WtE) schemes. The most prevalent WtE technologies include biological (biochemical conversion) and thermal (thermo-chemical) based conversion technologies. Biological technologies mainly employ anaerobic digestion (AD) <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> to produce biogas which can be used directly or upgraded to other secondary energy carriers. Landfill gas recovery is also based on anaerobic <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in landfills. Thermal treatment methods that produce heat and electricity include combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis. The most common form of WtE conversion technology is combustion or incineration <b>of</b> solid <b>waste.</b> In the developing world, AD is the most common technology especially for small scale and domestic applications. WtE technologies have been successfully deployed in many developed as well as some developing countries but there are limited initiatives in South Africa due to a number of barriers to the deployment of the technology. This study explored the barriers to wide scale deployment of WtE technologies in South Africa with a specific focus on adoption challenges faced by local municipalities specifically in the Western Cape Province. Four objectives were identified, namely: (1) investigate existing waste management methods, challenges experienced and current (proposed) interventions; (2) investigate local municipalities' efforts to implementing WtE schemes and the challenges encountered; (3) estimate the amount of energy that can be produced by local municipalities from waste {{and the extent to which}} the energy gap could be narrowed and; (4) identify the most appropriate WtE technology that local municipalities could implement. The research methodology comprised of a mixed methods approach which encompassed both qualitative and quantitative approaches, based on an exploratory design. A sample of five municipalities was identified and participated, from a population of 24 municipalities in the Western Cape Province. The criteria used to select the municipalities include (1) experiences, plans and efforts to adopt WtE (2) socio-demographic trends such as population growth and urbanisation rates as well as (3) proximity and ease of collecting data physically. Some challenges that were experienced relate to limited availability and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> generation data and waste compositions, limited availability of municipal documents (such as feasibility studies and policy documents) and the inability of participants to answer all the relevant questions. The latter was mainly due to the different stages of WtE implementation in the different municipalities. Through the analysis, it was noted that socio-demographic trends such as population growth and in-migration increased between the 2001 and 2011 period, which also indicated an increase in the waste generated. Although local municipalities were implementing waste initiatives such as recycling and composting, none had physically implemented any WtE schemes. However, the municipalities were exploring the technologies and were at different stages, mainly at the feasibility stage. The challenges deterring municipalities from adopting WtE include: 1. Unsuitable waste feedstock for energy generation and poor data on waste generation and composition for investment decision making, 2. Restrictions on independent power producers (IPPs) of electricity to directly supply power to municipalities as well as timeous wheeling agreements (the monopoly of Eskom) 3. Poor synchronisation of policies (energy and waste policies do not provide a solid platform for establishing WtE industries), 4. Poor integration <b>of</b> WtE into <b>waste</b> management planning, 5. Limited knowledge of technologies by decision makers and lack of political will; 6. Low landfill tariffs, 7. Limited access to capital to invest in technologies and high investment costs depending on the type of technology, 8. Lack of skills to implement technologies, 9. Limited awareness of the technologies and their benefits and opposition from the public for various reasons including emissions of hazardous gases, and 10. Delays in processing environmental and legal applications...|$|R

40|$|Some {{organic acids}} of low {{molecular}} weight, generated through <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> giant <b>wastes</b> or root exudation, increase the solubilization of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) through complexation reactions and {{may affect the}} distribution of their chemical forms in soil. By using natural soil and soil spiked with Cd or Cu, the effect of acetate, citrate, and lactate incorporation on the solubilization of these metals {{and the distribution of}} their chemical forms was assessed. To this end, four concentration levels of organic acids were incorporated to soil: 0, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 6 mM at constant ionic strength in 0. 02 M potassium chloride (KCI) at pH 5. 5 at a soil to solution ratio of 1 : 20. After 24 h equilibrium, the supernatant was separated and used to determine the concentration of organic acid not retained by soil through the technique of Zone Capillary Electrophoresis and the metal concentration through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The residue was fractionated to determine Cd and Cu chemical forms through a sequential extraction method of five steps. Results showed that acetate and lactate retention is higher in non-sterilized soils which would indicate that anion retention would partly correspond to consumption by microorganisms rather than to anion adsorption by soil particles. It was also found that a higher metal content has a negative effect on acetate retention. The presence of lactate and citrate increases the solubility of both metals, and treatment with these acids in some cases affect the distribution of their chemical forms. Acetate incorporation increased the amount of Cu associated to organic matter, and the presence of citrate affected the fractions of exchangeable Cu, carbonate, and associated to manganese oxides. The fraction of both metals associated to iron oxides was the least affected by the incorporation of organic acid anions...|$|R
