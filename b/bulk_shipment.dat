40|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} (VCM) is unloaded from railroad tank cars or tank trucks into pressurized storage spheres. VCM, emulsifiers, and catalysts are metered into polymerization vessels wherein PVC {{is produced}} through a chemical reaction {{in an aqueous}} medium under controlled conditions of temperature and pressure. After the reaction reaches a predetermined completion, the contents are transferred to a secondary vessel wherein steam is injected and the VCM containing vapors are pumped to a recovery system. The VCM-containing vapors are compressed, cooled, condensed, decanted, and recycled to the process for reuse. The stripped PVC resin water slurry is then pumped to blending tanks where the batches from multiple reaction vessels are blended for product uniformity. From the plant tanks the PVC resin water slurry is pumped to a dewatering centrifuge, where approximately 90 % of the water is removed and subsequently discharged to the industrial sewer system. The PVC resin wet cake is conveyed from the centrifuge to a flash dryer where essentially all the remaining water is removed. At this point, the dry resin is buoyant in an air stream and enters a two-stage collection system for separation of conveying air.

40|$|Purpose – In {{transportation}} and distribution systems, the shipment decisions, fleet capacity, and storage capacity are interrelated {{in a complex}} way, especially when the authors take into account uncertainty of the demand rate and shipment lead time. While shipment planning is tactical or operational in nature, increasing storage capacity often requires top management’s authority. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a new method to integrate both operational and strategic decision parameters, namely shipment planning and storage capacity decision under uncertainty. The ultimate goal is to provide a near optimal solution that leads to a striking balance between the total logistics costs and product availability, critical in maritime logistics of <b>bulk</b> <b>shipment</b> of commodity items. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use simulation as research method. The authors develop a simulation model to investigate the effects of various factors on costs and service levels of a distribution system. The model mimics the {{transportation and}} distribution problems of bulk cement in a major cement company in Indonesia consisting of a silo at the port of origin, two silos at two ports of destination, and a number of ships that transport the bulk cement. The authors develop a number of “what-if” scenarios by varying the storage capacity at the port of origin as well as at the ports of destinations, number of ships operated, operating hours of ports, and dispatching rules for the ships. Each scenario is evaluated in terms of costs and service level. A full factorial experiment has been conducted and analysis of variance has been used to analyze the results. Findings – The results suggest that the number of ships deployed, silo capacity, working hours of ports, and the dispatching rules of ships significantly affect both total costs and service level. Interestingly, operating fewer ships enables the company to achieve almost the same service level and gaining substantial cost savings if constraints in other part of the system are alleviated, i. e., storage capacities and working hours of ports are extended. Practical implications – Cost is a competitive factor for bulk items like cement, and thus the proposed scenarios could be implemented by the company to substantially reduce the transportation and distribution costs. Alleviating storage capacity constraint is obviously an idea that needs to be considered when optimizing shipment planning alone could not give significant improvements. Originality/value – Existing research has so far focussed on the optimization of shipment planning/scheduling, and considers shipment planning/scheduling as the objective function while treating the storage capacity as constraints. The simulation model enables “what-if” analyses to be performed and has overcome the difficulties and impracticalities of analytical methods especially when the system incorporates stochastic variables exhibited in the case example. The use of efficient frontier analysis for analyzing the simulation results is a novel idea which has been proven to be effective in screening non-dominated solutions. This has provided the authors with near optimal solutions to trade-off logistics costs and service levels (availability), with minimal experimentation times...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{original}} {{findings of the}} Swedish Nobel laureate Arrhenius in 1896 linking {{the temperature of the}} Earth to the gaseous composition of our atmosphere we have come a long way. However, one of the most startling observations is the increasing mean carbon dioxide concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Recordings from 1960 to the present show a total increase of almost 80 ppm CO 2 to the present value of 392 in July 2011. Even without the implications on climate change, the simple fact that anthropogenic contributions of CO 2 are obligation enough to seek solutions to solve the issue at hand. However the sequestration of CO 2 is a multi-dimensional problem with no simple solution to be offered. It is likely dependent on the individual nation, the most accessible storage site both logistically and economically will be a driving factor in the decision making process. It is with this that attention is placed on the preliminary suggestion by Marchetti in 1977, who thought of sequestering CO 2 in the path of ocean currents where natural processes would disperse it further, thus mitigating the problem. Ever since then, the concept of ocean storage of CO 2 has received mixed views. Although many are currently championing the concept of geological storage, the authors believe that ocean storage, though risky, should be considered nonetheless as a viable alternative. Case in point is China with its extended coastline and relatively close access to open sea as well as deep basins makes it a prime choice. China?s continued dependence on fossil fuels for power generation and startling economic growth are additional incentive for the authors to put forward views on CCS in its current state of development. This report serves to outline some high level views in the form of possible future guidelines for a complete solution of the CCS value chain. The report is organised into eight chapters that meticulously address different elements of a CCS system. Chapter One introduces the implications of climate change as well as the project design. System characterisation is addressed in Chapter Two and Three where an effort to give a broad overview of the project, inclusive of public concerns, is made. The authors propose a complete solution that encompasses the capture of carbon dioxide (CO 2) effluents. Chapter Four focuses on the arrangements for transporting carbon dioxide via pipelines and liquid <b>bulk</b> <b>shipment</b> of CO 2 to offshore platforms. Potential risks were identified and mitigation measures were proposed in Chapter Five. Sequestration in ocean space, proposed dilution rate as well as perceived effects associated with ocean acidification form the main argument in Chapter Six with specific application to China. The proposed solution allows for a measure of flexibility to the readers and the authors deem such an approach being necessary as CCS implementation is still in its infancy. With the capture of CO 2 from coal-fired power plants by means of traditional and emerging technologies, both retrofitting of existing plants or the continued use of coal in more efficient greener plants can be considered. The choice of ocean space for sequestration purposes was primarily based on the desire to stimulate further study as there are little known effects of CO 2 at great ocean depths. By addressing this topic the authors also accede {{to the fact that there}} are challenges and risks (Chapter Seven and Eight) to this storage solution that deserved further examination. As a result, public engagement strategies that are essential in getting the public interested about CCS should be actively supported. Lastly, CCS solutions in the long run should endeavor to achieve a zero carbon footprint while accommodating the steady strong development of the Chinese economy...|$|E

Industrial automation has reduced the need for direct worker contact during many of the operations. Product transfer is generally automated at converter sites. During bulk deliveries, the product is pumped directly from delivery truck into a bulk storage tank; when delivered in totes, the product is usually directly pumped from the tote (which is used as storage) or discharged into a small storage tank with the tote being returned to the supplier for cleaning and re-use. Addition of the stabilisers to PVC is automated, which reduces direct human contact with the tin stabiliser. 1 Larger facilities enable the more frequent use of <b>bulk</b> <b>shipments.</b> In high volume applications like pipe and siding, bulk deliveries account for about 25 % of total shipments to those applications in the US, while tote shipments (reusable 1 ton containers) account {{for the majority of the}} remainder.
