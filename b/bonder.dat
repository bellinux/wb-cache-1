6000|$|Olaf {{perceived}} {{it would}} still be some time before the <b>Bonder</b> army was in rank. His own Dag of Sweden, too, was not yet come up; he was to have the right banner; King Olaf's own being the middle or grand one; some other person the third or left banner. All which being perfectly ranked and settled, according to the best rules, and waiting only the arrival of Dag, Olaf bade his men sit down, and freshen themselves with a little rest. There were religious services gone through: a matins-worship such as there have been few; sternly earnest to the heart of it, and deep as death and eternity, at least on Olaf's own part. For the rest Thormod sang a stave of the fiercest Skaldic poetry that was in him; all the army straightway sang it in chorus with fiery mind. The <b>Bonder</b> of the nearest farm came up, to tell Olaf that he also wished to fight for him [...] "Thanks to thee; but don't," [...] said Olaf; [...] "stay at home rather, that the wounded may have some shelter." [...] To this <b>Bonder,</b> Olaf delivered all the money he had, with solemn order to lay out the whole of it in masses and prayers for the souls of such of his enemies as fell. [...] "Such of thy enemies, King?" [...] "Yes, surely," [...] said Olaf, [...] "my friends will all either conquer, or go whither I also am going." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now {{just about}} the time when Tryggveson, spy, and party had landed in Norway, and were {{advancing}} upon Lade, with what support from the public could be got, dissolute old Hakon Jarl had heard of one Gudrun, a Bonder's wife, unparalleled in beauty, who was called in those parts, [...] "Sunbeam of the Grove" [...] (so inexpressibly lovely); and sent off a couple of thralls to bring her to him. [...] "Never," [...] answered Gudrun; [...] "never," [...] her indignant husband; in a tone dangerous and displeasing to these Court thralls; who had to leave rapidly, but threatened to return in better strength before long. Whereupon, instantly, the indignant <b>Bonder</b> and his Sunbeam of the Grove sent out their war-arrow, rousing all the country into angry promptitude, and more than one perhaps into greedy hope of revenge for their own injuries.

In short, How he fared along, beset by difficulties and the mournfulest thoughts; but patiently persisted, steadfastly trusted in God; and was fixed to return, and by God's help try again.

6000|$|At {{last the}} <b>Bonder</b> army too was got ranked; three commanders, {{one of them}} {{with a kind of}} loose chief command, having settled to take charge of it; and began to shake itself towards actual advance.

Finn's brother, Kalf Arneson, once a warm friend of Olaf, was chief of the three commanders on the {{opposite}} side. Finn and he addressed angry speech to one another from the opposite ranks, when they came near enough. Finn, seeing the enemy fairly approach, stirred Olaf from his sleep. [...] "Oh, why hast thou wakened me from such a dream?" [...] said Olaf, in a deeply solemn tone. [...] "What dream was it, then?" [...] asked Finn. [...] "I dreamt that there rose a ladder here reaching up to very Heaven," [...] said Olaf; [...] "I had climbed and climbed, and got to the very last step, and should have entered there hadst thou given me another moment."

Jarl Hakon, too, sister's son of Knut, and always well seen by him, had long been busy in this direction, much forgetful of that oath to Olaf when his barge got canted over by the cable of two capstans, and his life was given him, not without conditions altogether! ...|$|E

60|$|And now began {{that long}} and sad captivity they all along feared.

6000|$|This small {{victory was}} the last that Olaf had over his many enemies at present. He sailed along, still northward, day after day; several {{important}} people joined him; but the news from landward grew daily more ominous: Bonders busily arming to rear of him; and ahead, Hakon still more busily at Trondhjem, now near by, [...] "--and he will end thy days, King, if he have strength enough!" [...] Olaf paused; sent scouts to a hill-top: [...] "Hakon's armament visible enough, and under way hitherward, about the Isle of Bjarno, yonder!" [...] Soon after, Olaf himself saw the <b>Bonder</b> armament of twenty-five ships, from the southward, sail past in the distance to join that of Hakon; and, worse still, his own ships, one and another (seven in all), were slipping off on a like errand! He made for the Fjord of Fodrar, mouth of the rugged strath called Valdal,--which I think still knows Olaf and has now an [...] "Olaf's Highway," [...] where, nine centuries ago, it scarcely had a path. Olaf entered this fjord, had his land-tent set up, and a cross beside it, on the small level green behind the promontory there.

6000|$|As we {{have here}} {{mentioned}} the three different classes that existed in Norway, it may be well to explain that the masters were peasants or [...] "bonders", but {{not by any means}} similar to peasants in other lands; on the contrary, they were the udal-born proprietors of the soil--the peasant-nobility, so to speak, the Udallers, or freeholders, without any superior lord, and were entitled to attend and have a voice in the [...] "Things" [...] or assemblies where the laws were enacted and public affairs regulated. The next class was that of the [...] "unfreemen". These were freed slaves who had wrought out or purchased their freedom, but who, although personally free, and at liberty to go where and serve whom they pleased, were not free to attend the legislative assemblies. They were unfree of the Things, and hence their apparently contradictory designation. They, however, enjoyed the protection and civil rights imparted by the laws, and to their class belonged all the cottars on the land paying a rent in work on the farm of the <b>bonder</b> or udaller, also the house-carles or freeborn indoormen, and the tradesmen, labourers, fishermen, etcetera, about villages and farms. Thralls were slaves taken in war, over whom the owners had absolute control. They might sell them, kill them, or do with them as they pleased. Thralls were permitted to purchase their freedom--and all the descendants of those freed thralls, or unfreemen, were free.|$|E
6000|$|Sunbeam of the Grove, when next {{demanded of}} her <b>Bonder,</b> has the whole {{neighborhood}} assembled in arms round her; rumor of Tryggveson is fast {{making it the}} whole country. Hakon's insolent messengers are cut in pieces; Hakon finds he cannot fly under cover too soon. With a single slave he flies that same night;--but whitherward? Can think of no safe place, except to some old mistress of his, who lives retired in that neighborhood, and has some pity or regard for the wicked old Hakon. Old mistress does receive him, pities him, will do all she can to protect and hide him. But how, by what uttermost stretch of female artifice hide him here; every one will search here first of all! Old mistress, by the slave's help, extemporizes a cellar under the floor of her pig-house; sticks Hakon and slave into that, as the one safe seclusion she can contrive. Hakon and slave, begrunted by the pigs above them, tortured by the devils within and about them, passed two days in circumstances more and more horrible. For they heard, through their light-slit and breathing-slit, the triumph of Tryggveson proclaiming itself by Tryggveson's own lips, who had mounted a big boulder near by and was victoriously speaking to the people, winding up with a promise of honors and rewards to whoever should bring him wicked old Hakon's head. Wretched Hakon, justly suspecting his slave, tried to at least keep himself awake. Slave did keep himself awake till Hakon dozed or slept, then swiftly cut off Hakon's head, and plunged out with it {{to the presence of}} Tryggveson. Tryggveson, detesting the traitor, useful as the treachery was, cut off the slave's head too, had it hung up along with Hakon's on the pinnacle of the Lade Gallows, where the populace pelted both heads with stones and many curses, especially the more important of the two.

6000|$|Olaf {{had about}} three {{thousand}} men with him; gathered mostly as he fared along through Norway. Four hundred, raised by one Dag, a kinsman {{whom he had}} found in Sweden and persuaded to come with him, marched usually in a separate body; and were, or might have been, rather an important element. Learning that the Bonders were all arming, especially in Trondhjem country, Olaf streamed down towards them in the closest order he could. By no means very close, subsistence even for three thousand being difficult in such a country. His speech was almost always free and cheerful, though his thoughts always naturally were of a high and earnest, almost sacred tone; devout above all. Stickelstad, a small poor hamlet still standing where the valley ends, was seen by Olaf, and tacitly by the Bonders as well, to be the natural place for offering battle. There Olaf issued out from the hills one morning: drew himself up according to the best rules of Norse tactics, rules of little complexity, but perspicuously true to the facts. I {{think he had a}} clear open ground still rather raised above the plain in front; he could see how the <b>Bonder</b> army had not yet quite arrived, but was pouring forward, in spontaneous rows or groups, copiously by every path. This was thought to be the biggest army that ever met in Norway; [...] "certainly not much fewer than a hundred times a hundred men," [...] according to Snorro; great Bonders several of them, small Bonders very many,--all of willing mind, animated with a hot sense of intolerable injuries. [...] "King Olaf had punished great and small with equal rigor," [...] says Snorro; [...] "which appeared to the chief people of the country too severe; and animosity rose to the highest when they lost relatives by the King's just sentence, although they were in reality guilty. He again would rather renounce his dignity than omit righteous judgment. The accusation against him, of being stingy with his money, was not just, for he was a most generous man towards his friends. But that alone was the cause of the discontent raised against him, that he appeared hard and severe in his retributions. Besides, King Knut offered large sums of money, and the great chiefs were corrupted by this, and by his offering them greater dignities than they had possessed before." [...] On these grounds, against the intolerable man, great and small were now pouring along by every path.|$|E
