25|$|Although Spenser endowed 'The <b>beauteous</b> Trent' with 'thirty {{different}} streams' {{the river}} is joined by {{more than twice that}} number of different tributaries, of which the largest in terms of flow is the Tame which drains most of the West Midlands, including Birmingham and the Black Country. The second and third largest are the Derwent and the Dove respectively; together these two rivers drain the majority of Derbyshire and Staffordshire, including the upland areas of the Peak District.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Homerun was mixed. Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com {{wrote that the}} film [...] "succeeds in delivering a relatively simple, intimate story that should prove moving {{for even the most}} jaded audience", while Nick England of the San Diego Asian Film Foundation described Homerun as [...] "a film with certain <b>beauteous</b> qualities that we can genuinely enjoy, but end up choking on when it is all over with". In contrast, FilmsAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei panned its use of political satire, which she felt [...] " [...] the film to be devoid of innocence and replaced with a sense of agenda and manipulation".|$|E
2500|$|Aesthetically he's a formalist: {{aesthetic}} is {{only the}} form, not the content; this is where his scholarly personality suppressed his artistic predilections. The art must provide aesthetic pleasure; it should aspire to panhuman ideal, rise above the reality to the value. Therefore, Marković is not particularly supportive of naturalism and realism: naturalism simply depicts abject and vicious sides of life. The object of art must be <b>beauteous</b> not only by its form, but also venerable by its content. Illustrious artists are [...] "folk teachers, the creators of life".|$|E
2500|$|In c. February, 398, Maria married Honorius, her {{maternal}} first cousin, once removed. Her {{husband was}} a son of Theodosius I and his first wife Aelia Flaccilla. Honorius was not yet fourteen-years-old. The Epithalamion written in their honor by Claudian survives. He places his flattering description of Maria {{in the mouth of}} Venus, a Roman goddess principally associated with love, beauty and fertility, the [...] equivalent of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. [...] "E'en though no ties of blood united thee to the royal house, though thou wert in no way related thereto, yet would thy beauty render thee worthy of a kingdom. What face could rather win a sceptre? What countenance better adorn a palace? Redder than roses thy lips, whiter than the hoar-frost thy neck, cowslips are not more yellow than thine hair, fire not more bright than thine eyes. With how fine an interspace do the delicate eyebrows meet upon thy forehead! How just the blend that makes thy blush, thy fairness not o'ermantled with too much red! Pinker thy fingers than Aurora's, firmer thy shoulders than Diana's; even thy mother dost thou surpass. If Bacchus, Ariadne's lover, could transform his mistress' garland into a constellation how comes it that a more <b>beauteous</b> maid has no crown of stars?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Laman Blanchard, {{writing in}} 1836, {{described}} the Rother as [...] "a <b>beauteous</b> stream", {{and noted that}} chub, roach and perch were caught by fishermen who fished from its banks. It {{was also one of}} the main sources of salmon for the River Don system. The river did not suffer from the worst effects of the industrial revolution until the 1880s, when the development of coal mining on several of its tributaries resulting in a rapid deterioration in water quality. The industry itself discharged minewater to the river, containing large volumes of solids, which were deposited on the river bed, smothering the vegetation. The villages which grew up around the mines often had little or no sewage treatment facilities, and hence sewage found its way into the river. The River Doe Lea, the River Drone and the Pools Brook became lifeless sewers, as did the Rother. Derbyshire County Council obtained a ruling from the Chesterfield County Court in 1905, which required local authorities to stop polluting the river, and gave them three years to construct sewage treatment works. However, the growth in population outstripped the efforts to resolve these issues, and the river continued to deteriorate. One or two of its tributaries were not polluted, and the River Hipper retained stocks of brown trout and grayling.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{major theme}} {{throughout}} {{the play is}} the contrast between Margaret and Henry, something which is introduced when they first meet. Henry thanks God for bringing Margaret to him, and exclaims [...] "For thou hast given me in this <b>beauteous</b> face/A world of earthly blessing to my soul,/If sympathy of love unite our thoughts" [...] (1.1.21–23). The irony here, much commented on by critics, is that this unity is exactly what does not happen – their thoughts never unite, and their contrasting and incompatible attitudes are seen time and again throughout the play. For example, after the false miracle, Henry is distraught and laments, [...] "O God, seest thou this and bear'st so long?" [...] (2.1.150), while Margaret's response is much more mundane; [...] "It made me laugh to see the villain run" [...] (2.1.151). When Buckingham arrives to bring news to Henry of Eleanor's dabbling in necromancy, Henry's reaction is pious and sorrowful, [...] "O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,/Heaping confusion on their heads thereby" [...] (2.1.181–182). Margaret's response, however, is combative, using the news to forward her own agenda; [...] "Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,/And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best" [...] (2.1.183–184). Later, when Horner and Thump are about to fight, Henry sees the contest as a sacred point of honour: [...] "A God's name, see the lists and all things fit;/Here let them end it, and God defend the right" [...] (2.3.54–55). Margaret however, is simply {{looking forward to a}} fight; [...] "For purposely therefore,/Left I the court to see this quarrel tried" [...] (2.3.52–53). Henry is [...] "fatally married to his polar opposite." ...|$|E
