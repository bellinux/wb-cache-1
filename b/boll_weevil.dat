5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E

25|$|The <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> (Anthonomus grandis) is a beetle which {{feeds on}} cotton buds and flowers. Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it {{migrated}} into the United States from Mexico {{in the late}} 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, the <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevil</b> Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions.|$|E
25|$|Historically, in North America, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} destructive pests in cotton production has been the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b> Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevil</b> Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.|$|E
25|$|Other {{limitations}} on <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> populations include extreme heat and drought. Its natural predators include fire ants, insects, spiders, birds, and a parasitic wasp, Catolaccus grandis. The insects sometimes emerge from diapause before cotton buds are available.|$|E

25|$|Until the mid-20th century, Florida was {{the least}} populous Southern state. In 1900, its {{population}} was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War. The <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> devastated cotton crops.|$|E
25|$|The Alabama Extension Service {{initially}} {{focused on}} improving the bleak economic prospects of Alabama farmers, {{most of whom}} raised cotton under the persistent threat of the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b> As funds permitted, home demonstration agents were employed to provide farm wives with practical assistance with food preservation and other home-related improvements.|$|E

5000|$|The Arkansas-Monticello <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevils</b> {{football}} {{program is the}} intercollegiate American football team for the University of Arkansas at Monticello located in the U.S. state of Arkansas.

The team plays its home games at Willis [...] "Convoy" [...] Leslie Cotton Boll Stadium in Monticello, Arkansas. The <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevils</b> are coached by Hud Jackson.|$|R
5000|$|Although its {{membership}} is not exclusively Southern, some view the Blue Dogs {{as the political}} successors to a now defunct-in-name Southern Democratic group known as the <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevils,</b> who {{played a critical role}} in the early 1980s by supporting President Ronald Reagan's tax cut plan. The <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevils,</b> in turn, may be considered the descendants of the Dixiecrats and the [...] "states' rights" [...] Democrats of the 1940s through the 1960s, and even the Bourbon Democrats of the late 19th century.|$|R
25|$|While many control {{methods have}} been {{investigated}} since the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> entered the United States, insecticides have always remained the main control methods. In the 1980s, entomologists at Texas A University pointed {{to the spread of}} another invasive pest, the red imported fire ant, as a factor in the weevils' population decline in some areas.|$|E
25|$|Musicians of the state's Delta {{region were}} {{historically}} significant {{to the development}} of the blues. Although by the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farm owners were black, continued low prices for cotton and national financial pressures resulted in most of them losing their land. More problems built up with the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation, when thousands of agricultural jobs were lost.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, {{the state}} refused {{for years to}} build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the {{reliance}} on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912â€“1913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, {{thousands}} of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings. The <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went West to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the rhetoric}} {{surrounding}} lynchings frequently suggested {{they were to}} protect the virtue and safety of white women, the actions basically arose out of white attempts to maintain domination in a rapidly changing society and their fears of social change. Victims were the scapegoats for peoples' attempts to control agriculture, labor and education, {{as well as a}} reaction to economic stresses during downturns when cotton prices dropped, and larger disasters such as the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b>|$|E
25|$|The insect {{crossed the}} Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, {{to enter the}} United States from Mexico in 1892 and reached southeastern Alabama in 1909.

Since the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> entered the United States, it has cost U.S. cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.|$|E
