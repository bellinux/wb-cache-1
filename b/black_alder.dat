5|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} includes many communities of a Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean type: warm oak forests with undergrowth of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, such as tree heath (Erica arborea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Rose of Sharon (Hypericum calycinum), green olive tree (Phillyrea latifolia), Cistus incanus, sage-leaved rock rose (Cistus salvifolius), among others. The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west {{of the park}} have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The coastal dunes are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of <b>black</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus glutinosa), white willow (Salix alba) and crack willow (Salix fragilis).|$|E
25|$|The reserve {{comprises}} a vast open lowland {{landscape with}} {{a mosaic of}} swamps, moors, lakes, rivers and forests located between the basins of the Bug and Wieprz rivers.

60|$|Something {{was wrong}} in my call; the birds were suspicious, knowing not what danger had kept their fellows silent so long, and now {{threatened}} {{them out of the}} <b>black</b> <b>alders.</b> A moment's intent listening; then the leader stepped slowly down from his log and came towards me cautiously, halting, hiding, listening, gliding, swinging far out to one side and back again in stealthy advance, till he drew himself up abruptly at sight of my face peering out of the underbrush. For a long two minutes he never stirred so much as an eyelid. Then he glided swiftly back, with a faint, puzzled, questioning kwit-kwit? to where his flock were waiting. A low signal that I could barely hear, a swift movement--then the flock thundered away in scattered flight into the silent, friendly woods.|$|R

50|$|Τhe {{black pine}} dominates {{on the eastern}} and {{northern}} side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine. In this zone there is also beech. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there elm, cherry plum, European yew, hazel, holly, cornus mas, manna ash, maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants.

40|$|Several storms have damaged Estonian {{forests in}} recent years. Individual tree {{properties}} such as diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height affect {{the type of}} damage (stem breakage or uprooting) and influence the formation of postdisturbance forest structure. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse how the risk of uprooting and stem breakage varied with respect to tree diameter, height, species and soil conditions. The data were collected from plots located in storm-damaged forests in eastern Estonia. The probability of uprooting increased with increasing diameter for Norway spruce, European aspen and birch. <b>Black</b> <b>alders</b> with large stem diameter usually suffered stem breakage. A high proportion of stem breakage also occurred among small Norway spruce in the understorey, probably damaged by falling canopy trees. Soil conditions influenced the ratio between uprooting and stem breakage of Norway spruce, the ratio being much higher on gley soils than on podzolic soils. The root plate size of Norway spruce was only slightly correlated with dbh, tree height and volum...|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of a thicket of low <b>black</b> <b>alders,</b> {{surrounded}} by a perfect hedge of bushes, I found him at last. He was on the lower end of a fallen log, gliding rapidly up and down, spreading wings and tail and budding ruff, as if he were drumming, and sending out his peculiar call at every pause. Above him, in a long line on the same log, five other partridges were sitting perfectly quiet, save now and then, when an answer came to the leader's call, they would turn their heads and listen intently till the underbrush parted cautiously and another bird flitted up beside them. Then another call, and from the distant hillside a faint kwit-kwit and a rush of wings in answer, and another partridge would shoot in on swift pinions to pull himself up on the log beside his fellows. The line would open hospitably to let him in; then the row grew quiet again, as the leader called, turning their heads from side to side for the faint answers.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the park}} there are 4 avenues of oaks and one tree - a pedunculate oak - {{protected}} {{in the form}} of natural monuments. The avenues are grouped in the area of Gryżyna village, they gather about 300 trees and with its longevity ( [...] 150-200 years) and size (20 -25 metres high and 180-400 centimetres of circumference) they are considered an amazing natural phenomenon. Another natural monument is the deepest and the most beautiful ravine, which was created by water after the glacier had retreated. The western and central part of the ravine is covered by the beech forest. In the eastern part, on the peat bogs, <b>black</b> <b>alders</b> grow. The Rashes of Gryżyna cover 32,86 hectares and are located in the postglacial valley near the springs of Gryżyński Potok.

6000|$|We will wander--for {{though the}} sun be bright, here are good fish {{to be picked}} out of sharps and stop-holes--into the water-tables, ridged up centuries since into furrows forty feet broad and five feet high, over which the crystal water sparkles among {{the roots of the}} rich grass, and hurries down innumerable drains to find its parent stream between tufts of great blue geranium, and spires of purple loosestrife, and the {{delicate}} white and pink comfrey-bells, and the avens--fairest and most modest of all the waterside nymphs, who hangs her head all day long in pretty shame, with a soft blush upon her tawny check. But at the mouth of each of those drains, if we can get our flies in, and keep ourselves unseen, we will have one cast at least. For at each of them, in some sharp-rippling spot, lies a great trout or two, waiting for beetle, caterpillar, and whatsoever else may be washed from among the long grass above. Thence, and from brimming feeders, which slip along, weed-choked, under white hawthorn hedges, and beneath the great roots of oak and elm, shall we pick out full many a goodly trout. There, in yon stop-hole underneath that tree, not ten feet broad or twenty long, where just enough water trickles through the hatches to make a ripple, are a brace of noble fish, no doubt; and one of them you may be sure of, if you will go the proper way to work, and fish scientifically with the brace of flies I have put on for you--a governor and a <b>black</b> <b>alder.</b> In the first place, you must throw up into the little pool, not down.
