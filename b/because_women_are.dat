25|$|The German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency stated {{on their}} website that the {{establishment}} of women's parking spaces does not violate the General Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz), <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely than men}} to be victims of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Lanying’s life, {{she faced}} {{a lot more}} {{difficulties}} {{because she was a}} female. So after she came back from America, she joined the All-China Women's Federation. She held a lot of conferences and talked about the gender issues. As a woman, she never believed gender schema and always fought for herself. She believed that in the science field, women and men are equal, and that the reason why women are fewer in this field is <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> more easily distracted by other things such as gossip, so women have to memorize more unrelated things and cannot focus on work.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{when women}} {{have the right to}} work and are educated, women's job {{opportunities}} may in practice be unequal to those of men. In Egypt for example, women have limited opportunities to work in the private sector <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> still expected to put their role in the family first, which causes men to be seen as more reliable in the long term. In Saudi Arabia, it is illegal for Saudi women to drive, serve in military and other professions with men. It is becoming more common for Saudi Arabian women to procure driving licences from other Gulf Cooperation Council states such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> {{required}} to perform certain korbanot (sacrifices) in the Temple in Jerusalem, <b>women</b> today <b>are</b> {{required to}} perform, and hence can lead (and can count in the minyan for if required), the specific prayers substituting for these specific sacrifices. Birchat Hagomel falls in this category.|$|R

50|$|The fear of {{conservative}} {{women at the}} time was the burgeoning feminist movement taking root in women's colleges which would allegedly plant the idea in men's minds that <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> now seen as independent, they could shirk their economic duties as providers.|$|R
25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex relationship {{can not be}} viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E
25|$|Arguments favoring {{discrimination}} against women are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western misogynist writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from Formicarius (1435), Preceptorium divinae legis (1475) and Lectiones super ecclesiastes (1380).Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its negative pole. Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation of opposites, but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. <b>Because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> the negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Beyond sex {{differences}} in academic ability, recent research has also been focusing on women’s underrepresentation in higher education, especially {{in the fields of}} natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Nonetheless, 2011 data on earned doctorates in the United States by the National Science Foundation shows female representation in all of academia varies, not just in STEM subjects. For example, in 2011, women earned 54% of molecular biology PhDs but less than 20% in physics (STEM). In humanities and social sciences, women earned over 70% of psychology PhDs, but only 30% in philosophy. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Women in Science explained these patterns of female under-representation across academic disciplines, using the field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis, which claims that women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> stereotyped as not possessing such talent. The study, conducted on 1820 academics from 30 different disciplines, found that the more a particular field values gifted-ness, the fewer the female PhDs in that discipline. According to the researchers, “emphasis on raw aptitude may activate negative stereotypes in women’s own minds, making them vulnerable to stereotype threat”.|$|E

Women and girls may also choose to perform the mitzvah of waving the lulav and etrog, although they are not required by Halakha to do so. [...] <b>Because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> not required to perform this mitzva, some are of the opinion that Sephardi women do not need to recite the blessing.|$|E
2500|$|Several feminists {{make the}} {{distinction}} {{that it is}} not <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> women or [...] "feminine" [...] that they relate to nature, but because of their similar states of oppression by the same male-dominant force. The marginalization is evident in the gendered language used to describe nature and the animalized language used to describe women. Some discourses link women specifically to the environment because of their traditional social role as a nurturer and caregiver.|$|E
5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; original sin among <b>women</b> <b>was</b> a particular concern, especially <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> perceived as creating life. During this time, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.|$|R

2500|$|De Beauvoir defines {{women as}} the “second sex” <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> defined in {{relation}} to men. Aristotle referred that women are “female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities.” De Beauvoir {{also points out that}} St. Thomas referred to the woman as the “imperfect man", the [...] "incidental” being. De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the 'immanence' to which they were previously resigned and reaching 'transcendence', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.|$|E
2500|$|Sex ratio {{theory is}} a theory that {{explains}} the relationship and sexual dynamics within {{different areas of the}} world based on the ratio of the number of marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women. According to this theory, an area has a high sex ratio when there is a higher number of marriage-aged women to marriage-aged men and an area has a low sex ratio when there is more marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women. In terms of infidelity, the theory states that when sex-ratios are high, men {{are more likely to be}} promiscuous and engage in sex outside of a committed relationship because the demand for men is higher and so this type of behaviour, which is desired by men, is more accepted. On the other hand, when sex ratios are low, promiscuity is less common <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> in demand and since they desire monogamy and commitment, in order for men to remain competitive in the pool of mates, they must respond to these desires. [...] Support for this theory comes from evidence showing higher divorce rates in countries with lower sex ratios and higher monogamy rates in countries with higher sex ratios.|$|E

2500|$|Kabary may be {{delivered}} {{by two or}} more mpikabary at the same occasion, and each one generally was nominated by and represents {{a portion of the}} audience present, as during hiragasy performances. [...] When this happens, kabary speech can take on somewhat competitive overtones as the speakers attempt to demonstrate their superior skills. The mpikabary typically addresses himself to the audience of his opponent, and while direct confrontation is generally frowned upon in polite society in the Highlands of Madagascar, if an opponent mpikabary makes an error {{in the form of the}} kabary or misstates an ohabolana, this is commonly pointed out in an indirect or delicate manner as evidence of greater mastery. [...] The use of indirect language such as proverbs is viewed as the more challenging, adult manner of speaking and demonstrates skill, while direct criticism, bluntness, hateful speech or anything that causes loss of face to the audience or a rival speaker is censured and despised as lacking in skill. [...] Kabary is generally the domain of men and not women, <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> believed and expected to speak in a more straightforward wayincluding the expression of anger that can cause loss of face to the speakerwhile men are expected to preserve face by taking the time to choose their words carefully when speaking to others. [...] Nonetheless, some women may exceptionally engage in kabary (for instance, all queens), although men represent the vast majority of mpikabary.|$|E

60|$|Before {{we begin}} {{discussing}} our various new {{plans for the}} people's welfare, let us make a kind of agreement that we will argue in a straightforward way, {{and not in a}} tail-foremost way. The typical modern movements may be right; but let them be defended because they are right, not because they are typical modern movements. Let us begin with the actual woman or man in the street, who is cold; like mankind before the finding of fire. Do not let us begin {{with the end of the}} last red-hot discussion&mdash;like the end of a red hot poker. Imperialism may be right. But if it is right, it is right because England has some divine authority like Israel, or some human authority like Rome; not because we have saddled ourselves with South Africa, and don't know how to get rid of it. Socialism may be true. But if it is true, it is true because the tribe or the city can really declare all land to be common land, not because Harrod's Stores exist and the commonwealth must copy them. Female suffrage may be just. But if it is just, it is just <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> women, not <b>because</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> sweated workers and white slaves and all sorts of things that they ought never to have been. Let not the Imperialist accept a colony because it is there, nor the Suffragist seize a vote because it is lying about, nor the Socialist buy up an industry merely because it is for sale.|$|E
