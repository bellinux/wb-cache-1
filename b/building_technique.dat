5|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, low-lying casemates {{were added to}} the western and southwestern {{curtains}} to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The <b>building</b> <b>technique</b> used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and technical expertise. Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected during this phase, likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Scanian {{architecture}} {{is shaped by}} the limited availability of wood; it incorporates different applications of the <b>building</b> <b>technique</b> called half-timbering. In the cities, the infill of the façades consisted of bricks, whereas the country-side half-timbered houses had infill made of clay and straw. Unlike many other Scanian towns, the town of Ystad has managed to preserve a rather large core of its half-timbered architecture in the city center—over 300 half-timbered houses still exist today. Many of the houses in Ystad {{were built in the}} renaissance style that was common in the entire Øresund Region, and which has also been preserved in Elsinore (Helsingør). Among Ystad's half-timbered houses is the oldest such building in Scandinavia, Pilgrändshuset from 1480.|$|E

25|$|The Eltham {{district}} {{had been}} settled since the 1850s; {{some of these}} early pioneers had used mud bricks to build their farmhouses, but the method had long been abandoned. Jörgensen saw value in the <b>building</b> <b>technique.</b> The local soils appeared suitable for both adobe (mudbrick) and pisé de terre (rammed earth) and it was cheap, so he set his students to work. He dispatched Arthur Munday, to the State Library in Melbourne to research the technique. There was little written material available, as the methods has been handed down from father to son. Arthur finally found {{in the writings of}} the ancient Roman historian Pliny some of the information they were looking for.|$|E
25|$|Romanian Orthodox monasteries {{and churches}} exist {{throughout}} Romania, but traditionally, few are constructed on a monumental scale. A {{great number of}} wooden churches are still intact in the Carpathian Mountains villages, but {{by far the most}} impressive are the Wooden Churches of Maramureş which push wood <b>building</b> <b>technique</b> to its limits. Byzantine influences can be found in most Romanian church buildings but domestic styles have evolved in different periods of time and in different regions. In Moldavia, a particular style was used {{in the construction of the}} monasteries, of which some of the most important are the churches of northern Moldavia - UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as those of Moldoviţa, Putna, Suceviţa, or Voroneţ. In Wallachia, Curtea de Argeş Cathedral was built in a Byzantine style with Moorish influences, and a great number of churches show Greek influences, especially those built in the 18th century, such as Stavropoleos Church in central Bucharest. Romania also evolved the distinctive Brâncovenesc style: the monasteries of Snagov and of Sâmbăta de Sus in Transylvania are classical examples.|$|E

500|$|The jagamohana is {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and has a two-element sloping roof with clerestory windows between them. The jagamohana [...] measures [...] from the inside and [...] from the outside. The latticed windows are classified as pata jali where perforations are square or rectangular in shape. In addition, there are trellised windows with slabs of stone sculptures depicting dancers and musicians. Light enters the interior through doors and the latticed windows. The junction of the vimana and the jagmohana is not cleanly built, leading some scholars to postulate that the porch was added at a much later date; however, the primitive connection is attributed to the <b>building</b> <b>technique.</b> The temple was constructed by burying completed portions in inclined layers of earth up which heavy pieces of stone were dragged.|$|E
500|$|Simon Jenkins has {{described}} Little Moreton Hall as [...] "a feast of medieval carpentry", but the <b>building</b> <b>technique</b> is unremarkable for Cheshire {{houses of the}} period– an oak framework set on stone footings. Diagonal oak braces that create chevron and lozenge patterns adorn the façades. The herringbone pattern with quatrefoils present at the rear, which {{can also be seen}} at Haslington and Gawsworth Halls, is a typical feature of 15th-century work, while the lozenge patterns, continuous middle rail and lack of quatrefoils in the front façade are typical of 16th-century early Elizabethan work. The south range containing the gatehouse, the last to be completed, has lighter timbers with a greater variety of patterns. The timber frame is completed by rendered infill and Flemish bond brick, or windows. The windows contain 30,000 leaded panes known as quarries, set in patterns of squares, rectangles, lozenges, circles and triangles, complementing the decoration on the timber framing. Much of the original 16th-century glazing has survived and shows the colour variations typical of old glass. Old scratched graffiti is visible in places. The older parts of the roof frame are decorated, and the brickwork of some of the chimneys has diapering in blue brick.|$|E
500|$|The Detective's Office (set number 10246) is {{the tenth}} {{set in the}} Modular Building line and was {{released}} January 1, 2015. [...] This set contains 2262 pieces. It contains a detective's office, a barber shop named [...] "Al's", a pool room, and an upstairs apartment. The [...] "Al's" [...] sign resembles the various signs from the Pet Shop, Town Hall, and Fire Brigade. The featured [...] "Pool" [...] sign uses a <b>building</b> <b>technique</b> never used before. Inside the pool room features a fan, a pool table, and a dart board. The detective office features clues, a cabinet, and a secret storage space behind a picture. The barber shop features a mirror, scissors, lights, and chairs for customers. The apartment holds an old style toilet and a small kitchen. This modular varies from previous buildings because it has secret compartments that allow cookie smuggling throughout the building, a new box design, new pieces, and somewhat more of a modern design. It also is different {{because it is the}} only modular to have two buildings on the same baseplate. The front of the building features a newspaper stand, a tree, and 2 balconies. It includes 6 minifigures.|$|E

2500|$|Earth is {{the most}} typical fill {{material}} used in bag-wall construction techniques. [...] This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags {{has become one of}} the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive <b>building</b> <b>technique</b> that is flexible, and easy to learn and use. [...] However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (see also Rice-hull bagwall construction).|$|E
