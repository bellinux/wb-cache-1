Haynes taught swimming classes and regularly took underprivileged young boys to movies and <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> dinners. After several years of active membership at the local level, he was elected president of the national YMCA in 1919 and served two one-year terms. His primary focus during his tenure was the launching of several successful membership drives. In 1920, he was appointed to the Indiana State Board of Education by Governor James P. Goodrich where he advocated increased state funding for vocational education.|$|E

In April 2008 the widow of Shelathia Harvey also sued Stokes, as well as Savannah Foods. It was a wholly owned subsidiary after Imperial <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> out and the factory was still owned in its name. In August, 2008 Malcolm Frazier succumbed to his injuries, bringing {{the total number of}} deaths to fourteen. Frazier, who suffered burns over 85% percent of his body, died at the Joseph M.

5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then <b>bought</b> <b>them.</b> After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E
5|$|Tina and Louise's aunt Gayle (Megan Mullally) has <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> {{tickets to}} an {{upcoming}} concert by the popular boy band Boyz 4 Now. Tina is excited, but Louise, who dislikes boy bands, only agrees {{to go at}} the insistence of her mother Linda (John Roberts). Gene has qualified for a regional tablescaping competition, which Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and Linda escort him to. Louise rejoices after a pet emergency leaves Gayle unable to bring the sisters to the concert, but reluctantly agrees to help find another ride after seeing Tina's disappointment. They hitch a ride with Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) and his older cousin Leslie (Jack McBrayer), who are going to the concert to sell bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs. Bob and Linda later meet the arrogant father of a fellow competitor named Oscar Anthony, which drives them to push Gene to win.|$|E

25|$|Reportedly {{the first}} {{telephone}} was operated at the Hotel Perkins. By 1923, ten lines served the county, {{each with a}} central; the Stuart central was located {{in the home of}} Walter S. Gilbert. In 1937, the Lee Telephone Company acquired all the private lines. In 1974, the Central Telephone Company of Virginia bought out the Lee Company. Years later Sprint/Centel <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> out and now Centurylink serves Patrick County.|$|E

25|$|In 716, Chilperic and Ragenfrid {{together}} led an army into Austrasia {{intent on}} seizing the Pippinid wealth at Cologne.

Charles had little time to gather men, or prepare, {{and the result was}} the only defeat of his career. The Frisians held off Charles, while the king and his mayor besieged Plectrude at Cologne, where she <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> off with a substantial portion of Pepin's treasure. Then they withdrew.|$|E
25|$|As {{railroad}} passenger ridership {{declined in}} the late 1950s, some railroads retired dome cars due to the maintenance costs. Other railroads that had not purchased dome cars new <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> second hand. Illinois Central purchased several cars from Missouri Pacific and Canadian National bought several cars from Milwaukee Road, for example. Because of their enormous usage of sealed glass, the cooling of the cars required massive air conditioning capacity. Maintenance and repair of these cars was costly. Breakdown of the air conditioning system on the road, even in winter, could render a car unusable.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of CP/M and S-100 bus computers was loosely patterned on the MITS Altair, an early {{standard in the}} microcomputer industry. This computer platform was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s. CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software by greatly {{reducing the amount of}} programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer. An important driver of software innovation was the advent of (comparatively) low-cost microcomputers running CP/M, as independent programmers and hackers <b>bought</b> <b>them</b> and shared their creations in user groups. CP/M was displaced by MS-DOS soon after the 1981 introduction of the IBM PC.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} of the abbey did not go unnoticed. In 1844 a rich young landowner, member of parliament, and generous churchman, Alexander James Beresford Hope, visited the ruins, found them deplorable, and <b>bought</b> <b>them.</b> Inspired by the missionary zeal of the Reverend Edward Coleridge, Hope and other donors gave additional money to restore and construct buildings {{for the establishment of}} a college to train young men as missionaries in the British colonies. They envisioned a dual purpose for the college: (a) to educate missionaries and (b) to excavate and preserve the abbey remains. St Augustine's Missionary College remained in existence until 1947. However, on the night of 31 May 1942, its buildings were so badly damaged by a German blitz that the College ceased operations.|$|E

About 1833, Timothy S. and David Coates engaged in merchandising and lumbering, continuing until 1854, when Clark Kimball of Osceola, succeeded David.
