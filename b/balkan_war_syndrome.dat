40|$|This paper {{researches}} the two <b>Balkan</b> <b>wars</b> and {{the actions}} of the participating countries by using the theoretical concept of the so-called “security dilemma’ as one of the key concepts in the science of international relations.

The goal is to find out whether this theoretical concept {{can be applied to the}} countries which took part in the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Wars,</b> and if its application in this specific case can offer some answers about the reasons behind the start of the two <b>Balkan</b> <b>Wars,</b> the question of the balance of power and its shifts, as well as the changes in alliances between the participating countries. In order to successfully accomplish this goal, the paper is going to utilize relevant literature on the topic of this theoretical concept, but also on the historical period of the two <b>Balkan</b> <b>wars</b> (1912 and 1913). With this approach, we hope to look at the subject from a different angle, which has not been sufficiently explored...|$|R
