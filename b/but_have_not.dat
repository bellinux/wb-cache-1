5|$|Among heterodontosaurids, only Heterodontosaurus {{itself is}} known from a {{complete}} skeleton.

Consequently, most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies (defining features) {{have been described}} from the teeth and jaw bones. Heterodontosaurus measured just over 1meter (3.3ft) in length, while the fragmentary remains of Lycorhinus may indicate a larger individual.|$|E

5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout {{have been released}} sporadically, approximately once a decade, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E

5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest and have no predators of their own except humans.

Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E
5|$|British {{control of}} Gibraltar enabled the Allies {{to control the}} {{entrance}} to the Mediterranean during the Second World War. It was attacked on several occasions by German, Italian and Vichy French forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the Gibraltarians themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to self-determination. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> reached any conclusion.|$|E
5|$|During the non-breeding season, storks in the Indian region {{disperse}} widely, {{mainly in}} the Gangetic Plains and sightings from the Deccan region are rare.

These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta however declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s. Improved sanitation has been suggested as a cause of their decline.

Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia.

Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.|$|E
