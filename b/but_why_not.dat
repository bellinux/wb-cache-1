500|$|On August 4, 2011, Derulo {{performed}} {{a medley of}} [...] "It Girl" [...] and [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] on America's Got Talent. Robbie Daw of Idolator compared his performance to Michael Jackson, writing [...] "we're used to the 21-year-old [...] MJ's legendary moves, especially on AGT. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> stage some original shuffling of your own at some point, Jason?". He later sang the song on The Wendy Williams Show on September 30, 2011. During an Australian promotional tour for Future History, Derulo performed [...] "It Girl" [...] at the Westfield shopping mall in Parramatta, New South Wales, {{as part of a}} set list which included [...] "In My Head" [...] and [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home".

500|$|Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski {{wrote about}} Mileena {{that instead of}} [...] "focusing on her {{fighting}} style, or assets," [...] they simply could not [...] "get past one thing: how does she pronounce the letter P without touching her lips together?" [...] In 2010, Game Informer included her among the palette swap characters not wanted by {{them in the future}} Mortal Kombat games, later describing her in the 2011 game as being [...] "as creepy as ever." [...] When American radio host Howard Stern mocked a Mortal Kombat fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the latter [...] "insane" [...] as [...] "onanism and Mileena should not mix." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote that [...] "as for the date theme , frankly we can’t really see the appeal – she’s not a patch on Sheeva, after all." [...] GameDaily praised the [...] "superb fashion sense" [...] of Soulcaliburs Taki by contrasting her with Mileena. Writing about [...] "outdated and cringe-worthy representations of women in video games" [...] in 2012, MMGN's Nathan Misa stated: [...] "Look, I like Lara Croft's booty shorts or Mileena's two...deadly sais as much as every other guy, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> have more than virtual polygons to ogle at?" [...] Discussing what she perceived as video games' popular misconceptions about women, Sarah Ditum wrote in PlayStation Official Magazine that same year: [...] "Relax—we don’t really bite. Well, not unless we have a face full of hell fangs at the top of an impossibly hot bod. Hellooo, Mileena." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, [...] "I {{fought hard}} against the emotionalism of In America [...] [...] [...] but I lost. There's no {{questioning}} the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants {{trying to make it}} in Manhattan. It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down— <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Jonas," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I didn't mean {{to triumph}} over you; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> would <b>not</b> the fire burn before {{you cut the}} hole through?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mervyn, {{what do you}} mean? You {{have all}} the power and {{consequence}} here, and are fully master of all; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> should <b>not</b> poor mamma live in her own house?' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>why</b> is <b>not</b> Frank Headley with them, when he {{is needed}} most? And why are Valencia's eyes more red with weeping than even her sister's sorrow need have made them? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most likely, 'Twould be a {{shame to}} shut them up with the poor missus this glad weather. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> They'll be company for ye, Kenneth lad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not such a one as myself, perhaps; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> {{one like}} you? How many generations {{have there been}} of you, now, at the place you call Clawbonny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stewart, {{certainly}} I cannot remain here {{longer if}} you insist upon my going. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> listen to me when I want so much to help you? Why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Checking his visitor at one point, he said, [...] "You have {{mentioned}} ragged {{schools and the}} good that is done by them, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> should <b>not</b> the school-boards look after such children?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see! Poor Mrs. Mercer {{went away}} ill, {{and did not}} live long after, and I suppose her people never troubled {{themselves}} about her letters. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> did <b>not</b> you get ours." ...|$|R
2500|$|Much {{is spoken}} now about downing of several Georgian {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles over Abkhazia. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> is <b>not</b> anyone saying {{anything about the}} fact, that existing agreements prohibit flights over this conflict territory? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why not?' said Barnaby. 'Because he is a stern man, {{and talks}} roughly? Well! I don't like him, {{or want to}} be with him by myself; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> speak about him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, I didn't think so. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> You--you cared once, and {{you tell}} me plainly you don't love him. It was all a terrible mistake. We were meant for each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is a very}} {{negative}} sort of goodness," [...] returned May, smiling. [...] "However, if you must go to see some one, Jamieson is better than Smithers; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> come home and consult with mother and me?" ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. I had {{not meant}} to speak of it, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> should <b>not</b> I? It will be a fine lesson to you, Miss Livvy. Ma'am, it is your Aunt Phoebe whom I love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Rodolph, {{so long as}} you do not {{quarrel with}} his jokes, they shall pass as true wit. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> comes <b>not</b> our son? Have you bidden the Prince Maximilian to our presence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|VERA (aside). One more blow! What does he mean? Oh, impossible! <b>but</b> <b>why</b> is he <b>not</b> with us? Alexis! Alexis! <b>why</b> are you <b>not</b> here? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Had I {{known of}} this, I {{would have done}} what in my flurry I {{did not think of}} doing--set a watch upon him. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> {{advertise}} for your missing wife as a preliminary, consulting your solicitor in the meantime?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you want}} it done, my daughter, Mrs. Rivers, is a dragon of {{diplomacy}} in canvassing; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> send him to Stoneborough? Cheviot takes a selection of cleric's sons at 30 pounds, {{and we would have}} an eye to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{very kind}} of you, Chicken, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> keep it yourself? You like nice things as well as I do," [...] said Cicely, much {{impressed}} by {{the value of the}} gift, for it was real amber, and the clasp of gold.|$|E
60|$|The {{voice was}} almost earnest, and the boy's resentment fled. He felt sorry, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> he did <b>not</b> know.|$|R
6000|$|... "All is well then," [...] {{the other}} exclaimed. [...] "Never mind {{the loss of}} your men. The money which I have promised you for this {{business}} will hire you two hundred such knaves; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> didst <b>not</b> knock him on head at once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are getting}} beyond me: <b>but</b> <b>why</b> do you <b>not</b> apply {{a little of}} the worldly wisdom which these same casuists taught you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was enough}} for everybody--India for Russia, a time-honoured dream, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> Alsace-Lorraine and perhaps Egypt, for France; Australia for Japan; China and South Africa for Germany. Why not? You may laugh at it on paper but I say again--why not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ob course not," [...] {{replied the}} negro, promptly, [...] "peepil's nebber anxious about whar wise men goes to; it's on'y child'in an' stoopid folk dey's got to tink about. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> ax de Queen, massa, for leabe ob absence to go a-huntin'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ans. It is no {{contempt}} at all {{to consult}} men more wise and judicious than him that wrote, or myself either. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> consult with others. Is wisdom to die with you? Or do you count all that yourselves have no hand in, done to your disparagement? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, in part, {{what all}} this means," [...] {{observed}} Deerslayer--"yes, I see through it, in part. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> is <b>not</b> Hetty present? Now Thomas Hutter is gone, {{she is one of}} the owners of these cur'osities, and ought to see them opened and handled." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>why</b> should <b>not</b> the {{conclusion}} be given up, {{since it is}} possible [...] Christ may have had two natures in him, so as to have been less than [...] the Father in respect to the one, and equal to him in respect to the [...] other.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>why</b> should <b>not</b> {{the truth}} be spoken of this region? Is the truth harmful? Has it ever needed to hide its face? God made the Sea of Galilee and its {{surroundings}} as they are. Is it {{the province of}} Mr. Grimes to improve upon the work? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course! It isn't {{just the}} thing for a gentleman moving in the select circles of Clover Street, as you do; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> come, sometimes, in the {{character}} of distinguished guest, and encourage your humble friends?

6000|$|... "Well, perhaps you're right.
