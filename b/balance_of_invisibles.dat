40|$|Abstract <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> Payments (BoP), being {{a record}} of the {{monetary}} transactions over a period {{with the rest of the}} world, reflects all payments and liabilities to foreigners and all payments and obligations received from foreigners. In this sense, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments is one of the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime. Two decade of economic reforms and free trade opened several opportunities that reflected in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments performance of the country. This paper attempts to evaluate the trends <b>of</b> India’s <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> Payments and identify its emerging challenges. The discussion is broadly classified into four parts viz. i) India’s <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments picture since 1991, ii) emerging role <b>of</b> <b>invisibles</b> and software services in <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments iii) unhealthy trends in FDI and iv) the vulnerability and challenges ahead. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> Payments (BoP), being {{a record}} of the {{monetary}} transactions over a period {{with the rest of the}} world, reflects all payments and liabilities to foreigners and all payments and obligations received from foreigners. In this sense, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments is one of the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. BoP accounting serves to highlight a country's competitive strengths and weaknesses and helps in achieving balanced economic-growth. It can significantly affect the economic policies of a government and the economy itself. Therefore, every country strives to a have a favorable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime. Two decades of economic reforms and free trade opened several opportunities that, of course, reflected in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments performance of the country. This paper, therefore, attempts to evaluate the trends and emerging challenges <b>of</b> India’s <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> Payments. The discussion is broadly classified into four parts viz. i) India’s <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments picture since 1991, ii) emerging role <b>of</b> <b>invisibles</b> and software services in <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments iii) unhealthy trends in FDI and iv) the vulnerability and challenges ahead. ...|$|R
50|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> {{support on}} {{recipients}} have been extensively investigated, but the consequences <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> support on providers are less known. One study in 2016 investigated {{the benefits and}} costs <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> support on couple-members who enacted supportive behaviors by differentiating the processes <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) from processes <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> instrumental support (providing tangible aid such as sending money or childcare). No costs of support-giving were found for providers when they demonstrated acts <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> emotional support. The effects for invisible instrumental support told a different story, where providers who reported high relationship satisfaction were unaffected, but providers who reported low relationship satisfaction were negatively affected by their acts <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> instrumental support {{with an increase in}} negative mood. These findings suggest that emotional comfort may be a more central function to maintain close relationships than instrumental support. Therefore, providing invisible emotional support may lead to less perceptions of a costly inequity than providing invisible instrumental support on average. However, since invisible instrumental support did not incur costs for providers who reported high relationship satisfaction, it implies that high relationship satisfaction may buffer potential costs that would otherwise be felt by support-providers. The differential results between invisible instrumental and emotional support indicate that a solid distinction between instrumental and emotional social support may be useful to take into account when investigating effects <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> support as a whole.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES Social support receipt from one's {{partner is}} assumed to be {{beneficial}} for successful smoking cessation. However, support receipt can have costs. Recent research suggests that the most effective support is unnoticed by the receiver (i. e., invisible). Therefore, this study examined the association between everyday levels <b>of</b> dyadic <b>invisible</b> emotional and instrumental support, daily negative affect, and daily smoking after a self-set quit attempt in smoker-non-smoker couples. METHODS Overall, 100 smokers (72. 0 % men, mean age M = 40. 48, SD = 9. 82) and their non-smoking partners completed electronic diaries from a self-set quit date on for 22 consecutive days, reporting daily invisible emotional and instrumental social support, daily negative affect, and daily smoking. RESULTS Same-day multilevel analyses showed that at the between-person level, higher individual mean levels <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> emotional and instrumental support were associated with less daily negative affect. In contrast to our assumption, more receipt <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> emotional and instrumental support was related to more daily cigarettes smoked. CONCLUSIONS The findings are in line with previous results, indicating invisible support to have beneficial relations with affect. However, results emphasize the need for further prospective daily diary approaches for understanding the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> support on smoking cessation. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Social support receipt from a close other has proven to have emotional costs. According to current studies, the most effective social support is unnoticed by the receiver (i. e., invisible). There is empirical evidence for beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> social support on affective well-being. What does this study add? Confirming benefits <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> social support for negative affect in a health behaviour change setting Providing first evidence for detrimental effects <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> social support on smoking...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an overview over research that considers invisible audiences. Fundamentally we understand media audiences as ‘people who receive, co-create, interpret, understand and appropriate media messages’ (Reifová and Pavlíčková, 2013 : 130). Within this realm, we identify and define invisible audiences in a twofold way. Firstly we consider research on audience {{groups that have}} been marginalized by both mainstream media and mainstream audience studies such as post-socialist audiences, working class audiences and very young audiences. Secondly we consider audience groups that are literally <b>invisible</b> including practices <b>of</b> lurking in social media environments as well as unintended audiences. The literature review of research of {{the past ten years}} on invisible audiences identifies important gaps for both forms <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> audiences. In conclusion, we suggest more extensive research on the diverse groups <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> audiences on a more structural level, i. e. questions of certain social, political as well as cultural groups are rendered invisible. Furthermore we suggest that studies consider practices <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> audiences on the micro, experiential level from the perspective <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>invisible</b> audiences...|$|R
