5000|$|The {{electric}} <b>bass</b> <b>is</b> {{a relative}} {{newcomer to the}} world of jazz. Until the 1950s, the double <b>bass</b> <b>was</b> used to anchor jazz ensembles from small combos to huge big bands. The electric <b>bass</b> <b>was</b> introduced in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson (and later Monk Montgomery) first used the instrument in Lionel Hampton's big band. When the electric <b>bass</b> <b>is</b> used in jazz, it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role. When the <b>bass</b> <b>is</b> used to accompany, it may be used to perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and jazz standards, in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass.|$|R

25|$|It {{pays for}} {{fishermen}} {{to remember that}} wild Australian <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> still a highly migratory when in the freshwater reaches of rivers, and can also be an extremely wary fish in these habitats, {{much more so than}} exotic trout species.|$|E
25|$|The main piscivore of the LSZ is {{the striped}} bass (Morone saxatilis), which was {{introduced}} in the 1890s and preys heavily upon native fishes.

25|$|Australian <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> {{not found}} in the Murray-Darling system because {{although}} the system is extensive, it has only one variable entrance to the Southern Ocean, a feature that appears to be incompatible with the estuarine breeding habits of Australian bass and other aspects of their life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{mainstream}} country music, bluegrass {{is traditionally}} played on acoustic stringed instruments. The fiddle, five-string banjo, guitar, mandolin, and upright bass (string <b>bass)</b> <b>are</b> often {{joined by the}} resonator guitar (also {{referred to as a}} Dobro) and (occasionally) harmonica or Jew's harp. This instrumentation originated in rural dance bands and is the basis on which the earliest bluegrass bands were formed.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{bass fishing}} competitions, caught <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> {{placed in a}} live well, and {{released}} as soon as caught and weighed by officials.

25|$|Peacock <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} food {{fish and}} also considered game fish. This {{has resulted in}} their accidental (escapees from fish farms) or deliberate (release by fishers) introduction to regions outside their native range, both elsewhere in South America, and in warm parts of North America and Asia. Where introduced, they may become invasive and damage the ecosystem because of their highly predatory behavior, feeding extensively on smaller native fish.|$|E

25|$|Medieval lutes were 4- or 5-course instruments, plucked using a quill as a plectrum. There {{were several}} sizes, {{and by the}} end of the Renaissance, seven {{different}} sizes (up to the great octave <b>bass)</b> <b>are</b> documented. Song accompaniment was probably the lute's primary function in the Middle Ages, but very little music securely attributable to the lute survives from the era before 1500. Medieval and early-Renaissance song accompaniments were probably mostly improvised, hence the lack of written records.|$|E
25|$|Black {{sea bass}} inhabit US coasts from Maine to NE Florida {{and the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, and are most {{abundant}} off the waters of New York. They are found in inshore waters (bays and sounds) and offshore in waters up {{to a depth of}} 130 m (425'). They {{spend most of their time}} close to the sea floor and are often congregated around bottom formations such as rocks, man-made reefs, wrecks, jetties, piers, and bridge pilings. Black sea <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> sought after recreational and commercial fish, and have been overfished.|$|E
500|$|Lake Jean {{is home to}} brook trout, brown trout, brown bullhead, {{and yellow}} bullhead. Acid rain with a pH near 3.0 has altered {{the ecology of the}} lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has {{decreased}} the number and quality of insects and plankton {{at the base of the}} food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnows, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. Predators like chain pickerel and largemouth <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> relatively few in number, and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly. Since 1996, the DCNR has added [...] of powdered lime to the lake each year to make the pH more neutral.|$|E
50|$|A bass song {{differs from}} a bass test in that a <b>bass</b> test <b>is</b> a {{recording}} where <b>bass</b> <b>is</b> {{the main point}} of the track, while in a bass song, the <b>bass</b> <b>is</b> still very prominent, yet remains supplemental {{to the rest of}} the song.|$|R

500|$|Some users add a {{subwoofer}} because {{high levels}} of low <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> desired, even beyond {{what is in the}} original recording, {{as in the case of}} house music enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some floor standing tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and [...] "satellite" [...] speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the [...] "satellite" [...] speakers are located.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{identified}} the songs [...] "Only in 3's", [...] "Fortunately Gone", and [...] "Doe" [...] {{as being more}} benign and friendly-sounding than the Pixies' work; Matt LeMay of Pitchfork described [...] "Doe", [...] "Iris", and [...] "Oh!" [...] as possessing a beautiful, surprisingly gripping quality. [...] "Oh!" [...] has a slow tempo, restrained drumming, a sad violin performance by Carrie Bradley, and raw singing by Deal, while [...] "Opened", [...] "Limehouse", and [...] "Hellbound" [...] each contain a buoyant rhythm. About [...] "Hellbound", musician Sasha Alcott wrote in The Boston Herald that the song [...] "rides the edge between sweet and delicate frivolity and a fierce head-banging head-banging sing-a-long ... The guitar, drums and <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> all doing their own thing to build up and then slam into the refrain." [...] "Metal Man", co-written by Wiggs and featuring her on Spanish guitar, contains a melody suggesting the Pixies' [...] "Cactus".|$|E
500|$|According to Thom Jurek of Allmusic, [...] "Richard Russell's {{production}} on I'm New Here kept Scott-Heron's voice front and center; [...] displaces it often, all but covering it with effects, beats, and pitched vocals in styles that cross the electronic music gamut". Tim Noakes of Dazed & Confused describes the album as [...] " [...] love letter to sample {{culture and the}} history of the UK electronic underground. Against 's booming backdrop of sub bass breakdowns, obscure samples and two-step rhythms, Scott-Heron’s scarred poetic missives take on a more sinister edge". Ian Maleney of Slate comments on the album's music, [...] "The beats and <b>bass</b> <b>are</b> classic dub [...] and the use of stretched and pitched vocal samples cement the albums place in the ever-developing dubstep cannon". Music critic Max Feldman notes [...] "smothering" [...] bass lines and [...] "robust" [...] beats, and writes that the album performs a [...] "balancing act between the avant-garde end of the dubstep fallout" [...] and [...] "dance-ability".|$|E
50|$|The double <b>bass</b> guitar <b>was</b> {{very heavy}} {{and not as}} easy to carry as other string instruments. Paul Tutmarc built an {{electronic}} <b>bass</b> that <b>was</b> played {{the same way as}} a guitar. This <b>bass</b> <b>was</b> called the Audiovox Model 736 Electronic Bass. “About 100 Audiovox 736 <b>basses</b> <b>were</b> made, and their distribution was apparently limited to the Seattle area.” The idea did not catch on and the company folded.|$|R
50|$|After {{the closure}} of the Shergold company in 1992 some <b>basses</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by individual luthiers using left-over parts and electronics. However no official records were kept and so for identification purposes these <b>basses</b> <b>are</b> also classified as official Marathon basses.|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} {{conventional}} fractions {{is taken to}} its logical conclusion with string bass sizes, in that a full-size (4/4) <b>bass</b> <b>is</b> uncommon. Most <b>basses</b> <b>are</b> 3/4 or 7/8, and younger players can use 1/2 or even 1/4 size instruments.|$|R
