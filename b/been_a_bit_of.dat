5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions {{are found in the}} northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{on a tour}} in the United States, Powderfinger {{played with}} Coldplay, in what Middleton {{described}} as a highlight. The band also played on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote Odyssey Number Five. After Coldplay cut short the tour, Powderfinger ended up playing numerous US shows themselves, before returning to Australia to play Splendour in the Grass. Middleton's partner {{gave birth to the}} couple's first daughter in September 2001.

Barber revealed [...] "He puts himself and his heart on the line like he's never done before. At first, Vanessa says no - and he's devastated. He's in a really vulnerable place and he doesn't take her knockback well. Rhys has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a ladies man all his life and he's never really committed to someone before Vanessa. She's a pretty special girl as far as Rhys is concerned." [...] Rhys becomes determined not to give up and he is [...] "thrilled" [...] when Vanessa changes her mind. Barber teased that it is possible viewers could see the last of Rhys and Vanessa for a while, adding [...] "There are definitely interesting times ahead!" ...|$|E

500|$|Odyssey Number Five marked Powderfinger's first {{successful}} attempt {{to enter the}} United States market. Fanning told Billboard in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, [...] "In America, we haven't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity", with the [...] "vibes" [...] on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream. Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As {{a result of these}} efforts, [...] "My Happiness" [...] was briefly placed on rotation on KROQ-FM and several other radio stations. The song ultimately peaked at #23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. This success was assisted by the band appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman, and by supporting Coldplay on tour.

500|$|England's next {{match was}} a one-off home Test against Sri Lanka and Agnew {{retained}} {{his place in}} the England team. At the time, Sri Lanka were regarded as the minnows of world cricket: this was only their 12th Test match and their first at Lord's, but they dominated the match, taking a 121-run lead on first innings and declaring twice. It was a disappointment for England and, in a batsman-friendly match in which the Sri Lankans racked up 785 runs for just 14 wickets, Agnew suffered. [...] Wisden described England's pacemen as ineffective; Agnew's [...] match figures were 2–177 off 43 overs. Poor performance and a muscle injury limited him to bowling a single over on the last day; later, Agnew reflected on other negative aspects of this match: [...] "I felt a complete outsider, not part of the set-up. I think the feeling in the dressing room was that the game had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a cock-up." ...|$|E

Ramsay Street's most prolific marry-er and father-er." [...] She also criticises the fact Paul's false leg is never shown on-screen adding: [...] "Paul has a wooden leg, which sometimes causes him to limp, when he remembers about it." [...] Holy Soap have said that Paul starting the Lassiter's fire and killing Gus during his 2004 return, was one of soap opera's greatest comebacks. They also branded him a [...] "legendary figure" [...] of Neighbours. Josephine Monroe in her book Neighbours: The first 10 years, names Paul one of soap opera's most enduring characters. An Inside Soap writer opined that [...] "slimy seducer" [...] Paul remained the same [...] "eighties smooth operator", observing [...] "he's certainly not short of a slick chat-up line or two. He's as skilled a lothario now as he always was." ...|$|E

GameSpy further commented that Kadabra {{makes up for}} the [...] "shortcomings" [...] of Abra. 1UP FM praised the characters' design, as the hosts noted them as some of their [...] "favorite" [...] Pokémon in the series {{and that they were}} [...] "impressed" [...] with their appearance. GamesRadar editor Henry Gilbert praised Kadabra and Alakazam's mustaches, listing them on their list of [...] "The 10 {{greatest}} mustaches in gaming history". GamesRadar editor Brett Elston labelled Abra's moveset [...] "lame", while acknowledging its potential to evolve into more powerful Pokémon. However, he claimed that Alakazam was [...] "useful" [...] only in [...] "limited" [...] circumstances. Elston also called Alakazam one of the [...] "most disturbing" [...] Pokémon of all time for the game's assertion that its brain cells [...] "continually multiply" [...] until it dies a horrible death. In a poll conducted by IGN, Kadabra was voted as the 91st best Pokémon, where it was called [...] "much cooler" [...] than Alakazam because [...] "He doesn't need to show off by bending two spoons". Alakazam was voted as the 20th best Pokémon, where the staff commented on the evolution line, stating they [...] "not only loved the clever naming system but the creatures' designs and abilities as well". They further stated that [...] "Abra has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a pain to raise and evolve, but the end result, an Alakazam, is well worth it in my book." ...|$|E
500|$|After Gilly {{eventually}} {{starts a}} relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd been a pretty happy bunch. And yet one person, who'd <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really surprised me, that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. It was weird. I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled in what you do, then you're having a successful life.|$|E

[...] Frank Clarke thought the Packer final drive was [...] "lucky football," [...] though Chuck Howley {{acknowledged that the}} Cowboy double coverage on the wide receivers left the backs open underneath. [...] Cornell Green even claimed that a bad pass interference call, [...] "the worst call I've seen in history," [...] on Dave Edwards aided the Packer final drive: [...] "That was the game." [...] In reality, the play Green recalled in which Starr threw a pass behind Donny Anderson happened back in the first quarter; but the call was [...] defensive holding (Willie Townes held tight end Marv Fleming), a 5-yard penalty, and the infraction occurred before Starr threw the pass. [...] There were no penalties called on either team during the final Packer drive. [...] Even Tom Landry in the NFL Film of the Ice Bowl stated {{that if he had}} realized the field was frozen, the Cowboys would have switched to a zone defense.|$|E
2500|$|British {{automotive}} writer Nick Georgano devotes {{a chapter}} to Teague {{in the book}} titled The Art of the American Automobile: the Greatest Stylists and their Work describing individuals whose creative talents {{made a difference in}} production and custom automobiles since the 1930s. According to the authors of the book,Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future, Teague {{was one of the people}} that [...] "helped to transport us into the future." [...] While serving as the chief stylist, Teague was called by Popular Mechanics to predict the design trends for automobiles in the 1960s. Together with Brooks Stevens, Teague presented ideas about future cars and vehicle technologies at the 1963 SAE congress in Detroit. Teague, [...] "who is generally considered to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a maverick" [...] predicted an evolutionary process for automobiles that turned out to be right. Teague foretold improvements in conventional gasoline engines, while cars [...] "would have greater variety of style now that glass could be shaped, and better suspension systems" [...] In contrast to Stevens, Teague believed that the automobiles of 1970 would still be built to provide basic transportation, and not be [...] "a home on wheels" [...] powered by an advanced power plant “the size of a breadbox.” ...|$|E
2500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: [...] "I’ve liked episodes {{that focus}} on Krapappel, {{but on the other}} hand, her {{relationship}} with Skinner has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a dud. Those two factors cancel each other out to leave this as an average show, though the mockery of EPCOT scores some points. I think the real EPCOT is pretty fun, actually, but the program delivers some amusing pokes at it." [...] "Special Edna" [...] was named the best episode of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons by IGN writers Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski. They commented: [...] "First and foremost, this episode, as the title implies, is a nice spotlight on poor, overworked, underpaid Mrs. Krabappel. Krabappel's relationship with Principal Skinner takes center stage [...] But there's a ton more to this episode, including Grampa's story about serving as a four year old in World War I; Milhouse showing up with his uncle to give Bart a ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter; and a trip to a very thinly veiled parody of Disney World's EPCOT Center [...] that is filled with spot on parodies like the World of Tomorrow ride, which is a horribly dated 1960s take on the far future of the year 1984." ...|$|E
