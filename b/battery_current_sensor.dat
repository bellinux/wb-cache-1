40|$|Recently, State {{of energy}} (SOE) {{has become one}} of the most {{fundamental}} parameters for battery management systems in electric vehicles. However, current information is critical in SOE estimation and <b>current</b> <b>sensor</b> is usually utilized to obtain the latest current information. However, if the <b>current</b> <b>sensor</b> fails, the SOE estimation may be confronted with large error. Therefore, this paper attempts to make the following contributions: <b>Current</b> <b>sensor</b> fault detection and SOE estimation method is realized simultaneously.

This thesis describes the design and evaluation of the EPS module, which is a critical part of the satellite, because without power the satellite {{will not be able to}} operate. The electrical power system of the satellite consists of the solar cells, batteries, and voltage converters. With limited power available, the main focus of the design has been to implement an efficient system with minimum losses in power conversions. The Electrical Power System (EPS) module has been designed with simplicity, reliability, and redundancy in mind. The designed is based on the requirements of a reliable power source, with the main goals of charging the batteries with power from the solar cells and regulate the battery voltage down to the requested voltages of the backplane. A charger is chosen for its abilities to provide efficient and safe charging by using proper strategies for efficient energy harvesting and charging. To accommodate the voltage request of the backplane, four fixed value regulators is chosen for the design. For power monitoring of the provided power from the solar cells and <b>batteries,</b> <b>current</b> monitor <b>sensors</b> are implemented after each charger circuit and the batteries.
