2500|$|When {{the time}} came to groom a {{successor}} for the king, {{there seemed to be no}} suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: [...] "You are the rightful king and we must ask you to come with us to the palace." [...] Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, [...] "I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root." [...] The stick he carried, was of chopo or <b>black</b> <b>poplar,</b> which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid.|$|E

Why dost thou then delay my longing arms? Have cares, and age, and mortal life such charms? The moon grows sickly {{at the sight of}} day, And early cocks have summoned me away: Yet I'll appoint a meeting place below, For there fierce winds o'er dusky vallies blow, Whose every puff bears empty shades away, Which guidless in those dark dominions stray. Just at the entrance of the fields below, Thou shalt behold a tall <b>black</b> <b>poplar</b> grow; Safe in its hollow trunk I will attend, And seize thy spirit when thou dost descend.|$|E
6000|$|The {{biggest of}} the old trees, which I shall {{describe}} first, was a red willow growing by itself within forty yards of the house. This is a native tree, and derives its specific name rubra, {{as well as its}} vernacular name, from the reddish colour of the rough bark. It grows to a great size, like the <b>black</b> <b>poplar,</b> but has long narrow leaves like those of the weeping willow. In summer I was never tired of watching this tree, since high up in one of the branches, which in those days seemed to me [...] "so close against the sky," [...] a scissor-tail tyrant-bird always had its nest, and this high open exposed nest was a constant attraction to the common brown carrion-hawk, called chimango--a hawk with the carrion-crow's habit of perpetually loitering about in search of eggs and fledglings.|$|E
60|$|The long-tailed or bottle-tit {{is one of}} {{the most}} delicately pretty of our small {{woodland}} birds, and among my treasures, in my invisible and intangible album, there were several pictures of him which I had thought unsurpassable, until on a day two years ago when a new and better one was garnered. I was walking a few miles from Bath by the Avon where it is not more than thirty or forty yards wide, on a cold, windy, very bright day in February. The opposite bank was lined with bushes growing close to the water, the roots and lower trunks of many of them being submerged, as the river was very full; and behind this low growth the ground rose abruptly, forming a long green hill crowned with tall beeches. I stopped to admire one of the bushes across the stream, and I wish I could now say what its species was: it was low with widespread branches close to the surface of the water, and its leafless twigs were adorned with catkins resembling those of the <b>black</b> <b>poplar,</b> as long as a man's little finger, of a rich dark-red or maroon colour. A party of about a dozen long-tailed tits were travelling, or drifting, in their usual desultory way, through the line of bushes towards this point, and in due time they arrived, one by one, at the bush I was watching, and finding it sheltered from the wind they elected to remain at that spot. For a space of fifteen minutes I looked on with delight, rejoicing at the rare chance which had brought that exquisite bird- and plant-scene before me. The long deep-red pendent catkins and the little pale birdlings among them in their grey and rose-coloured plumage, with long graceful tails and minute round, parroty heads; some quietly perched just above the water, others moving about here and there, occasionally suspending themselves back downwards from the slender terminal twigs--the whole mirrored below. That magical effect of water and sunlight gave to the scene a somewhat fairy-like, an almost illusory, character.|$|E

5000|$|Populus balsamifera, {{commonly}} called balsam poplar, bam, bamtree, eastern balsam-poplar, hackmatack, tacamahac poplar, tacamahaca, is a tree {{species in the}} balsam poplar species group in the poplar genus, Populus.

[...] Other common names for the species include heartleaf balsam poplar, and Ontario balsam <b>poplar.</b> The <b>black</b> cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa, is sometimes considered a subspecies of P. balsamifera and may lend its common name to this species, although the <b>black</b> <b>poplars</b> and cottonwoods of Populus sect.

On March 3, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson ordered that Pennsylvania Avenue be widened and the road completed. Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the architect newly hired to supervise the avenue's reconstruction, built three lanes separated by four rows of <b>Black</b> <b>Poplars.</b>|$|R
