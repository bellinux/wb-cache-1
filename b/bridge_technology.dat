40|$|Applications {{that cross}} the {{boundaries}} of different computing machines, operating systems, and programming languages are increasingly the norm. As a result, the need for {{what might be called}} <b>bridging</b> <b>technologies</b> to develop software that works across heterogeneous environments has become more compelling. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture is one such technology that is both robust and commercially available. CORBA essentially describes how client applications can invoke operations on server objects using the services of an intermediary known as an Object Request Broker, or ORB. This article introduces CORBA by describing its key components. It then reviews the boundaries it helps to bridge.

40|$|Our {{society is}} changing. The role which {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) play in our society is growing rapidly and meanwhile the world’s population is ageing. ICT has enabled social network sites (SNS), which are often targeted towards younger people and is therefore less suitable for seniors who find themselves displaced again and again. Through a design research oriented study, we explored the theories of non-traditional computing to find alternative ways of using technology to better meet the needs of seniors. We have found <b>bridging</b> <b>technologies</b> to be a promising domain that could help address the life-changing consequences of population ageing. We have identified four design principles to support the design of <b>bridging</b> <b>technologies,</b> geared towards enabling seniors to interact with social network sites. These principles constitute our final contribution...|$|R

50|$|Many {{questioned}} {{the wisdom of}} concrete floating <b>bridge</b> <b>technology</b> after the sinking of {{a portion of the}} Lacey V. Murrow bridge on November 25, 1990. However, a Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) investigation revealed that that incident resulted from the improper handling of hydrodemolition water being used during bridge renovations, rather than in any basic flaw in the bridge's concept or design. Concrete floating bridges continue to remain a viable means for the conveyance of vehicle traffic over Lake Washington.|$|E
50|$|The {{first modern}} train ferry was Leviathan, built in 1849.

40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emission}} reductions {{are at the}} centre of national and interna-tional efforts to mitigate climate change. In road transportation, many politically incentivised measures focus on increasing the energy efficiency of established technologies, or promoting electric or hybrid vehicles. The abatement potential of the former approach is limited, electric mobility technologies are not yet mar-ket-ready. In a case study for Germany, this paper focuses on natural gas po-wered vehicles as a <b>bridging</b> <b>technology</b> in road transportation. Scenario analys-es with {{a low level of}} aggregation show that natural gas-based road transporta-tion in Germany can accumulate up to 464 million tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent emission reductions until 2030 depending on the speed of the diffusion process. If similar policies were adopted EU-wide, the emission reduction potential could reach a maximum of about 2. 5 billion tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent. Efforts to pro-mote natural gas as a <b>bridging</b> <b>technology</b> may therefore contribute to significant emissions reductions.
