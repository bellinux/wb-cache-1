In this study two cold-water coral (CWC) <b>bearing</b> <b>cores</b> from two depths in the thermocline of the southern Gulf of C´adiz (sGoC) were analysed in a mutli-proxy approach. U-series dated glacial CWCs were analysed for recorded Li/Mg temperatures, water mass 14 C reservoir ages and radiogenic Nd isotope signatures (epsilonNd). For the first time, a CWC epsilonNd record was extended by two independent co-located hemipelagic sediment records. A seesaw pattern for the glacial sGoC intermediate waters alternating between predominant Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) and Eastern Antarctic Intermediate Water (EAAIW) is proposed. Glacial ENACW and EAAIW both exhibited polar temperatures (~ 0 °C) and more radiogenic epsilonNd signatures (~- 9) than nowadays and were distinguishable by their reservoir ages, with better ventilated glacial ENACW than EAAIW. A compilation of existing CWC mound aggregation records allowed for a first estimate of initial CWC settlement in the ocean around 3. 4 Ma ago, coinciding with the mid-Pliocene warm period and the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.

Examples include Oil-Free microturbines, motors, generators and turbochargers. The driving forces for integrating gas foil bearings into these high-speed systems are the benefits promised by removing the oil lubrication system. Elimination of the oil system leads to reduced emissions, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. Another benefit is reduced power plant weight. For rotorcraft applications, this would be a major advantage, as every pound removed from the propulsion system results in a payload benefit. Implementing foil gas bearings throughout a rotorcraft gas turbine engine is an important long-term goal that requires overcoming numerous technological hurdles. Adequate thrust bearing load capacity and potentially large gearbox applied radial loads are among them. However, by replacing the turbine end, or hot section, rolling element bearing with a gas foil bearing many of the above benefits can be realized. To this end, engine manufacturers are beginning to explore the possibilities of hot section gas foil bearings in propulsion engines.

Using a combination of rotordynamic analyses and a load capacity model, it is shown to be reasonable to consider a gas foil <b>bearing</b> <b>core</b> section...|$|E

The remaining 9 samples were submerged in clean water for the same period. Two sections of rope from each the dirty and clean groups were fatigued at 100, 200, 300, 400 cycles and one section each at 500 cycles. After fatigue treatment, the rope was tensile tested. Comparisons were made between the strengths of the dirty rope samples and the clean rope samples. It was found that exposure to abrasive particles decreases the fatigue life of the rope. It {{should be noted that the}} clean and dirty rope segments had identical strengths before fatigue treatment (5500 lb break strength), the same as that of new rope (100 % overall strength). Once exposed to fatigue treatment, the dirty ropes’ overall strength dropped linearly with greater fatigue.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) accessory protein Nef stimulates viral infectivity by facilitating an early event in the HIV- 1 life cycle. Although no structural or biochemical defects in Nef-defective HIV- 1 particles have been demonstrated, the Nef protein is incorporated into HIV- 1 particles. To localize the function of Nef within the virus particle, we developed a novel technology involving fusion of enveloped donor HIV- 1 particles <b>bearing</b> <b>core</b> defects with envelope-defective target virions bearing HIV- 1 receptors. Although neither virus alone was capable of infecting CD 4 + target cells, the incubation of donor and target virions prior to addition to target cells resulted in infection. This effect, termed “virion transcomplementation,” required a functional Env protein on the donor virus and CD 4 and an appropriate coreceptor on target virions. To provide evidence for intervirion fusion as the mechanism of complementation, experiments were performed using dual-enveloped HIV- 1 particles bearing both HIV- 1 and ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) Env proteins as donor virions. Infection of CD 4 -negative target cells bearing E-MLV receptors was prevented by HIV- 1 entry inhibitors when added before, but not after, incubation of donor and target virions prior to the addition to cells. When we used Nef+ and Nef− donor and target virions, Nef enhanced infection when present in donor virions. In contrast, no effect of Nef was detected when present in the target virus. These results reveal a potential mechanism for enhancing HIV- 1 diversity in vivo through the rescue of defective viral genomes and provide a novel genetic system for the functional analysis of virion-associated proteins in HIV- 1 infection...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} activity has demonstrated {{the viability of}} producing methane from gas hydrate bearing sediments by injecting and sequestering CO 2 in a process where CO 2 replace methane in gas hydrate by a process called CO 2 - CH 4 exchange. The work presented in this thesis consist {{of a series of}} ten experiments designed to increase the basic knowledge of hydrate formation and subsequent methane production by CO 2 - CH 4 exchange in sandstone with emphasis on the effect of initial water saturation and brine salinity. Methane hydrate was formed at 8. 3 MPa and 4 °C in ten partially saturated Bentheimer sandstone cores with varying initial water saturation and salinities. The hydrate formations were reproducible and showed a strong correlation between hydrate growth rate and both salinity and water saturation, where increased salinity or water saturation resulted in slower formation and more residual water. A correlation between initial growth rate and hydrate saturation were observed where the change in growth rate were proportional to the change in saturation. Hydrate bearing sandstone core plugs with high residual water saturation were successfully obtained by using initial water saturation above 0. 6. CO 2 - CH 4 exchange was successfully performed on five hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>core</b> plugs with different hydrate and water saturations. CO 2 - CH 4 exchange were performed by injecting liquid CO 2 and a 75 mol% N 2 + 25 mol% CO 2 mix at a rate of 0. 02 ml/min and measuring the effluent composition with a GC and, for some cores, the mass flow with a mass flow meter. The highest methane recovery from hydrate was estimated at 52 %. Nitrogen was successfully used to dissolve plugging in two experiments without any resulting large scale dissociation. Co-injection of nitrogen and carbon dioxide showed excellent ability to hinder secondary hydrate formation during exchange without affecting the recovery.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tendon {{injuries}} {{can result}} from tendon overuse or trauma, resulting in substantial pain and disability. Given that natural or surgical repair of tendons lead to a poor outcome in terms of mechanical properties and functionality, {{there is a great}} need for tissue engineering strategies. Textile platforms enable the generation of biomimetic constructs [1]. Therefore, the main goal of this study is the development of cell-laden hybrid hydrogel fibers reinforced with a mechanically robust core fiber and their assembly into braided constructs towards replicating tendon mechanical properties and architecture. METHODS: To fabricate mechanically reinforced hydrogel fibres, a commercially available suture was coated using a cell-hydrogel mixture of methacryloyl gelatine (GelMA) and alginate. Composite fibres (CFs) were obtained by ionic crosslinking of alginate followed by photocrosslinking of GelMA. CFs were assembled using braiding technique and the mechanical properties of single fibres and braided constructs were evaluated. Different cells were encapsulated in the hydrogel layer, including MC- 3 T 3, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human tendon-derived cells (TDCs). Cell viability and metabolic activity were evaluated by LIVE/DEAD staining and presto blue assay of metabolic activity. The expression of tendon-related markers and matrix deposition were also investigated. RESULTS: CFs were fabricated with a GelMA:alginate hydrogel layer and using multifilament twisted cotton or biodegradable suturing threads. The biocompatibility of this system was evaluated on encapsulated cells (Fig. 1 a). Cells (MC- 3 T 3, MSCs and TDCs) were homogeneously distributed along the hydrogel layer, being viable up to 14 days in culture. In addition, TDCs were spreading inside the hydrogel after less than 48 h. Moreover, to further improve the mechanical properties of CFs, braided constructs were generated (Fig. 1 b). Braiding CFs together enhanced their tensile strength and the process did not affect the viability of encapsulated cells. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: CFs were generated with a load <b>bearing</b> <b>core</b> and a hydrogel layer towards mimicking both mechanical properties and the matrix-rich microenvironment of tendon tissue. Accordingly, cell behaviour can be further modulated by modifying the hydrogel composition or, ultimately, through the addition of bioactive cues. Finally, braiding CFs together allows tuning the mechanical properties of developed constructs to match those of native tendon tissues.

40|$|Purpose: Down {{syndrome}} (DS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chromosomal syndromes. Children with this diagnosis receive physical therapy from an early age to help with strength, stability, motor planning and to help them meet motor milestones. Although early intervention physical therapy is usually done in the home or daycare, it is important to explore different therapies and how those might positively affect the child's outcomes. This project presents the case of a young girl with Down syndrome who received both hippotherapy and pool therapy and uses evidence based analysis to look at the PICO question: In toddlers with Down syndrome, does pool therapy or hippotherapy provide better motor outcomes? Background: In children with Down syndrome, early intervention therapies, especially physical therapy, are important to help with strengthening, postural stability, and to decrease the use of compensatory patterns. It is important when working with children to find activities that are fun, that they want to participate in, and, in children with low levels of arousal, which will increase their level of arousal to increase alertness, participation, and tone. Although all babies with a diagnosis of Down syndrome are referred to physical therapy, not all receive aquatic therapy or hippotherapy, which are different environments for physical therapy. Aquatic therapy is helpful for children with Down syndrome because it works on trunk stabilization, core strength, and does not stress lax ligaments. It is fairly easy to access. A downside, is that it is not a viable option for children with G-tubes or who have recently had surgery. In a hippotherapy setting, children with Down syndrome work on weight <b>bearing,</b> <b>core</b> strength, stability, awareness and attention, and on receiving proprioceptive input. Hippotherapy would not be appropriate for the children with respiratory issues if it is outside, or who have serious ligamentous laxity in their atlanto-occipital or atlanto-axial ligaments, because it could be dangerous. Hippotherapy is less common, and people rarely continue to participate in hippotherapy throughout their lives due to decreased availability of hippotherapy settings. Case Description: Anna G. was referred for an initial developmental evaluation with Early Intervention when she was around 5 months old for a diagnosis of trisomy 21 with a developmental delay. At around 24 months old, her physical therapist decided to change her physical therapy from at-home therapy to pool therapy. Based on her diagnosis, Anna was allotted 8 hours of therapy per month, to be split between physical therapy and speech therapy. Due to the limited number of early intervention therapy hours approved each month for children with DS, Anna was not allowed to receive both hippotherapy and pool therapy at the same time. Outcomes: Anna demonstrated improved tone and movement across interventions and it is impossible to determine if one treatment is better than the other. She continues to participate in hippotherapy and Early Intervention physical therapy. Discussion: Research assessing hippotherapy and aquatic therapy for early intervention in children with Down syndrome is very limited. Based on current evidence both hippotherapy and aquatic therapy would be appropriate, however, hippotherapy is the most suitable therapy for working on weight bearing for increased tone and postural stability. More research with larger populations and follow up studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A novel polyazomethines <b>bearing</b> triphenylamine <b>core</b> and {{a proper}} model {{compound}} were syn-thesized and their spectroscopic (FTIR, 1 H NMR) and optical (UV-vis, photoluminescence) properties {{and also a}} molecular dynamic calculations were investigated. The polymers which were soluble in organic sol-vents (chloroform, dimethylacetamide, m-cresol) and formed transparent foils, emitted blue light and their photoluminescence band and intensity were solvent dependent. Additionally, the effects of blending the new polyazomethines with other polymers–PMMA, polyvinylophenol on UV-vis spectra were examined. Non-covalent ionic-type interactions between azomethines and methanesulfonic acid (MSA), m-cresol (MC) and p-chlorophenol (pClp) were also investigated. The structure formation of azomethines com-plexes are discussed {{on the basis of}} 1 H NMR and FTIR. Photoluminescence and absorption properties of the azomethines compounds after doping with MSA, MC and pClp were tested. Key Words: Azomethines, triphenylamine, photoluminescence 1...|$|R

The <b>core</b> <b>bearing</b> structure with ground area measuring 28 x 43, 4 m consists of steel frames from rolled sections. Scia Engineer 2010 software {{has been used to}} create a three-dimensional model for the purpose of dimensioning each member and global analysis. Results obtained from the computer analysis were double-checked with a hand calculation of a few subelement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{variety of}} Banach algebras is a {{non-empty}} class of Banach algebras, {{for which there}} exists a family of laws such that its elements satisfy all of the laws. Each variety has a unique core (see [3]) which is generated by it. Each Banach algebra is not a core but, in this paper, we show that for each Banach algebra there exists a cardinal number (quantum of that Banach algebra) which shows the elevation of that Banach algebra for <b>bearing</b> a <b>core.</b> The class of all cores has interesting properties. Also, in this paper, we shall show that each core of a variety is generated by essential elements and each algebraic law of essential elements permeates {{to all of the}} elements of all of the Banach algebras belonging to that variety, which shows the existence of considerable structures in the cores. 1...|$|R
