5|$|They have a docile {{temperament}} and the milk {{has a high}} <b>butterfat</b> content, so have traditionally been used as house cows. They are generally good-natured animals but very protective of their young.|$|E
5|$|They are a {{hardy breed}} {{due to their}} native environment, the Highlands of Scotland. This results in long hair, giving the breed its ability to overwinter. Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high <b>butterfat</b> content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest quality, is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E
25|$|Unhomogenized {{milk and}} cream contain <b>butterfat</b> in {{microscopic}} globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from {{the other parts of}} the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the <b>butterfat</b> composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free <b>butterfat,</b> <b>butterfat</b> crystals, and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.|$|E

25|$|Butter is a {{dairy product}} {{containing}} up to 80% <b>butterfat</b> (in commercial products) which is solid when chilled and {{at room temperature}} in some regions and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the <b>butterfat</b> from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, {{as well as in}} cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of <b>butterfat,</b> milk proteins and water, and in some types, added salt. Butter may also be sold with added flavourings, such as garlic butter.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Elmer McCollum, a {{biochemist}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{and colleague}} Marguerite Davis identified a fat-soluble nutrient in <b>butterfat</b> and cod liver oil. Their work confirmed that of Thomas Osborne and Lafayette Mendel, at Yale, which suggested a fat-soluble nutrient in <b>butterfat,</b> also in 1913. Vitamin A1 was first synthesized in 1947 by two Dutch chemists, David Adriaan van Dorp and Jozef Ferdinand Arens.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{butter is}} about 80% <b>butterfat</b> and 15% water; {{traditionally}} made butter may have {{as little as}} 65% fat and 30% water. <b>Butterfat</b> {{is a mixture of}} triglyceride, a triester derived from glycerol and three of any of several fatty acid groups. Butter becomes rancid when these chains break down into smaller components, like butyric acid and diacetyl. The density of butter is 0.911g/cm3 (0.527oz/in3), about the same as ice.|$|E
25|$|Clarified {{butter is}} butter with {{almost all of}} its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure <b>butterfat.</b> Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting <b>butterfat</b> is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{had to be}} {{processed}} to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a goatskin or clay container to separate the <b>butterfat</b> from the whey. The <b>butterfat</b> was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make clarified butter, which could then be stored for a long time. Clarified butter was used principally for cooking and frying. Butter churns have been excavated at Beersheba, dating from the 4th century BCE, and other ancient Israelite sites.|$|E
25|$|Freezing of {{milk can}} cause fat globule {{aggregation}} upon thawing, resulting in milky layers and <b>butterfat</b> lumps. These can be dispersed again by warming and stirring the milk. It {{can change the}} taste by destruction of milk-fat globule membranes, releasing oxidized flavors.|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{made from}} cows' milk, butter {{can also be}} manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt such as dairy salt, flavorings and preservatives are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter produces clarified butter or ghee, which is almost entirely <b>butterfat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whipped cream {{may also}} be made in a {{whipping}} siphon, typically using nitrous oxide as the gas, as carbon dioxide tends to give a sour taste. The siphon may have replaceable cartridges or be sold as a pre-pressurized retail package. The gas dissolves in the <b>butterfat</b> under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.|$|E
25|$|Butter is {{used for}} sautéing and frying, {{although}} its milk solids brown and burn above 150°C (250°F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The smoke point of <b>butterfat</b> is around 200°C (400°F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying. Ghee {{has always been a}} common frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or religious reasons.|$|E
25|$|Milk is an {{emulsion}} or colloid of <b>butterfat</b> globules {{within a}} water-based fluid that contains dissolved carbohydrates and protein aggregates with minerals. Because it is produced {{as a food}} source for the young, all of its contents provide benefits for growth. The principal requirements are energy (lipids, lactose, and protein), biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids supplied by proteins (essential amino acids and amino groups), essential fatty acids, vitamins and inorganic elements, and water.|$|E
25|$|Dunlop cattle are {{supposed}} to have originated here or within the parish, bred by J. Dunlop of that Ilk from improved stock from Holland, in around 1550 to 1700 or later. J. Dunlop of Titwood is said to have first bred 'Ayrshire Cows' at one of his home farms. The breed, also known as Cunninghame or Ayrshire cattle are pied, white and brown, short in leg, long in the horn, straight in the back: the bulls are fiery in temper and the cows are peculiarly placid and docile. They produce milk which is very high in <b>butterfat</b> and ideal for cheese-making. The milk has a high protein content but is relatively homogenous.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, Briarcliff Farms was milking nearly 500 cows at {{any given}} time. The farm raised its own stock, feeding the cattle eight pounds of dry feed twice a day with pasture and green corn in summer. The feed mixture was 50 percent bran, 25 percent crushed oats and 25 percent cornmeal, {{all of which were}} claimed to be the best available. The farm {{required}} that each cow produce 6,000 pounds of milk with 5 percent <b>butterfat</b> or 5,000 pounds of milk with 6 percent <b>butterfat,</b> or she would be butchered or sold. Each cow ate an average of seven pounds of grain per day (varying from two pounds on pasture to 12 in winter), 1.5 to 2 pounds of oil meal each day and free-choice timothy and clover hay— daily, depending on size. Each worker milked, cleaned and groomed 16 to 18 cattle daily. The New York Milk Commission analyzed the farm's milk weekly; although the board of health regulations in New York allowed threemillion bacteria per cubic centimeter in milk, the milk commission limited bacteria to 30,000. The farm chilled its milk within two minutes of milking to , often limiting its bacteria counts to 200–400 per cc. A chemical analysis of the milk was performed every month; although regulations required a minimum of three percent <b>butterfat,</b> Briarcliff required its milk to have over five percent <b>butterfat</b> to be sold. A March 1905 New York Milk Commission analysis indicated that the farm's milk had 8.2 percent <b>butterfat,</b> the [...] "richest Briarcliff product ever reported on".|$|E
500|$|In 1993, an {{application}} {{was made for}} the name Cornish clotted cream to have a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in the European Union for cream produced by the traditional recipe in Cornwall. This was [...] accepted in 1998. Cornish clotted cream must be made from milk produced in Cornwall and have a minimum <b>butterfat</b> content of 55 percent. The unique, slightly yellow, Cornish clotted cream colour {{is due to the}} high carotene levels in the grass.|$|E
500|$|From 1947 to 1949, under a Walter and Eliza Hall Veterinary Research Fellowship, he {{attended}} the University of Cambridge from which he earned a doctor of philosophy. [...] His thesis, called Interrelationships between the digestive and mammary physiology of ruminants, was based on research he had conducted in 1947 in which he discovered that green oat consumption by dairy cows produced milk with less <b>butterfat.</b> [...] In the thesis, he explained how the complex interaction between environment, climate, soil, plant, and animal physiology and metabolism had combined to produce the lowered milkfat.|$|E
500|$|Common elands have a mild {{temperament}} {{and have been}} successfully domesticated for meat and milk production in South Africa and Russia. Their need for water is quite low because they produce urine with a high-urea content, but they require a substantial grazing area, along with salt licks and large amounts of supplementary foods like maize, sorghum, melons and beans which can be expensive. A female can produce up to [...] of milk per day that is richer in milkfat than cow milk. The pleasant-tasting milk has a <b>butterfat</b> content of 11-17% and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared, versus several days for cow milk.|$|E
500|$|The farm, one of {{the first}} {{producers}} of certified milk in the US, operated {{under the supervision of the}} Milk Commission of the Medical Society of the County of New York. With the farm producing about [...] of milk daily (an average of [...] per cow per day), Briarcliff Farms was {{one of the}} largest dairy operations in the northeast. According to Nebraska's department of agriculture in 1903, the three largest owners of dairy cows in the eastern US were Fairfield Farm Dairy in New Jersey, Briarcliff Farms and the Walker-Gordon Laboratory Company (which had [...] "branches in all of the principal cities"). In 1897 the farm had Jersey, Normande and Simmental cattle, selling the breeds' milk for 10, 12 and 15 cents per quart respectively. Briarcliff Farms also sold cream (with 50 percent <b>butterfat)</b> for 60 cents per quart, Jersey butter for 50 cents per pound and Normande or Simmental butter for 60 cents per pound. In 1909, half the farm's herd consisted of registered Jerseys and the other half high-grade Jerseys. In Pine Plains, many of Barn B's milkers were from the Netherlands because of that country's reputation for good milkers.|$|E
2500|$|All {{categories}} of butter {{are sold in}} both salted and unsalted forms. Either granular salt or a strong brine are added to salted butter during processing. In addition to enhanced flavor, the addition of salt acts as a preservative. The amount of <b>butterfat</b> in the finished product is a vital aspect of production. In the United States, products sold as [...] "butter" [...] must contain at least 80% <b>butterfat.</b> In practice, most American butters contain slightly more than that, averaging around 81% <b>butterfat.</b> European butters generally have a higher ratio—up to 85%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} of milk differs widely among species. Factors such as the type of protein; the proportion of protein, fat, and sugar; the levels of various vitamins and minerals; {{and the size of}} the <b>butterfat</b> globules, and the strength of the curd are among those that may vary. For example: ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1910, dietary fats {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} <b>butterfat,</b> beef tallow, and lard. During Napoleon's reign in France {{in the early}} 19th century, a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk; it did not gain acceptance in the United States. In the early 20th century, soybeans began to be imported into the United States {{as a source of}} protein; soybean oil was a by-product. What to do with that oil became an issue. At the same time, there was not enough <b>butterfat</b> available for consumers. The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered, and now the ingredients (soybeans) and the [...] "need" [...] (shortage of butter) were there. Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development. The fat industry found that hydrogenated fats provided some special features to margarines, which allowed margarine, unlike butter, to be taken out of the refrigerator and immediately spread on bread. By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat, such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard. Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace <b>butterfat.</b> Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and Spry, sold in England, began to replace butter and lard in the baking of bread, pies, cookies, and cakes in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|In high school, Pauling {{conducted}} chemistry experiments by scavenging {{equipment and}} material from an abandoned steel plant. With an older friend, Lloyd Simon, Pauling set up Palmon Laboratories in Simon's basement. [...] They approached local dairies offering to perform <b>butterfat</b> samplings at cheap prices but dairymen were wary of trusting two boys with the task, {{and the business}} ended in failure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some places}} in Europe, the fat content of crème fraîche is regulated, {{and it may}} not contain {{ingredients}} other than cream and starter culture. [...] In North America and the UK, products labeled [...] "low-fat crème fraîche", with about 15% <b>butterfat</b> and with added stabilizers such as xanthan gum or maize/corn starch are commercialized. It is less stable when heated.|$|E
2500|$|Crème fraîche (English {{pronunciation}} : , , lit. [...] "fresh cream") is a soured cream containing 10–45% <b>butterfat</b> {{and having}} a pH of around 4.5. It is soured with bacterial culture, but is less sour than U.S.-style sour cream, and has a lower viscosity and a higher fat content. [...] European labeling regulation disallows any ingredients other than cream and bacterial culture.|$|E
2500|$|Häagen-Dazs {{ice cream}} comes in several {{traditional}} flavors {{as well as}} several esoteric flavors that are specific to the brand, such as Vanilla Swiss Almond and Bananas Foster. It is marketed as a [...] "super-premium" [...] brand: it is quite dense (very little air is mixed in during manufacture), uses no emulsifiers or stabilizers other than egg yolks, and has a high <b>butterfat</b> content. It is sold both in grocery stores and in dedicated retail outlets serving ice cream cones, sundaes, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|The gas is {{extremely}} soluble in fatty compounds. In aerosol whipped cream, it is dissolved in the fatty cream until {{it leaves the}} can, when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam. Used in this way, it produces whipped cream four times {{the volume of the}} liquid, whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume. If air were used as a propellant, oxygen would accelerate rancidification of the <b>butterfat,</b> but nitrous oxide inhibits such degradation. Carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water, which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer-like [...] "sparkling" [...] sensation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{parts of}} {{northern}} Wisconsin, farmers cultivated cranberries {{and in a}} few counties in south central Wisconsin, farmers had success growing tobacco, but the most popular replacement for wheat was dairy farming. As wheat fell out of favor, many Wisconsin farmers started raising dairy cattle and growing feed crops, which were better suited to Wisconsin's climate and soil. One reason for the popularity of dairy farming was that many of Wisconsin's farmers had come to the state from New York, the leading producer of dairy products at the time. In addition, many immigrants from Europe brought an extensive knowledge of cheese making. Dairying was also promoted by the University of Wisconsin–Madison's school of agriculture, which offered education to dairy farmers and researched ways to produce better dairy products. The first test of <b>butterfat</b> content in milk was developed at the university, which allowed for consistency in the quality of butter and cheese. By 1899, over ninety percent of Wisconsin farms raised dairy cows and by 1915, Wisconsin had become the leading producer of dairy products in the United States, a position it held until the 1990s. The term America's Dairlyland appeared in newspapers as early as 1913 when the state's <b>butterfat</b> production became first in the nation. In 1939 the state legislature enacted a bill to add the slogan to the state's automobile license plates. It continues to be the nation's largest producer of cheese, no longer focusing on the raw material (milk) but rather the value-added products. Because of this, Wisconsin continues to promote itself as [...] "America's Dairyland", Wisconsinites are referred to as cheeseheads {{in some parts of the}} country, including Wisconsin, and foam cheesehead hats are associated with Wisconsin and its NFL team, the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
