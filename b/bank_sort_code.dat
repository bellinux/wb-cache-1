50|$|To {{avoid the}} {{processing}} fees, many businesses resorted to using direct debit, {{which is then}} called electronic direct debit (Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren, abbr. ELV). The point-of-sale terminal reads the <b>bank</b> <b>sort</b> <b>code</b> and account number from the card but instead of handling the transaction through the Girocard network it simply prints a form, which the customer signs to authorise the debit note. However, this method also avoids any verification or payment guarantee provided by the network. Further, customers can return debit notes by notifying their bank without giving a reason. This means that the beneficiary bears the risk of fraud and illiquidity. Some business mitigate the risk by consulting a proprietary blacklist or by switching to Girocard for higher transaction amounts.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{the initial}} digits of <b>bank</b> <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> are {{allocated}} to settlement {{members of the}} Cheque and Credit Clearing Company and the Belfast Bankers' Clearing Company. These numbers are six digits long, formatted into three pairs which are separated by hyphens.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} list {{shows the}} first two digits of the <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> allocated to clearing banks. Thus, in the example 01-10-01, 01 indicates that the bank is {{a branch of the}} National Westminster Bank; the other sets of digits are for internal use. This example represents the NatWest branch in Spring Gardens, Manchester. Clearing banks can act for other banks, so looking up a <b>bank</b> by <b>sort</b> <b>code</b> in this list does not always mean the account is actually handled by that <b>bank,</b> e.g. the <b>sort</b> <b>code</b> 08-32-00 HMRC VAT is not a Co-operative Bank account but a Citibank account, as is 08-32-10 for National Insurance.|$|R
50|$|The British and Irish <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> {{are only}} used for {{domestic}} money transfers. If {{money is being}} transferred across international borders, an international network is used. At the beginning of 2014 all European countries using the euro switched to the IBAN {{as a means of}} identifying bank accounts and previously used coding systems such as the BLZ, BIC and even account numbers are not in use anymore. However, transfers to, amongst others, the United States and Australia make use of the BIC Codes. Characters 9 to 14 of British and Irish IBANs hold the <b>bank</b> account <b>sort</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R

Someone then used these details to set up a £500 direct debit to the charity Diabetes UK.

50|$|<b>Sort</b> <b>codes,</b> in the British and Irish banking industries, are bank codes used {{to route}} money {{transfers}} between banks within their respective countries via their respective clearance organisations. In Ireland, a <b>sort</b> <b>code</b> {{is known as}} the NSC or National <b>Sort</b> <b>Code</b> and is regulated by IPSO (Irish Payment Services Organisation). Although <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> in both countries have the same format, they are regulated by different authorities as each country has its own banking system.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>sort</b> <b>code,</b> {{which is}} a six-digit number, is usually {{formatted}} as three pairs of numbers, for example 12-34-56. It identifies both the bank and the branch where the account is held. In some cases, the first digit of the <b>sort</b> <b>code</b> identifies the <b>bank</b> itself and in other cases the first 2 digits identify the bank. [...] Although {{there is a strong}} correlation between BIC <b>Codes</b> and <b>sort</b> <b>codes,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> are not explicitly encoded into BIC codes (although they are encoded into IBANs).|$|R

5000|$|When the six-digit <b>sort</b> <b>code</b> {{system was}} set up in the 1960s, numbers in the 70 range were {{reserved}} for the large number of London offices of banks which were not members of the London Clearing. Individual <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> within the range 70-00-00 to 70-99-99 were allocated on a one-off basis to the many London offices of private and foreign banks. Cheques drawn on these banks were colloquially known within the banking industry as [...] "walks" [...] because they were cleared by being hand-delivered ("walked") to the drawee banks by messengers from the Clearing House. By the 1990s, all these banks had been issued with <b>sort</b> <b>codes</b> within the ranges of the various clearing banks which, henceforth, acted as clearing agents for them.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThis thesis aims at {{developing}} a <b>sorting</b> <b>code</b> for Coulomb excitation studies at iThemba LABS. In Coulomb excitation reactions, the inelastic scattering of the projectile transfers {{energy to the}} partner nucleus (and vice-versa) through a time-dependent electromagnetic field. At energies well below the Coulomb barrier, the particles interact solely through the well known electromagnetic interaction, thereby excluding nuclear excitations from the process. The data can therefore be analyzed using a semiclassical approximation. The <b>sorting</b> <b>code</b> was used to process and analyze data acquired from the Coulomb excitation of 20 Ne beams at 73 and 96 MeV, onto a 194 Pt target. The detection of gamma rays was done using the AFRODITE HPGe clover detector array, which consists of nine clover detectors, in coincidence with the 20 Ne particles detected with an S 3 double-sided silicon detector. The new <b>sorting</b> <b>code</b> includes Doppler-correction effects, charge-sharing, energy and time conditions, kinematics and stopping powers, among others, {{and can be used}} for any particle-γ coincidence measurements at iThemba LABS. Results from other Coulomb excitation measurements at iThemba LABS will also be presented...|$|R
