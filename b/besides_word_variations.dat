30|$|In this study, {{we showed}} {{that the effects of}} NP weight on <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> are more {{complicated}} in Mandarin Chinese than what have been previously documented for other languages (English, Japanese, Korean, etc.). Specifically, both short-before-long and long-before-short tendencies were observed in <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> across the preverbal and postverbal domains. We interpret the current results as evidence for both conceptual and positional factors operating in Mandarin Chinese, especially in the preverbal domain. These findings contribute to the general understanding of the underlying mechanisms for <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> across languages.|$|R

40|$|Although {{researchers}} have recognised {{the importance of}} question wording in survey research for many years, the search for generalisable rules of question wording has proved elusive. This paper reports the results of four studies on question wording: a comparison of an open with a closed question on the same topic, a comparison of negative versus positive statements, a test of different question <b>wording</b> <b>variations,</b> and {{a test of the}} effect of one question on another. The conclusion reached is that, while it is possible to write the same question {{in a number of different}} ways, simply changing one word may change the whole meaning of a question. However, other questions are more resistant to <b>wording</b> <b>variations</b> and further research in this area may help distinguish between specific variations that affect question meaning and those that do not...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to analyze texts written by pupils during the {{national}} test in the subject Swedish for grade 9 in order to identify and illustrate how they have met the instructions for the writing task including genre. The texts have been analyzed using Palmér & Östlund-Stjärnegårdh’s (2005) model for student text analysis. This model has been supplemented by studying word and sentence length, as well as indexes for level of readability (LIX) and <b>word</b> <b>variation</b> (OVIX) in order to illustrate possible differences in a gender perspective. The results of this study are in line with previous research, as the girls’ texts are longer and more descriptive, while the boys’ texts are shorter and show a wider range of <b>word</b> <b>variation.</b> The pupils have succeeded in fulfilling the genre and have to a large extent met the task instructions, producing communicative and engaging writing. However, the results of the analysis would have further improved and developed the texts...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to show that}} not only {{syntactic}} representations {{play a role in the}} processing of <b>word</b> order <b>variations.</b> Variations of order affect not only the syntactic structure, but also hte information structure of a sentence.

[ [...] . ] Chapter 2 introduces linguistic theories which try to explain the abovementioned characteristics of <b>word</b> order <b>variations.</b> Syntactic as well as focus structural analyses are discussed. [ [...] . ] Chapter 3 gives an overview of language comprehension models. These models are discussed on the background of emprirical studies which investigated the processing of <b>word</b> order <b>variations.</b> A neurocognitive perspective on language processing is provided in Chapter 4. A neurophysiological method, the measuring of evetn-related brain potentials (ERPs), and a neurocognitive model of language comprehension are described. this chapter also discusses studies using the described method for the investigation of <b>word</b> order <b>variations.</b> Chapter 5, the first experimental part of the thesis, includes three reading studies which look into hte processing of <b>word</b> order <b>variations</b> with different DP types.

3000|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> in Mandarin Chinese (hereafter “Mandarin” for short). Specifically, {{we focus on}} the {{alternation}} between SVO and SOV word orders in the language, and whether (and how) it is conditioned by NP weight. The reason we choose to investigate Mandarin is twofold. First and foremost, same as Hungarian, Mandarin allows <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> both in the postverbal domain and across the preverbal-postverbal domains. While typically a SVO language (Sun and Givón 1985), Mandarin allows a grammaticalized ba construction that puts object NP before the verb, resulting in an optional SOV word order. Second, Mandarin presents an unusual combination of (typically) head-initial VPs and head-final NPs, which is rarely observed across languages (Matthews and Yeung 2000). Importantly, this property distinguishes Mandarin from both Japanese (with head-final VP and head-final NP) and English (with head-initial VP and head-initial NP) in a critical aspect (i.e., headedness) for both theoretical accounts. Given the mixed headedness of Mandarin, what will production-oriented and comprehension-oriented accounts predict for NP weight effects in <b>word</b> order <b>variation?</b> [...]...|$|R

30|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} the cross-linguistic difference proposed by Chang and colleagues {{may be related to}} the difference between the preverbal domain and the postverbal domain. A critical difference between the two languages is that <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> takes place in the preverbal domain in Japanese but in the postverbal domain in English. Since the preverbal area is closer to the beginning of the sentence, where phrasal order is in general more sensitive to semantic and pragmatic factors such as topic status, animacy, and concreteness (Mcdonald et al. 1993), it is possible that <b>word</b> order <b>variation</b> in the preverbal domain—as it occurs in Japanese—is more sensitive to meaning than form.|$|R
