5|$|Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola {{took over}} Frank Rijkaard's duties at the {{conclusion}} of the season. Guardiola <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them different customs from distant regions. The inventories of gifts presented to deities from the royal palace indicate that Qatna used the sexagesimal numeral system.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Nero then {{appointed}} Vespasian to {{put down}} the rebellion, who landed in Judaea with fifth and tenth legions in 67. He was later joined by his son Titus at Ptolemais, who <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across Galilee and by 69 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Groups of Hasidic Jews from Eastern Europe began {{establishing}} {{communities in}} the late 18th century, and <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them their traditional Ashkenazi cuisine, developing, however, distinct local variations, notably a peppery, caramelized noodle pudding known as kugel yerushalmi.|$|E
5|$|Immigrants to Israel have {{incorporated}} {{elements of the}} cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came. During approximately fifty years before 1948, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration, which <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them {{a whole range of}} foods and cooking styles. Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels, while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes, such as schmaltz herring and vorschmack (gehakte herring).|$|E
5|$|In 1977 (before the Yellow Jackets {{had even}} joined the ACC), this {{football}} series was {{being considered for}} termination by the administration of Georgia Tech. Clemson football fans, {{in an effort to}} show their economic impact on the Atlanta, Ga., area, <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them to Atlanta large stockpiles of two-dollar bills that were stamped with Clemson Tiger Paws.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a wave of}} Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> {{them the}} kadans, a {{sophisticated}} form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century German {{immigrants}} <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them Riesling vines, named Johannisberg Riesling to qualify them as “legitimate” German Riesling. New York, particularly in the Finger Lakes region, was one of the earliest U.S. producers of Riesling. Plantings started to appear in California by 1857 and followed in Washington State in 1871.|$|E

5|$|People {{from small}} {{villages in the}} hills near Genova, Italy {{were among the first}} to settle {{permanently}} in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The Orel <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> it 40 men, 2-machine guns, and a doctor. Within 15 {{minutes of}} its arrival, the Russians were {{preparing}} {{for military action}} {{at the end of}} the railway line in the northern part of Singapore to intercept any fleeing mutineers. The Russians were successful in capturing an estimated 180 mutineers. The Russians had also engaged in heavy gun battle with the mutineers on the night of 25th February.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|According to news reports, {{the first}} {{passenger}} trains {{left the city}} at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General W. S. Hancock arrived and was followed by 360–400 federal troops from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them two 12 pounder artillery pieces. From that point on, {{the men of the}} 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> it {{the requirement for}} boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{was married}} to Hipparete, the {{daughter}} of Hipponicus, a wealthy Athenian. His bride <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades' already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she attempted to divorce him because he consorted with courtesans but he dragged her away from her court appearance. She lived with him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son, Alcibiades the Younger. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical attractiveness, {{of which he was}} inordinately vain.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{was one of}} {{the first}} native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which {{resulted}} in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E
5|$|Antemoro {{villages are}} {{primarily}} clustered {{in the southeastern}} coastal area near Vohipeno and Manakara. Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories: the mpanombily (or tompomenakely), who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca, and the menakely, composed of the working and slave classes, who {{were said to have}} descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs' rule, or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> them. The mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others. Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus, who had <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> him a large {{force of}} 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly {{had threatened to}} oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E
