50|$|During the 2004 repainting, {{engineers}} {{discovered that}} the pier 3 bearings (east side of navigation channel) had displaced roughly 11 inches east of their original location {{as a result of}} unexpected movement of that pier (west) towards the main river channel. Hennepin County contracted with Wiss, Janey, Elstner and Associates (WJE) to investigate and report on the cause and extent of damage. The consultant's report concluded that evidence suggested the pier underwent many years, perhaps 50, of creep deflection due to sustained lateral earth pressure at the foundation which was held in check by the <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> ultimate strength was finally overcome sometime in 2004 which allowed the unrestrained and rapid movement of the pier.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research into reliability calculations of agriculture double universal joint shafts based on temperature measuring in cardan-type universal joint <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Special laboratory equipment {{was developed for}} this research which {{is presented in the}} paper.

If the presented research were used along with maintenance measures recommended in the paper and with proper use, the level of reliability of the shafts would be 2. 1 times higher. The presented results of the research showed that needle bearings, i. e. <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> of the joints, are the most critical elements on universal joint shafts and are possible causes of their lower reliability.

5000|$|A {{tear down}} {{examination}} of the right hand engine revealed that the [...] "thrust bearing of right engine was improperly assembled during last overhaul at DART Engine Shop PIAC in September 2005." [...] The thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> had been turning eccentric while being assembled and thus was orbiting instead of an ideal rotation. The resulting imbalance caused reverse bending loads on the bolt heads of the <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> resulting in the failure of one bolt head, which created even more stresses and caused the bearing housing to open after the next 5 bolts had failed. The rotor assembly of the turbine increased its radii of orbit and caused the turbine rotor to free itself and move forward resulting in the turbine discs and blades to experience heavy rubbing, the turbine blades failed due to resulting thermal stresses and broke away.

50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|E

The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation.|$|E

50|$|A similar-looking kind {{of damage}} is called false {{brinelling}} and {{is caused by}} fretting wear. This occurs when contacting bodies vibrate {{against each other in}} the presence of very small loads, which pushes lubricant out of the contact surface area, and the <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> cannot move far enough to redistribute the displaced lubricant. The result is a finely polished surface that resembles a brinell mark, but has not permanently deformed either contacting surface. This type of false brinelling usually occurs in bearings during transportation, between the time of manufacture and installation. The polished surfaces are often mistaken for brinelling, although no actual damage to the bearing exists. The false brinelling will disappear after a short break-in period of operation.|$|E

40|$|In Port Aransas, TX, movable bridges, ferry ramps, {{are used}} to dock ferry boats and load {{vehicles}} on and off of the boats to cross the Corpus Christie, TX ship channel as part of State Highway 361. Fatigue cracks are present {{in several of the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> that attach the ramps to the headwall at the ferry landing.

The recorded data from the instrumentation was accessed remotely from Texas A&M University in College Station and analyzed using MatLAB, Mathematica, and Microsoft Excel. Load data was collected for several months. The information was used to develop recommendations for design loads to be used when the <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> are rebuilt. Results indicate that the exterior beams of the ramps experience the largest force values in compression caused by docking and thrusting of the ferry boats.

50|$|The {{operating}} environment and service needs {{are also important}} design considerations. Some bearing assemblies require routine addition of lubricants, while others are factory sealed, requiring no further maintenance {{for the life of}} the mechanical assembly. Although seals are appealing, they increase friction, and in a permanently sealed bearing the lubricant may become contaminated by hard particles, such as steel chips from the race or bearing, sand, or grit that gets past the seal. Contamination in the lubricant is abrasive and greatly reduces the operating life of the <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly.</b> Another major cause of bearing failure is the presence of water in the lubrication oil. Online water-in-oil monitors have been introduced in recent years to monitor the effects of both particles and the presence of water in oil and their combined effect.|$|E
