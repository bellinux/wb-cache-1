500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To turn my <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E
500|$|At 13, he {{enrolled}} in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school. [...] When {{he was in the}} eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students. [...] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> moment, he said, [...] "There was just something neat about the machine." [...] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

2500|$|Around 1928, Tudor was {{in contact}} with the young {{religious}} scholar Mircea Eliade, who was becoming an exponent of experimental neo-traditionalism in Romanian philosophy. Both were influenced by Nae Ionescu, the theologian and logician, theorist of an eclectic ideology known as Trăirism. Looking <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> period in his 1980s memoirs, Eliade wrote: [...] "I met often with Stelian Mateescu, Paul Sterian, Mircea Vulcănescu, and Sandu Tudor. Together we planned a journal of religious philosophy, for which Tudor had found a title: Duh și Slovă (Spirit and Letter)." [...] The magazine, described by Eliade as a would-be successor of Ionescu's mystical journal Logos, never saw print.|$|E

For ten years the couple lived the idle life of upper-class Italians, which Sage later {{described}} as “a stagnant swamp.” She looked <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> time as years that she simply “threw away to the crows.

We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California."

2500|$|The book {{begins in}} the spring of 1942 as Takei and his family are on a train {{traveling}} towards the Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas. Takei recounts the four years his family spent in Japanese American internment, his experiences there, and the aftermath of those experiences. The book also provides background and research into the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were interned in similar camps. Takei's parents were identified as [...] "disloyals", and sent to the maximum security Tule Lake War Relocation Center in northern California. Takei's family left Tule Lake in 1946 and he describes their tough time readjusting to life after being in the internment camps. He excelled in his early studies and skipped the third grade. He recounts an incident from fourth grade where the teacher referred to him as [...] "that little Jap boy", and the emotions he still carries looking <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> event.|$|E

When Bragg's army fell <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> city, Jackson's brigade was assigned to Major General Benjamin F. Cheatham's division of Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk's corps.
