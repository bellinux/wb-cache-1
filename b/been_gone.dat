5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> for less than a minute Barbara claims he had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|When Sandoz {{returns to}} Earth, {{his friends are}} dead, and his faith, once {{considered}} worthy of actual canonization by his superiors, is merely an extension of his bitter anger with the God who sent him to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has <b>been</b> <b>gone,</b> during which popular outrage at the UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. As Sandoz painfully explains what really happened, his personal healing begins, but only time will prove whether {{the same is true}} of the Society of Jesus.|$|E

25|$|After more staff turnover, McTavish again {{returned}} as head writer. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, {{which included the}} controversial rape of Bianca. Gone upon McTavish's latest return was Jean Dadario Burke as executive producer, being replaced with Julie Hanan Carruthers. Under McTavish, ratings fluctuated back and forth. To lure back long-time viewers, McTavish created new characters and romances, as well as scripted the return of various characters who had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> for long. She introduced star-crossed couple JR Chandler and Babe Carey upon writing JR's return to the series, scripted most of popular pairing Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone's love story, and created fellow popular couple Zach Slater and Kendall Hart. Characters Julia Santos (Sydney Penny) and Janet Dillon (Kate Collins, who was originally slated to return for a brief stint) were eventually brought back.|$|E
25|$|At about 6:30p.m., when Meade {{learned more}} about the {{location}} of Pickett's and Sheridan's forces, he ordered Warren to send his relief column down the Boydton Plank Road, but Bartlett had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> too long to be easily recalled. Warren sent three regiments that Bartlett had detached to guard artillery and wagons down the Boydton Plank Road under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson and reported this to Meade. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been broken down by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan. Meade told Warren to have his entire force ready to move. By 9:17p.m., Warren was ordered {{to withdraw from the}} line and send a division to Sheridan at once.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates {{about what will happen}} if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, moose are {{currently}} found {{in large numbers}} throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, with more modest numbers in the southern Czech Republic, Belarus and northern Ukraine. They are also widespread through Russia on up through the borders with Finland south towards the border with Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine and stretching far away eastwards to the Yenisei River in Siberia. The European moose was native to most temperate areas with suitable habitat on the continent and even Scotland {{from the end of}} the last Ice Age, as Europe had a mix of temperate boreal and deciduous forest. Up through Classical times, the species was certainly thriving in both Gaul and Magna Germania, as it appears in military and hunting accounts of the age. However, as the Roman era faded into medieval times, the beast slowly disappeared: soon after the reign of Charlemagne, the moose disappeared from France, where its range extended from Normandy in the north to the Pyrenees in the south. Farther east, it survived in Alsace and the Netherlands until the 9th century as the marshlands in the latter were drained and the forests were cleared away for feudal lands in the former. It was gone from Switzerland by the year 1000, gone from the western Czech Republic by 1300, gone from Mecklenburg in Germany by c. 1600, and has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> from Hungary and the Caucasus since the 18th and 19th century, respectively.|$|E

500|$|The {{synopsis}} for {{the episode}} reads [...] "Sherlock has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> for two years. But someone isn't quite convinced that he's dead." [...] The 'someone' {{turns out to}} be Anderson, the forensics technician from series 1 and 2 (who has now lost his job due to his obsessive conviction that the detective still lives). He had a long-standing mistrust of Sherlock, yet {{is now one of the}} few people who believes Sherlock is alive, and throughout the episode is trying to convince Lestrade. Anderson tracks him via various mysterious events from Tibet to New Delhi to Germany in which he seems to be involved and points out that the incidents are getting progressively closer to London.|$|E

[...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for {{there is so much to}} do right where he is.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thompson of NPR Music was {{disappointed}} with the music video because it [...] "undercuts its message to an alarming degree: The words say 'Since you've <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> / I can breathe for the first time,' but the pictures say, 'Breaking up with you necessitates destroying all of your property.'" [...] At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the music video received nominations for three awards; it won Best Female Video and Best Pop Video, and received a nomination for the Viewer's Choice Awards but lost to Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams". MusicOMH ranked the music video as the 86th best video of the last decade. In February 2012, the music video received a Pop-Up Video treatment by VH1 which shows [...] "pops up" [...] bubbles containing trivia, witticisms and borderline sexual innuendos throughout the video.|$|E

500|$|While still {{detained}} by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in {{questions in the}} House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the [...] "matter has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon which we could take action". Two months later George Orwell wrote the essay [...] "In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse", where he stated that [...] "it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity". Orwell's rationale was that Wodehouse's [...] "moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, {{and according to the}} public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins", which was compounded by his [...] "complete lack—so far as one can judge from his printed works—of political awareness".|$|E
