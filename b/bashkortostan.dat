25|$|Northern Tatarstan and <b>Bashkortostan</b> were {{in ancient}} times areas of {{settlement}} of the Udmurt people. Many Udmurt villages are divided in these two republics. Over the centuries Udmurts there were subjected to enforced Islamisation by the dominating Tatars and Bashkirs, but they preserved strong national consciousness and Pagan faith. In recent times pan-Udmurt worship services have taken place annually in <b>Bashkortostan,</b> {{and they have been}} subject of repression by Muslim authorities.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Kazan, territories such as Udmurtia and <b>Bashkortostan</b> joined Russia without a conflict. The {{administration}} of the khanate was wiped out; pro-Moscow and neutral nobles kept their lands, but others were executed. Tatars were then resettled far away from rivers, roads and Kazan. Free lands were settled by Russians and sometimes by pro-Russian Tatars. Orthodox bishops such as Germogen forcibly baptized many Tatars.|$|E

Tatar is also considered to have been the official language in the short-lived Idel-Ural State, briefly formed during the Russian Civil War. However, that Bolshevist Russia did not recognize official languages as such; however, {{there were a number of}} languages that could be used in trial in some republics.

The Western Tatars have their capital in the town of Qasím (Kasimov in Russian transcription) in Ryazan Oblast, with a Tatar population of 1100. A minority of Christianized Volga Tatars are known as Keräşens.|$|E
25|$|In 1235 four Dominican friars, {{among them}} Friar Julian, left the kingdom {{to find a}} Hungarian group whose {{ancestors}} had remained somewhere in the East in the 9thcentury. Julian met them in modern <b>Bashkortostan</b> (Russia) where he also learnt of the danger exposed by the expanding Mongol Empire. The Mongol armies set out for Hungary {{in the spring of}} 1241, and incited a disastrous defeat to the royal army at Muhi. In the battle both Hungarian archbishops perished, along with other prelates and barons. Contemporary sources, among them Roger of Torre Maggiore, depict the utter desolation and destruction inflicted by the Mongols. All of the forty monasteries that are known to have disappeared at this time lay in the area affected by the invaders.|$|E
500|$|If the Magyars' {{original}} homeland {{was situated}} in Western Siberia, {{instead of being}} identical with Magna Hungaria, their ancestors moved from Western Siberia to Eastern Europe.

500|$|According to a {{scholarly}} theory, {{the name of}} at least one Magyar tribe, Gyarmat, is connected to the name of a Bashkir group, Yurmatï. Specific burial ritesthe use of death masks and the placing of parts of horses into the gravesfeaturing a 9th- or 10th-century cemetery at the confluence of the Volga and Kama near present-day Bolshie Tigany in <b>Bashkortostan</b> are also evidenced among the Magyars who lived in the Carpathian Basin in the [...] Most specialists say that the cemetery at Bolshie Tigany was used by Magyars who either remained in Magna Hungaria when other Magyar groups left the territory, or who moved there from other regions which were inhabited by the Magyars during their migrations.|$|E
500|$|In the 1230s, Friar Julian went {{to search}} for the Magyars' legendary {{homeland}} Magna Hungaria after reading about it and a group of Magyars who had remained there in a Hungarian chronicle. He met a Hungarian-speaking group [...] "beside the great Etil river" [...] (the Volga or the Kama) {{in the land of the}} Volga Bulgars, in or in the wider region of present-day <b>Bashkortostan</b> in Eastern Europe. Whether Magna Hungaria was the original homeland of the Magyars, or whether the Magyars' ancestors settled in Magna Hungaria after their migration to Europe from their Western Siberian original homeland is still subject to scholarly debates. According to a third scholarly theory, Magna Hungaria was neither the Magyars' original homeland nor their first homeland in Europe. Instead, the ancestors of the Eastern Magyars whom Friar Julian met had moved to Magna Hungaria from the south.|$|E
