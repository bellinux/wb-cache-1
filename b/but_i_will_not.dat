We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

I will not say of my brother {{that he may be}} a traitor," [...] but I will say, [...] "Produce what you have. I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay. I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth, and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny"—will you not agree that a society which has lost sight of that, cannot survive? ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what was coming, and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E

500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is my religion. It's my moral framework. I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He has not worked with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government. In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E
2500|$|January 23, 2006 - As returns {{indicate}} that the Liberals had lost the 2006 federal election to Stephen Harper's Conservatives, Prime Minister Paul Martin concedes the election and announces his intention to resign as Liberal party leader. In his concession speech, held {{in the early hours}} of the morning (EST), he states: [...] "I will continue to represent with pride the people of LaSalle—Émard, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> take our party into another election as leader".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 24, 2006, after {{it became clear}} that the Conservatives were on their way to a plurality, Martin conceded defeat. (Near the end of the 2004 election, Martin and Harper both pledged that they would not form a {{government}} unless they won a plurality of seats.) [...] Martin surprised many by announcing his resignation as party leader, saying [...] "I will continue to represent with pride the people of LaSalle—Émard, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> take our party into another election as leader." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the wave}} of {{deportation}} had reached, and swept over, the neighboring towns and was threatening Aintab, Dr. Shepard made a strong appeal to the Vali [...] of the province of Aleppo, and this official, who was a righteous man, firmly prevented the action being carried out. Another righteous man of another town refused to send out the innocent people of his city, saying, [...] "You may deport me and my family, if you will, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> carry out these orders." [...] He was soon removed from his post. The righteous Vali of Aleppo, too, was sent away, and the fiendish work ordered against the [...] "Christian nation" [...] still went on.|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{if he had}} any regrets, he said: [...] "If I {{had seen}} the banking crisis coming.

[...] On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that not once did anyone or any delegation that came in to see me ever say, ‘Watch out for Anglo’ ... I wish they had have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise {{that it would have been}} better if some things had been done differently, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> denigrate the good that has been done," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1536, Luther's prince, Elector of Saxony John Frederick, {{issued a}} mandate that {{prohibited}} Jews from inhabiting, engaging in business in, or passing through his realm. An Alsatian shtadlan, Rabbi Josel of Rosheim, asked a reformer, Wolfgang Capito, to approach Luther {{in order to}} obtain an audience with the prince, but Luther refused every intercession. In response to Josel, Luther referred to his unsuccessful attempts to convert the Jews: [...] "... I would willingly do my best for your people <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> contribute to your [...] obstinacy by my own kind actions. You must find another intermediary with my good lord." [...] Heiko Oberman notes this event as significant in Luther's attitude toward the Jews: [...] "Even today this refusal is often judged to be the decisive turning point in Luther's career from friendliness to hostility toward the Jews;" [...] yet, Oberman contends that Luther would have denied any such [...] "turning point". Rather he felt that Jews were to be treated in a [...] "friendly way" [...] in order to avoid placing unnecessary obstacles in their path to Christian conversion, a genuine concern of Luther.|$|E

2500|$|Ion Antonescu and his {{subordinates}} were for long {{divided on the}} issue of the Final Solution, as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the RSHA's direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy with reference to Soviet Jews. In various of his early 1940s statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory. The unrestrained character of some Romanian actions toward Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination. When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding [...] "eastern Jews". In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: [...] "As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> rest or be idle until we too have gone all the way with the Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circle}} of her own court, she was {{surrounded}} by sympathizers of the Hats. Her favorite Henrika Juliana von Liewen was a prominent sympathizer of the Hats, as was Claes Ekeblad, Hans Henrik von Liewen, Anders Johan von Höpken {{and other members of}} her personal circle of friends, and through her court connections, she made an alliance with the Hats (party). Her strategy was to affect the votes in the parliament of the Riksdag through bribes. After the birth of her eldest son in 1746, she accompanied the crown prince on an official tour through the country, during which she gathered agents among members of the Caps through bribes. At the visit of the Cap's parliamentary Kalsenius, she described him as: [...] "The biggest villain in the world, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> leave until I have bribed him. That is the only means by which one can reach the goal one has in mind." [...] Kalsenius is also confirmed to have voted with the Hats party in the exactly the issues interesting to Louisa Ulrika during the votes in the Riksdag. Her goal was to overthrow the constitution and reintroduce the system of absolute monarchy with enlightened absolutism in Sweden. Her plans were internationally noted already by her creation of the L'Ordre de l'Harmonie, with the motto of unity. Her plans were opposed by Russia and Great Britain, who in 1746, allied with the Caps (party), attempted to stage a coup through their agents in Sweden against the royal house.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{controversy}} of {{the later}} Chrétien years was the Sponsorship Scandal, which involved more than $100million distributed from the Prime Minister's Office to Quebec's federalist and Liberal Party interests without much accountability. On May 8, 2002, the Sponsorship scandal broke when the Auditor-General, Sheila Fraser, issued a report accusing Public Works bureaucrats of having broken [...] "just about every rule in the book" [...] in awarding $1.6million to the Montreal ad firm Groupaction Marketing Inc. The money awarded to Groupaction in three dubious contracts appeared to have disappeared, and the firm {{had a long history}} of donating to the Liberals. Opposition critics further suggested that the Public Works minister at the time, Alfonso Gagliano, whom Chrétien had praised as a great patriot, was not just a mere by-stander to questionable contacts associated with the sponsorship program that Fraser had identified. In response to the public outrage, Chrétien argued in speech in Winnipeg that all this was necessary to stop Quebec separatism and justified by the results, stating that: [...] "Perhaps there was a few million dollars that might have been stolen in the process. It is possible. But how many millions of dollars have we saved the country because we have re-established the stability of Canada as an united country? If somebody has stolen the money, they will face the courts. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> apologize to Canadians." [...] Chrétien's argument that he had nothing to apologize for in regards to the sponsorship program, and his apparent condoning of corruption as justified by the results of saving Canada fared poorly with the Canadian public, which increasingly started to perceive the Prime Minister as an autocratic leader with a thuggish streak. A poll taken later in May 2002 showed that over half of Canadians believed that the Chrétien government was corrupt.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
