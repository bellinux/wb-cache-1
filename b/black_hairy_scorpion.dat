40|$|Abstract Introduction Linezolid-induced <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue {{has been}} rarely reported. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to report a case of linezolid-induced <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue and review the literature. Case {{presentation}} A 56 -year-old Caucasian man was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia that failed to respond to levofloxacin 750 mg daily. He was started on linezolid and meropenem and was subsequently discharged home on oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours and intravenous ertapenem 1 g daily. On a follow-up clinic visit, day 14 of linezolid therapy, he complained of dysgeusia and his tongue examination was consistent with <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue. After he finished his antibiotic course, his complaints resolved with regular tongue brushing. Conclusion <b>Black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue is characterized by abnormal hypertrophy and elongation of filiform papillae. Five reported cases of linezolid-induced <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue were identified in a MEDLINE search (from January 2000 to June 2012). The Naranjo Probability Scale revealed a probable adverse drug reaction of linezolid-induced <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue. Potential contributing factors included other antibiotics, drug–drug interaction and poor oral hygiene. Health care professionals should be aware of the possibility of linezolid-induced <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue. Thorough history for other possible contributing factors should be obtained. Patients on linezolid should be counseled to perform good oral hygiene. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction:  Black hairy tongue {{occurs as}} a result of {{inability}} desquamation and hyperthrophy of filiforme papilla on the dorsum of the tongue which also cause as the creation of velvety plaques. Case Presentation:  Four patients with <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue who were referred to our clinic with different complaints were presented as cases. Discussion: Although the etiopathogenesis of the <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> louse is not completely known, many predisposing factors have been proposed. Prevention of triggering factors, the regulation of food and water, mechanical cleaning of the language is important in the treatment of <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue. Medical treatment includes antiseptic solutions, topical tretinoin. Conclusion:  Family physicians should consider that in first-stage smokers patients may rarely develop <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> language...|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{known as}} the black-back scorpion, it can be {{differentiated}} from the giant desert <b>hairy</b> <b>scorpion</b> by its completely black prosoma or cephalothorax. This scorpion is quite nervous and can display aggressiveness towards its keeper. It should not be kept communally, as fights and cannibalism are frequent. The toxicity of its venom is usually deemed to be low, though its sting can be quite painful. This scorpion and its close relative Hadrurus arizonensis make good pets for a beginner, as they are quite large, very active and typically eat a lot.|$|R

25|$|<b>Black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue (BHT, also termed lingua villosa nigra) {{refers to}} a {{condition}} of the tongue where the filiform papillae elongate with black or brown discoloration, giving a <b>black</b> and <b>hairy</b> appearance.

Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue.|$|R
2500|$|Hairy tongue (lingua villosa) {{refers to}} a marked {{accumulation}} of keratin on the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue, giving a hair-like appearance.

[...] However, the elongated papillae of hairy tongue usually develop discoloration due to growth of pigment producing bacteria and staining from food. Hence the term <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue, although hairy tongue may also be discolored yellow or brown. Transient, surface discoloration that is not associated with hairy tongue can be brushed off.

Dermoscopic features of a <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue have never been reported. Dermoscopy might be useful in speculating pathologic features of oral lesions. The objective was to identify additional dermoscopic criteria. Two Japanese patients who were clinically given a diagnosis of “black hairy tongue ” were evaluated for dermoscopic features. We have shown characteristic dermoscopic features of brownish hair-like elongation of filiform papillae with whitish lingual papillae. Dermoscopic examination seemed useful {{as an adjunct to}} the diagnosis of this benign disorder of the tongue, demonstrating exact changes in shape and color of filiform papillae. It might also be helpful in more objective observation of the therapeutic efficacy. <b>Black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue is a benign disorder characterized by hypertrophy of the filiform papillae of the tongue and is usually asymptomatic. A common clinical feature of a <b>black</b> <b>hairy</b> tongue is brownish-black discoloration caused by variety of precipitating factors, such as chronic smoking, poor oral hygiene, tooth loss, chronic or extensive use of antibiotics, and radiation therapy to the head and neck...|$|R
