5000|$|However, silicon {{has several}} {{drawbacks}} {{as an alternative}} to carbon. Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms. Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as [...] "monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules". This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger mass and atomic radius, and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double bonded carbon is part of the carbonyl group, a fundamental motif of <b>bio-organic</b> <b>chemistry).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Westheimer's diverse {{interests}} led {{him through}} many paths in chemistry and politics. He was highly regarded, creative, and rigorous. His combined abilities in diverse areas {{made him an}} authoritative presence in any discussion. It is especially valuable to read proceedings of conferences (such as the Welch Foundation Conference on <b>Bio-Organic</b> <b>Chemistry,</b> 1971) in which transcripts of his comments are presented, {{to get a good}} idea of his approach. His demeanor of projecting a pessimistic outcome, while hoping for the best, earned him the sobriquet [...] "Black Frank" [...] among students. While he possessed a fine sense of humor, his ability to project a prediction of the worst possible outcome dominated how he was perceived. The attitude enabled him to question results with care and accept outcomes based on fact rather than hope. His approach to research involved attention to the key details that provide solutions to problems, while his papers remain engaging examples of clarity in scientific reporting.|$|E
