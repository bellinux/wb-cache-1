500|$|Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later {{admitted}} that financial mistakes were made: [...] "We did our best; {{some people have}} said it wasn't good enough. That's easy to say with 20/20 hindsight <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> there were no rules. We were making it up as we went along." ...|$|E
2500|$|This rule {{by itself}} is very puzzling since {{it looks like it}} could be used without bothering with fuzzy logic, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the {{decision}} is based on a set of rules: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>BUT</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> real 2-D {{crystals}} such as graphene {{exist in}} 3-D. The reciprocal lattice of a 2-D hexagonal sheet {{that exists in}} 3-D space in the [...] plane [...] is a hexagonal array of lines parallel to the [...] or [...] axis that extend to [...] and intersect any plane of constant [...] in a hexagonal array of points.|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} to answer in the affirmative, <b>but</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> I had no certain knowledge, so I {{corrected}} myself.|$|R
60|$|The blood {{rose to the}} girl's face, <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> {{the major}} {{occasionally}} displayed some little penetration she contrived to keep silent, though this {{was by no means}} easy. Coulthurst, however, nodded.|$|R
6000|$|I was indignant for a moment; <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> {{anger was}} out of the question, and that I had indeed {{appeared}} as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness-- ...|$|R
2500|$|In Either/Or, Kierkegaard {{insists that}} the single {{individual}} has ethical responsibility of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics {{gets in the way}} of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an [...] "eternal happiness", or the salvation of the soul as the highest good. He says, be whatever you want, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> your soul belongs to God, not to the world.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even if {{what he did}} {{were the}} right thing to do, this was not the way to do it." [...] "The {{surrender}} might have been necessary: the cant was not. Any statesman with a sense of honour would at least have stilled that hysterical cheering and said: My friends, for the present, we are out of danger. <b>But</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling. But this Chamberlain comes home beaming as fatuously as some country-cousin whom a couple of card-sharpers in the train have just allowed to win sixpence, to encourage him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schneerson {{publicly}} {{expressed his}} {{view that the}} safety and stability of Israel were {{in the best interests}} of the United States, calling Israel the front line against those who want the anti-Western nations to succeed. He was opposed to land for peace, which he called an [...] "illusion of peace", saying that it would not save lives, but harm lives. Schneerson stated that this position was not based on nationalistic or other religious reasons, but purely out of concern for human life. Benjamin Netanyahu said that while serving as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in 1984, Schneerson told him: [...] "you will be serving in a house of darkness, <b>but</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>that</b> even in the darkest place; the light of a single candle can be seen far and wide..." [...] Netanyahu later retold this episode in a speech at the General Assembly, on Sept 23, 2011.|$|E
60|$|Deringham {{glanced at}} the Indian-wrought case, which was {{singularly}} artistic, somewhat dubiously, <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> something was due to their host, drew a cigar out and lighted it. He said nothing for a minute, {{and then turned to}} the teamster.|$|R
6000|$|The {{surprise}} and indignation of Jasper {{on hearing this}} was great, <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> the savage had already been punished for his offence, {{and that it would}} be mean to take advantage of him when there were three to one, he merely said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Such gross {{fanaticism}} was {{uncommon in}} America, and Miss Peyton began to imbibe {{the impression that}} her guest was deranged; <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> he had been sent by a well-known divine, and one of reputation, she discarded the idea, and, with some forbearance, observed,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> though {{death may}} alter our place, it cannot alter our character--though it may alter our circumstances, it cannot alter ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, Leonard, I {{will take}} all {{measures}} for your safety; <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> I am answerable to the Prince for my brother's followers." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Hubbell roared out {{orders to}} throw out life-preservers and lower a boat; <b>but,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> he was not on board a vessel of the olden times, he changed the order and {{commanded}} that a patent boat-hook be used upon {{the man in the}} water.|$|R
25|$|Max {{takes the}} place of a Lysander pilot and flies to France to meet with Delamare, who, it transpires, is being held at the local police station. Max and the {{resistance}} break into the jail. Delamare is drunk, <b>but</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> Marianne was a beautiful pianist.|$|R
50|$|When {{his mother}} dies, estranged son Bob (James Garner) {{inherits}} her estate, and, surprisingly, {{custody of his}} younger brother D.J. (James Woods), who suffers from schizophrenia. Bob is initially reluctant at his new responsibility, <b>but</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> he had promised his mother to look after his brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{the best}} you know how, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> I'm going to have {{something}} to say first," [...] and Jet swung the cane threateningly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask that {{question}} of your oracles, O King, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> rumour {{does not always}} lie, and let the daughter of that strange father go." ...|$|E
60|$|Don't, Paradine; I {{know you}} didn't like one another, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> I loved him {{with all my}} heart. I shall never get over his death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he {{remind you}} of {{the figure of the}} man you saw come out of the mews?" [...] Lord Fawn paused. [...] "We can't make him move about here as we did in Mr. Wickerby's room; <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> as you must do, does he look like the man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Betty trembled a little. He spoke so sharply, {{his eyes}} were bent on her so keenly, and he looked so strong, so {{forceful}} that she was almost afraid. <b>But</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> she had said only what, to her mind, was absolutely true, she raised her eyes and repeated the words: ...|$|R
6000|$|Ervic {{hesitated a}} moment <b>but,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> he need not {{consider}} Reera's anger if he succeeded in transforming the fishes, {{he was about to}} open the cupboard when he was arrested by the voices of the fishes, which stuck their heads above the water in the kettle and called out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be so. <b>But</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing is}} known! Remember, too, that your father's last wish {{was to keep}} secret the manner of his death!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, sir; <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{the anxiety}} which I suffer {{now will be}} {{increased}} day by day, until it brings me {{on the threshold of}} the grave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] said Friedel, [...] "I cannot <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the Genoese {{merchant}} of old told us of a German noble sold by his foes to the Moors." ...|$|E
60|$|He met {{her gaze}} without wavering, and, {{though he was}} not aware of this, his eyes had a {{question}} in them. It was one he could not have asked directly even if he had wished, <b>but</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> Anita was to live in that city he took a bold course.|$|R
60|$|I felt {{indeed a}} {{momentary}} pang, <b>but</b> I <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> I {{was fighting for}} my freedom.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} night Max {{takes the}} place of a Lysander pilot and flies to France to meet with Delamare, who, it transpires, is being held at the local police station. Max and the resistance break into the jail to confront Delamare. He is drunk, <b>but</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> Marianne was a beautiful pianist.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Finn {{could not}} <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the friend {{she had lost}} was not, among women, the one best able to give a girl good counsel in such a crisis.|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps I have behaved badly--at {{least from}} your point of view, <b>but</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> I warned you. Let us sit down here. Who is your friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{what you}} like, my dear," [...] she said. [...] "I will tell Cecil {{to leave you}} alone. <b>But</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> he is our host. You must really be civil to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{strong desire}} to make off seized the girl; <b>but,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> she had {{presented}} herself for inspection, she controlled the impulse, and returned to him with no demonstration of displeasure, but a little more fire in [...] "the fine eye," [...] and a more erect carriage of the [...] "capital figure." ...|$|R
60|$|At this command, to Rose's great dismay, {{six more}} hands were offered, {{and it was}} evident that she was {{expected}} to shake them all.

50|$|They fail to keep Miki safe at {{her school}} {{on the first day}} and she gets kidnpped by the henchman.
