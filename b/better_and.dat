5|$|Bath Township {{is a small}} {{community}} located ten miles (16km) northeast of Lansing, Michigan which contains the unincorporated village of Bath. The area was primarily agricultural in the early 1920s. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, many small one-room schools were closed, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a <b>better</b> <b>and</b> more complete education if students could attend a single school at one location.

5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture <b>better</b> <b>and</b> are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out for more, and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was <b>better,</b> <b>and</b> they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs.

In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E
