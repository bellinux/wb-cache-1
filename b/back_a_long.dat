25|$|Past {{climate is}} {{interpreted}} using {{a number of}} methods including lake levels, river strength, dune systems, glacial extent and pollen. The further back in time one goes, the broader the signals used become. While the climate can be inferred for a specific location 20,000 years ago, 5 million years ago the climate over most of Africa has to be considered and the results adjusted using current analogies. Problems associated with going <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time include an uneven distribution of records and a shortage of vegetation fossils due to unfavourable conditions.|$|E

I used {{to go and see}} the band, and it was a band that really impressed me because Geordie's guitar sound was just really, really strong. And they were really tribal, the band, and it was really intense. It was just really good to hear something like that during the 80s, which sort of caved in a bit with haircuts and synthesizers". The band were also honoured by [...] Metal Hammer at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for Absolute Dissent.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, Emmett first joined Yorkshire when almost 25 as a {{professional}} fast left-arm bowler with a near roundarm action, though {{in his later years}} he took to bowling slow-medium. Once discovered, however, Emmett climbed almost immediately {{to the top of the}} cricketing tree, playing for England against Surrey & Sussex in Tom Lockyer's benefit match at the Oval in 1867, his second season. An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill. In later years, Emmett shared the Yorkshire bowling duties with George Ulyett, Billy Bates, Ted Peate and Bobby Peel. He called his most famous delivery the [...] "sostenuter": after pitching on leg the ball would break <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to take the off-stump. As time went on, Emmett's pace deserted him.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome Kerviel (Société Générale) and Kweku Adoboli (UBS), two rogue traders, {{worked in}} {{the same type of}} position, the Delta One desk - a table where {{derivatives}} are traded, and not single stocks or bonds. These types of operations are relatively simple and often reserved for novice traders who also specialize in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), financial products that mimic the performance of an index (i.e. either upward or downward). As they are easy to use, they facilitate portfolio diversification through the acquisition of contracts backed by a stock index or industry (e.g. commodities). The two traders were very familiar to control procedures. They {{worked in the}} back office, the administrative body of the bank that controls the regularity of operations, before moving to trading. According to the report of the Inspector General of Societe Generale, in 2005 and 2006 Kerviel [...] "led" [...] by taking 100 to 150 million-euro positions on the shares of Solarworld AG listed in Germany. Moreover, the [...] "unauthorized trading" [...] of Kweku Adoboli, similar to Kerviel, did not date <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way. Adoboli had executed operations since October 2008 - his failure and subsequent arrest occurred in 2011.|$|E

She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying {{in a car crash}} in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) breaking up with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says nobody does. They dance together and end up kissing. Lauren walks in and slaps Peter and Zsa Zsa, who fights with Lauren. Whitney intervenes, but ends up getting in the fight herself, and Zsa Zsa ends up with a cut on her forehead. When Lucy orders her out, Zsa Zsa throws punch over Lauren, Lucy and Whitney. Outside, she asks Peter if he knows Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), saying they go <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way. Zsa Zsa visits Shirley and they talk. She is about to explain her reasons for being there when Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) comes in, and Shirley asks her to leave. Outside, Peter is waiting for Zsa Zsa. She goes to the bus stop and Peter wonders if he will see her again. She walks over to him and kisses him passionately, and says [...] "maybe", taking his keys without him knowing.|$|E
2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet {{the funny thing is}} those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production just a little too refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but that seems like a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} solo diving goes <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way. The concept of buddy diving is {{relatively}} new. Freedivers traditionally dived {{alone or with}} a surface attendant {{to assist with the}} harvest. Early diving bells were often only large enough for a single occupant. When surface supplied diving was developed, it was common to only have one diver unless the work to be done required more, and this tradition continues to the present, although there is now usually a standby diver and the working diver is in constant communication with the surface control crew. The sport of scuba diving had its roots among the multitude of small enthusiastic snorkelling and spearfishing clubs in the decades just before and after the Second World War. After the invention of the [...] "aqualung" [...] by Cousteau and Gagnan, the first commercially marketed underwater breathing apparatus became available for sale for sporting purposes in the late 1940s. As the new sport of scuba diving rapidly expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations – notably the YMCA – began programmes to train swimming enthusiasts in this new aquatic pastime and began to codify what were believed to be the proper practices needed for this expanding amateur sport. The buddy system had been thought to be a useful corollary to the [...] "never swim alone" [...] edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of harrowing diving incidents. The buddy system did indeed have some very useful aspects: the cross checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and the enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA continued as a major force in the development of diver certification during the first 50 years of this new sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as NAUI, PADI and BS-AC the practise of buddy diving solidified into one of the two main mantras of the sport: [...] "never hold your breath" [...] and [...] "never dive alone".|$|E
