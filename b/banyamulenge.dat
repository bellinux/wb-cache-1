5|$|Kagame first {{provided}} {{troops and}} military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province. With Rwandan army support, the <b>Banyamulenge</b> defeated local {{security forces and}} began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda {{despite the presence of}} the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.|$|E
5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
25|$|In August 2004, 166 <b>Banyamulenge</b> {{refugees}} were massacred at {{a refugee camp}} in Gatumba, Burundi by a force composed mostly of National Liberation Front rebels. Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa, a <b>Banyamulenge,</b> suspended his participation in the transitional government for one week in protest, before being persuaded to return to Kinshasa by South African pressure.|$|E
25|$|The crisis became {{increasingly}} unstable as it continued into 1996. The Hutu militants in the camps, now well organized, began {{to expand their}} activities from raids into Rwanda to attacks on the <b>Banyamulenge</b> ethnic group in eastern Zaire. The <b>Banyamulenge</b> were ethnic kinspeople to the Tutsi, having migrated from Rwanda over a century earlier. Rwanda began to secretly ship weapons {{across the border to}} arm the <b>Banyamulenge</b> in their fight against the exiled Rwandan Hutus, resulting in a low level conflict in the Zairean provinces of North and South Kivu. While details are unclear, sometime during this period Rwanda, with the support of Uganda, began to plan the creation of a rebellion led by Laurent Kabila.|$|E
25|$|During the Second Congo War, Tutsi militias {{among the}} <b>Banyamulenge</b> in the Congo {{province}} of Kivu desired to annex themselves to Rwanda (now dominated by Tutsi forces under the Kagame government). Kagame also desired this, both {{to increase the}} resources of Rwanda by adding those of the Kivu region, and also to add the Tutsi population, which the <b>Banyamulenge</b> represented, back into Rwanda, thereby reinforcing his political base and protecting the indigenous Tutsis living there, who had also suffered massacres from the Interhamwe.|$|E
25|$|In this war, militarized Tutsi {{elements}} in the South Kivu area of Zaire, known as <b>Banyamulenge</b> to disguise their original Rwandan Tutsi heritage, allied with the Tutsi RDF forces against the Hutu refugees in the North Kivu area, which included the Interahamwe militias.|$|E
25|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army, succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
25|$|The new Tutsi-dominated RPF {{government}} of Rwanda (in power from July 1994) protested this violation of Rwandan territorial integrity {{and began to}} give arms to the ethnically Tutsi <b>Banyamulenge</b> of eastern Zaire. The Mobutu {{government of}} Zaire vigorously denounced this intervention but possessed neither the military capability to halt it nor the political capital to attract international assistance.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Rwanda's {{situation}} in the war began to worsen. Many members of the RCD either gave up fighting or decided to join Kabila's government. Moreover, the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> the backbone of Rwanda's militia forces, became increasingly tired of control from Kigali and the unending conflict. A number of them mutinied, leading to violent clashes between them and Rwandan forces.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, the Congolese {{military}} {{announced that}} it was ending a seven-month offensive against the FDLR, prompting a sharp rebuke by the government of Rwanda. Prior to this, Gen. Laurent Nkunda had split from the government, taking <b>Banyamulenge</b> (ethnic Tutsis in the DRC) soldiers from the former Rally for Congolese Democracy and assaulting FDLR positions, displacing a further 160,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The {{new group}} of Rwanda led by INGABO became the new leaders of Rwanda. They are divided in two groups; The Rwanda-EACU group of most KIGA and the <b>Banyamulenge</b> of Rwanda Kazembe. In 2011 war broke out in Libya, the African Military Contingent {{will be part of}} the new {{settlement}} that happens in Libya, Rwanda will be part of it, with particular cooperation between Rwanda, Uganda, and Sudan to the Libyan Conflict.|$|E
25|$|When Mobutu's {{government}} {{issued an}} order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, the ethnic Tutsis in Zaire, known as <b>Banyamulenge,</b> were {{the focal point}} of a rebellion. From eastern Zaire, the rebels and foreign government forces under the leadership of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Rwandan Minister of Defense Paul Kagame launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him as they marched west toward Kinshasa.|$|E
25|$|The Tutsi are {{the second}} largest {{population}} division among the three largest groups in Rwanda and Burundi; the other two being the Hutu (largest) and the Twa (smallest). Small numbers of Hema, Kiga and Furiiru people also live near the Tutsi in Rwanda. The Northern Tutsi who reside in Rwanda are called Ruguru (Banyaruguru), while southern Tutsi that live in Burundi are known as Hima, and the Tutsi that inhabit the Kivu plateau in the Congo go by <b>Banyamulenge.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 1999 {{tensions}} {{within the}} RCD about {{the dominance of}} the <b>Banyamulenge</b> reached a boiling point when RCD leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba moved his base from Goma to Uganda-controlled Kisangani to head a breakaway faction named Forces for Renewal. A further sign of a break occurred when President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Kabila signed a ceasefire accord on 18 April in Sirte, Libya, following the mediation of Libyan President Muammar al-Gaddafi, but both the RCD and Rwanda refused to take part.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks later}} Kabila chose {{to abandon his}} {{previous}} decision. He thanked Rwanda for its help and ordered all Rwandan and Ugandan military forces to leave the country. Within 24 hours Rwandan military advisors living in Kinshasa were unceremoniously flown out. The people most alarmed by this order were the <b>Banyamulenge</b> Tutsi of eastern Congo. Their tensions with neighbouring ethnic groups had been a contributing factor in {{the genesis of the}} First Congo War and they were also used by Rwanda to affect events across the border in the DRC.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} Itombwe {{region is}} inhabited by Bafuliro, Babembe, Banyindu and Bashi people, with population densities in 1998 of over 100 people per square kilometer. Population densities {{on the western}} slope and the high plateau of Itombwe are lower at between 10 and 20 people per square kilometer. The related Balega and Babembe people live in this area. <b>Banyamulenge</b> (ethnic Tutsi) refugees from Rwanda have moved into Babembe territory starting in the 1880s, causing tensions between the inhabitants. The Bavira people live on the Ruzizi River and {{on the shore of}} Lake Tanganyika.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{uprising}} by the ethnic Tutsi, {{sometimes referred to}} as a whole as <b>Banyamulenge</b> (although this term only represents people from one area in eastern Zaireâ€”other ethnic Tutsi Kinyarwanda-speaking people include the Banyamasisi and the Banyarutshuru, as an example) people in eastern Zaire in October 1997, a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to Rwanda {{in the last two weeks}} of November. This massive repatriation was followed at the end of December 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from Tanzania, again in a huge, spontaneous wave. Less than 100,000 Rwandans are estimated to remain outside of Rwanda, and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government, its allies in the civilian militias known as Interahamwe, and soldiers recruited in the refugee camps before 1996. There are also many innocent Hutu who remain in the forests of eastern Congo, particularly Rutshuru, Masisi and Bukavu, who have been misinformed by rebel forces that they will be killed upon return to Rwanda. Rebels also use force to prevent these people from returning, as they serve as a human shield.|$|E
500|$|... 10th Military Region/South Kivu: Major Mbuja Mabe (PPRD). General Pacifique Masunzu, in 2010. Region {{included}} 112th Brigade on Minembwe plateuxes. This grouping was [...] "an {{almost exclusively}} <b>Banyamulenge</b> brigade under the direct {{command of the}} 10th Military Region, [...] consider General Masunzu as its leader." ...|$|E
500|$|When Kabila {{took power}} in 1997, {{the country was}} renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo and so {{the name of the}} {{national}} army changed once again, to the Forces armÃ©es congolaises (FAC). Tanzania sent six hundred military advisors to train Kabila's new army in May 1997. Command over the armed forces in {{the first few months of}} Kabila's rule was vague. GÃ©rard Prunier writes that 'there was no minister of defence, no known chief of staff, and no ranks; all officers were Cuban-style 'commanders' called 'Ignace', 'Bosco', Jonathan', or 'James', who occupied connecting suites at the Intercontinental Hotel and had presidential list cell-phone numbers. None spoke French or Lingala, but all spoke Kinyarwanda, Swahili, and, quite often, English.' On being asked by Belgian journalist Colette Braeckman what was the actual army command structure apart from himself, Kabila answered 'We are not going to expose ourselves and risk being destroyed by showing ourselves openly... We are careful so that the true masters of the army are not known. It is strategic. Please, let us drop the matter.' Kabila's new Forces armÃ©es congolaises were riven with internal tensions. The new FAC had <b>Banyamulenge</b> fighters from South Kivu, kadogo child soldiers from various eastern tribes, such as Thierry Nindaga, Safari Rwekoze, etc... Lunda Katangese Tigers of the former FNLC, and former FAZ personnel. Mixing these disparate and formerly warring elements together led to mutuny. On 23 February 1998, a mostly <b>Banyamulenge</b> unit mutiniued at Bukavu after its officers tried to disperse the soldiers into different units spread all around the Congo. By mid-1998, formations on the outbreak of the Second Congo War included the Tanzanian-supported 50th Brigade, headquartered at Camp Kokolo in Kinshasa, and the 10th Brigade â€” one of the best and largest units in the army â€” stationed in Goma, as well as the 12th Brigade in Bukavu. The declaration of the 10th Brigade's commander, former DSP officer Jean-Pierre Ondekane, on 2 August 1998 that he no longer recognised Kabila as the state's president was one of the factors in the beginning of the Second Congo War.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Banyamulenge</b> form a {{minority}} of the South Kivu population. Rival ethnic groups in the late 1990s claimed the <b>Banyamulenge</b> numbered no more than 35,000, while the <b>Banyamulenge</b> sympathizers claim up to ten times that number. [...] The population of <b>Banyamulenge</b> in the early 21st century is estimated at between 50,000 and 70,000 by RenÃ© Lemarchand or by GÃ©rard Prunier at around 60,000â€“80,000, a figure about 3â€“4 percent of the total provincial population.|$|E
2500|$|The various <b>Banyamulenge</b> {{militias and}} the Rwandan {{government}} forces are separate. [...] In early 2002, extensive fighting {{took place on}} the high plateau of South Kivu after Commandant Patrick Masunzu, an ethnic <b>Banyamulenge</b> in the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) rebel movement, gathered <b>Banyamulenge</b> support in an uprising against the RCD-Goma leadership.|$|E
2500|$|Lemarchand {{notes that}} the group {{represents}} [...] "a rather unique case of ethnogenesis." [...] The <b>Banyamulenge</b> of South Kivu are culturally and socially distinct from the Tutsis of North Kivu and the Tutsis who fled to South Kivu in the 1959â€“1962 Rwandan revolution. [...] Most <b>Banyamulenge</b> speak Kinyarwanda, {{and those that do}} speak it with a dialect different from other Tutsi groups. The ambiguous political and social position of the <b>Banyamulenge</b> has been a point of contention in the province, leading to the <b>Banyamulenge</b> playing {{a key role in the}} run-up to the First Congo War in 1996â€“7 and Second Congo War of 1998â€“2003.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became more}} polarised {{with the beginning}} of the Second Congo War in 1998. [...] Those who had carried out the massacres of Hutu became part of the ruling military forces in the Kivus. [...] Meanwhile, the Congolese government of Laurent Kabila urged the [...] "indigenous" [...] population to fight not only the invading RPF, but the rebelling <b>Banyamulenge</b> and Tutsi civilians. [...] Matching actions to words, Kabila armed [...] "indigenous" [...] Mai-Mai and Congolese Hutu in response to the RPF's supplying arms to the <b>Banyamulenge.</b> The two Mai-Mai groups most active against the <b>Banyamulenge</b> are the Babembe and Balega militias.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1996, a Zairean {{government}} official based in Bukavu {{declared that the}} <b>Banyamulenge</b> {{would be forced to}} leave the country, apparently as an attempt to end the conflict between them and the Hutu militants. This led to an uprising of the <b>Banyamulenge</b> in the Kivus, who were now well-armed by the RPF, and an exchange of mortar fire between the armies of Zaire and Rwanda across Lake Kivu. [...] With a speed that many observers found suspicious, Kabila found himself head of the well-supplied rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire (AFDL), which included the <b>Banyamulenge</b> militias. This new conflict {{came to be known as}} the First Congo War. At the time, Rwanda officially denied any military connection to the new rebel group, although it openly expressed support for its goal of overthrowing Mobutu.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} in South Kivu took longer to develop. [...] Once the 1994 refugees arrived, local authorities began appropriating Banyamulenge-owned {{property in the}} valley {{with the support of}} Mbembe. [...] Threatened by both the armed Hutus to the north and a Congolese army appropriating property and land, the <b>Banyamulenge</b> of South Kivu sought cross-border training and supply of arms from the RPF. [...] As threats proliferated, each Native Authority formed its own militia. [...] Finally, in November 1996, the RPF-backed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), which the <b>Banyamulenge</b> militias joined, crossed the border and dismantled the camps, before continuing on to Kinshasa and overthrowing Mobutu. The ranks of the AFDL were composed in large part by <b>Banyamulenge,</b> who filled most of the administrative positions in South Kivu after the fall of Bukavu.|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, the <b>Banyamulenge</b> were hemmed {{into the}} high plateau by Congolese Mai-Mai, the Burundian Forces for the Defense of Democracy, and the Rwandan Hutu ArmÃ©e de LibÃ©ration du Rwanda (ALiR). [...] They were unable to carry out basic {{economic}} activities without the security provided through the RCD-Goma. [...] Numerous families fled to the relative safety of the Burundian capital of Bujumbura. [...] Nevertheless, <b>Banyamulenge</b> make up much of the RCD military wing, the ArmÃ©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC), and control the towns of Fizi, Uvira and Minembwe.|$|E
2500|$|As {{documented}} in the DRC Mapping Exercise Report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, {{the success of the}} invasion led to revenge killings by the Tutsi Banyarwanda against their opponents. [...] Perhaps six thousand Hutu were purged in the week following the AFDL capture of the town. It was worse in South Kivu, as <b>Banyamulenge</b> settled local scores and RPF soldiers appeared to conflate the gÃ©nocidaires with the Hutu with the [...] "indigenous" [...] Congolese. [...] One intellectual in Bukavu who was otherwise sympathetic to the <b>Banyamulenge</b> claim to citizenship stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 August 1998 the <b>Banyamulenge</b> in {{the town}} of Goma erupted into mutiny. Rwanda offered {{immediate}} assistance to the <b>Banyamulenge</b> and early in August a well-armed rebel group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD)â€”composed primarily of <b>Banyamulenge</b> and backed by Rwanda and Ugandaâ€”had emerged. This group quickly came to dominate the resource-rich eastern provinces and based its operations in Goma. The RCD quickly took control of the towns of Bukavu and Uvira in the Kivus. The Tutsi-led Rwandan government allied with Uganda, and Burundi also retaliated, occupying a portion of northeastern Congo. To help remove the occupying Rwandans, President Kabila enlisted the aid of refugee Hutus in eastern Congo and began to agitate public opinion against the Tutsis, resulting in several public lynchings in the streets of Kinshasa. On 12 August a loyalist army major broadcast a message urging resistance from a radio station in Bunia in eastern Congo: [...] "People must bring a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones, and the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis." ...|$|E
2500|$|North and South Kivu, where a {{weakened}} FDLR continues {{to threaten the}} Rwandan border and the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> where Rwanda supports RCD-Goma rebels against Kinshasa (see Kivu conflict), and where local conflicts continue to fuel violence; ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Banyamulenge,</b> {{sometimes}} called [...] "Tutsi Congolese", {{is a term}} historically referring to the ethnic Tutsi concentrated on the High Plateau of South Kivu, in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to the Burundi-Congo-Rwanda border.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two groups of}} Tutsi in the Congo (DRC). There is the <b>Banyamulenge</b> {{that live in the}} southern tip of South Kivu. They are descendants of migrating Rwandan, Burundian and Tanzanian pastoralists. And secondly there are Tutsi in North Kivu and Kalehe in South Kivu - being part of the Banyarwanda (Hutu and Tutsi) community. These are not <b>Banyamulenge.</b> Some of these Banyarwanda are descendants of people that lived long before colonial rule in Rutshuru - on what's currently Congolese territory. Others migrated or were [...] "transplanted" [...] by the Belgian colonists from Rutshuru or from Rwanda and mostly settled in Masisi in North Kivu and Kalehe in South Kivu.|$|E
2500|$|The Congolese Tutsi in North Kivu were {{threatened}} by the new armed Hutu camps, while the newly established Tutsi government in Rwanda gave them {{a safe place to}} go. Their peril was underlined by a commission led by Mambweni Vangu, who declared that all Banyarwanda were refugees and must return to Rwanda. [...] In April 1995, Anzuluni Mbembe, the co-speaker of the Parliament of Congo, signed a resolution stating that all <b>Banyamulenge</b> were recent refugees (regardless of how long they had lived in the Congo) and providing a list of <b>Banyamulenge</b> who would be expelled from the country. Between March and May 1996, the remaining Tutsi in Masisi and Rutshuru were identified and expelled into refugee camps in Gisenyi. The Bahunde, forced out by the Hutu, also took refuge there.|$|E
2500|$|In Rwanda, {{this led}} to the [...] "Social revolution" [...] and Hutu {{violence}} against Tutsis. Tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed and many others fled to neighboring countries, such as Burundi, Uganda and expanding the <b>Banyamulenge</b> Tutsi ethnic group in the South Kivu region of the Belgian Congo. Later, exiled Tutsis from Burundi invaded Rwanda, prompting Rwanda to close its border with Burundi.|$|E
2500|$|The Rwandan {{government}} also challenged current borders by claiming {{a substantial part}} of eastern Congo as [...] "historically Rwandan". The Rwandans alleged that Kabila was organising a genocide against their Tutsi brethren in the Kivu region. The degree to which Rwandan intervention was motivated by a desire to protect the <b>Banyamulenge,</b> as opposed to using them as a smokescreen for its regional aspirations after ousting Mobutu Sese Seko, is still being debated.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1993, about 50,000 Burundian {{refugees}} from the Burundi Civil War began streaming into primarily South Kivu. They were followed the next year by almost one million mostly Hutu {{refugees from}} the Rwandan Genocide, creating the Great Lakes refugee crisis. [...] The Hutu government responsible for the genocide came with the refugees; they turned the camps into armed bases from which they could launch attacks against the newly victorious RPF government in Rwanda. [...] The influx of refugees dramatically changed {{the situation of the}} <b>Banyamulenge.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Banyamulenge</b> conquered {{their rights}} by arms but the rift {{between them and}} the local {{population}} has grown. [...] The attitude of the Tutsi soldiersâ€”during and after the war has made them more detested by the population due to the killings, torture. [...] For example, they will go into the village, raid all the cattle, tell the populationâ€”since when have you learned to keep cattle; we are cattle; we know cattle. [...] In Bukavu, they went into and stole from houses. [...] Not so much in Goma. [...] The result is the population is increasingly getting concerned over the question of the Tutsi presence.|$|E
