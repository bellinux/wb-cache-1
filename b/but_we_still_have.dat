She added, [...] "It took us much longer to get here than we anticipated. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> very big ambitions for the brand to go much farther." [...] Hewson herself has pale skin and very dark hair, wears little jewellery, and has eschewed cosmetic surgery. The Evening Standard described Hewson's style as [...] "the antithesis of bling" [...] and columnist Amanda Brunker wrote that at age50 her attractive appearance [...] "seems to defy all the odds" [...] given her hectic lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, the Germans cut theatrics {{from their}} goal celebrations; arms were raised {{but there was}} no jumping or {{screaming}} after scoring. Coach Joachim Löw stated his team had [...] "a clear, persistent game-plan", and as they realised Brazil were [...] "cracking up", they took advantage as in contrast to the Brazilians' nervousness the German players were [...] "extremely cool". Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in [...] "no game of the Cup, [...] played their best", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: [...] "we took all the balls, and scored the goals". Löw also declared the team had [...] "no euphoria" [...] during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant nothing for the upcoming final, saying [...] "We didn't celebrate. We were happy, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a job to do".|$|E

2500|$|In January 1943, Cappon {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} as coach at Princeton {{in order to}} accept a commission with the U.S. Navy. [...] He was assigned to St. Mary's Pre-Flight School in Moraga, California. [...] Cappon missed the 1943–1944 through 1945–1946 basketball seasons while serving in the Navy. [...] Cappon was a lieutenant in the Naval Aviation fitness program, where he wrote training texts and directed athletics for the fleet airwing on the West Coast. [...] After returning to Princeton, Cappon was outspoken {{on the value of}} athletics as an equalizer in American society. [...] In a 1952 speech, Cappon said: [...] "There are some basic principles that we're gradually losing sight of in America, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> them in athletics. [...] When you come out for an athletic team, your race, creed or color makes no difference. [...] Nobody asks you who you know or how much money you've got. [...] The athletic field is one place where the merit system still takes precedence over the seniority system." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{delineating}} Eboli and Philip, Schiller {{seems as}} if struggling against the current of his nature; our feelings towards them are hardly so severe as he intended; their words and deeds, at least those of the latter, are wicked and repulsive enough; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a kind of latent persuasion that they meant better than they spoke or acted. With the Marquis of Posa, he had a more genial task. This Posa, we can easily perceive, is the representative of Schiller himself. The ardent love of men, which forms his ruling passion, was likewise the constant feeling of his author; the glowing eloquence with which he advocates the cause of truth, and justice, and humanity, was such as Schiller too would have employed in similar circumstances. In some respects, Posa is the chief character of the piece; there is a preëminent magnificence in his object, and in the faculties and feelings with which he follows it. Of a splendid intellect, and a daring devoted heart, his powers are all combined upon a single purpose. Even his friendship for Carlos, grounded on the likeness of their minds, and faithful as it is, yet seems to merge in this paramount emotion, zeal for the universal interests of man. Aiming, with all his force of thought and action, to advance the happiness and best rights of his fellow-creatures; pursuing this noble aim with the skill and dignity which it deserves, his mind is at once unwearied, earnest and serene. He is another Carlos, but somewhat older, more experienced, and never crossed in hopeless love. There is a calm strength in Posa, which no accident of fortune can shake. Whether cheering the forlorn Carlos into new activity; whether lifting up his voice in the ear of tyrants and inquisitors, or taking leave of life amid his vast unexecuted schemes, there is the same sedate magnanimity, the same fearless composure: when the fatal bullet strikes him, he dies with the concerns of others, not his own, upon his lips. He is a reformer, the perfection of reformers; not a revolutionist, but a prudent though determined improver. His enthusiasm does not burst forth in violence, but in manly and enlightened energy; his eloquence is not more moving to the heart than his lofty philosophy is convincing to the head. There is a majestic vastness of thought in his precepts, which recommends them to the mind independently of the beauty of their dress. Few passages of poetry are more spirit-stirring than his last message to Carlos, through the Queen. The certainty of death seems to surround his spirit {{with a kind of}} martyr glory; he is kindled into transport, and speaks with a commanding power. The pathetic wisdom of the line, 'Tell him, that when he is a man, he must reverence the dreams of his youth,' has often been admired: that scene has many such.|$|E

The episode was originally scheduled to air in its regular half-hour time slot, but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot beginning a half hour early, although it still counts as one official episode, similar to the earlier season episode [...] "Moving On". Rogers noted that [...] "we knew the last two episodes would be hour-longs, and The Finale might even end up running longer, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{a lot of great}} storytelling to do leading up to them, and 'Livin' the Dream' was one that ultimately deserved to be an hour long episode as well!" ...|$|R

Sattouf had rejected several film offers before because they lacked creative freedom, but he agreed when he was contacted by Anne-Dominique Toussaint, a film producer and a fan of Sattouf's graphic novels who wanted to make a teen film. Sattouf wrote the first draft of the script and then asked screenwriter Marc Syrigas to help him to re-write it. Rather than make a film about [...] "the codes of today's teens, the way they talk, or their arsenal of electronic devices", Sattouf wanted to focus on [...] "the intensity of their emotions". He wanted to depict [...] "the things that happen during teenage-hood that we don't show so often".|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, the LS debuted as Lincoln's first {{rear-wheel drive}} sport luxury sedan for the 2000 model year, under {{influence}} from {{the newly established}} Premier Automotive Group. In designing the LS to be competitive in its segment (which was also shared with its domestic rival, the Cadillac Catera, which debuted in 1997), Helmuth Schrader, the LS' German-born chief designer, said of the car, [...] "In a segment defined and dominated by BMW and Mercedes, the car {{had to have a}} functional, no-nonsense look. This redefines the Lincoln brand, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{to make sure it was}} recognizable as a member of the same family as the Town Car, Continental, Mark VIII, and the Navigator." [...] Heeding this insight, the LS featured an understated, well-proportioned exterior design with squared rectangular fog lights. The body was tightly sculpted with short front and rear overhangs to emphasize an athletic appearance while well-rounded wheel housings were intentionally made small to suggest that the car's wheels were larger than their actual size. The greenhouse of the LS offered spacious headroom and was accentuated by a smoothly arched roofline. Completing the exterior were chrome accents on the front and rear fascias and a waterfall grille.|$|R
