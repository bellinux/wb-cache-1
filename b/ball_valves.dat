It is significant to both {{the management of the}} enterprise, and the actors involved in the development of enterprise systems. While there is no order of priority for the columns of the Framework, the top-down order of the rows is significant to the alignment of business concepts and the actual physical enterprise.

2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart valve was the caged-ball, which utilizes a metal cage to house a silicone elastomer ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow. At the completion of the heart's contraction, the pressure inside the chamber drops and is lower than beyond the valve, so the ball moves back against the base of the valve forming a seal. In 1952, Charles A. Hufnagel implanted caged-ball heart valves in ten patients (six survived the operation), marking the first long-term success in prosthetic heart valves. A similar valve was invented by Miles [...] "Lowell" [...] Edwards and Albert Starr in 1960 (commonly referred to as the Starr-Edwards Silastic Ball Valve). The first human implant was on Sept 21, 1960. It consisted of a silicone ball enclosed in a cage formed by wires originating from the valve housing. Caged <b>ball</b> <b>valves</b> have a high tendency to form blood clots, so the patient must have a high degree of anti-coagulation, usually with a target INR of 2.5-3.5. Edwards Lifesciences discontinued production of the Starr-Edwards valve in 2007.|$|E

In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> and into the delivery line.

Residues arise because in the half open position of the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> a gap is created between the ball bore and the body in which fluid can be trapped. To avoid the fluid getting into this cavity, the cavity has to be plugged, which can be done by extending the seats in such a manner that it is always in contact with the ball.

The 3 piece design allows for the center part of the valve containing the ball, stem & seats to be easily removed from the pipeline.

Comparison of flow pattern at several opening angles was investigated. Pressure drop behind of the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> and formation of vortex flow after the valve section have been discussed. As the opening of the valve decreases, these vortices grow and may cause more pressure drop. In other words, more energy is lost due to these growing vortices.
