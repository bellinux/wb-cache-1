50|$|Where {{electrical}} safety is an issue, {{various kinds of}} protected plugs and sockets are available. These have sliding covers on plugs or other devices to protect the user from accidental contact with live conductors, but are still largely compatible with the original design. A typical design is now required (IEC 61010) on digital voltmeter test leads and several other measurement and laboratory equipment. In this design, the metal <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> is entirely sheathed in plastic and presses into a deep recess in the DVM. Alternatively, the equipment has the male part of the <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> and it is deeply recessed; the test lead contains a sheathed banana jack. Also, the test lead wire is specified for higher voltage isolation.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} widely used plugs {{are based on}} {{combining}} 2 or more banana plugs with a plastic handle and other features for ease of use and to prevent accidental insertion in other such plugs. Many of these plugs are derived from the double <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> consisting simply of two banana plugs spaced 3/4 inch (about 19mm) apart.|$|E
50|$|For {{high voltage}} use, a special {{sheathed}} {{version of the}} <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> and socket is used. This version has an insulating sheath around both {{the male and female}} connectors to avoid accidental contact. The sheathed male plug will not work with an unsheathed female socket, but an unsheathed male plug will fit a sheathed female socket.|$|E

5000|$|Individual <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> and jacks are {{commonly}} color-coded red and black, but {{are available in}} a wide variety of colors. Dual <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> are often black with some physical feature such as a molded ridge or thick tab, marked [...] "Gnd" [...] indicating the relative polarity of the two plugs.|$|R

5000|$|Invention of {{the plug}} is claimed by two entities. The Hirschmann company claims it {{was invented by}} Richard Hirschmann in 1924. A {{competing}} claim is made for the General Radio Company (Genrad), which stated [...] "1924: GenRad developed <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> - replaces pin plugs, this spring-loaded connector technology..." [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "introduced in this country US by GR in 1924".|$|E
50|$|A banana {{connector}} (commonly <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> for the male, banana socket or {{banana jack}} for the female) is a single-wire (one conductor) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment. The term 4 mm connector is also used, especially in Europe, {{although not all}} banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts. The plug is typically a four-leafed spring tip that fits snugly into the jack. The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment.|$|E
50|$|US-style double banana (pictured): A {{plastic housing}} {{containing}} two banana plugs, allowing simultaneous connection of {{a signal line}} and a ground (earth) line; see the photo. The housing may allow the connection of individual wires, a permanently attached coaxial cable providing both signal and ground, or a coaxial connector such as the BNC connector shown in the photo. Conventionally the tab located {{on one side of}} the dual <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> denotes the ground, shell, or negative (reference) side of the connector.|$|E

50|$|The Laboratory Modules were {{packaged}} in an extruded aluminum housing, intended {{to sit on}} an engineer's workbench, although a rack-mount bay was sold that held nine laboratory modules. They were then connected together using <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> patch cords inserted {{at the front of}} the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), or 10 MHz (1960). The Modules proved to be in high demand in other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone, turning a profit at the end of its first year.|$|E
50|$|The pin's {{diameter}} is nominally 4 mm. The pin has {{one or more}} lengthwise springs that bulge outwards slightly, {{giving the}} appearance of a banana. Taking the springs into account, the actual diameter of a <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> is typically a bit larger than 4 mm when not plugged in. When inserted into a matching 4 mm socket the springs press against the sides of the socket, improving the electrical contact and preventing the pin from falling out. The other end of the plug has a lug connector to which a length of flexible insulated equipment wire can be attached, which is either screwed, soldered, or crimped into place. An insulating plastic cover is usually fitted over this rear end of the connector.|$|E
5000|$|One {{reason why}} banana {{connectors}} are not rated for mains usage {{is that an}} exposed <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> or socket can present a shock hazard if connected to an energized source. A plug that is only partially inserted into a jack can also present a risk of accidental contact, because the conductive surface of the plug will not be completely covered. This can especially happen if a 20 mm long plug is inserted into a socket that is only intended for 15 mm long plugs. Further, some banana plugs have the screw used to fix the wire to the plug exposed. Also, when connecting plugs using transverse holes in the plug, {{large parts of the}} pin of the second plug are exposed. Another reason why banana connectors are not rated for mains usage is the lack of double isolation of wires and connectors. The hazards include electric shock, electrocution, burns from accidental short circuits, and damage to the attached equipment.|$|E

5000|$|Besides <b>plugging</b> into {{specific}} <b>banana</b> jacks, <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> may {{plug into}} [...] "five-way" [...] or [...] "universal" [...] binding posts on audio equipment.|$|R
30|$|To {{connect the}} hook, we {{produced}} cables {{that are on}} the one side compatible with standard multimeter plugs {{and on the other side}} feature a mini <b>banana</b> <b>plug</b> to connect to the connectable crochet hook. The cables are also custom constructions, consisting of braided textile cords around a flexible wire that electrically connects its two ends. As opposed to the relative stiffness of common multimeter cables, this soft cable helps avoiding potential harm to a delicate textile artifact or interfering with the crafter’s movements while using the hook. The textile multimeter cable is pictured in Fig.  3, connected to the hook in Fig.  4.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{permit the use of}} double <b>banana</b> <b>plugs,</b> the {{distance}} between the positive and negative plugs should be 3/4 inch (19 mm).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Small black binding posts {{of an old}} {{loudspeaker}} driver are visible. These binding posts are not {{compatible with}} <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> of any size. Instead they were endowed with small solder contacts.|$|R
25|$|The {{signal to}} be {{measured}} is fed {{to one of the}} input connectors, which is usually a coaxial connector such as a BNC or UHF type. Binding posts or <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> may be used for lower frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Quality <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> and cables are {{typically}} rated for 30 V at 15 A. Cheap versions can have worse isolation, {{and might not}} withstand 15 A at all. Banana connectors are not usually rated for mains voltage.|$|R
50|$|Many {{speakers}} and electronics have flexible five-way binding posts {{that can be}} screwed down or held down by a spring to accept bare or soldered wire and pins or springy <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> (through {{a hole in the}} outward-facing side of the post).|$|R
50|$|Grid bias {{batteries}} are still manufactured today, {{but not for}} radio use. They are popular in schools and colleges as a convenient variable voltage source in science classes. The most popular battery is the 9 volt type with taps every 1½ volts that accept <b>banana</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Speaker wire {{terminations}} {{facilitate the}} connection of speaker wire to both amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of termination include soldered or crimped pin or spade lugs, <b>banana</b> <b>plugs,</b> and 2-pin DIN connectors. The type of termination {{is determined by the}} connectors on the equipment {{at each end of the}} wire. Some terminations are gold plated.|$|R
50|$|A {{closely related}} but {{different}} design {{is the so-called}} pin plug and matching pin jack. The pin <b>plug</b> designs resemble <b>banana</b> <b>plugs,</b> but without the spring on the male pin. Instead, these designs rely on spring action in the female jack, or tightly machined tolerances, to ensure good contact. The pin plug design was used where maximum density of connectors was desired (such as in pin plugboards), or a very compact connector was needed.|$|R
5000|$|On {{their power}} amplifiers, Naim use {{recessed}} loudspeaker sockets that accept only <b>banana</b> <b>plugs.</b> Use of forks or bare wire-connectors for speaker output was ruled {{out from the}} beginning, {{even though this is}} standard practice elsewhere. Reviewers complained about [...] "nasty little plug sockets" [...] used for the amplifiers. [...] Naim's own NAC A5 speaker wire occasionally comes in for criticism for its physical stiffness, and also for imparting a [...] "brittle, scratch" [...] quality to the sound.|$|R
50|$|Even {{so-called}} isolated binding posts {{are typically}} not sufficiently isolated to protect users from coming {{into contact with}} their metal parts carrying voltage. As such they are not suitable {{to be used for}} carrying dangerous voltages (cf. extra-low voltage). On several types of equipment it has been becoming common to no longer use the traditional binding posts, but safety banana jacks. The universal property of binding posts is lost here, since safety banana jacks can only be used with traditional and safety <b>banana</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|I/O {{includes}} three ring connectors (plus one power one ground) which accept crocodile clips or 4 mm <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> {{as well as}} a 23-pin edge connector with two or three PWM outputs, six to 17 GPIO pins (depending on configuration), six analog inputs, serial I/O, SPI, and I²C. Unlike early prototypes, which had an integral battery, an external battery pack (AAA batteries) can be used to power the device as a standalone or wearable product. Health and safety concerns, as well as cost, were given as reasons for the removal of the button battery from early designs.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{closely related}} type is the {{stackable}} connector for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets {{on the opposite}} surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable <b>banana</b> <b>plugs,</b> and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called [...] "shields". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.|$|R
50|$|A general type of {{connector}} {{that simply}} screws or clamps bare wire to a post; such connectors are frequently used in electronic test equipment and audio. Many, {{but not all}} binding posts will also accept a <b>banana</b> connector <b>plug.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{the series}} budget was {{comparatively}} low, the set designers resorted to using modified common everyday objects; for instance, electric irons, inverted clock pendulums, washing-machine console parts and designer pencil sharpeners {{were used as}} props control panels, sewing thread coils and <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> as futuristic machine parts, and plastic cups as ceiling lights. Many panels were produced by the then-newly invented thermoforming process. Lots of designer furniture was also used, notably Ludwig Mies van der Rohes 258-type couch, Harry Bertoias Diamond-type armchair, Yrjö Kukkapuros Karuselli-type armchair,Charles Eamess Aluminium group #EA105 chair, George Nelsons DAF Chair and Eero Saarinens Tulpe table/chair combo. Joe Colombos famous Smoke-type drinking glasses were used throughout the series.|$|R

5000|$|The {{signal to}} be {{measured}} is fed {{to one of the}} input connectors, which is usually a coaxial connector such as a BNC or UHF type. Binding posts or <b>banana</b> <b>plugs</b> may be used for lower frequencies.If the signal source has its own coaxial connector, then a simple coaxial cable is used; otherwise, a specialized cable called a [...] "scope probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire test lead for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.General-purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 megohm in parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads. This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes. Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50‑ohm inputs, which must be either connected directly to a 50‑ohm signal source or used with Z0 or active probes.|$|R
