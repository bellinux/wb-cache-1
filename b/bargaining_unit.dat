25|$|Justice Ivan Rand {{issued a}} {{landmark}} legal decision following a strike in Windsor, Ontario, involving 17,000 Ford workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues.

Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although {{they do not have}} to join the union.|$|E

25|$|The NLB's {{interpretation}} of Section 7(a), however, increasing diverged from that espoused by the NRA. On March 1, 1934, the Board issued its decision in Denver Tramway Corporation.

25|$|Unions may {{organize}} a particular section of skilled workers (craft unionism), {{a cross-section of}} workers from various trades (general unionism), or attempt to {{organize a}}ll workers within a particular industry (industrial unionism). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on {{the rank and file}} members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit</b> and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.|$|E

2500|$|Tobin was a lukewarm {{supporter}} of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). [...] He did not oppose its passage, but expressed deep concern that the Act did not expressly protect craft unionism and allow the creation of craft-based <b>bargaining</b> <b>units.</b> Tobin convinced the AFL to seek introduction of an amendment permitting <b>bargaining</b> <b>units</b> along craft lines. [...] But although Senator Robert F. Wagner agreed to submit the amendment, he failed to do so. After the quick growth of the CIO under the NLRB, Tobin became disenchanted and suggested that the NLRA be repealed and the NLRB disbanded. In time, Tobin came to strongly support the Act.|$|R
25|$|The Act {{outlines}} procedures {{similar to}} those of the National Labor Relations Act for electing a representative labor organization. Only secret ballot elections are permitted. The Board has the right to determine the correct <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit,</b> and an election is triggered only when a petition signed by a majority of current workers is presented. There are several bars to holding an election (including the existence of an existing certified labor organization, an election was held and lost within the previous 12 months, and an election was held but no contract executed within the previous 12 months).|$|E
25|$|Madden's {{stewardship}} of the NLRB came under increasing attack, however. Section 9(b) of the NLRA authorized the Board to determine the appropriate <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit,</b> but did not specify what standards to use to make that determination. The AFL had long preferred craft unionism, whereby workers were organized into unions {{on the basis of}} craft, trade, or skill. But other unions sought to organize workers on an industry-wide basis (industrial unionism) to create more powerful unions as well as to take advantage of changes in the workplace that mass production and increases in corporate size were making. The intense philosophical differences led the AFL to eject those organizations advocating industrial unionism, and these unions formed the CIO in November 1936.|$|E
25|$|Green {{dared not}} refuse the AFL {{executive}} council's instructions {{to undertake a}} joint organizing drive, {{but he did not}} wholeheartedly implement a plan, either. For {{the first six months of}} the year, Green did nothing. After the creation of the federal Steel Labor Relations Board in late June 1935 (an independent labor relations board created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt because of the failures of the National Labor Board), Green worked with Tighe, steel industry executives and the steel board to create a plan to allow collective bargaining in the steel industry. The talks dragged on through the end of the year. The sticking point was the AFL's demand for representational exclusivity (the concept that if a majority of workers voted for the union then all employees in the <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit</b> should belong to the union).|$|E
2500|$|NFFE grew quickly. [...] For example, by 1929 it had {{organized}} more than 1,500 {{workers at the}} Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The unit was the largest NFFE chapter in the country, the largest local union in the country, and the largest women's union in the country. NFFE also quickly abandoned its craft focus. Some local chapters—especially those in large federal agencies in Washington, D.C., where {{the number of workers}} enabled craft-based <b>bargaining</b> <b>units</b> to remain viable—retained their craft structure. But most of the union's units throughout the country became industrial unions. Even many of the D.C.-area unions abandoned their craft orientation to become industrial unions with agency-wide <b>bargaining</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|The authors {{hypothesize that}} past strike {{experience}} {{will have a}} negative or "teetotaler" effect on a collective <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit's</b> propensity to strike in future negotiations, other things being equal. They test this using a unique micro-level sample comprising four consecutive negotiations by 147 <b>bargaining</b> <b>units</b> in U. S. manufacturing industries, controlling for observable and unobservable differences among bargaining pairs in the propensity to strike. The {{results are consistent with}} the view that the experience of striking is, indeed, sobering: lagged strike experience variables have a significantly negative effect on the propensity to strike in the current negotiation.

25|$|Harry Beck was a {{maintenance}} worker with the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. (C) in Maryland and a CWA organizer. Beck protested {{the use of}} his union dues for a political cause in which he did not believe and asked for a refund. The CWA refused, arguing that using union dues for political expenditures was appropriate and legal. In the early 1970s, after disagreeing with national CWA officials over a union organizing drive in suburban Baltimore, Maryland, Beck resigned from the union and began to pay the $10-a-month agency fee. Beck continued to protest {{the use of his}} agency fee for political purposes, and asked the CWA to provide a more accurate accounting of how much money it spent on politics. The union refused. In June 1976, Beck and 19 other non-union members of the CWA's <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit</b> at C sued the union for a refund. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation provided legal counsel and support to Beck and the other 18 workers. Beck quit C in 1979 and moved to Oregon, where he worked at CWA-organized job at American Telephone & Telegraph and continued to pay his agency fee.|$|E
25|$|On December 16, 1957 another {{representation}} {{election for}} the TWU was scheduled, and the motormen from the MBA {{did not want}} to have a small role in the TWU, and threatened to strike, but were stopped by court injunctions. As a result, the motormen wanted to hold an election for the representation of their craft independent of the NYCTA-wide elections. The management of the NYCTA did not recognize the MTA as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>unit</b> as the TWU officially represented the motormen. A request for a separate election was denied, and as a result the motormen wanted to show their power and to acquire their own representation. As a result, on December 9, 1957, the motormen went on strike, resulting in subway service being reduced in half for eight days. Riders using the IND lines in Queens, the Bronx, and Upper Manhattan, and the southern Brooklyn lines of the BMT were the hardest hit. The leaders of the MBA were punished after going against injunctions prohibiting strikes. Afterwards, the MBA leaders were punished, and on the first morning of the strike, the MBA President Theodore Loos and three other MBA officials were arrested and sent to jail. In 1958, the TWU and the MBA reached a settlement. The motormen became a separate United Motormen's Division within the TWU and benefitted from a fund for skilled craft workers. Theodore Loos became its head.|$|E

After students began a hunger strike and on-campus vigil, the strike was settled on May 1, 2006.

Collective <b>bargaining</b> <b>units</b> are required to take annual votes to maintain certification as a union.
