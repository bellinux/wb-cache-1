5|$|Although a {{small number}} of castles had been built in England during the 1050s, after the conquest the Normans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> timber motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers to control their newly {{occupied}} territories. During the 12th century the Normans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> more castles in stone, with characteristic square keeps that supported both military and political functions. Royal castles were used to control key towns and forests, whilst baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates; a feudal system called the castle-guard was sometimes used to provide garrisons. Castles and sieges continued to grow in military sophistication during the 12th century, and in the 13th century new defensive town walls were constructed across England.|$|E

This {{became known as}} the Organ reform movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Mere {{was a small}} and {{unimportant}} settlement in the early 13th century. In 1243 Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, acquired the manor. Richard was the brother of Henry III and immensely rich. In 1253 he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a castle at Mere.|$|E
5|$|A second British raid, {{which had}} been {{scheduled}} to take off from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up near the carriers, and the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow. Swordfish and Seafire aircraft flew protective patrols over the Home Fleet throughout the morning's operations.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> more castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, organ {{builders}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{instruments in}} concert halls {{and other large}} secular venues, allowing the organ {{to be used as}} part of an orchestra, as in Saint-Saëns' Symphony No. 3. Frequently the organ is given a soloistic part, such as in Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante for Organ & Orchestra, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Organ, Strings and Tympani, and Frigyes Hidas' Organ Concerto.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century, but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response the Welsh princes and lords <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> their own castles, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodwydd, Tomen y Faerdre and Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the Norman fortifications {{in the area and}} it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone. At the end of the 12th century the Welsh rulers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> castles in stone, primarily in the principality of North Wales.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{formally}} the Count of Cotentin, Henry continued {{to control the}} west of Normandy. The struggle between Henry's brothers continued. William Rufus continued to put down resistance to his rule in England, but <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a number of alliances against Robert with barons in Normandy and neighbouring Ponthieu. Robert allied himself with Philip I of France. In late 1090 William Rufus encouraged Conan Pilatus, a powerful burgher in Rouen, to rebel against Robert; Conan was supported by most of Rouen and made appeals to the neighbouring ducal garrisons to switch allegiance as well.|$|E
5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the island {{into a more}} circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{official}} government statement that allowed {{for freedom of}} the press, {{this was the first}} trial of whether or not Dubček was serious about reforms. Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.|$|E

5|$|George Mason <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America {{for the use}} of local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and the shops and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. Following {{the birth of their}} second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His {{departure}} on November 27, 1840, was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and his library of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 1221 Llywelyn {{took control}} of {{neighbouring}} Meirionnydd from his son, Gruffydd; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there, but {{the father and son}} had fallen out.

Castell y Bere was the first of several stone castles built by Llywelyn and the initial castle consisted of several towers positioned around a courtyard, situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris.|$|E
