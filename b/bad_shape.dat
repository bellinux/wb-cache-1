In December of that year, Shmuel Spiegel managed to raise $25,000 for emergency repairs. However, despite offering cholent (the traditional Sabbath lunch stew) at the Sabbath morning kiddush, Spiegel had to search local streets to make the ten men for the minyan. In 2004 the regular membership hovered around 40. Spiegel kept the synagogue running at an annual cost of around $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged {{to make it look}} like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in <b>bad</b> <b>shape.</b> To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E

5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|Duncan was {{assigned}} to Escort Group B-7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943. She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944. She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943. The ship {{was assigned}} to anti-submarine duties in the Western Approaches after her refit was finished in May 1944, and Duncan remained there until April 1945. At that time she was transferred to coastal anti-submarine patrols to counter any last-gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine {{to interfere with the}} Allied supply lines to the Continent. Placed in reserve the following month, Duncan was in <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and was sold for scrap later that year. The demolition, however, was not completed until 1949.|$|E

However, CECAFA Secretary General Nicholas Musonye decided to move the remaining group games from the Namboole Stadium since {{it had been in}} <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> due to heavy rains. It was confirmed that on Saturday, 1 December, Somalia would play Tanzania at the Lugogo Stadium at 14:00 UTC+3 while Eritrea would take on Rwanda at the same venue two hours later.

50|$|In {{the game}} of Go, shape {{describes}} the positional qualities {{of a group of}} stones. Descriptions of shapes in go revolve around how well a group creates or removes life and territory. Good shape can refer to the efficient use of stones in outlining territory, the strength of a group in a prospective fight, or making eye shapes so that a group may live. <b>Bad</b> <b>shapes</b> are inefficient in outlining territory and are heavy. Heavy groups cannot easily make eye shapes and are therefore good targets for attack. Understanding and recognizing the difference between good <b>shape</b> and <b>bad</b> is an essential step in becoming a stronger player.|$|R
5000|$|Clock {{speed switch}} (“turbo” switch). Changed the {{processor}} clock speed {{from the standard}} 3 MHz (BK-0010* series) to 4 or 6 MHz, or from the standard 4 MHz (BK-0011* series) to 3 or 6 MHz. Not all processor samples worked reliably at 6 MHz; the possibility of such overclocking had to be determined experimentally for each sample. Switching the clock speed changed the pace of dynamic games. The turbo switch usually had to be installed together with the pause switch, because the simplest circuit for switching the clock speed produced <b>bad</b> <b>shapes</b> in the clock signal due to contact bounce when the mechanical switch was flipped, running the risk of hanging the software execution unless the processor was in the suspended state.|$|R

It was issued on Spunk! Records and achieved critical acclaim and [...] "got everyone paying attention". Walker described collaborating with Freer, Loucataris, and Nix: [...] "We've {{known each other for}} at least 10 years ...

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} <b>bad</b> <b>shape.</b> The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

Trailers from Class 65 and Class 67 were taken into use, and for a short period a Class 91 trailer. On 28 August 1985, passenger traffic on the line was terminated and the two remaining trains were retired. Reasons for the termination included a lack of sufficient political support for financing new trains, and also that Class 64 was no longer suitable for use. The last two trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are stored at Garnes Station, part of the Old Voss Line.|$|E

Victorieuse was on summer maneuvers off the Iberian coast in July 1893. The ship was initially condemned in May 1897, but this was reversed so she could convoy torpedo boats to Bizerte.

5|$|All of the {{surviving}} ships except Condorcet were reduced to second-line roles by 1920. Mirabeau was not repaired after her salvage and was hulked {{for a few years}} before being sold. Vergniaud was in <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and became a target ship before she was sold for scrap. Voltaire and Diderot had their underwater protection modernized in the early 1920s and became training ships before they were condemned in the mid-1930s. Condorcet was assigned to the Channel Division in the early 1920s before she too had her underwater protection modernized. She also became a training ship after its completion, but she was hulked in 1931 and became a depot ship for the torpedo school. The ship was captured intact when the Germans occupied Toulon in November 1942 and was used by them as a barracks ship. Condorcet was scuttled by the Germans in August 1944 and refloated the following year before being scrapped.|$|E

The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and a sore throat Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E

Renamed Chesma (Чесма), the ship arrived in Port Said, Egypt on 19 September and later supported efforts to intimidate the Greek Government into support Allied operations in Macedonia. She arrived at Alexandrovsk on 16 January 1917 after a brief refit in Birkenhead and became flagship of the Arctic Flotilla. Her crew joined the Bolsheviks in October 1917 and Chesma was captured by the British in Murmansk in March 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.
