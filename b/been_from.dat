5|$|Brandon Marsh has a {{very low}} risk of {{pollution}} and as such the main threat from man has <b>been</b> <b>from</b> vandalism; in 2007, a fire started by youths destroyed {{a third of the}} Newlands reedbed. This was the second time the reed bed had been targeted, the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck.|$|E
5|$|D. lacustris ("of the lake") is a nomen dubium, {{named by}} Marsh in 1884 based on {{specimen}} YPM 1922 found by Arthur Lakes, {{consisting of the}} snout and upper jaw of a smaller animal from Morrison, Colorado. These remains are now believed to have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> an immature animal, rather than from a separate species.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Arthur are {{believed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> a decaying cold front in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002. By July 9, a weak low-level circulation was first detected, in association with a broad low pressure area. Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper level wind shear was marginally favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized.|$|E
5|$|The sthamba buttalikas are pillar {{images that}} show traces of Chola {{art in the}} Chalukyan touches. Some of the artists working for the Hoysalas may have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> Chola country, {{a result of the}} {{expansion}} of the empire into Tamil-speaking regions of Southern India. The image of mohini on one of the pillars in the mantapa (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is an example of Chola art.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{companies}} in the U.S. offering conversions. The most common conversions have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> hybrid electric cars to plug-in hybrid, but due to the different technology used in hybrids by each carmaker, the easiest conversions are for 2004–2009 Toyota Prius and for the Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner Hybrid.|$|E

5|$|Under this view, {{the moment}} the treaty {{transferring}} the territories to U.S. sovereignty was signed, the residents of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other territories became subject to all the rights granted by the Constitution.

5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second man went missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury as it had <b>been</b> <b>from</b> 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it {{was transferred to the}} state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|As a hadrosaurid, Prosaurolophus {{would have}} been a large herbivore, eating plants with a {{sophisticated}} skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material {{would have been}} cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like structure. Feeding would have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the ground up to around 4meters (13ft) above. Like other hadrosaurs, it could have moved both bipedally and quadrupedally. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Prosaurolophus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5|$|Credit Suisse {{developed}} the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused {{exclusively on the}} chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has <b>been</b> <b>from</b> private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of friendly fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E
5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E
