25|$|In {{the case}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is then pointed at a photovoltaic cell. This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is <b>beamed</b> <b>at</b> a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.|$|E

Pulses of radio waves were <b>beamed</b> <b>at</b> the planet using the [...] radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory, and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions, designated the Alpha and Beta regions. The observations also revealed a bright region attributed to mountains, which was called Maxwell Montes. These three features are now the only ones on Venus {{that do not have}} female names.|$|E

We find, moreover, that when run in multipass mode, the accelerator {{can be made to}} image the injected <b>beam</b> <b>at</b> the dump by a proper choice of accelerating phase...|$|R
