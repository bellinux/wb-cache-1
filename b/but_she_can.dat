5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can,</b> as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E
5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E

25|$|The Empire of China is an old, crazy, first-rate Man of War, which a {{fortunate}} {{succession of}} able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat for these {{hundred and fifty}} years past, and to overawe their neighbours merely by her bulk and appearance. But whenever an insufficient man happens to have the command on deck, adieu to the discipline and safety of the ship. She may, perhaps, not sink outright; she may drift some time as a wreck, and will then be dashed to pieces on the shore; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> never be rebuilt on the old bottom.|$|E
25|$|Joy (Yellow Heart) - Peach {{becomes very}} happy as if walking on air, which {{allows her to}} slowly ascend in a small tornado, gust fogs and clouds, turn windmills, push down fountains, hit blocks above her and blow enemies away. With this power, she can float in the wind in some stages. She can also use it to break open flying bags that contain mostly coins and {{sometimes}} hearts and vibe crystals, splash bits of Blooper's ink thrown in the air, spin Kamek's head and slow down her falls as an easy use. However, some areas feature spores that stop her flying abilities, requiring more traditional platform methods to reach, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> go up platforms that are vertically close.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to convince Cassie that his claims are sincere, Azazeal kills Thelma before Cassie's eyes as a sacrifice to increase his power and prove that he is truly who he says he is. This act has two unintentional consequences: his power over Cassie is initially weakened by the shock, and Thelma thereafter continues to share Cassie's room as a ghost that only Cassie, Azazeal and other ghosts can see. Thelma never forgives Azazeal for her own death, and is a strong voice against him to Cassie, who has grown to have feelings for him. Thelma is unable to touch the living, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> touch other ghosts and presumably manipulate inanimate objects (including clothing, artifacts, books, doors, window sashes, and vending machines) and eat, which she does constantly (since ghosts cannot gain weight). Thelma works {{behind the scenes to}} spy on Azazeal and gather evidence from places where Cassie cannot enter. Cassie, while horrified by some of Azazeal's behaviour, ultimately finds herself drawn into his power. Azazeal possesses Cassie, and while under his power, she gives herself to him and they conceive a child.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{predicted}} in January 1966 {{that the various}} boycotts would force Smith to give in [...] "within {{a matter of weeks}} rather than months", but the British (and later UN) sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with it, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with opprobrium, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. [...] "Rhodesia can not only take it, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> also make it," [...] Smith said on 29 April 1966, while opening the annual Central African Trade Fair in Bulawayo. [...] "When I say take it, I use it in two ways. Firstly, when it comes to sanctions we have proved we can take it. Secondly, when it comes to independence, we have also proved we can take it." ...|$|E
500|$|Belldandy's {{capacities}} and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change {{the appearance of}} her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly), <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, [...] "see" [...] people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and [...] "speak" [...] to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held {{to be the best}} in the heavens. She is also incapable of becoming inebriated on alcoholic drinks, but instead becomes so with soda. (One can is enough to send her in a drunken rampage—although given her personality, [...] "rampage" [...] takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). [...] During the manga's publication, more of Belldandy's capabilities are discovered, but she probably has many more : Urd notes that Belldandy loves accumulating [...] capabilities [...] but usually doesn't mention them herself. Among those seen in the manga, she has a Valkyrie diploma - as demonstrated when she neutralizes Thrym the Invincible in hand-to-hand combat - and she's a champion flying broom racer. the only thing she can't do is hurt others - provided Keichi isn't in harm's way, otherwise she will [...] "deal" [...] with anything and anyone standing in her way (see Thrym above for the most out of character example) whatever the cost on herself.|$|E

She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on how {{we were going to get}} to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

Jocelyn Vena for MTV praised the singer's performance, writing [...] "Rihanna used her touching vocals to prove that not only can she sex up a performance <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> also sing the heck out of one." [...] Erika Ramirez noted that Rihanna [...] "belted out the song." ...|$|E

She habitually omits Mia's mother's surname [...] "Thermopolis" [...] from her granddaughter's lengthy list of names and titles, much to Mia's annoyance. She speaks French most of the time, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> also speak English.

2500|$|Cameron is a Terminator whom John Connor {{sent back}} from 2027 {{to protect his}} earlier self. Her model and exact {{capabilities}} are not known, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> mimic human mannerisms better than the T-800 model could, and she can also consume small amounts of food, a first for Terminators. Her name is an homage to Terminator film franchise creator James Cameron. Glau {{had not seen the}} Terminator films prior to being cast as Cameron Phillips, whose role in the series was initially kept concealed but was later revealed to be a Terminator sent from the future to protect John. Friedman had previously wanted to cast Glau in a pilot he wrote four years prior to The Sarah Connor Chronicles, but she was already committed to Serenity. Glau almost did not audition for the role because of her preconceptions of the character and she felt that she did not have [...] "that Terminator look". On playing Cameron, Glau said she was [...] "intimidated" [...] by the role because it was a challenge for her to balance the human and robot characteristics. Later in the series it is revealed that Cameron assumed the identity of a resistance fighter, , before being reprogrammed.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{characters}} of Super Mario Bros. 2 have been assimilated into the greater Mario universe as well, such as Birdo, Pokeys, Bob-ombs, and Shy Guys. This {{is the first}} game in which Princess Toadstool and Toad are featured as playable characters. Princess Peach eventually starred in other Mario games such as Super Princess Peach. Toad has received supporting roles in later Mario games and has starred in games like Wario's Woods, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and [...] Super Mario Bros. 2 is the first game where Luigi received the physical appearance he has today; notably, he is taller than Mario. In the Super Smash Bros. series, Peach {{not only has the}} ability to pluck and throw vegetables, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> also float in mid-air both in the same fashion as in this game. Super Smash Bros. Melee has a stage called Mushroom Kingdom II, which is based on Super Mario Bros. 2, though the visuals are more similar to the version seen in Super Mario All-Stars. The stage also has characters in their 2D sprite form, including Pidgit and Birdo. Luigi's jump in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U features a replication of the [...] "fluttering legs" [...] animation that made up his jump cycle in this game, and both versions feature red grass that randomly appears in stages, with characters pulling them to reveal random items, similar to what happens in the game. [...] The 1989 cartoon television series The Super Mario Bros. Super Show features characters from Super Mario Bros. 2.|$|E
2500|$|Prima Games' {{guide to}} Shaolin Monks states she is [...] "quick enough for {{moderate}} damage, and {{has some of}} the most potent special moves in the game," [...] but her limitation is she needs to be fighting at close range to make an use of it. Regarding Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, however, Prima declared Kitana [...] "a tough character to win with" [...] and [...] "like many of the other low tier character types, she's lacking in almost every aspect" [...] (even as she [...] "is a little better on defense than she is on offense"). She was rated overall only 4/10 for this game. Prima's official guide for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, on the other hand, called her [...] "one of the more dangerous characters in the game due to her speed and extremely effective move-set." [...] Their official guide for 2011's Mortal Kombat deemed Kitana a capable fighter who once again [...] "is at her deadliest in the corner" [...] and is also especially good if played against Baraka and Cyber Sub-Zero. Prima observed Kitana in MK2011 as her [...] "cheapest" [...] incarnation so far, stating [...] "Kitana is not only one of the most damaging characters in the game, but in addition to the Fan Lift and Square Wave Punch, she can combo her Air Fan almost any time an opponent is airborne." [...] According to Prima's guide to MKX, [...] "Kitana {{is one of the more}} unique characters in the game" [...] due to her inheriting many of Jade's special moves, and she [...] "is a zoning character at heart, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> play offensively or defensively" [...] depending of a variation chosen. The guide recommended the [...] "Mournful" [...] variant for former Jade players, and the [...] "Assassin" [...] variant, which [...] "tries to take the generally defensive style Kitana has in Mortal Kombat X and add some offensive firepower to it," [...] for veteran Kitana players.|$|E
