5|$|Harding's biographers, writing while Britton's {{allegations}} remained uncertain, differed {{on their}} truth; Russell believed them unquestioningly while Dean, having reviewed Britton's papers at UCLA, regarded them as unproven.

A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E

Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} series of Torchwood, the Torchwood website, located at torchwood.org.uk, recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an {{alternate}} reality game {{made up of}} electronic literature {{in the form of}} fictional intercepted blogs, newspaper cutouts and confidential letters and IM conversations <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood. For the second series in 2008, a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures. The BBC America Torchwood also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of d√©tente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E

5|$|In June 1893, {{when the}} Australasian Federal League was formed {{at a meeting}} in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined {{immediately}} and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 Corowa Conference and a League delegate to the 1896 Bathurst Conference, informal conferences held <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the League (primarily based in Sydney), the Australian Natives' Association (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected Constitutional Convention to be charged with drafting the Bill for the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which {{came to be known as}} the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|Phenotypic traits can be {{displayed}} in one sex and desired {{in the other}} sex, causing a positive feedback loop called a Fisherian runaway, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock. An alternate theory proposed by the same Ronald Fisher in 1930 is the sexy son hypothesis, that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the same sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection {{is often associated with}} sexual dimorphism, including differences in body size between males and females of a species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
