40|$|Identification {{of tomato}} <b>infectious</b> <b>{{chlorosis}}</b> virus, the causal agent of chlorosis disease on tomato in Cipanas West Java by sequencing of main coat protein gene nucleotide. Tomato <b>infectious</b> <b>chlorosis</b> virus (TICV) causes chlorosis on tomato. Tomatoes infected by this virus shows interveinal yellowing, necrotic, bronzing, brittleness, and declining in productivity. This study aims {{to identify the}} causal agent of chlorotic disease on tomato by sequencing the coat protein gene. The methods involve collecting infected plants, total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, DNA amplification, visualization {{of the results of}} reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and phylogenetic analysis using BLAST, clustal w, Bioedit v 7. 0. 5. 3, MEGA v 6 : 06. RT-PCR using spesific primers (CP-F TICV Bam and TICV R-Hind) amplified a DNA band of 792 bp, which has been successfully sequenced and identified as TICV. Nucleotide sequences homology analysis showed that TICV Indonesia_TWJ isolate Cipanas is the same strain as TICV from other countries (99. 4 – 100 %), such as Spain, Greece, USA, France, and Italy...|$|R
40|$|Expression {{of tomato}} <b>infectious</b> <b>chlorosis</b> virus coat protein gene on Escherichia coli. Tomato <b>infectious</b> <b>chlorosis</b> virus (TICV) is the causal agent of {{chlorotic}} disease of tomato. Detection of TICV {{can be carried}} out by RT-PCR and serological test. Titer of TICV in plant tissue is very low because TICV is limited to phloem. Serological detection of TICV requires antiserum which is not available in Indonesia. Producing antibody through cloning and coat protein gene (TICV CP gene) expression is a promising approach in producing antiserum. The objective {{of this study was to}} express TICV CP gene as antigen for antiserum production. TICV CP gene was amplified using RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from TICV infected leaves collected from Cipanas, Cianjur, West Java. The amplified CP gene was then sequenced and sub-cloned into pET 21 b expression vector, transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL 21 DE 3 (pLysS) and induced expression using IPTG 1 mM overnight at 37 °C. CP that contains 6 xhistag was purified using NiNTAspin column and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The size of TICV CP gene was 750 bp and the gene was expressed on pET 21 b vector and SDS-PAGE showed a 29 kDa band...|$|R

40|$|Cucumber mosaic virus, Tomato spotted wilt virus, Tomato mosaic virus, Tomato {{chlorosis}} virus, Pepino mosaic virus, Torrado tomato {{virus and}} Tomato <b>infectious</b> <b>chlorosis</b> virus cause serious damage and significant economic losses in tomato crops worldwide. The {{early detection of}} these pathogens is essential for preventing the viruses from spreading and improving their control. In this study, a procedure based on two multiplex RT-PCRs was developed for the sensitive and reliable detection of these seven viruses. Serial dilutions of positive controls were analysed by this methodology, {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by ELISA and singleplex versions of RT-PCR. The multiplex and singleplex RT-PCR assays were able to detect specific targets at the same dilution and were 100 times more sensitive than ELISA. The multiplex versions were able to detect composite samples containing different concentrations of specific targets at ratios from 1 : 1 to 1 : 1000. In addition, 45 symptomatic tomato samples collected in different tomato-growing areas of Sicily (Italy) were analysed by multiplex RT-PCR, singleplex RT-PCR and commercially available ELISA tests. Similar results were obtained using the RT-PCR techniques, with a higher sensitivity than ELISA, revealing a common occurrence of mixed infections and confirming the presence of these seven virus species in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Crops of globe {{artichoke}} (Cynara scolymus) in Manouba and Bizerte regions, Tunisia, were surveyed {{in spring and}} autumn 2012 {{for the presence of}} key artichoke viruses. A total of 336 leaf samples were collected randomly from plants that were either asymptomatic or showing virus-like symptoms. These were tested for Artichoke Italian latent virus (AILV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Artichoke mottled crinkle virus (AMCV), Pelargonium zonate spot virus (PZSV), Artichoke latent virus (ArLV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Potato virus X (PVX), Tomato <b>infectious</b> <b>chlorosis</b> virus (TICV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). Results from dot-blot hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed the occurrence of AILV and BYMV {{for the first time in}} Tunisia, and confirmed that of TICV on artichoke crops. ArLV and AILV were the most frequent viruses detected, whereas infections of AMCV, CMV and PVX had a lower incidence. PZSV, TuMV and TSWV were not detected in any of the samples collected. Notable differences were observed between results from spring and autumn surveys, probably as a consequence of the different vegetatives status of the plants and different leaf sample conditions (fresh versus dried).

Do total de plantas avaliadas, nove espécies foram suscetíveis ao isolado testado de ToCV, indicando a potencial capacidade dessas plantas de atuarem como hospedeiras alternativas de ToCV em campo. Concluiu-se então que é necessária maior preocupação com as plantas Amaranthus hibridus, Solanum americanum, Nicandra physaloides e Physalis angulata, pois além de suscetíveis a ToCV, são plantas altamente infestantes em lavouras de tomate e potenciais hospedeiras alternativas do vírus na ausência ou na presença da cultura.

As cultivares de tomateiro resistentes foram previamente infectadas por ToCV pelo inseto vetor e, posteriormente, inoculadas com os tospovírus Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV) e Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV). Após a inoculação, as plantas resistentes não foram infectadas pelos tospovírus, avaliadas visualmente e por teste sorológico (Dot-Elisa). Adicionalmente, foi utilizado outro modelo biológico com Nicotiana benthamina não transgênica e transgênica, transformada constitutivamente com o gene Sw- 5. As plantas transgênicas resistentes previamente infectadas por ToCV e posteriomente inoculadas com os tospovírus apresentaram sintoma de lesão local, indicando resistência e ausência de infecção sistêmica.

This crop is affected by a large variety of pests and pathogens, including some viruses. The major species are found within the genus Begomovirus, Tospovirus and Crinivirus. The criniviruses are emerging viruses, with two known species in tomato Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) and Tomato <b>infectious</b> <b>chlorosis</b> virus (TICV). They were identified in the mid 90 s, in the United States. In Brazil, only ToCV was reported in tomatoes. Genetically, ToCV consists of two single-stranded RNA molecules, encapsidated in long and flexuous viral particles. They are transmitted by three whitefly species: Bemisia tabaci, Trialeurodes vaporariorum and T. abutiloneus. In tomato, the main symptoms are characterized by chlorotic spots, which evolve to strong internerval chlorosis, mainly visualized in the lower leaves. The first report of ToCV in Brazil was made in 2006 and since then the virus has been found in the main producing regions of tomato of the country. However, it has been poorly studied. Due to this demand, the aim of this study was to determine the host range of ToCV in Brazil. A total of 50 species of cultivated and non-cultivated plants was tested in inoculation with ToCV by the insect vector (B. tabaci biotype B). Nine species were shown to be susceptible to ToCV infection, indicating the potential ability of these plants to act as alternative hosts of ToCV in the field. Therefore, it was concluded that the growers are concerned with the following plants: Amaranthus hibridus, Solanum americanum, Nicandra physaloides and Physalis angulata. They were all susceptible to ToCV, and are frequently found in tomato crops. They are potential virus alternative hosts in the absence of tomato plants, and when tomatoes are present, they can act as inoculum source of ToCV to these plants. The possible synergism between ToCV and the tospovirus Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) was recently reported. In this interaction, apparently a ToCV infection foster TSWV infection in TSWV-resistant plants (contatining the Sw- 5 gene). The interaction between two or more viruses can result in unexpected pathological consequences and because of this possible impact in the Brazilian tomato production, we evaluated this synergism between ToCV and tospovirus in tomatoes in the Brazilian conditions. The tospovirus-resistant cultivars Predador and Viradoro were selected, and the susceptible cultivar Dominador was used as control in the assays. Resistant tomato cultivars were previously infected with ToCV by the insect-vector and then inoculated with tospoviruses Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV) and Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV). After inoculation, the resistant plants were not infected, confirmed by visual inspection and a sorologic test (Dot-Elisa). In addition, a similas test was performed using transgenic and non-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants, which are constitutively transformed with the gene Sw- 5. The resistant transgenic plants previously infected with ToCV and subsequently inoculated with TCSV and GRSV showed local lesion symptoms, indicating resistance and absence of systemic infection. The prior infection of the resistant plants with ToCV did not alter the expression of the Sw- 5 gene. It is believed that this absence of resistance breakdown is possibly associated with the tomato variety and the viral species that were used. The identification of alternative hosts of ToCV and undertanding the interaction of the viruses in cases of mixed infection are essential information to enable the success of any virus control strategy...|$|R
