5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} that could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people.

A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and {{did not include the}} tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
