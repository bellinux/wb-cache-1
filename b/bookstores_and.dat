5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> souvenir shops.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal soon {{developed}} {{into its own}} independent record labels and networks. The first Christian metal label was Pure Metal Records, a sublabel of Refuge Records. Soon there appeared other labels such as R.E.X. Records and Intense Records. Fanzines were published in several countries, with Heaven's Metal as {{the first one in}} the US in 1985. During that time almost every Christian record label became interested in Christian metal, and they advertised the newly signed metal bands on their roster on Heaven's Metal since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon Heaven's Metal achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication. Heaven's Metal achieved a dedicated flock of 15,000 readers. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered on the magazine. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the more underground Christian metal releases were typically distributed in Christian <b>bookstores,</b> <b>and</b> those as well as the fanzines also traded Christian metal cassette copies with the music fans.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} also {{opened the door for}} the first honest look at Czechoslovakia’s past by Czechoslovakia’s people. Many of the {{investigations}} centered on the country’s history under communism, especially in the instance of the Joseph Stalin-period. In another television appearance, Goldstucker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writer’s Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert, to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> libraries, and the literary world. Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily Prace (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists Union, which by March 1968 had already convinced the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions for foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.|$|E

5|$|The Tokyo Mew Mew manga {{series was}} well {{received}} by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, {{the first volume}} sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume {{at the low end}} of the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, with most of the series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga, based on sales from both mainstream <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of à la Mode saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to mainstream bands that have some songs incorporating literary references among a wider repertoire of music (notably Led Zeppelin to The Lord of the Rings), wizard rock bands take their inspiration entirely from the Harry Potter universe. In preserving {{the promotion of}} reading, too, bands like to perform in libraries, <b>bookstores,</b> <b>and</b> schools. The bands have also performed at the fan conventions.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Word Books, Inc. (now HarperCollins) {{commissioned}} Hank Ketcham Enterprises, Inc. {{to produce}} a series of ten comic books under the title Dennis and the Bible Kids, with the usual cast of characters reading (and sometimes partly acting out) the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, Esther, Jesus, and other Biblical characters. These were sold through Christian <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> related outlets. Each issue contained several inspirational renderings by Hank Ketcham himself.|$|E

With Nova Studios in financial distress, Higgins and Masters struck a deal: Catalina would purchase {{the rights to the}} unreleased Boys Town. Masters would be free to sell the rights to all his other films to another vendor. Catalina would also hire Masters as its head of production, where he would also be free to write and direct films on an occasional basis.|$|E
25|$|New York's Hungarian {{community}} {{reached its}} zenith of almost 125,000 {{in the middle}} of the 20th century, the largest of any city in the nation. The area around the church had a strong Hungarian presence, with many <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> restaurants catering to its tastes. It declined over the rest of the century as the descendants of the original immigrants gradually assimilated and moved to Queens or the suburbs. New immigrants attended the church but often settled outside Manhattan as the area had begun to gentrify. The church continues to serve them, holding services in Hungarian every Sunday.|$|E

25|$|In January 1985, Dahmer {{was hired}} as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights a week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an {{incident}} occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform fellatio upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition, the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's gay bars, <b>bookstores,</b> <b>and</b> gay bathhouses. He is also known to have stolen a male mannequin from a store, which he briefly used for sexual stimulation before his grandmother, having discovered the item stowed in a closet, demanded that he discard it.|$|E

Stores {{that came to be}} known as [...] "New Age shops" [...] opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as [...] "New Age bookstores", [...] while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> then websites like Amazon.com.|$|E
500|$|Doug Van Pelt of HM Magazine {{stated that}} Christian metal had its [...] "heyday" [...] {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. By 1987, {{there were more than}} a hundred Christian metal bands, and their records were sold at both Christian <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> non-Christian retails. By 1988, the four largest Christian metal bands (excluding the {{mainstream}} success Stryper) were Bloodgood, Barren Cross, Whitecross, and Leviticus. The Kentucky-based band Bride initially played speed metal, particularly on Live to Die, and reached a wider audience when they released Snakes in the Playground (1992). Despite being criticized for their abrupt changes in style in favor of what's [...] "hot", are still considered [...] "a primeval force at the centre of Christian heavy metal." ...|$|E
500|$|Geoff Ryman wrote several award-winning {{novels and}} short stories that {{prominently}} feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of The Child Garden (1989), an outsider {{because of her}} resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into {{a relationship with a}} similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. Lust (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. Was (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally-challenged abused child, linked by their connection to The Wizard of Oz books and film. In a Locus magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: “In 1990, if you had asked me which was the worst thing to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then Was came out.... They had it in the gay section of <b>bookstores</b> <b>and</b> they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay." ...|$|E
