There is a need to investigate the reasons behind and the possible solutions for, the lack of trust between these two groups. Forest <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> in Ockelbo municipality where interviewed in October 2015. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were asked to subjectively grade their level of trust on a scale of 1 to 10 were 1 was the lowest and 10 was the highest. The results showed the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> trust in the cutting planners averaged 6. 9. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> expressed a clear preference for cutting planners who had practical experience operating a forest machine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} carry out design of a small scale {{electrically}} powered <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> for a developing nation, case for Zimbabwe. The bending of metal is of great importance {{in the manufacture of}} products such as nut shelling machines and maize shelling machines. Currently being used at Company X engineering is a manual <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> with a single operation hence this design will help {{to increase the number of}} metals being bent, an increase in the efficiency and production. The paper deals with manufacturing or bending of sheet metal by using power operated sheet <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> Especially discussion made the productivity analysis of manually or power operated sheet <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> Considering manual operation is replaced by power operated devices. It also gives information about limitation of manually operated sheet <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> and power operated sheet <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> The existing machines are limited to a single operation. The aim of the research is to increase the number of bent parts and to place an adjustable table to suit the height of the user thereby reducing back pain internal injuries in the long run. The researchers visited the Company X to gather information concerning the problems faced by the employees. Material tests which are of great value were carried out and the use of software. A Plate Rolling Machine is a machine that will roll different kinds of metal sheet into a round or conical shape and a rod <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> will roll or bend different kinds of metal sheet into right angles or circular shapes. The research aims at making it possible to do the operations on a single machine. We recommend the machine to be automated and the use of a servo motor to reduce human injuries at the workshop. Use of oils and maintenance is of great value to increase the life span of the machine...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new flexible <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> and its practical applications. The proposed machine uses a new method. When tubes are {{fed into the}} fixed and mobile dies, they are bent by shifting the relative position of the mobile die. The bending radius {{is controlled by the}} relative distance and orientation between the mobile die and the tube. The bending angle is controlled by the length of the fed tube. This forming process has a big advantage. A change of the expected bending shape will need no change in the tooling system but only a new definition of the motion of the active die and the length of the fed tube. The active die movements are controlled by a 6 -DOF parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM) with hydraulic servo drive. Making use of the PKM serves not only to achieve a complete motion along six axes but also to obtain a high dynamic motion of the <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> Application examples show that the <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> can be applied to designer's interiors, universal designed products, and automotive parts. Until now these processes have been difficult to achieve using a conventional <b>bending</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
