2500|$|Since 2008 France has a <b>bonus-malus</b> system {{offering}} a financial incentive, or bonus, {{for the purchase}} of cars with low carbon emissions, and a fee, or malus, {{for the purchase of}} high-emission vehicles. The bonus applies to private and company vehicles purchased on or after 5 December 2007 and are deduced from the purchase price of the vehicle. The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration.

5000|$|In insurance, a <b>bonus-malus</b> system (BMS) is {{a system}} that adjusts the premium paid by a {{customer}} according to his individual claim history.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>bonus-malus</b> (Latin for good-bad) is {{used for}} a number of {{business}} arrangements which alternately reward (bonus) or penalize (malus). It is used, for example, in the call center and insurance industries.|$|E
50|$|In {{executive}} compensation, {{particularly at}} banks, <b>bonus-malus</b> refers to schemes where annual bonuses {{are held in}} escrow (do not immediately vest), and can be reduced retroactively (clawed back) in case of losses in future years.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a basic}} {{question}} under <b>Bonus-malus</b> system based on insurance customer’s point of view, that is, “Should an insurance customer carry an incurred loss himself, or should he make a claim to the insurance company?”. Hence, an insurance customer prefers to choose self-financing an occurred loss by carrying a small loss himself {{in order to avoid}} an increased future premium, instead of financing the loss by compensation from the insurance company. This strategy is called bonus hunger of the insurance customer. In this strategy, the insurance customer prefers the most profitable financial alternative, after a loss occurrence. A well-designed <b>bonus-malus</b> system must take bonus hunger into consideration.|$|E
5000|$|In call centers, a <b>bonus-malus</b> {{arrangement}} is a {{section in the}} contract between the company buying the call center services (buyer) and the company providing the call center services (call center) allowing for a payment to be made from one company to the other. As part of the contract, both companies agree {{on a set of}} Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These are measurements for how the call center is performing. If the call center is performing poorly, then there would be a malus payment (payment from the call center company to the buyer). If the call center is doing well, then there is a bonus payment from the buyer to the call center company. <b>Bonus-malus</b> payments are in addition to the normal cost of call center services.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adoption}} of plug-in electric {{vehicles in the}} France is actively supported by the French government through a <b>bonus-malus</b> system and other incentives. The government provides subsidies towards the purchase of all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids with low [...] emissions. The French government also set up a national purchase incentive scheme for all-electric utility vans.|$|E

50|$|Bonus {{usually is}} a {{discount}} in the premium which is given on {{the renewal of}} the policy if no claim {{is made in the}} previous year. Malus is an increase in the premium if there is a claim in the previous year. <b>Bonus-malus</b> systems are very common in vehicle insurance. This system is also called a no-claim discount (NCD) or no-claims bonus in Britain and Australia.|$|E
50|$|The only measure {{actually}} {{implemented in}} 2008 was the <b>bonus-malus</b> system on new vehicles, establishing penalties for purchasers {{of the most}} polluting vehicles and instead introducing a bonus for the least polluting cars. This measure was introduced by decree for the bonus (decree of 26 December 2007) and {{an amendment to the}} 2007 Rectificative Finance Act (which allows to change during the year the initial Finance Act) for the penalty (malus).

50|$|An {{aircraft}} held on {{the ground}} incurs costs, consequently airlines plan operations to minimise ground time. It is common practice for airlines and aircraft ground handling to have contracts based on a <b>bonus-malus</b> system, penalising the causative agent for delays caused. Delay code properties cover nine category sets for delay. Each category set can be described using either a two digit number code or a two letter alpha code; most airlines use the numeric format but some prefer the alpha. Many airlines further subdivide the IATA codes with an additional character, for more granular delay analysis, {{but these are not}} standardized.|$|E

Opišemo stohastične procese, na podlagi katerih ustvarimo modela za analizo porazdelitve škod posameznika ter celotnega portfelja. Navedemo osnove Bayesove teorije in statistike, ki je temelj za izpeljavo optimalnega <b>bonus-malus</b> sistema. Osrednji del je namenjen primerjavi <b>bonus-malus</b> sistemov. Uporabljamo različne prijeme analize <b>bonus-malus</b> sistema, izračunanih je več koeficientov, na podlagi katerih uvrščamo <b>bonus-malus</b> sisteme med strožje in milejše. Primerjani so <b>bonus-malus</b> sistemi iz evropskih držav (Švica in Finska) s sistemi s tujih celin (Kenija in Tajvan), vsi pa so primerjani z <b>bonus-malus</b> sistemom, ki se trenutno uporablja v Zavarovalnici Maribor. V zadnjem delu konstruiramo optimalni <b>bonus-malus</b> sistem s pomočjo modela statistične igre med naravo in aktuarstvom. Izpeljava temelji na Bayesovi statistiki s pomočjo linearne kombinacije apriorne premije in škodnega vedenja. Tak <b>bonus-malus</b> sistem je pošten do vseh zavarovancev, kar pomeni, da vsak posameznik plača premijo, sorazmerno njegovi škodni pogostosti. Hkrati pa z zelo strogimi premijskimi razredi malusa izravna premijske razrede bonusa do te mere, da je povprečna premijska stopnja enaka 100. The thesis {{focuses on}} the <b>bonus-malus</b> system and its use in the motor vehicle {{insurance}} segment. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the <b>bonus-malus</b> system is identified with a Markov chain. Described are stochastic processes on the basis of which we have created two models for analysing the distribution of claims of an individual, and of the total portfolio. The principal features of Bayes 2 ̆ 7 Theorem and statistics, which form a basis for the implementation of an optimal <b>bonus-malus</b> system, are set out in this part of the thesis. The central part of the thesis deals with a comparison of different <b>bonus-malus</b> systems. Various models of the <b>bonus-malus</b> system analysis are presented, and several coefficients are calculated, on the basis of which we classify <b>bonus-malus</b> systems into more rigorous or more lenient ones. A comparison is made of <b>bonus-malus</b> systems used in some European countries (Switzerland and Finland) with those used in countries on other continents (Kenya and Taiwan), all of which are compared with the <b>bonus-malus</b> system currently used in Zavarovalnica Maribor. In the last part of the thesis, we have created an optimal <b>bonus-malus</b> system by means of a statistical match between nature and the actuarial science. The derivation is based on Bayesian statistics by use of a linear combination of an a priori premium and indemnity behaviour. Such <b>bonus-malus</b> system is fair to all insurance holders, meaning that each individual pays a premium in proportion to his/her claim frequency. At the same time, by applying very rigorous malus classes, this system levels off premium classes to the extent that the average premium rate equals 100...|$|E
40|$|Title: Modelling Bonus - Malus Systems Author: Marika Stroukalová Department: Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics Supervisor: RNDr. Lucie Mazurová, Ph. D., KPMS MFF UK Abstract: In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} <b>bonus-malus</b> tariff systems {{commonly}} used to adjust the a priori set premiums according to the individual claims during mo- tor third party liability insurance. The main aim of this thesis is to describe the standard model based on the Markov chain. For each <b>bonus-malus</b> class we also determine the relative premium ("relativity"). Another objective of this thesis is to find optimal values for the relativities {{taking into account the}} a priori set premiums. We apply the theoretical model based on the stationary distribu- tion of <b>bonus-malus</b> classes on real-world data and a particular real <b>bonus-malus</b> system used in the Czech Republic.
