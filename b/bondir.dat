5000|$|Santa Cruz (meaning {{holy cross}} in Portuguese) {{is the largest}} village in Goa with a {{population}} of 21,000 people all from different religions and also from different parts of India. Geographically, it is situated in the North Goa district in the Sub-District of Ilhas de Goa (Which means Islands of Goa in Portuguese) or Tiswadi (thirty villages in Konkani) Taluka. Santa Cruz is bounded north with Rio de Ourem (river of gold Estuary in Portuguese), the neighbouring villages are Merces ("à mercê de" [...] translates into [...] "at the mercy of" [...] in English) village which stretches from the north-east to the east (on {{the east side of the}} NH 17), Bambolim which stretches from east to the south and Taleigao which stretches from the south to the west. Panjim, the capital city of the state of Goa located on the largest of the islands and is to its northwest. This village is sub-divided into 11 wards, each of which has its own individuality within the village viz, Bandh Vaddo (or Bandhar) (southwest of Santa Cruz Church at the foot of Taleigao hillocks), <b>Bondir</b> (around Northeast of Santa Cruz Church (near the Rio de Oureum estuary to its southeast)), Cabesa Ward (around south of Santa Cruz Church at the foot of Bambolim hillocks), Primeiro Bairro (around Santa Cruz Church at sea level), Segundo Bairro (north of Santa Cruz Church at sea level).|$|E
40|$|International audienceCeRhSn and CeIrSn were {{synthesized}} {{from the}} elements via arc-melting. A single crystal from the CeIrSn sample was investigated {{on the basis of}} X-ray diffractometer data: ZrNiAl type, P 2 m, a= 743. 8 (2), c= 407. 58 (7) pm, wR 2 = 0. 0308, 352 F 2 values and 14 variable parameters. An important structural feature of CeIrSn are relatively short Cesingle <b>bondIr</b> distances (4 × 303 and 1 × 308 pm). Hydrogenation of these ternary stannides leads to the formation of the new hydrides CeRhSnH 0. 8 and CeIrSnH 0. 7 which adopt the same crystal symmetry as the original compounds but a larger unit cell volume after hydrogen insertion. Magnetization, electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power measurements reveal a change of the ground state of the cerium from intermediate valence to the nearly trivalent state induced by hydrogenation. Moreover, 119 Sn Mössbauer spectroscopic data of CeRhSn, CeIrSn and their hydrides at 4. 2 and 78 K indicate only one tin site. The isomer shifts are slightly larger for the hydrogenated samples suggesting a slightly higher s electron density at the tin nuclei of the hydrides...|$|E
