Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) {{has a high}} glucose intake irrespective of sugar concentration of nectar {{and it is not}} known how these bats regulate their <b>blood</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> concentrations {{in order to avoid the}} negative effects associated with hyperglycemia. Generally fruit bats have a high amount of sugar intake in a short period of time which could cause a glucose challenge and it is therefore necessary to determine whether these bats are able to regulate their <b>blood</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> levels within normal levels. This study investigated the <b>blood</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> levels of E. wahlbergi before and after feeding.   Epomophorus wahlbergi ’s <b>blood</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> level was relatively low (5. 24 ± 0. 38 mmol/l) before feeding and increased during/after feeding (8. 19 ± 1. 24 mmol/l). However, these levels did not exceed the normal mammalian <b>blood</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> levels (< 10 mmol/l). These bats were able to regulate their <b>blood</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> thus escaping the negative consequences associated with hyperglycemia...|$|R

5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low <b>blood</b> <b>glucose).</b> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in <b>blood</b> <b>glucose,</b> epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a common}} notion that more {{frequent}} hypoglycemia is a disadvantage of intensive/flexible regimens. The frequency of hypoglycemia increases with increasing effort to achieve normal <b>blood</b> <b>glucoses</b> with most insulin regimens, but hypoglycemia can be minimized with appropriate glucose targets and control strategies. The difficulties lie in remembering to test, estimating meal size, taking the meal bolus and eating within the prescribed time, and being aware of snacks and meals that are not the expected size. When implemented correctly, flexible regimens offer greater ability to achieve good glycemic control with easier accommodation to variations of eating and physical activity.|$|R
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
25|$|Due to glycated hemoglobin's {{variability}} (as {{shown in}} the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals. People with HbA1c values at 64mmol/mol or less should be provided additional testing {{to determine whether the}} HbA1c values are due to averaging out high <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> (hyperglycemia) with low <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> (hypoglycemia) or the HbA1c is more reflective of an elevated <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> that does not vary much throughout the day. Devices such as continuous <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> monitoring allow people with diabetes to determine their <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels on a continuous basis, testing every few minutes. Continuous use of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans but not by Medicare in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed at least weekly. Another test that is useful in determining if HbA1c values are due to wide variations of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> throughout the day is 1,5 Anhydroglucitol, also known as GlycoMark. GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences hyperglycemia above 180mg/dL over a two-week period.|$|E

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: To {{test whether}} {{the link between}} birthsize and raised <b>blood</b> {{pressure}} or <b>glucose</b> tolerance is due to genetic or intrauterine factors, we studied whether differences in birthweight between pairs of monozygous and dizygous twins are associated with adult differences in <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>glucose</b> tolerance. Methods: A sample of 58 monozygous and 140 dizygous twins were identified from a register of births in Birmingham, United Kingdom, between 1950 and 1954. The twins had their blood pressure measured and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Results: There were no statistically significant associations between birthweight, length or ponderal index, and either <b>blood</b> pressure or <b>glucose</b> tolerance in the twins. Although there were substantial within-pair differences in birthweight between monozygous and dizygous twin pairs, these differences did not correlate with the adult outcomes. Monozygous correlations, however, for both <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>glucose</b> tolerance were statistically significantly higher than dizygous correlations and a quantitative genetic model suggested statistically significant heritability for these traits. In contrast correlations of birthsize were similar in monozygous and dizygous pairs suggesting only a small genetic component in determining fetal size. Conclusion/interpretation: Our results show that birthsize in twins does not predict adult <b>blood</b> pressure or <b>glucose</b> tolerance. We also suggest that shared genetic determinants for fetal growth and adult outcomes {{are not likely to}} be prevalent or powerful...|$|R
