5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design.

In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the <b>bridge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E
