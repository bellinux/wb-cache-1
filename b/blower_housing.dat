5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{most of the}} stock {{one-piece}} windshields were replaced with two-piece units {{similar to those used}} on the EMD GP20, a move intended to bring standardization of windshield glass to several classes of Santa Fe locomotives and thereby reduce maintenance stockpiles. A [...] "second generation"-style traction motor <b>blower</b> <b>housing</b> was fitted to the left side of later rebuilds.|$|E
5000|$|Rupp minibikes saw {{even more}} cutbacks {{to the lineup}} in 1973. The only bike that {{remained}} was the newly designed Roadster, stylized as the Roadster II. It continued to use a Tecumseh HS40 but with a larger <b>blower</b> <b>housing.</b> It came in two color options, brown and magenta. It continued to use 12" [...] wheels on Rupp Trials tires, with 24 spokes only. Rupp sold their last minibikes in 1976.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic: the {{governor}} mechanism detects air {{flow from the}} flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine's <b>blower</b> <b>housing</b> and linked to the carburetor's throttle shaft. A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. Pneumatic governors are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.|$|E
5000|$|Sonnets from a Lock Box (1929) is {{regarded}} as her best work. [...] It {{is a collection of}} thirty-eight sonnets using the first person, noted for its directness and mystical symbolism. [...] Her final collection of poetry, Last Poems (1944), was published posthumously by Ridgely Torrence. [...] Branch was also the author of A Christmas Miracle and God Bless this House (1925) and Bubble <b>Blower's</b> <b>House</b> (1926).|$|R
50|$|The organ, {{parts of}} which date from 1841 and earlier, is {{essentially}} a Harrison and Harrison of 1914 vintage, but incorporating significant amounts of pipework by Edmund Schulze. It was restored in 1927 and 1949 by Harrison and Harrison; in 1965 by Wood, Wordsworth and in 1997 by Andrew Carter. The restoration of the blowing plant and refurbishment of the <b>blower</b> <b>house</b> were undertaken in 1997 by Allfab Engineering of Methley.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gent {{focuses on}} two major themes: solidarity, {{including}} housing, social policy, employment, regional and economic policy, and durability, including agriculture, nature and animal rights. Van Gent has {{voted against the}} GreenLeft parliamentary party on several important issues: she voted against the marriage of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange and Máxima Zorreguieta, {{because she is a}} republican and she spoke out against GreenLeft's support for the invasion of Afghanistan. Van Gent initiated several legislative programs, concerning legal protection for whistle <b>blowers,</b> <b>housing</b> subsidies for students and constitutional protection of animal welfare. She has criticized lavish parties for departing politicians by saying [...] "you can knock a zero off the price tag for most of them." [...] She was opposed to a reduction in benefits to Turkish and Moroccan parents. She has criticized poor railway performance; she said [...] "They are ‘ready for winter’, except when it snows." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{comprehensive}} topical report {{discusses the}} key {{findings in the}} development of an advanced blower for HVAC applications. The benefits of rearward inclined blades over that of traditional forward inclined blades is well documented, and several prototype wheels are demonstrated in various housings. A comparison of retrofitted blowers to that of three typical units from the industry is presented. The design and modification of the <b>blower</b> <b>housing</b> is addressed and the impact of size limitations on static efficiency is discussed. The roadmap to rearward-inclined wheel technology insertion is presented and typical static efficiency gains are documented...|$|E
40|$|A {{testing program}} was {{undertaken}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an electric utility (Pacific Gas and Electric Co.) {{to compare the}} performance of furnace blowers. This laboratory testing program was undertaken to support potential changes to California Building Standards regarding in-field furnace blower energy use. This technical support includes identifying suitable performance metrics and target performance levels for use in standards. Five different combinations of blowers and residential furnaces were tested for air moving performance. Three different types of blower and motor combinations were tested in two different furnace cabinets. The blowers were standard forward [...] curved impellors and a prototype impeller with reverse-inclined blades. The motors were two 6 -pole permanent split capacitor (PSC) single-phase induction motors, a brushless permanent magnet (BPM) motor and a prototype BPM designed for use with a prototype reverse-inclined impellor. The laboratory testing operated each blower and furnace combination over a range of air flows and pressure differences to determine air flow performance, power consumption and efficiency. Additional tests varied the clearance between the <b>blower</b> <b>housing</b> and the furnace cabinet, and the routing of air flow into the blower cabinet...|$|E
40|$|This {{comprehensive}} topical report {{discusses the}} key {{findings in the}} development of a intelligent integrated blower for HVAC applications. The benefits of rearward inclined blades over that of traditional forward inclined blades is well documented and a prototype blower design is presented. A comparison of the proposed blower to that of three typical units from the industry is presented. The design of the <b>blower</b> <b>housing</b> is also addressed and the impact of size limitations on static efficiency is discussed. Issues of air flow controllability in the rearward inclined blower is addressed and a solution to this problem is proposed. Several motor design options are discussed including inside-out radial flux designs and novel axial flux designs, all are focused on the various blower needs. The control of the motor-blower and airflow through the use of a high density inverter stage and modern digital signal processor is presented. The key technical challenges of the approach are discussed. The use of the motor as a sensor in the larger heating/ventilating system is also discussed. Diagnostic results for both the motor itself and the blower system are presented...|$|E
50|$|He {{later became}} Organist of All Saints', Eastbourne in 1908, and St. Andrew's, Wells Street, London, in 1917. Four years as Assistant Organist of Wells Cathedral {{led him to}} Chichester. In 1931 he left Chichester to become Organist of Ely Cathedral. He retired in 1949. It was during Conway's time as Organist of Chichester Cathedral that an {{electric}} blowing apparatus was provided for the Cathedral organ. The <b>blower</b> was <b>housed</b> in the room off the north transept, {{now known as the}} Plant Room, and the wind was conveyed through to the organ via an underground conduit still in existence.|$|R
50|$|Part of his archive {{and some}} of his {{architectural}} drawings survive and are housed in the Farnham Museum. Some of his archive can also be found in Stedman Blower Architects archive, {{in the hands of the}} <b>Blower</b> Foundation. The <b>houses</b> of Dippenhall remain his most lasting legacy and within a few hectares stand a dozen or so buildings designed, built and altered by him throughout his career. Fortunately most are Grade 2 Listed Buildings and will remain along with his significant contribution to the town centre of Farnham, and the restoration and sensitive infill projects that he designed.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel was}} a {{critical}} success, receiving praise from respected individuals, including the statesman Edmund Burke and literary critic Dr Johnson. It was admired for its comic view of wealthy English society, and for its realistic portrayal of working-class London dialects. It was even discussed by some characters in another epistolary novel of the period: Elizabeth <b>Blower's</b> The Parsonage <b>House</b> (1780). Burney's father read public reviews of the novel before learning that the author was his own daughter. Although the act of publication was radical for a woman {{at that time and}} of her age, he was impressed by the favourable reactions to the book and largely supported her. Certainly, he saw social advantages to having a successful published writer in the family, and was pleased that Frances had achieved recognition through her work.|$|R
