5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner.</b> Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|E
5|$|Torres made a scoring {{start to}} the 2008–09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> away at Sunderland, which was the only goal in a 1–0 win on 16 August 2008. He {{suffered}} a hamstring tear in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, which would keep him out {{for two to three}} weeks. Torres made his return in a 2–1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League and went on to score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2–0 win. He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3–2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit. The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League. Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool. On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres' former club Atlético in the Champions League at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game. Atlético president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to watch the game, but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside. He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007–08 season on 27 October 2008.|$|E
25|$|On 29 December 2009 a new {{definitive}} issue featuring {{periods in}} Maltese history was issued. All the values were issued in Malta's largest miniature sheet, {{with a combined}} face value of €11.42. This was therefore the highest combined face value of a Maltese miniature sheet. On 23 May 2011 the miniature sheet was reissued with MaltaPost's new logo in the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner.</b> Two new values {{were added to the}} set in 2012, while between 2011 and 2015 some of the original values were reprinted with minor differences.|$|E
5000|$|Windows 8 added a bar {{containing}} {{a set of}} five shortcuts known as the [...] "charms", invoked by moving the mouse cursor into the top or <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corners</b> of the screen, or by swiping from the right edge of a compatible touchpad or touch screen. [...] This feature was retained in 8.1.|$|R
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the books was a flipbook composed of the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corners</b> {{of all of the}} book's pages.

When the pages were flipped from front to back, the narrating Animorph could be seen morphing into the animal.|$|R
30|$|STM 4 i.e. DCS-D {{is on the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> side <b>corner</b> in Fig.  1 {{and named}} as the DC grid for {{collection}} and integration of offshore wind power. The DC grid is designed for collecting offshore wind power, supplying offshore load (e.g. oil or gas platform) and integrating them to the onshore AC system. STM 4 {{can be used for}} offshore DC grid planning and system studies to investigate coordinating control methods, protection strategies and transient characteristics of offshore DC grids if the corresponding control functions and protection strategies are implemented in the model.|$|R
500|$|The left panel shows villagers and city-dwellersSerbs, Hungarians and Germansmeeting in Vršac's main {{square to}} sell and {{purchase}} items, as well as simply to converse. The scene is set around mid-morning. It occurs {{against the backdrop of}} a row of shiny, white-washed buildings and the spire of the town's main church is also visible in the background. All the figures are dressed in costumes traditionally worn by their compatriots, making it easier for the viewer to discern their ethnicity. [...] "They interact with ease", the art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "and an aura of general good will envelops the scene". The centre panel depicts a group of peasants in the countryside gathering grapes from a row of vines. The panel to the right shows villagers harvesting their ripened wheat. Two figures are seen bending over in the background, sickles in hand, while a third sharpens his scythe in the foreground. The artist's signature, Joanowits P, {{can be found in the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> of the centre panel.|$|E
500|$|During navigation, an {{indicator}} in the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> {{of the screen}} indicates the presence of enemies {{and the likelihood of}} a battle being triggered. An indicator in the top left-hand corner also shows the current [...] "phase" [...] of Kagutsuchi, a moon-like object hovering in the sky of the Vortex World which shifts its phase as the Protagonist explores. Standard battles are initiated through random encounters, which trigger a transition into a dedicated battle arena. The player party is composed of the Protagonist and three demons: only eight demons can be carried by the Protagonist at the game's opening, but more can be added as the game progresses. At the end of battles, the party gains experience points and Macca, the in-game currency. Party members will level up when enough experience points have been gathered. Upon leveling up, the statistics of allied demons are randomly raised, while the Protagonist's stats can be customized by the player. The Protagonist's abilities and resistances are also influenced by equipping one of 24 different Magatama found in-game. The Protagonist can learn new skills from equipped Magatama when he levels up, and is also granted passive buffs and debuffs which take effect in battle. Magatama will sometimes act violently within the Protagonists, creating different effects depending on the Magatama equipped.|$|E
500|$|Success {{finally came}} in the 2001–02 season. Arsenal regained the league, beating Manchester United at Old Trafford in the {{penultimate}} {{game of the season}} to complete the club's second double under Wenger; Arsenal defeated Chelsea 2–0 to win the FA Cup four days prior. Bergkamp played in 33 league matches, setting up 15 goals, one of which was against Juventus in the second group stage of the Champions League. Holding off two markers, he twisted and turned before feeding the ball to Freddie Ljungberg in the penalty box to score. Bergkamp headed in the winner against Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth-round tie on 27 January 2002, but was shown a red card for a two-footed lunge on defender Jamie Carragher, who himself was sent off for throwing a coin into the crowd. He was subsequently banned for three matches (two league, one FA Cup round). Bergkamp appealed for his ban, but was unsuccessful. He made his return against Newcastle United on 3 March 2002. Early in the match, Arsenal midfielder Robert Pirès played a low pass from the left flank to Bergkamp in the edge of the opponent area with his back to goal. Under pressure from his marker Nikos Dabizas, Bergkamp controlled the ball with one flick and went around the other side before placing the ball precisely into the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> to score. Wenger described the goal as [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "It was not only a magnificent goal but a very important one – I enjoyed it a lot". Bergkamp featured in nine out of the last ten league games, forming a productive partnership with Ljungberg.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not well}} to despise anybody or {{anything}} until {{you know what they}} can do. I have known some very stupid-looking people who could do a sum in the rule-of-three in a minute, and who could add up a column of six figures abreast while I was just making a beginning at the <b>right-hand</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>corner.</b> But stupid-looking beings are often good at other things besides arithmetic.

2500|$|Once {{nomination}} proceedings {{have ended}} on nomination day, the returning officer issues to each candidate, group of candidates or their election agents a permit authorising banners and posters to be displayed. The permit specifies {{the maximum number}} of banners and posters that may be displayed, any restrictions as to the places where or manner in which they must not be displayed, and the period after polling day within which they must be removed. All banners and posters must have a stamp bearing the returning officer's official mark on the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner.</b> They may not be displayed within [...] of any polling station or any shorter distance as the returning officer may specify. Among other things, it is an offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months to alter, deface, destroy, obliterate or remove any banner or poster, or to display a banner or poster {{in such a way as}} to obscure any banner or poster already displayed.|$|E
60|$|Be {{pleased to}} {{consider}} {{here for a}} moment the unknown district of Kot- Kumharsen. It lay cut lengthways by the Indus under the line of the Khusru hills--ramparts of useless earth and tumbled stone. It was seventy miles long by fifty broad, maintained a population of something less than two hundred thousand, and paid taxes to the extent of forty thousand pounds a year on an area that was by rather more than half sheer, hopeless waste. The cultivators were not gentle people, the miners for salt were less gentle still, and the cattle-breeders least gentle of all. A police-post in the top right-hand corner and a tiny mud fort in the top left-hand corner prevented as much salt-smuggling and cattle-lifting as the influence of the civilians could not put down; and in the <b>bottom</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> lay Jumala, the district headquarters--a pitiful knot of lime-washed barns facetiously rented as houses, reeking with frontier fever, leaking in the rain, and ovens in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the later}} consumer-marketed 8-track {{cartridge}} developed later in 1964 by Bill Lear {{which had the}} pinch roller integrated in the cartridge, the Fidelipac cartridge had {{a hole in the}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>bottom</b> front <b>corner</b> of the cartridge, where the pinch roller, built into the player instead, would swing up into place to support the tape up against the capstan. While later machines from ATC, ITC, Harris, and others had machines where the pinch roller would automatically engage into the cartridge when the play button was pressed (the capstan motor was already running when the cart was inserted), early machines such as Sparta, Spot-matic, and others made the operator physically push or pull a lever to get the pinch roller in place before playback could begin. However, the 8-track was slower in speed ( [...] ips compared to Fidelipac's [...] ips) and did not have adequate tape support pads, and thus were not [...] "broadcast quality." [...] The lower speed and narrower tracks in 8-track cartridges led to higher noise and poorer frequency response. The 8-track design also lacked a cue track.|$|R
