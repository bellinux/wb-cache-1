5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford {{and delayed}} the match between Essex Eagles and Surrey Lions to after ten o'clock. When it finally began, {{it had been}} {{shortened}} to five overs a side, and Essex made good use of it as they scored 71 for 3 - Ronnie Irani making 32, while Azhar Mahmood took two for three for Surrey. In reply, Antonio Palladino took two wickets for Essex, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> up for grabs when Surrey needed eight off five after James Middlebrook bowled a wide that went for four - however, he only conceded six runs from the remaining balls of the game, and Surrey finished on 70 for 2. Yet, {{they would have to}} be exceedingly unlucky in their last game to be eliminated, while Essex jumped into the top three and looked to qualify along with them.|$|E

500|$|Hunters, campers, hikers, {{fishermen}} and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains. Rydholm said, [...] "...there {{seemed to be}} no groundswell of sentiment in favor of it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as the though the die was cast and nothing could be done to stop it". The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country [...] and might harm the wilderness. Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel. [...] William C. Weber, a real estate developer from Detroit, owned property along Mountain Lake, in northern Marquette County. A Michigan attorney general's opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two-thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project. The proposed highway was to cross two [...] parcels of Huron Mountain Club property, but that was not enough to halt construction.|$|E
500|$|The game {{took place}} on a Friday evening and was {{televised}} to a national audience of over 12 million. Graham made a slight adjustment to his team's formation, bringing David O'Leary in to play as a sweeper in a back five. His thinking was to nullify Liverpool's attacking threat and {{for much of the}} first half, Arsenal stemmed their opponents' usual passing game. In the second half, Smith scored, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> increasingly likely the title would remain at Anfield as Arsenal struggled to increase their lead. However, deep into stoppage time, Thomas evaded a challenge by Steve Nicol and raced into the penalty area, before slipping the ball past advancing Bruce Grobbelaar to make the score 2–0. The final whistle was blown seconds later, ending Arsenal's 18-year wait to be crowned league champions. Described as [...] "the most dramatic finish in the 120-year history of the English top flight" [...] by BBC Sport in 2008, the title decider at Anfield generated interest in the sport and the events were depicted in Nick Hornby's best-selling book Fever Pitch.|$|E
500|$|Out of the ruts and {{the ways}} of its village, Selborne {{fashioned}} a new natural history. [...] It spoke simply, with a human voice. [...] <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> profoundly. [...] It pioneered a way for students of nature who wished, as White did, not to roam the high Arctic or far Pacific but to fathom their own terrain. [...] It offered a wide world to anyone willing to dig deep. [...] Selborne said: [...] watch narrowly, skim close to the ground. [...] It whispered, hushed, what Thoreau would later broadcast: [...] "We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. [...] Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. [...] We know not where we are." [...] In those words, as in all Walden, Thoreau may have had in mind the village of Selborne and the Reverend Gilbert White--the town reached only by ruts running well beneath the surface, the man whose book had leapt the ruts to round the globe.|$|E

500|$|On November 16, 2004 Destiny's Child {{performed}} [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{during the}} television show Good Morning America broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The song was performed on June 28 during the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles. Midway through the performance, for which the members wore form-fitting, floor-length brown gowns, they randomly picked Terrence Howard, Nelly and Magic Johnson from the audience to the stage and performed a lap dance for them. Corey Moss of MTV News felt that their performance {{was one of the}} more memorable of the night. Emily Tan from the website Idolator noted that the performance was one of the band's best further writing, [...] "No one expected the girls to get as down and dirty as they did... <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like no one was complaining." [...] Steve Baltin writing for Rolling Stone remarked that the group provided [...] "some sizzle". The trio gave a live rendition of [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] again at NBC's The Today Show show on July 29, 2005. A writer of People magazine felt that [...] "Beyoncé shimmies and shakes things up" [...] during the performance. An acoustic version was also performed on MTV in 2005 during the its Spring Break coverage.|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E

We had now arrived {{in the heart of}} the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone {{emphasised}} that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once..." [...] – J.B. Priestley, English Journey, 1934 ...|$|E

2500|$|Of course, {{the other}} {{communities}} trying to attract {{what would become}} Northern Illinois University were not so impressed. A July 1895 editorial in the Oregon Republican complained, [...] "Just where this fish came from is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> haggard and footsore, like it had tramped a long distance. There is some talk of stocking the Kish with salt-cured cod. They stand the pressure all right in either a wet or dry season." [...] The committee paid it no mind and DeKalb was accepted as a finalist to be the host site for the new college. On July 15 each of the finalist communities made their pitch to Goodrich in Chicago.|$|E
2500|$|The film in its {{original}} cut plays out in chronological order, but when Devlin and Emmerich edited the film in the director's cut to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. Only Davidson's upper torso was filmed because Davidson had refused to take out his nipple rings. The first scene {{was a combination of}} model shots and a set in Yuma, Arizona where [...] had been filmed. The scene of the excavation of the Stargate was also filmed in three days in Arizona. A golden look was achieved by filming near the time of sunset. To keep within the limit of the budget, the producers put stick figures with cloth in the distant desert to appear as humans. The original Stargate was painted black, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like a giant tire so it was repainted silver at the last moment.|$|E
2500|$|Costumes for Broadchurch were {{designed}} by freelance costume designer Ray Holman. Holman worked with the actors portraying major characters {{to ensure that the}} costumes fit the character. He spent hours discussing the characters with the actors, and sometimes took the actors shopping or to costume suppliers to find the right look. Holman crafted the [...] "old and saggy" [...] look of Alec Hardy's character to reflect the fact that Hardy [...] "didn't really care what he wore." [...] Often arriving on the set at 6 a.m., Holman ensured that Tennant's suit was appropriately crumpled every day. Holman also designed Ellie Miller's [...] "unflattering grey work suit". Holman and actress Olivia Colman agreed that Ellie was a person who'd lived in a small town her entire life. Having been a uniformed police officer, she'd worked her way up in the ranks but still retained an unconscious desire to appear in uniform. The grey trouser suit was critical to that look. [...] "I did apologise to her about that, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> fantastic and characterised her," [...] Holman said. Beth Lattimer's red dress, seen in episode one, was also Holman's idea. There was disagreement about it, but Holman said he insisted on the red dress. [...] "I wanted the red dress because I knew it would move quite beautifully and she has to run on the beach and I wanted the red against the cliffs," [...] he said.|$|E
