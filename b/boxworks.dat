Studies using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and {{transmission electron microscopy}} have been carded out in order to elucidate the detailed features and origin of the <b>boxwork.</b> In the early stage of weathering, halloysite spheres formed in etch pits {{on the walls of}} microstructural discontinuities in the slightly weathered rock. With further weathering, the halloysite spheres grew to discs or flattened globules, which in turn coalesced to form large planar halloysite plates amid narrow fissures. The halloysite plates were detached by dissolution of the plagioclase ingroundwater. Continued growth of the halloysite tubes in the plates resulted in the wrinkling of the plates. Finally, the plagioclase was completely dissolved by groundwater, leaving the <b>boxwork</b> of wrinkled halloysite walls and large pores. The relatively high rigidity of the <b>boxwork</b> is due to the compact agglomeration f halloysite tubes within the wrinkled halloysite walls. Cation balance calculation shows that A 1 was significantly mobilized uring the formation of the <b>boxwork</b> in the weathering environment. The well-developed microfissures, the high dissolution rate of the calcic plagioclase, and the rapid flow. of groundwater in a mountainous topography with relatively steep (20 ~ slope have been the factors controlling the formation of the porous <b>boxwork</b> in the halloysite-rich kaolin of the Sancheong area...|$|R

50|$|Gossan (eiserner hut or eisenhut) is {{intensely}} oxidized, weathered or decomposed rock, {{usually the}} upper and exposed part of an ore deposit or mineral vein. In the classic gossan or iron cap all that remains is iron oxides and quartz often {{in the form of}} <b>boxworks,</b> quartz lined cavities retaining the shape of the dissolved ore minerals. In other cases quartz and iron oxides, limonite, goethite, and jarosite, exist as pseudomorphs replacing the pyrite and primary ore minerals. Frequently gossan appears as a red stain against the background rock and soil due to the abundance of oxidized iron and the gossan may be a topographic positive area due to the abundance of erosion resistant quartz and iron oxides. Although most gossans are red, orange, or yellow, black gossans from manganese oxides such as pyrolusite, manganite, and especially psilomelane form at the oxidized portion of Mn-rich mineral deposits.|$|E

50|$|Wind Cave National Park is a United States {{national}} park 10 mi {{north of the}} town of Hot Springs in western South Dakota. Established in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, it was the seventh U.S. National Park and the first cave to be designated a {{national park}} anywhere in the world. The cave is notable for its displays of the calcite formation known as <b>boxwork.</b> Approximately 95 percent of the world's discovered <b>boxwork</b> formations are found in Wind Cave. Wind Cave is also known for its frostwork. The cave is also considered a three-dimensional maze cave, recognized as the densest (most passage volume per cubic mile) cave system in the world. The cave is currently the sixth-longest in the world with 140.47 mi of explored cave passageways. Above ground, the park includes the largest remaining natural mixed-grass prairie in the United States.|$|R
40|$|North Pangnirtung, Coronation and Maktak fjords are {{situated}} on Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, Canada, having a common freshwater source {{related to the}} melting of the Penny Ice Cap. Bottom photographs and Holocene core samples analysed for this Thesis were acquired during the 1982 Sedimentology of Arctic Fjords Experiment (S. A. F. E.) cruise of the CSS Hudson and were reinterpreted from an ichnological point of view. Bottom photographs were examined to identify epifaunal and infaunal organisms and their associated trails or burrows exposed on the substrate surface. Locomotion and resting traces produced by echinoderms and gastropods, {{as well as a}} variety of burrows produced by infaunal organisms, were observed. These biogenic structures were then compared to biogenic structures revealed through x-radiograph images and direct observations from Lehigh cores. Intermediate- and deep-tier structures were observed in the ichnofabric of the glaciomarine sediments. Extensive bioturbation by the shallow-tier epibenthic tracemakers, most notably ophiuroid echinoderms (brittlestars), destroyed much of the primary sedimentary fabric resulting in homogenous silty clay sediments. The dominant deep-tier structure consists of an open burrow three-dimensional <b>boxwork</b> which allows for oxygen penetration into the sediment through the burrow walls at depths below the redox zone. Potential tracemakers for these deep-tier structures are likely polychaetes, particularly capitellids. Sandy event beds, associated with mass wasting of delta front and fjord sidewall sediments, are mostly unaffected by bioturbation. Sedimentation rates during these events were high and re-establishment of the three-dimensional burrow <b>boxwork</b> occurred quickly as normal conditions of suspension fall-out resumed. Deep-tier structures are not observed in sandy intervals indicating that the tracemaker preferred finer-grained sediments. The three-dimensional burrow <b>boxwork</b> occurs pervasively in the cores, though the intensity of bioturbation is greater in cores distal to the fjord head...|$|R
5000|$|The cave {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the marble formation's erosion during the Toarcian age of the Early Jurassic epoch, dating back to around 180 Ma. It {{consists}} of three interconnected caves and has three entrances, arranged into two separate floors. Each cave is different in hydrologic properties, stalactites and stalagmites. The total length of the Dupnisa Cave is 3200 m. Two caves, named [...] "Kuru" [...] ("Dry") and [...] "Kız" [...] ("Maiden"), are situated on the upper level running 2720 m, of which the lower cave, called [...] "Sulu" [...] ("Wet"), is located 60 m underneath. The [...] "Kuru" [...] is extremely rich in terms of stalactites, stalagmites, stalagnates and wall dripstones, reaching massive proportions. It is the source of the spring water flowing into Rezve Creek, the frontier between Turkey and Bulgaria. In contrast, the lower cave contains subterranean streams and lakes with draperies and <b>boxworks</b> over the lakes. The lower cave is at an elevation of 345 m AMSL. The cave's exit is 61 m higher than the entrance.|$|E
40|$|Concretions {{cemented}} by {{iron oxide}} are abundant and diverse in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of southern Utah. Some of these structures are considered terrestrial analogs for concretions imaged on Mars. The Navajo concretions can be spheroidal, pipelike, or tabular with multicompartmented <b>boxworks.</b> These iron oxide concretions typically display a rinded structure: dense sandstone rinds cemented by iron oxide surround pale, iron-poor sandstone cores. Within a single structure, the iron-rich rinds may be single or multiple. Pseudomorphs of siderite {{are present in}} local residual, iron-rich cores of <b>boxworks.</b> Workers {{in the late nineteenth}} through mid-twentieth centuries, many of whom found evidence for siderite precusors, concluded that many spherical, rinded, iron oxide-cemented concretions were formed by centripetal precipitation of iron oxide inward from the perimeter of the concretion; in contrast, the walls of pipelike concretions of iron oxide grew centrifugally outward. We interpret the Navajo spheroids and <b>boxworks</b> as centripetal products of the oxidation of siderite-cemented (precursor) concretions that were very similar in both size and shape to the current concretions: rinds grew (thickened) inward toward the internal source of Fe(II). Siderite pseudomorphs appear to be absent from spheroids and many <b>boxworks</b> because all siderite was dissolved. In the cores of the larger <b>boxworks</b> some siderite was oxidized in situ; the Fe(II) did not migrate away from the original siderite crystals. The oxidation process was mediated by iron-oxidizing microbes and began at concretion perimeters when oxidizing groundwater started to displace the CO 2 - and methane-bearing water that had precipitated the siderite. In contrast, pipelike concretions are centrifugal—rinds formed around a cylindrical reaction front and thickened outward toward Fe(II) and away from the oxygenated water flowing within the cylinders. The cylindrical shape of the reaction front was produced by self-organizing feedbacks between dissolution of dispersed siderite cement and focused flow through a heterogeneous sandstone matrix...|$|E
40|$|Pyrrhotites in {{polished}} sections {{from more}} than twenty stratabound massive sulphide and magmatic nickel-copper deposits in Norway were studied under the microscope using the magnetic olloid method. In both types of deposits, two distinct styles of intergrowths between monoclinic and hexagonal pyrrhotites were found: crystallographically-controlled lamellar intergrowths and fissure-controlled irregular intergrowths. Lamellar intergrowths consist of crystallographically oriented monoclinic lamellae occurring in a hexagonal matrix and were produced originally by exsolution from hexagonal pyrrhotite on cooling. Irregular intergrowths comprise blades and patches of monoclinic pyrrhotite occurring along fissures and grain boundaries of hexagonal pyrrhotite, and were formed by interactions between hexagonal grains and sulphur-rich hydrothermal solutions. Increase in lamella thickness and spacing, development of lamella zonations, wedge-shaped composite ends, <b>boxworks</b> and composite lamellae were caused by progressive lamellae coarsening and maturation during natural annealing, {{which could have been}} promoted by anisotropic stress.

40|$|Petrological {{studies using}} X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), optical microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM-EDS) and electron microprobe analyzer (WDS) showed the mineralogical, micromorphological and geochemical transformations due to the bauxitisation of anorthosite from the Barro Alto Stratiform Mafic–Ultramafic Complex (Central Brazil). The hydrolytic alteration of the anorthosite occurred in two different stages {{in accordance with the}} order of stability of the minerals to the weathering: firstly the bytownite and secondly the ferromagnesian minerals. The weathering solutions, benefited from the existing network of fractures, percolated the weakness zones of the minerals characterising the microsystem of contact in which cores of plagioclase and ferromagnesian minerals were formed. In the first stage, the plagioclases are altered directly to gibbsite, and at an early stage, during the change process, the gibbsite crystals surround the primary ferromagnesian minerals that are totally or partially preserved. The transformation is isalteritic and is responsible for formation of porous alteromorphs consisting of septa of coarse gibbsite and fine gibbsite. As the weathering process advances, the ferromagnesian minerals directly enter to goethite. The <b>boxworks</b> of gibbsite and goethite characterise a primary plasmic microsystem...|$|E
40|$|While the {{presence}} {{of water on the}} surface of early Mars is now well known, the volume, distribution, duration, and timing of the liquid water have proven difficult to determine. This study makes use of a distinctive boxwork-rich sedimentary layer on Mount Sharp to map fluid-based cementation from orbital imagery and estimate the minimum volume of water present when this sedimentary interval was formed. The <b>boxwork</b> structures on Mount Sharp are decameter-scale light-toned polygonal ridges that are unique compared to previous observations of Martian fractured terrain because they are parallel-sided ridges with dark central linear depressions. This texture and the sedimentary setting strongly imply that the ridges are early diagenetic features formed in the subsurface phreatic groundwater zone. High-resolution orbital imagery was used to map the volume of light-toned cemented ridges. Based on the cemented volume, a minimum of 5. 25 × 105 [*]m^ 3 of cement was deposited within the fractures. Using a brine composition based on observations of other Martian cements and modeling the degree of evaporation, each volume of cement requires 800 – 6700 pore volumes of water, so the mapped <b>boxwork</b> ridge cements require a minimum of 0. 43 [*]km^ 3 of water. This is a significant amount of groundwater that must have been present at the − 3620 [*]m level, 1050 [*]m above the current floor of Gale Crater, providing both a new constraint on the possible origins of Mount Sharp and a possible future science target for the Curiosity rover where large volumes of water were present, and early mineralization could have preserved a once-habitable environment...|$|R
