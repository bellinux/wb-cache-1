5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been <b>blown</b> <b>out.</b> The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is invited}} to the White House for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane {{carrying}} Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, the Dukes were <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders led {{the team}} with only 12points. One analyst {{attributed}} this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, {{as well as the}} continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed the game with a sprained ankle.|$|E

5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} was lit by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they were <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares.|$|E
5|$|On the Cayman Islands, the {{hurricane}} caused strong waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting to <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> windows and beach erosion. Strong waves {{damaged or destroyed}} many docks on the south shore of the islands, and also sank one dive ship near Grand Cayman. In addition, numerous incoming and outgoing flights were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Arizona {{came off}} of a 7-5 (4-5 in conference) season in coach Rich Rodriguez's debut with the team. Arizona started their season by beating Toledo, Oklahoma State, and South Carolina State prior to getting <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> 49-0 by Oregon. Later in the season, Arizona beat USC who was ranked #9. Star running back Ka'Deem Carey had his best {{game of the year}} against Colorado totaling 366 yards to give the Wildcats their sixth win of the season. Their regular season {{concluded}} with a loss to rival Arizona State 41-34.|$|E

5|$|Both UCLA and Texas {{would lose}} their {{respective}} games; also, Nebraska, which had entered the Big Ten Championship Game at No. 12 in the BCS, was <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> 70–31 by a Wisconsin team that entered the game at 7–5. All of this {{opened the door for}} the winner of the MAC game to enter the top 16. Northern Illinois won and vaulted to #15 in the BCS Standings, earning a spot in the 2013 Orange Bowl. The berth was the first ever for a MAC team in a BCS game, and was also the first BCS berth ever for a one-loss non-AQ team.|$|E
5|$|Bremner's last cap came against Denmark on 3 September 1975. An {{incident}} in Copenhagen {{after the game}} where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a lifetime ban from international football by the Scottish Football Association; four other players, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham also were banned for life (Graham and Harper later had their bans overturned). Bremner maintained his innocence, stating that the incident had been <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> of proportion by the SFA.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage. Though no one was injured, windows were <b>blown</b> <b>out,</b> the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss. A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. No one was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.|$|E

5|$|On 10 June 1990, British Airways Flight 5390, a BAC One-Eleven flight between Birmingham and Málaga, {{suffered}} a windscreen blowout {{due to the}} fitting of incorrect bolts the previous day. The Captain, Tim Lancaster, suffered major injuries after being partially <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> of the aircraft, but the co-pilot landed the plane safely at Southampton Airport. Despite the physical trauma he suffered, Lancaster fully recovered, and five months later he returned to duty. The co-pilot never returned to flying due to the trauma he sustained.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would have <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E
5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

5|$|Dartmouth College fielded {{its first}} {{football}} team in 1881, {{when the school}} challenged Amherst College to a two-game series. They won the first contest, one touchdown to none, and tied the second. The following year, the team played their first major opponent when they traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson. Dartmouth was <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> 53–0, and a rivalry with Harvard formed. The Dartmouth football team developed through the 1880s, skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents. Prior to Wurtenburg's arrival, the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years. Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg's appointment and led the school to a 9–7 record.|$|E
5|$|During {{the offseason}} that followed, the new Red Sox {{ownership}} (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his {{high level of}} production to date. Believed to be necessary {{in pursuit of a}} trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> his knee playing offseason basketball.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind {{impressive}} offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts {{had one of the}} most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
5|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the destruction of}} the mansion {{as a result of the}} gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera. When the sequence was shot at a high speed, the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being <b>blown</b> <b>out,</b> while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.|$|E
5|$|While in the U.S., John and his {{siblings}} lived in grandeur and wanted for nothing, but on {{their return to}} England in February 1945 they were faced with the stark realities of wartime Britain. Rationing was still in force, their former home at Cheyne Walk had been bombed, and the house at 22Eaton Square had had its windows <b>blown</b> <b>out.</b> Despite the family's noble ancestry, the 6th Earl {{and his wife were}} agnostics and socialists and preferred a more austere existence than that offered by Tucker, an extremely wealthy Christian. For a time, John suffered nightmares and was taken to a psychotherapist. As an adult he remained an agnostic, but ensured that his children attended Sunday school, preferring to give them a traditional childhood.|$|E
