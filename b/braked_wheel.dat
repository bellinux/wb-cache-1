The original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was [...] diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed.

A quantitative comparison of inching vs. conventional driving was also performed on a full-scale vehicle through a series of drawbar pull tests in the Lunar terrain strength simulant, GRC- 1.

40|$|Modern {{trains are}} {{equipped}} with different braking systems, between which the braking effort can be distributed. Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. Tread brake systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the <b>braked</b> <b>wheel.</b> The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed. In particular, braking temperatures over 450 °C can result in a very short life up to crack initiation. However, for braking temperatures in the range of 300 - 350 °C, wheel tread material is more resistant to fatigue due to strain hardening...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} vibrations in a single passenger car wheel to identify road fiction. The peak in the transfer function of wheel speed to brake torque variations at the lowest resonance frequency (~ 32 Hz) is strongly influenced by the 'constraint' provided by the road surface. A model of the wheel with its rotational inertia {{in contact with the}} road via the tyre is developed. The inflated tyre carcass provides the stiffness in all directions, here mainly the rotational motion of the wheel, combined with the forward motion of the vehicle is considered. The tyre to road interaction includes the effect of saturation in the force versus brake slip characteristic. After linearization it can be proven that the local derivative of the slip characteristic has a consistent influence on the dynamic behaviour of the tyre. Where the local derivative tends to zero, the maximum achievable brake force is reached. Therefore, assessing the local derivative of the brake force versus slip curve is vital for optimal braking. The phenomenon is also studied in a laboratory environment, with a single <b>braked</b> <b>wheel,</b> running on an electrically driven steel drum of 2. 5 m diameter. Special attention is needed for the instrumentation of the wheel rotational speed. To reach the required sample rate and resolution in wheel speed information, the data-acquisition counts the duration of an encoder period. Since this wheel speed signal becomes available at encoder flanges, it needs to be resampled to create data that is synchronous with the input brake pressure and -torque and -force data, typically sampled at 512 Hz. For some conditions and road surfaces (bare steel and 'safety walk paper') both the relation between local derivative and resonance gain and the application of this relation as a friction identification methodology will be assessed...|$|E
40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of block configuration, brake power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the <b>braked</b> <b>wheel,</b> along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|E
