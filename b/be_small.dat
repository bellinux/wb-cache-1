The variation of the roadway {{deformation rate}} versus load exhibits the following trends: it <b>is</b> <b>small</b> in the load-bearing stage before the peak stress is reached, it <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for higher-density bolt supports, it <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for longer bolt lengths, and it <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for larger-diameter bolts.|$|R

5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to <b>be</b> <b>small</b> and dry.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect.

5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should <b>be</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E
5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would <b>be</b> <b>small</b> and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones like Gonu {{are extremely}} rare over the Arabian Sea, and most storms {{in this area}} tend to <b>be</b> <b>small</b> and dissipate quickly. The cyclone caused 50deaths and about $4.2billion in damage (2007USD) in Oman, where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610mm (24inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28deaths and $ in damage (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's {{geographical}} area is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still <b>be</b> <b>small.</b> This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E

5|$|People {{who live}} in large cities have {{a higher rate of}} COPD {{compared}} to people {{who live in}} rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to <b>be</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E
