5|$|Changing the <b>bogies</b> on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} <b>bogies.</b> As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another {{in as little as}} 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the <b>bogies</b> are usually changed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, {{which was designed to}} take a third of the weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four <b>bogies</b> and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing <b>bogies</b> on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the structural analysis, load tests and combined {{stress of the}} <b>bogie</b> frame. It seeks to identify the structural safety of the <b>bogie</b> frame when the <b>bogie</b> is assembled on the train and a train service is implemented. The <b>bogie</b> consists of the <b>bogie</b> frame, suspension, wheels, brakes and transmission, etc. The <b>bogie</b> frame {{can be considered as}} {{the most important part of}} the <b>bogie.</b> The analysis and tests were evaluated using JIS E 4207 standards and performance test standards for urban rail vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a new-type <b>bogie</b> wheel and its properties, i. e., <b>bogie</b> wheel with tubular spaced-damping, which has vibration-reducing buffering functions. The mechanic model of <b>bogie</b> wheel based on crawler bulldozer of some type was built. Matlab software {{was used to}} simulate such <b>bogie</b> wheel. The results show that <b>bogie</b> wheel with spaced-damping can effectively buffer the vibration on such bulldozer under different load cases...|$|R

5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the <b>bogies.</b> The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives had too high fuel consumption and the <b>bogies</b> had faults, as they had too high track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also had problems with overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the oil cooler and the brakes. The on-board computer failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bogie</b> bolster is {{the central}} section of the <b>bogie</b> that carries the entire weight of a coach's under frame. The <b>bogie</b> pivots around it using the center pivot pin. It couples to the <b>bogie</b> frame at each end using the {{secondary}} suspension system (typically coil springs and spring plank).|$|R
40|$|It {{would be}} {{desirable}} {{to obtain a}} stress profile of a <b>bogie</b> frame {{with reference to the}} railway track on which it runs. In this paper a structural analysis of a typical open-shaped railway vehicle <b>bogie</b> frame, based on a computer dynamic simulation of a real operating environment, is carried out. The analysis has confirmed that this type of <b>bogie</b> frame is very sensitive to torsion, which suggests that the twist loading case should be carefully investigated if an open-shaped <b>bogie</b> frame is involved in a particular <b>bogie.</b> It is also shown that the potential failure of a new <b>bogie</b> frame may be ascertained at the design stage by putting the <b>bogie</b> frame in a simulated service environment...|$|R

5|$|The {{order was}} placed with ABB Strømmen and AEG in August 1991. The high {{development}} cost was subsidised by the Norwegian government, {{who saw the}} project as potentially establishing a new industrial export product. Electrical components were built by AEG in Berlin, while the <b>bogies</b> were built by MAN in Nuremberg. The bodywork was built at Strømmen, with profiles from Alusuisse, and the trains were assembled in Strømmen.|$|E

5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two <b>bogies,</b> in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|To {{commence}} operations, a {{fleet of}} 26 T-68 trams manufactured by AnsaldoBreda in Italy were delivered in 1992. To provide extra trams for the Eccles Line, six modified T-68A trams were purchased in 1999. The T-68A vehicles {{were based on the}} original T-68s, but had modifications replacing destination rollblinds with dot matrix displays, and retractable couplers and covered <b>bogies</b> necessary for the high proportion of on-street running close to motor traffic.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two <b>bogies,</b> {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E

5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power <b>bogies</b> on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages {{at each end of}} the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it is equipped with a pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two <b>bogies.</b> If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a {{diesel-powered}} railroad train formed {{of railroad}} cars permanently articulated together with Jacobs <b>bogies,</b> {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use of stainless steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E
50|$|Development {{of a new}} <b>bogie</b> type {{began in}} 2007; the design was {{intended}} specifically for the UK market {{as a replacement for}} the SF5000 <b>bogie.</b> To reduce energy consumption and track access charges, a key feature of the design was reduced weight: weight-saving design elements included short wheelbase, inboard frames, a bolsterless <b>bogie</b> design, and hollow axles. Total <b>bogie</b> weight is 6.3 tonnes (powered) and 4.4 tonnes (trailer), a reduction of around one third from the SF5000 design. The decision to procure a train with a new <b>bogie</b> design untested in the UK was challenged by several observers at a parliamentary investigation into the train procurement; rival bidder Bombardier already had a proven low-weight <b>bogie.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic noise becomes {{significant}} for high-speed trains but its prediction {{in an industrial}} context is difficult. The flow and aerodynamic noise behaviour of a simplified high-speed train <b>bogie</b> at scale 1 : 10 are studied here through numerical simulations. The <b>bogie</b> is situated in the <b>bogie</b> cavity and cases without and with a fairing are considered, allowing the shielding effect of the <b>bogie</b> fairing on sound generation and radiation to be investigated. A two-stage hybrid method combining computational fluid dynamics and acoustic analogy is applied. The near-field unsteady flow is obtained by solving the unsteady three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations numerically using delayed detached-eddy simulation and the data are utilized to predict far-field noise signals based on the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy. Results show that when the <b>bogie</b> is located inside the <b>bogie</b> cavity, the shear layer developed from the cavity leading edge interacts strongly with the flow separated from the <b>bogie</b> upstream components and the cavity wall. Therefore, a highly turbulent flow is generated within the <b>bogie</b> cavity due to flow impingement and recirculation within the cavity. It is found that, for noise calculated from the <b>bogie</b> surface sources of both cases, the directivity exhibits a lateral dipole pattern with dominant radiation in the axial direction. Compared with the no fairing case, the noise level is about 1 dB higher in the <b>bogie</b> symmetry plane along the axle mid-span for the fairing case where a stronger flow interaction is produced around the <b>bogie</b> central region. Moreover, the noise radiated to the trackside is predicted based on a permeable integration surface close to the <b>bogie</b> and parallel to the carbody side wall. The {{results show that the}} <b>bogie</b> fairing is effective in reducing the noise levels in most of the frequency range due to its shielding effect and a noise reduction around 3 dB is achieved for the current model case by mounting a fairing in the <b>bogie</b> area...|$|R
50|$|Prototypes {{of the new}} SF-7000 <b>bogie</b> were {{completed}} at Siemens' <b>bogie</b> plant in Graz, Austria in late 2011.|$|R
5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of thermic siphons, <b>bogies</b> and cabs at {{each end}} of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both <b>bogies</b> of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
5|$|Angry {{students}} {{in various parts}} of Bihar damaged railway property and disrupted train traffic, as a protest. The police said the protesters targeted Patna, Jehanabad, Barh, Khusrupur, Sasaram and Purnia railway stations in the morning. The protesting students reportedly set afire two AC <b>bogies</b> of an express train at Barh railway station. They ransacked Jehanabad, Barh, Purnia and Sasaram railway stations. According to the railway police, at least 10 students were detained in the morning and extra security was deployed to control the situation. A 10-year-old boy was killed when police opened fire on protesters. The child was hit by a stray bullet and died at the scene after police in Rohtas district fired on a mob attacking a train station. A group of 25 people pelted stones on the Maharashtra Bhawan in Khalasi Line, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Constructed in 1928, the building is owned by the lone trust run by Marathis in Kanpur.|$|E
50|$|Replacing {{the axle}} with a <b>bogie</b> of {{conventional}} design would have obstructed {{access to the}} port faces.

The centre pin of the <b>bogie</b> rotated in a spring-centred block mounted beneath the steam chest on cross beams. This setup gave sufficient clearance so that, when the bolts were undone, {{the front end of the}} locomotive raised, and the <b>bogie</b> was run out from underneath, the steam chest cover could be removed without hindrance.|$|R
