But the Panthers went three and out, and on their third down play, defensive tackle Tyoka Jackson's 11-yard sack pushed them to the outer limits of field goal range, where Kasay missed a 53-yard kick attempt with 6:26 left in regulation.|$|E
25|$|Many sources {{contend that}} Sykes-Picot {{conflicted}} with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916 {{and that the}} publication of the agreement in November 1917 caused the resignation of Sir Henry McMahon. There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British red area and less obviously, the idea that British and French advisors would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and the brown area (a reduced Palestine) internationalised.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger has a tandem-seat 'glass cockpit' and is {{operated}} by a two-man crew; the pilot {{is placed in the}} forward position, with the gunner seated behind. Either of the crew members can manage the weapon systems or the primary flight controls, switching roles if necessitated; in addition to flying the aircraft, the Tiger's pilot would typically <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the self-defence systems and communications, as well as some secondary weapons functions. While some of the weapons use dedicated control interfaces, such as the anti-tank Trigat missile, air-to-air weapons can be managed via controls on both sets of collective and cyclic sticks.|$|E

Emotional effects may include stress, fearfulness, anxiety, exhaustion, fear of public humiliation, feeling dirty, poor body-image, reduced desire for sex, anger, humiliation, depression, isolation, secrecy, frustration and embarrassment. Some people may need to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> life outside of FI as means of compensation. The physical symptoms such as skin soreness, pain and odor may also affect quality of life. Physical activity such as shopping or exercise is often affected.

25|$|On Green Bay's {{first drive}} {{of the second}} half, they reached the Lions 38-yard line, only to lose the ball when Edgar Bennett was tackled for no gain by Willie Clay on fourth and 1. On the next play, Krieg's 36-yard {{completion}} to Herman Moore moved {{the ball to the}} Dallas 25, and Hanson eventually finished the drive by squeezing a 38-yard field goal inside the left upright, cutting Detroit's deficit to 10-3 with 5:58 left in the third quarter. Green Bay struck back with a 28-yard field goal by Jacke, set up by Favre's 26-yard completion to Robert Brooks, regaining a two-score advantage at 13-3. With time running out in the third quarter, Green Bay appeared to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the game, but Detroit finally caught a break as Mel Gray returned the ensuing kickoff a franchise playoff record 68 yards to the Packers 18-yard line. Krieg eventually cashed in the big return with a 3-yard pass to Perriman, cutting the deficit to 13–10 with 13:35 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

Clank also features in [...] "Giant Clank" [...] scenarios where Clank transforms into a larger and more advanced form and can battle similar size enemies; in this form he gains increased firepower with rockets and bombs and a large amount of health. During the single-player game, the player can also play as Captain Qwark in 2D side-scrolling levels (called [...] "Vid Comics"), which build upon the history of Captain Qwark and his previous conflicts with Dr. Nefarious.|$|E
500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it. We just want to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> our own music." ...|$|E
500|$|The General Division of the Rhodesian High Court {{ruled on}} 9 September 1966 that legal {{sovereignty}} lay with the British government, but that to [...] "avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law" [...] the Rhodesian {{government should be}} considered to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> law and order {{to the same extent}} as before UDI. In February 1968, ruling on Madzimbamuto's appeal, Beadle concluded that the Smith administration would be recognised by the local judiciary as the de facto government by virtue of its [...] "effective control over the state's territory", but that de jure recognition would be withheld as this was not [...] "firmly established". Madzimbamuto applied for the right to appeal to the British Privy Council; the Rhodesian Appellate Division promptly ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway.|$|E

500|$|In c. 1400 BC, Hittite records {{mention the}} {{military}} activities of an Ahhiyawan warlord, Attarsiya, a possible Hittite way of writing the Greek name Atreus, who attacked Hittite vassals in western Anatolia. Later, in c. 1315 BC, an anti-Hittite rebellion headed by Arzawa, a Hittite vassal state, received support from Ahhiyawa. Meanwhile, Ahhiyawa appears to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> {{a number of}} islands in the Aegean, an impression also supported by archaeological evidence. During {{the reign of the}} Hittite king Hattusili III (c. 1267–1237 BC), the king of Ahhiyawa is recognized as a [...] "Great King" [...] and of equal status with the other contemporary great Bronze Age rulers: the kings of Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria. At that time, another anti-Hittite movement, led by Piyama-Radu, broke out and was supported by the king of Ahhiyawa. Piyama-Radu caused major unrest in the region of Wilusa and later invaded the island of Lesbos, which then passed into Ahhiyawan control.|$|E
500|$|Beadle {{summarised}} the Rhodesian judiciary's {{position in}} light of UDI by saying simply that the judges would carry on with their duties [...] "according to the law", but this non-committal stance was challenged by legal cases heard at the High Court. The first of these was Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke N. O. and Others, concerning Daniel Madzimbamuto, a black nationalist detained without trial five days before UDI under emergency powers. When Lardner-Burke's ministry prolonged {{the state of emergency}} in February 1966, Madzimbamuto's wife appealed for his release, arguing that since the UK government had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government, the state of emergency (and, by extension, her husband's imprisonment) had no legal basis. The High Court's General Division ruled on 9 September 1966 that the UK retained legal sovereignty, but that to [...] "avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law" [...] the Rhodesian government should be considered to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> law and order to the same extent as before UDI. Madzimbamuto appealed to Beadle's Appellate Division, which considered the case over the next year and a half.|$|E
500|$|Julie Barak {{emphasizes}} {{the significance of}} [...] "one other stylistic idiosyncrasy {{of the work that}} adds to the sophistication of [...] artistry" [...] as there is a marked transition from third to first person narration for each girl in the last section of the novel. Luis describes this shift as a pivotal moment after which the events assume a chronological order and time accelerates, illuminating life in such a manner that it suddenly makes sense. The manner in which Alvarez alters the narrative voice is a stylistic expression {{of the extent to which}} each one of the girls [...] "wants to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> her own version of her history... These first person narratives in the last section become, in effect, a defense offered by each girl in her own words, an explanation of who they have become in the present, of why they 'turned out' the way they have." [...] The transition of narrative voice [...] "changes the dynamic of the reader-character-author triad" [...] and allows for the reader, who has been kept at a distance by the third person narrator, to relive [...] "the memory with the character, closely connected to her, developing a strong empathy with a unified character".|$|E

500|$|Two {{years after}} signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans to W.E. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, {{if he did not}} meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to [...] "deal with the bankers" [...] to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison, and Thompson-Houston).|$|E

Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E
