For breakout prevention, the embedded thermocouples had been proved best for breakout signals detecting. But in china, the system which used well in foreign countries did not fit for the current local condition, and gives error reports more often, so developing an efficient <b>breakout</b> <b>system</b> which fit for the condition of nowadays in China {{becomes more and more}} urgently...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : ConferenceInternational audienceThe goal of {{this paper}} is to create a hybrid {{recommendation}} system based on a Multi-Agent Architecture that will inform the trader about the future stock trend in order to improve the profitability of a short or medium time period investment. We proposed a Multi-Agent Architecture that uses the numbers of the Fibonacci Series and the Elliott Wave Theory, along with some special Technical Analysis Methods (namely Gap Analysis, <b>Breakout</b> <b>System,</b> Market Modes and Momentum Precedes Price) and Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and tries to combine and / or compare the result given by part / all of them in order to forecast trends in the financial market.

40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} using advanced approach {{based on}} the neural networks {{has been applied to}} the control and the quality optimisation in the main processes of steelwork such as the ladle metallurgical treatment and continuous casting. Particular importance has been given to the improvement of <b>breakout</b> prediction <b>system</b> and the reduction in the rate of false alarm generated by the conventional <b>breakout</b> detection <b>system.</b> Prediction of the chemical composition and temperature of liquid steel in the ladle has been achieved by neural networks and linear model. This prediction can be considered as a soft sensor. Slab surface temperature stabilisation {{on the basis of the}} casting events has been controlled by a neural networks algorithm, that gives an improvement in the surface temperature fluctuation in comparison to the conventional control system which is {{based on the}} PID controller. Quality monitoring and classification is also achieved by a neural network which is related to the <b>breakout</b> detection <b>system.</b> This technique achieves a classification of different defects based on the different alarm signal given by the <b>breakout</b> prediction <b>system.</b> Fault detection and process monitoring is developed using neural networks modelling. All models are developed on basis of practical operating database obtained from the iron and steel industry...|$|R

We tested 13 techical trading systems such 1 - 30 dual simple moving average crossover, 5 - 20 dual simple moving average crossover, 3 - 7 exponental moving average crossover, relative strength index (RSI), momentum, stochastic, moving average converge divergence (MACD), five Channel <b>Breakout</b> <b>Systems</b> (CBO 20 - 20, CBO 20 - 5, CBO 10 - 5 and CBO 15 - 5) and the directional movement index (DMI). The finding reveal that 8 out of 13 trading systems produced significally positive gross returns when 0. 44 percent transaction cost is applied. This finding confirms that technical analysis not only produce investment returns but {{also can be used}} as risk management as its ability to reduce risk and also confirm the random walk hypothesis for the market tested...|$|R

For the high failing and missing report rate of the system by indraught, whose report parameter cannot been changed, one new <b>breakout</b> prevention <b>system</b> which can optimize its parameters and based on the theory of the marked differences between temperature changing trend and spreading speed of the different temperature signal mode has been developed, it also has the hot distributing map.

40|$|Abstract—Different {{strategies}} and tools {{are available at}} {{the oil and gas industry}} for detecting and analyzing tension and possible fractures in borehole walls. Most of these techniques are based on manual observation of the captured borehole images. While this strategy may be possible and convenient with small images and few data, it may become difficult and suitable to errors when big databases of images must be treated. While the patterns may differ among the image area, depending on many characteristics (drilling strategy, rock components, rock strength, etc.). In this work we propose the inclusion of data-mining classification strategies in order to create a knowledge database of the segmented curves. These classifiers allow that, after some time using and manually pointing parts of borehole images that correspond to tension regions and <b>breakout</b> areas, the <b>system</b> will indicate and suggest automatically new candidate regions, with higher accuracy. We suggest the use of different classifiers methods, in order to achieve different knowledge dataset configurations. Keywords—Brazil, classifiers, data-mining, Image Segmentation...|$|R

These involved the placing of obstacles around the JNA facilities, setting up of artillery and air defence units, and drafting of plans to capture the JNA garrison, codenamed Operation Bilogora. The 1st Battalion of the 105th Brigade was deployed to around the villages of Bedenik and Velika Pisanica, the 2nd Battalion {{in the village of}} Narta, and the 3rd Battalion north of Bjelovar, thereby encircling the city. In the city itself, nine battlegroups were deployed to attack armoured units which might attempt a <b>breakout.</b> Air defence <b>systems</b> consisting of two [...] machine guns and two [...] anti-aircraft guns were set up in nearby villages. A battery of towed [...] T-12 antitank guns was deployed to the Hrgovljani area. In an attempt to mitigate an overall shortage of anti-tank weapons, 200 Molotov cocktails were sent from Zagreb and three armoured personnel carriers armed with 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank guided missile systems arrived from Virovitica on 23 September. The crisis headquarters was to coordinate all activities of the Croatian armed forces based in Bjelovar, as well as reinforcements received from Varaždin after the JNA garrison based there surrendered, but Colonel Želimir Škarec, a member of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia, was appointed as the commanding officer of the military operation.|$|R
40|$|An interactive, multidisciplinary, public workshop, {{organized}} {{by a group}} of experts in biochemistry, biophysics, chemical and biomolecular engineering, chemistry, microbial metabolism, and protein structure and function, was held on January 6 - 7, 2011 in Washington, DC. Fundamental insights into the biological energy capture, storage, and transformation processes provided by speakers was featured in this workshop�which included topics such as microbes living in extreme environments such as hydrothermal vents or caustic soda lakes (extremophiles) � provided a fascinating basis for discussing the exploration and development of new energy <b>systems.</b> <b>Breakout</b> sessions and extended discussions among the multidisciplinary groups of participants in the workshop fostered information sharing and possible collaborations on future bioinspired research. Printed and web-based materials that summarize the committee�s assessment of what transpired at the workshop were prepared to advance further understanding of fundamental chemical properties of biological systems within and between the disciplines. In addition, webbased materials (including two animated videos) were developed to make the workshop content more accessible to a broad audience of students and researchers working across disciplinary boundaries. Key workshop discussion topics included: Exploring and identifying novel organisms; Identifying patterns and conserved biological structures in nature; Exploring and identifying fundamental properties and mechanisms of known biological systems; Supporting current, and creating new, opportunities for interdisciplinary education, training, and outreach; and Applying knowledge from biology to create new devices and sustainable technology...|$|R
