5|$|After {{weeks of}} exchanging taunts and each side {{predicting}} victory for their side, {{the two teams}} faced off at SummerSlam. Jesse Ventura had been appointed as a supposedly impartial guest referee by Jack Tunney. It was strongly hinted leading up the event that Ventura, who provided commentary for many WWF events and was a strong critic of Hulk Hogan <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> was a supporter of Randy Savage even (if only to a somewhat lesser extent) during his face days, had been paid an undisclosed amount by DiBiase.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} the Samaritans, who resisted conversion to Christianity and were repeatedly in insurrection. He persecuted them with rigorous edicts, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> could not prevent reprisals towards Christians from taking place in Samaria toward the close of his reign. The consistency of Justinian's policy meant that the Manicheans too suffered persecution, experiencing both exile and threat of capital punishment. At Constantinople, on one occasion, not a few Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed in the emperor's very presence: some by burning, others by drowning.|$|E

When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dire's greater {{experience}} {{over long}} distances, it was Kiplagat who forged {{ahead in the}} last kilometre and she won the race with ten seconds to spare over her Ethiopian rival. Arusei was the third across the line half a minute later, while Feyse Tadese, Joyce Chepkirui, Meseret Mengistu and Fate Tola took places 4–7 around one minute behind the winner. It was Arusei's clear third place which proved {{the difference between the}} top African teams, as Kenya won the team gold by a margin of 34 seconds over Ethiopia. A strong final phase saw Zhu Xiaolin take eighth place for the hosts, which was the best non-African individual performance that year. Japan's Yoshimi Ozaki and Ryoko Kizaki were immediately behind her, failing to get a top eight finish <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> again leading the country to the team bronze with a buffer of over six minutes between them and Australia.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E

Deciding to leave Krycek out of the loop, Mulder calls Scully (Gillian Anderson) and asks her to conduct Grissom's autopsy. Mulder then heads to Grissom's clinic in Stamford, Connecticut, where he is confronted by an angered Krycek. The two travel back to Quantico to see Scully, who says that Grissom's body {{showed no signs of}} a fire, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> seems to have biologically believed it was burning.|$|E
5|$|Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated {{the same}} year. Pope Gregory III {{sent him a}} pallium in 736. He may have been {{appointed}} by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether or not he owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod was the fact that no king attended, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|Alonso lapped {{consistently}} {{in the low}} 1:19 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap of the race on lap41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop {{for the second time}} on lap43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lap46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap51, Massa, who was eighth, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as Räikkönen left the track at the run-off area. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.|$|E
