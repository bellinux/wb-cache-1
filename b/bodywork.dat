5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} <b>bodywork</b> by {{adapting}} designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED rear lights with clear lenses and integrating a new rear spoiler with the boot lid.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's new car, the EJ10B, {{was also}} {{introduced}} that weekend; {{the team had}} used their primary 2000 car, the EJ10, for the previous ten races. Originally due to be introduced at the previous race in Austria, the car was required to undergo Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety tests on its <b>bodywork</b> and Jordan wanted to develop more spare parts for the EJ10B, delaying the car's race début.|$|E
5|$|The Jordan team's plan to {{introduce}} its new car, the EJ10B, at this race was postponed as its <b>bodywork</b> {{was required to}} undergo Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety tests. This was due to a decision made by the Jordan team to develop the car further and create more spare parts. However, {{this was the last}} race that the EJ10 competed, as the EJ10B made its début at the next race.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bodywork</b> for {{the concept}} car {{displayed}} in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{order was}} placed with ABB Strømmen and AEG in August 1991. The high {{development}} cost was subsidised by the Norwegian government, {{who saw the}} project as potentially establishing a new industrial export product. Electrical components were built by AEG in Berlin, while the bogies were built by MAN in Nuremberg. The <b>bodywork</b> was built at Strømmen, with profiles from Alusuisse, and the trains were assembled in Strømmen.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear <b>bodywork</b> on its next pit stop.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's <b>bodywork,</b> but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute <b>bodywork</b> repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain in his garage for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and <b>bodywork</b> over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E
5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports <b>bodywork.</b> The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{performed}} {{strongly in}} other races; {{he won the}} Polish and Monza Grands Prix and the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, and took five more hillclimbs to win that Championship for {{the third and final}} time. He was, however, beaten by the Mercedes-Benz of Manfred von Brauchitsch at the Avusrennen (the yearly race at the AVUS track). Von Brauchitsch drove a privately entered SSK with streamlined <b>bodywork,</b> and beat Caracciola's Alfa Romeo, which finished in second place. Caracciola was seen by the German crowd as having defected to the Italian team and was booed, while von Brauchitsch's all German victory drew mass support.|$|E
5|$|Herd's {{knowledge}} of aerodynamics and Bruce McLaren's experience with Ford's sports car racing programme combined to spur the team into experimenting with aerodynamic <b>bodywork.</b> The M2A was {{fitted with a}} rear wing that produced downforce – downwards pressure on the car and tyres which allows faster cornering – and reduced lap times by three seconds at a test at Zandvoort circuit in November 1965, {{two and a half}} years before the Brabham and Ferrari teams eventually debuted wings in a Grand Prix. The team intended to use the wing on the M2B, but the engine problems that occurred prevented this.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the <b>bodywork.</b> They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|E

5|$|The fan car and {{hydropneumatic}} suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham {{was accused of}} going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver Jacques Laffite was among those {{to claim that the}} cars were fitted with heavily ballasted <b>bodywork</b> before being weighed at scrutineering. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E
5|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), in dry and sunny weather. At the start of the race, J.J. Lehto stalled his Benetton on the grid. Pedro Lamy, starting from further back on the grid, had his view of the stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing <b>bodywork</b> and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people. Further back, Martin Brundle had a good start, overtaking two cars as well as Lehto, propelling him from thirteenth to tenth place.|$|E

5|$|With the VT Commodore of 1997, Holden {{looked again}} to Opel in Germany for a donor platform. The {{proposal}} {{was to take}} the Opel Omega B and broaden the vehicle's width and mechanical setup for local conditions. In the early days, Holden considered adopting the Omega as is, save for the engines and transmissions, and even investigated reskinning the existing VR/VS architecture. Later on, the VT <b>bodywork</b> spawned a new generation of Statesman and Caprice (again based on the long-wheelbase wagons), and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding <b>bodywork,</b> emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the <b>bodywork</b> for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
