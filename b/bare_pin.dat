40|$|A {{literature}} review shows {{that much of}} work on radiating fins {{has been carried out}} analytically and numerically. Presently, a radiating pin fin with grooves and threads on its outside surface is investigated experimentally. A test facility with a vacuum chamber and instrumentation is fabricated. The heat input to the fin is varied such that the base temperature is maintained constant under steady state. Based on a study of effect of vacuum, using available resources, the chamber is designed for a vacuum of 80 mm Hg such that the contribution of convection to the total heat transfer could be ignored. The study shows that there exist optimum angle of grooves and number of threads per inch for which the heat loss per unit mass is a maximum. The grooved / threaded radiating fin loses 1. 4 and 1. 2 times greater heat per unit mass, respectively, compared to the <b>bare</b> <b>pin</b> fin...|$|E
40|$|The flux {{motion in}} a {{superconductor}} with a periodic logarithmiclike <b>bare</b> <b>pinning</b> potential is investigated. The effective barrier UJ(J) is derived and {{is shown to}} bear close resemblance with the related experimental results. The details of the pinning potential profile {{turn out to have}} significant influences on the functional form of the effective barrier. The linear response of the superconductor under a small current is analyzed and a slightly new formula is derived for resistivity in the thermally activated flux flow regimes. The distinct regimes for flux creep and flux flow and the crossover in between are treated simultaneously, and the familiar power-law behavior is demonstrated and is further confirmed by examining the dln E/dJ versus H relation. Satisfactory agreement is found between our results and related experimental observations. The experimentally observed field-dependent resistance broadening effect is also reproduced in this model. © 1994 The American Physical Society. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes he {{suffered}} terrible disappointments, due {{directly or indirectly}} to his great poverty. Once, he took all his cases of insects, containing nine hundred and sixteen specimens, and representing the work of four years, up to his garret to keep them there till {{he was able to}} glaze them. When he came to take them down again he found to his horror that rats had got at the boxes, eaten almost every insect in the whole collection, and left nothing behind but the <b>bare</b> <b>pins,</b> with a few scattered legs, wings, and bodies, sticking amongst them. Most men would have been so disgusted with this miserable end to so much labour, that they would have given up moth hunting for ever. But Edward was made of different stuff. He went to work again as zealously as ever, and in four years more, he had got most of the beetles, flies, and chafers as carefully collected as before.|$|R
6000|$|She colored {{so quickly}} that he knew {{she must have been}} {{conscious}} at the time, and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak, which had been half torn off her <b>bare</b> arm, was <b>pinned</b> together over it. When and how had she managed to do it without his detecting the act? ...|$|R
40|$|A general {{framework}} for analyzing the multiple Fano effect (MFE) in charge density wave (CDW) systems is developed. The MFE occurs when IR active modes have frequencies above the CDW gap and interference between the IR modes and the electronic continuum {{leads to a}} series of resonances and anti-resonances. We parameterize the peaks and dips of the absorption by a set of <b>bare</b> frequencies, a <b>pinning</b> parameter and one interaction parameter. We apply this method to recently observed photoinduced absorption spectra of -conjugated polymer films. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Fused-silica {{capillaries}} {{were packed}} with porous 1 <b>pin</b> <b>bare</b> silica microspheres and immobilized by potassium silicate-formamide {{in order to}} obtain columns with silica-based monolithic packing. After curing, the particle-fixed monolithic columns were octadecylated in situ with dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane. The columns were mechanically strong and permeable. No noticeable loss in efficiency was found after using a column continuously for 1 month. The performances of the particle-fixed silica monolithic columns were evaluated for CEC under RP conditions. High separation efficiency (about 125200 plates/m) was obtained by using these new types of columns...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} to look for the cows, and found them all lying in the place where he had left them; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards, taking a {{different}} path to that they had trod in the morning. This time they passed over a plain so <b>bare</b> that a <b>pin</b> could not have lain there unnoticed, yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there, both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass. Further on they crossed another plain, where the grass was thick and green, but on it were feeding a foal and its mother, so lean that you could have counted their ribs. And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats; one full of gay and happy youths, journeying {{to the land of the}} Sun, and another with grim shapes clothed in black, travelling to the land of Night.|$|R
