5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment <b>by</b> <b>executive</b> order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases <b>by</b> <b>executive</b> order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
