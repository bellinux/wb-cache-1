Induction studies of the chitinase in leaves <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> plants indicated that not only treatment with ethephon or salicylate and wounding but also a temperature shock strongly increased the enzyme level. cDNA libraries constructed from poly(A) -rich RNA isolated from young garlic shoots and bulbs were screened for chitinase clones using the cDNA clone CCH 4 encoding a basic potato chitinase as a probe. Two different cDNA clones (designated CHITAS 1 and CHITAS 2) of ca 1 000 bp were isolated and their sequences analyzed.

40|$|Lectins are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} that bind to carbohydrates {{with a high degree}} of specificity. They are involved in various cellular processes such as, host - pathogen interactions, targeting of proteins within cells, cell - cell interaction, cellular segregation and development. They serve as important tools for probing the carbohydrate structures in biological systems such as cell membranes and also as model systems for elucidating protein - carbohydrate interactions. Lectins are distributed ubiquitously in nature ranging from microorganisms to the plants and animals. Plant lectins are a group of proteins that according to a recently updated definition comprise all plant proteins possessing at least one non-catalytic domain that binds reversibly to specific mono- or oligosaccharide. The majority of all currently known plant lectins may be classified into four major groups - (1) Legume lectins, (2) Chitin-binding lectins, (3) Type 2 Ribosome inactivating proteins and the (4) Monocot mannose binding lectins. The monocot mannose binding lectins are an extended superfamily of structurally and evolutionarily related proteins. Till now these proteins have been isolated from the following families, namely, Amaryllidaceae, Affiaceae, Araceae, Orchidaceae, Iridaceae and Li/iaceae. They exhibit marked sequence homology and a unique specificity for mannose. At present there is a wide interest in the monocot mannose-binding lectins because of: (1) their exclusive specificity towards mannose, (2) their anti - retroviral activity and (3) their potent entomotoxic properties. Of particular interest are lectins from the <b>bulbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> (Allium sativum) and ramson (A. ursinum), which contain more than one type of lectin. The first report of the presence of lectins in the <b>bulbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> {Allium sativum agglutinin, ASA) was made by Van Damme et al in 1991. <b>Bulbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> are known to accumulate two types of mannose binding lectins, the heterodimeric, ASAI and the hornodimeric, ASAII. Though these two lectins differ in the lengths of their polypeptide chains, they exhibit marked similarities with respect to their primary sequence, post translational modifications, serological properties, immunochemical attributes as well as carbohydrate binding properties. This thesis describes the successful cloning of the ASAI gene from the garlic genomic DNA and expression of the functional recombinant protein in insect cell lines. ASAI was subsequently characterized for its carbohydrate binding specificity by means of a sensitive enzyme based assay. Finer insights into this sugar binding topology of ASAI for its complementary ligands was obtained from the surface plasmon resonance studies. Lastly, the folding behaviour as well as an estimate of its conformational stability was investigated by differential scanning calorimetric and equilibrium solution denaturation studies. Chapter 1 provides a comprehensive review on lectins pertaining to their definition, historical background, occurrence in nature, three dimensional structure and architecture, modes of bonding, biological functions and implications as well as their applications in biomedical research. Chapter 2 describes the isolation and purification of the heterodimeric lectin, ASAI in two steps using affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography from the <b>bulbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic.</b> The purified ASAI was then characterized for their serological, physico- and immuno-chemical properties by means of capillary electrophoresis, hemagglutination activity and generation of antisera against ASAI in rabbits. Chapter 3 revolves around the cloning of the gene encoding ASAI by PCR amplification from garlic genomic DNA. The authenticity of the ASA gene was established by means of gene sequencing, which in turn provided us with the primary sequence of this lectin. With the ASAI clone established innumerable attempts, as highlighted in the chapter, were made to express the functional protein in bacteria. All attempts yielded pure recombinant garlic lectin with no detectable activity. This prompted us to shift our efforts into expression of the recombinant protein in the baculovirus expression system using the Sf 21 insect cell lines and the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). The choice of this system proved beneficial as we obtained functional recombinant garlic lectin with its hemagglutinating activity comparable to the native protein. Chapter 4 highlights the design of an elegant coupled enzyme-based colorimetric assay (Enzyme Linked Lectin Adsorbent Assay) for elucidation of the carbohydrate binding specificity of ASAI. This expansive and extensive study involved the assay of a wide range of mannooligosaccharides in order to gain an insight into the sugar binding details of ASAI. ASAI recognizes monosaccharides in the mannosyl configuration. The potencies of the ligands for ASAI is shown to increase in the following order: Mannobiose < Mannotriose Mannopentaose Man 9 oligosaccharide. Mannononase glycopeptide (Man 9 GlcNAc 2 Asn), the highest oligomer studied exhibited the greatest binding affinity suggesting ASAI to possess a preference for cluster of terminal αl- 2 -linked mannosyl residues at the non-reducing end. This kind of exquisite specificity is unique in the lectins described so far. Among the glycoproteins assayed, invertase, soyabean agglutinin and ovalbumin displayed high binding affinity. Chapter 5 unravels the fine specificity of the mannose containing carbohydrate moieties for binding to ASAI with emphasis on their kinetics of binding. This has been achieved by invoking the principle of surface plasmon resonance allowing measurement of bimolecular interactions in real time. This investigation corroborates our earlier study about the special preference <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> lectin for terminal a α 1 - 2 linked mannose residues. Increase in binding propensity can be directly correlated to the addition of αl- 2 linked mannose to the mannooligosaccharide at its non-reducing end. An analyses of these data reveals that the α 1 - 2 linked terminal mannose on the α 1 - 6 arm to be the critical determinant in the recognition of mannooligosaccharides by the lectin. While kI increases progressively from Man 3 to Man 7 derivatives, and more dramatically so for Man 8 and Man 9 derivatives, k- 1 decreases relatively much less gradually from Man 3 to Man 9 structures. An unprecedented increase in the association rate constant for interaction with ASAI with the structure of the oligosaccharide ligand constitutes a significant finding in protein-sugar recognition. Chapter 6 deals with the thermal unfolding of ASAI, characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism which shows it to be highly reversible and can be defined as a two-state process in which the folded dimer is converted directly to the unfolded monomers (A 2 2 U). Moreover, its conformational stability has been determined as a function of temperature; GdnCl concentration and pH using a combination of thermal and isothermal GdnCl induced unfolding monitored by DSC, far-UV CD and fluorescence, respectively. Analysis of these data yielded the heat capacity change upon unfolding (∆CP) as also the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic parameters, namely, ∆G, ∆H, ∆S. The protein appears to attain a completely unfolded state irrespective of the method of denaturation. The absence of any folding intermediates suggests the quaternary interactions to be the major contributor to the conformational stability of the protein, which correlates very well with its X-ray structure. The final chapter summarizes the findings reported in the thesis...|$|R

It was concluded that, at the low disease pressure site, the low level of inoculum and disease incidence enabled the three biocontrol agents to bring about disease control that were related to improve garlic growth and production.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of methanolic extracts <b>of</b> the <b>bulbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Garlic</b> (Allium sativum L., Alliaceae) and Persian shallot (Allium ascalonicum L., Alliaceae) and leaves of Sage (Salvia officinalis L., Lamiaceae), ASE, AAE and SOE respectively, on the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) activities and on the levels of plasma lipids profiles such as triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in Alloxan diabetic Wistar rats. In comparison with diabetic control rats in diabetic treated rats, AAE increases the activities of SOD (65 %), GPX (43 %) and CAT (55 %). ASE and SOE increase SOD activity by 60 % and 33 % respectively. ASE reduces TC (34 %), SOE decreases TG (40 %) and LDL (30 %) and AAE reduces VLDL (24 %). Metformin exhibits mild antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties. Results of quantitative phytochemical analysis show that the methanolic garlic and Persian shallot bulbs extracts contain secondary metabolites including alkaloids (3. 490 % and 3. 430 %), glycosides (18. 023 % and 13. 301 %) and saponins (0. 812 % and 0. 752 %). Methanolic sage leaves extract contains flavonoids (1. 014 %), glycosides (23. 142 %) and saponins (2. 096 %). The total phenolic contents of ASE, AAE and SOE were in order 4. 273, 3. 621 and 6. 548 mg GAE/g dry weight (DW). These results suggest that Allium sativum, Allium ascalonicum and Salvia officinalis are beneficial in the control of diabetes by noticeable antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties...|$|R

30|$|In {{in vitro}} assays, three Trichoderma species, i.e., Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, and Trichoderma virens and tebuconazole, were {{compared}} {{for their ability}} to suppress S. cepivora isolate (Sc 8). In greenhouse experiments, the chemical treatment was the most effective, with the lowest incidence <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> white rot compared with the control. The antagonistic fungi tested either individually or in combination significantly reduced the incidence of white rot on garlic. In general, dual and triple combinations of the fungal isolates were more effective than these isolates used individually. The combination of the three Trichoderma species was the most effective treatment, decreasing disease incidence by 50.0 % in 2016 / 2017 season and 40.0 % in 2017 / 2018 season, respectively. The three Trichoderma species employed alone or in combinations and tebuconazole were evaluated under low and high disease pressures in field trials to determine which situation (s) provided the best control <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> white rot. Under low (40 sclerotia/kg of soil) and high (600 sclerotia/kg of soil) inoculum density, the standard fungicide programme (dipping <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> cloves in tebuconazole (1  ml of Folicur 25 % l− 1 of water) plus spraying garlic stem bases with the same concentration of tebuconazole) gave statistically significant disease control, decreasing disease incidence by 67.7 and 29.4 % in 2016 / 2017 season and 72.6 and 31.1 % in 2017 / 2018 season, respectively. Under low disease pressure, significant control, equal to the fungicide treatment, was achieved with the trip combination of three Trichoderma species.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the influence of combined nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) fertility on the organosulphur compound content <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> <b>bulbs,</b> especially alliin, as a specific flavour quality trait related to the health-value <b>of</b> <b>garlic.</b> Three cultivars, 'Printanor', 'Morasol' and 'Messidr 6 me', were grown in the greenhouse and in vitro. Sulphur was increased in the macronutrients within the range 0 - 144 mg l(- 1). Numerous combinations of both S and N were tested in vitro. In the greenhouse, increasing N levels, from 184. 8 mg l(- 1) to 856. 8 mg l(- 1), were tested with a single high level of S (128 mg l(- 1)). Increasing S alone {{did not affect the}} growth or <b>bulb</b> weight <b>of</b> any <b>garlic</b> cultivar, but slightly increased the alliin content <b>of</b> <b>bulbs.</b> No symptoms <b>of</b> S deficiency were observed under greenhouse conditions, although the same garlic cultivars grown in vitro at 0 mg S l(- 1) clearly suffered, their size being greatly reduced. This suggests an important role for S contamination, such as atmospheric S, in the process of S absorption by garlic plants, which is discussed. Increasing N levels significantly accelerated garlic maturity and decreased bulb yield. The effect of N on the organosulphur compound content <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> was cultivar-dependent, but alliin accumulation was not enhanced. 'Printanor' and 'Morasol' had the highest alliin levels and were negatively influenced by increasing N, while a slight synergistic effect of S and N was observed on 'Messidrome'. 'Messidrome' also had the highest flavour potential when including precursors, and was more efficient in accumulating S into organosulphur compounds. It is therefore advisable to choose the most appropriate variety, and to adapt the N x S fertilisation regime according to the environment, in order to produce garlic with the highest health-value. ...|$|R
