50|$|Furrow {{irrigation}} {{is conducted}} by creating small parallel channels along the field length {{in the direction}} of predominant slope. Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity. Water may be supplied using gated pipe, siphon and head ditch, or bankless systems. The speed of water movement is determined by many factors such as slope, surface roughness and furrow shape but most importantly by the inflow rate and soil infiltration rate. The spacing between adjacent furrows is governed by the crop species, common spacings typically range from 0.75 to 2 metres. The crop is planted on the ridge between furrows which may contain a single row of plants or several rows {{in the case of a}} <b>bed</b> <b>type</b> system. Furrows may range anywhere from less than 100 m to 2000 m long depending on the soil type, location and crop type. Shorter furrows are commonly associated with higher uniformity of application but result in increasing potential for runoff losses. Furrow irrigation is particularly suited to broad-acre row crops such as cotton, maize and sugar cane. It is also practiced in various horticultural industries such as citrus, stone fruit and tomatoes.|$|E

We assayed the endotoxin, coliform, and dust levels in 20 <b>types</b> of rodent <b>bedding.</b> Endotoxin concentrations were measured {{by using a}} commercial test kit, coliform counts were determined by using conventional microbiologic procedures, and dust content was evaluated by using a rotating–tapping shaker. Paper <b>bedding</b> <b>types</b> contained significantly less endotoxin than did other bedding types; {{the highest levels of}} endotoxin were detected in hardwood and corncob beddings. The range of endotoxin content for each <b>bedding</b> <b>type</b> was: corncob <b>bedding,</b> 1913 to 4504 endotoxin units per gram (EU/g); hardwood bedding, 3121 to 5401 EU/g; corncob–paper mixed bedding, 1586 to 2416 EU/g; and paper bedding, less than 5 to 105 EU/g. Coliform counts varied from less than 10 to 7591 cfu/g in corncob beddings, 90 to 4010 cfu/g in corncob–paper mixed beddings, less than 10 to 137 cfu/g in hardwood beddings, and less than 10 cfu/g in paper beddings. Average dust content was less than 0. 15 % in all commercial <b>bedding</b> <b>types.</b> We conclude that paper bedding is the optimal <b>bedding</b> <b>type</b> for conducting LPS inhalation studies and that rodent bedding containing high levels of endotoxin may alter the results of respiratory and immunologic studies in rodents...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Compare {{the rate}} of growth of four {{microbial}} strains that cause disease in the equine, on four commonly used <b>types</b> of <b>bedding.</b> The moisture holding capacity of each <b>bedding</b> <b>type</b> was also tested. Methods and results: Microbial strains included, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Dichelobacter nodosus and Dermatophilus congolensis. The <b>bedding</b> <b>types</b> tested were Pinus syvestrus (Scots pine shavings), Pinus nigra (Corsican pine shavings), Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce shavings), Cannabis sativa (hemp) and chopped wheat straw. A suspension of each microbial strain was spread in triplicate on agar media and incubated in its optimal growth conditions. The viable count (colony forming unit per ml) was determined for each bacterial strain for the five different <b>bedding</b> <b>types.</b> Pinus syvestrus <b>bedding</b> resulted in significantly less (p= 0. 001) bacterial growth of all strains tested. Conclusions: Factors resulting in the inhibition of bacterial growth include the anti-bacterial effects reported in the Pinacea family and the physical properties of the bedding substrate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Radiographic {{examination}} of cores {{taken at the}} entrance of a Georgia tidal inlet revealed three texturally and structurally different ypes of mud layers. Type I mud layers are composed of laminations of clay-size detritus that occur as flaser, wavy and lenticular <b>bedding.</b> <b>Type</b> II mud layers are composed of foresets and sand-size fecal and organic detritus that also occur as flaser, wavy and lentlcular <b>bedding.</b> <b>Type</b> II I mud layers are composed of foresets of mud pebbles and occur as wavy lenticular <b>bedding.</b> Mud-layer <b>types</b> form in response to hydraulically different depositional processes com-bined with the local availability of mud-grain sizes. Examination of textures and structures in these mud layers indicates that grains which constitute mud layers are transported and deposited from the traction load as well as the suspension load. In some areas, deposition from the bedload (traction load) is considerably more pronounced than deposition from suspension load. Type II and III nmd layers result from bedload deposition which does not necessitate a period of slack-water in the tidal cycle or a specific set of conditions of wave activity, suspended-matter concentration, and current velocity...|$|R

40|$|The pebble <b>bed</b> <b>type</b> high {{temperature}} gas cooled nuclear reactor is a promising option for next generation reactor technology {{and has the}} potential to provide high efficiency and cost effective electricity generation. The reactor unit heat transfer poses a challenge due to the complexity associated with the thermalflow design. Therefore to reliably simulate the flow and heat transport of the pebble bed modular reactor necessitates a heat transfer model that deals with radiation as well as thermal convection and conduction. In this study, a model with the capability to simulate fluid flow and heat transfer in the pebble bed modular reactor core has been developed. The developed model was implemented on a personal computer using FORTRAN 95 programming language. Several important fluid flow and heat transfer parameters have been examined: including the pressure drop over the reactor core, the heat transfer coefficient, the Nusselt number and the effective thermal conductivity of the fuel pebbles. Results obtained from the simulation experiments show a uniform pressure in the radial direction for a core to fuel element diameter (D/d) ratio> 20 and the heat transfer coefficient increases with increasing temperature and coolant mass flow rate. The model can adequately account for the flow and heat transfer phenomenon and the loss of pressure through friction in the pebble <b>bed</b> <b>type</b> {{high temperature}} nuclear reactor...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop appropriate methods for a quantitative assessment of mussel beds. Combined methods of ground truth investigation and remote sensing were applied to an old ripe and a young intertidal mussel bed. In the ripe <b>bed</b> <b>type,</b> three variables have to be determined for gaining reliable quantitative approaches of abundance and biomass: the total area covered by a bed; the coverage, that is the relation of mussel-covered small beds to the total mussel bed; and the portion, that is the area covered by mussels within a small bed. The total area can be determined by mapping in the field by means of a navigator, but a higher precision is reached by image analysis. For the coverage the assessment of ground by means of the 'transection method' supplies good results. The covered portion within the small beds is only assessable by ground truth examination, applying also the transection method. In the mussel beds of the young <b>bed</b> <b>type,</b> only ground truth methods can be applied: Mapping of total area in the field and sampling after the transection method. Due to the almost complete lack of any morphological structures, the young mussel beds were not picted in the aerial photographs analyzed until now. (orig.)

40|$|The fluvial {{system is}} a major concern in {{modeling}} landform evolution in response to tectonic deformation. Three stream <b>bed</b> <b>types</b> (bedrock, coarse-bed alluvial, and fine-bed alluvial) differ in factors controlling their occurrence and evolution and in appropriate modeling approaches. Spatial and temporal transitions among <b>bed</b> <b>types</b> occur in response to changes in sediment characteristics and tectonic deformation. Erosion in bedrock channels depends upon the ability to scour or pluck bed material; this detachment capacity is often a power function of drainage area and gradient. Exposure of bedrock in channel beds, due to rapid downcutting or resistant rock, slows the response of headwater catchments to downstream baselevel changes. Sediment routing through alluvial channels must account for supply from slope erosion, transport rates, abrasion, and sorting. In regional landform modeling, implicit rate laws must be developed for sediment production from erosion of sub-grid-scale slopes and small channels...|$|R

Dairy herds (n= 325) producing ≥ 11, 340 kg of milk daily were surveyed during a single farm visit. Monthly bulk milk SCC and total bacteria counts were obtained from milk buyers for 255 farms for a 2 -yr period. Of farms with the same <b>type</b> of <b>bedding</b> in all pens during the study period, most used inorganic bedding (IB), followed by organic nonmanure bedding (OB) and manure products (MB). Almost all bulk milk total bacterial counts were < 10, 000 cfu/mL and total bacterial count was not associated with <b>bedding</b> <b>type.</b> Bulk milk somatic cell score (BMSCS) was least for farms using IB, varied seasonally, and was greatest in the summer. The BMSCS was reduced when new bedding was added to stalls at intervals greater than 1 wk and when teats were dried before attaching the milking unit. The BMSCS for farms using OB was reduced when bedding in the backs of stalls was removed and replaced regularly and when fewer cows with nonfunctioning mammary quarters were present. The BMSCS for farms using MB was reduced when the proportion of cows with milk discarded was less. The rolling herd average (RHA) of herds using IB was 761 and 1, 153 kg greater than the RHA of herds using OB and MB, respectively. The RHA was 353 kg greater on farms where farmers understood subclinical mastitis and 965 kg greater on farms milking 3 times daily. Each 1 % increase of cows with nonfunctioning mammary quarters was associated with a decrease of 57 kg of RHA.

40|$|Interest {{in the use}} {{of dense}} phase {{conveying}} has grown considerably in recent years. However, not all products are capable of being conveyed in dense phase and {{it is often difficult to}} predict which products have dense phase capability without carrying out pilot conveying trials. The main objective of this work was to investigate the effect of bulk particular properties on pneumatic conveying performance. To achieve this, an extensive programme of conveying trials was carried out and each product tested was subjected to a series of bench scale tests to evaluate the bulk properties of the material. A phase diagram is proposed, based on the aeration properties of a material, which groups together products of similar conveying potential. The phase diagram gives a first indication on the basis of a small sample of material whether or not a product is capable of dense phase conveying. Further, it will predict the most appropriate mode of flow. For products capable of dense phase in a moving <b>bed</b> <b>type</b> flow regime, a further correlation is proposed which predicts the likely conveying performance in the pipeline in terms of mass throughput of product for given conditions based on the air retention characteristics of a product. The correlation has been generalised to extend its applicability to a range of pipeline configurations. The combination of the phase diagram and the correlation for dense phase moving <b>bed</b> <b>type</b> flow (the most commonly used form of dense phase conveying) provides a powerful design tool which will reduce the need for full conveying trials.
