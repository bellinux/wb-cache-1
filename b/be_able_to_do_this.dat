5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of metapopulation theory, {{in conjunction with}} the {{development of}} source-sink dynamics, emphasised the importance of connectivity between seemingly isolated populations.

25|$|Knowing how to {{suppress}} and manage one's own feelings {{is known as}} emotional intelligence, {{the ability to control}} one's emotions and to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.|$|E

And they must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it well. Assessment of learning should be directed towards gathering evidence for drawing inferences about capability under these conditions, not the scaffolded conditions.|$|R
25|$|Prediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., {{exactly when}} and {{where it will be}} visible, {{requires}} a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus must have been the first to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> A rigorous treatment requires spherical trigonometry, thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations. He may have discussed these things in Perí tēs katá plátos mēniaías tēs selēnēs kinēseōs ("On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude"), a work mentioned in the Suda.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the birds}} are not {{classified}} as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained {{to do so and}} the animal must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> without human assistance: it must also be shown that {{the birds are}} able to do this in the wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> all day.|$|E

500|$|In October 2010, the CIPM {{voted to}} submit a {{resolution}} for consideration at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), to [...] "take note of an intention" [...] that the kilogram be {{defined in terms of}} the Planck constant, h (which has dimensions of energy times time) together with other fundamental units. This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM in October 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014. Although the Committee recognised that significant progress had been made, they concluded that the data did not appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition, and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting, scheduled for 2018. Such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of delineating the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision, accuracy and stability.

The latter's plans had indeed been entirely based on the supposition that Blucher would retreat upon Namur; and in order to force him to do so he had abstained from all attack upon the Prussian left, and employed his whole strength against the right and center, so as to swing him round, and force him to retire by way of Namur.|$|E
