5|$|A Ellis {{had not yet}} {{reached the}} <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> be {{replaced}} by an extra attacker (he even attempted to return to stop the puck) and thus the goal was credited as an official goal against Ellis, {{as opposed to an}} empty-net goal.|$|E
5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, {{when he is not}} playing in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than sitting on the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> keep his muscles from stiffening.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ian Gomez) {{discovers that}} a {{photograph}} of Jules on an advertising bench has been defaced, so he, Bobby (Brian Van Holt) and Grayson stake out the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> catch the culprit. Grayson quickly realises that Bobby defaced the bench; Bobby confides in Grayson that he's not entirely comfortably yet with Grayson's and Jules' relationship, but insists that their friendship is still close.|$|E

5000|$|Members {{from the}} {{political}} party or parties which make up the Government sit on the government <b>benches,</b> <b>to</b> the Speaker's right.|$|R
50|$|Senators sit to {{the left}} of the Bailiff, then the Connétables, and then the Deputies filling up the <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> the right.|$|R
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} the <b>bench.</b> <b>To</b> the right is a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the picket line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
50|$|The men are all {{drunk and}} stumble over <b>to</b> some <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> rest. Nucki deliriously stumbles over {{to speak to}} a horse on a carriage.|$|R
50|$|Assembly Plant {{has real}} tools and work <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> {{assemble}} projects made of recycled materials donated {{by people in}} the community. Blueprints of suggested projects are available.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} smaller slides. A lazy river {{is also an}} attraction. A small outdoor pool is open during the summer. This pool has picnic <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> the side of it.|$|R
5|$|The Aggies {{broke the}} losing streak in 1910 with a stalemate, 11–11. In {{the final minutes}} of the game, Hopkins was on the Maryland eight-yard line, second down with two yards to go. A Johns Hopkins guard named Schrieber then ran from the field to their <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> leave a knocked-out tooth for safekeeping. The referee penalized the Blue and Black ten yards, and when their field goal attempt was blocked, the game ended in a tie.|$|E
5|$|The {{game against}} the Islanders also {{featured}} a devastating open-ice hit by Dion Phaneuf on New York's Kyle Okposo that saw the young forward taken off on a stretcher and sent to hospital with a concussion. The hit led Pascal Morency to leave his team's <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> engage Phaneuf as a melee {{broke out in the}} aftermath of the check. The league reviewed the incident and suspended Morency ten games for leaving the bench.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he rose from his seat and began to make his way towards the Welsh <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
50|$|Hopkins Beach {{is a great}} spot {{to spend}} the afternoon. There is a pier that leads out with <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> sit. the view is wonderful, looking out to Howe Sound and Cypress Mountain.|$|R
50|$|On 2 May 2012 Crook {{announced}} that from Tuesday 8 May, he would {{move from the}} cross <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> sit with his National Party colleagues. He did not, however, participate in joint Coalition meetings.|$|R
50|$|On March 21, 2014, the Oakland Raiders traded their 2014 sixth round {{draft pick}} to the Texans in {{exchange}} for Schaub. He was <b>benched</b> <b>to</b> start the season in favor of rookie QB Derek Carr.|$|R
5|$|After {{coming off}} the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action at New England, he ran for 106 yards and {{registered}} 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland. In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second play after the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown, the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season.|$|E
5|$|Brandon, however, {{remained}} at Bradford for the 2009–10 season and he scored his first goal {{for his hometown}} club with a late goal in a 2–0 victory against his former side Torquay United in late August. The following month, his second goal for the club again came against one of Brandon's former teams, as he once again came off the substitutes' <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> score in a 3–0 victory over Chesterfield. However, he continued to struggle to hold down a regular first-team place and when new manager Peter Taylor took over, Brandon {{was one of a}} number of players released early from his contract. He had played just 31 games during his two seasons with City, scoring three goals.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
50|$|Weingartner Park {{is located}} at Second and Summit Streets with a large variety of trees. There are many {{pathways}} and <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> enjoy and the park is particularly shady and breezy during {{the spring and summer}} months.|$|R
50|$|A few benches under a {{chestnut}} tree, the ivy {{hanging from}} the surrounding façades makes the space a lush, relaxed spot. During summers, a network of storytellers gather around the <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> tell their stories both to enthusiasts and passers-by.|$|R
50|$|Bower Park: Originally named Tower Park, in 1880 a 125-foot brick {{water tower}} {{was built on}} the site. The water tower was {{demolished}} in 1941. This is a very small park with flowers and a few <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> sit on located in downtown.|$|R
5|$|In August 2012, Holroyd {{joined his}} {{hometown}} club, Conference National side Macclesfield Town, on loan until January 2013. He made a scoring debut for the club, {{coming off the}} <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> score with his first touch in a 3–2 win against Lincoln City. In the fourth appearance of his loan spell, Holroyd scored a hat-trick as Macclesfield defeated Stockport County 4–3 at Edgeley Park. Holroyd scored his fifth goal for Macclesfield in a 2–2 away draw with Gateshead, coming on as a substitute and equalising late-on. He went on to score nine times in 23 appearances during the five-month loan spell, including two goals in a 4–1 FA Cup victory over Barrow that ensured Macclesfield progressed to {{the third round of}} the competition.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007 Evans {{came off}} the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> make his senior debut in City’s 1–0 League Cup victory against Norwich City. With first choice {{opportunities}} at City limited Evans moved on loan to Norwich City in November of that year, agreeing a deal until 1 January 2008. He made his debut for Norwich the following week when he came on as a substitute in the 3–1 victory over Blackpool. His first goal for the club came two games later, and just two minutes into his first start in a 2–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle {{at the start of}} December. Evans returned to Manchester City after his initial loan deal expired in January 2008, having made eight appearances and scored two goals.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{was awarded}} a {{testimonial}} match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable {{to play in the}} whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.|$|E
5000|$|During wartime, {{there were}} no {{performances}} and a bunker created by blasting {{into the side of}} the Kahlenberg under Castle Broich served as an air-raid shelter and a field hospital. People stripped the theatre of its wooden <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> use as firewood.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the people {{came down from}} the <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> congratulate the life-savers, and for fully an hour the two were forced to remain there listening to words of praise which they felt were not warranted by their exploit on the creek.|$|R
60|$|Rollo and Carlos {{sat down}} upon {{one of the}} <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> wait; but the little minute proved to be nearly half an hour. They were not tired of waiting, however, {{there was so much}} to amuse and {{interest}} them going on in the room.|$|R
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's <b>Bench</b> <b>to</b> gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E
5|$|The Blazers then {{faced the}} Dallas Mavericks {{in the first}} round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs. Roy shot 1-for-8 the first 2 games, {{including}} a Game 2 where he saw only 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless. The Blazers lost both games and trailed 0–2 in the series. He expressed his frustration about being the last substitution during the first 2 quarters, and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1. The series then went to Portland, and Roy scored 16 points in 23 minutes off the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> boost the Blazers to a 97–92 Game 3 win.|$|E
5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
50|$|Gibson raised funds by {{building}} log cabins for others including the Suitor, Fisher and Manning families, and selling off large lots on the <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> city folk. He never married or had children {{and died in}} the mid 1960s. Cabins grew and flourished on the benches of the Ghost.|$|R
5000|$|The mass {{collection}} of human data required by conscious cities has raised questions {{of ethics and}} privacy. Moreover, a conscious city can react negatively to certain groups by using [...] "hostile architecture," [...] such as sloped public <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> deter homeless people or high-frequency emitters to keep children away.|$|R
