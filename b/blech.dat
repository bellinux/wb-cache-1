40|$|Several {{analytical}} models {{exist for}} evaluating squeeze film damping in rigid rectangular perforated MEMS structures. These models {{vary in their}} treatment of losses through perforations and squeezed film, in their assumptions of compressibility, rarefaction and inertia, and their treatment of various second order corrections. We present a model that improves upon our previously reported work by incorporating more accurate losses through holes proposed by Veijola and treating boundary cells and interior cell differently as proposed by Mohite et al. We benchmark all these models against experimental results obtained for a typical perforated MEMS structure with geometric parameters (e. g., perforation geometry, air gap, plate thickness) that fall well within the acceptable range of parameters for these models (with the sole exception of <b>Blech’s</b> model {{that does not include}} perforations but is included for historical reasons). We compare the results and discuss the sources of errors. We show that the proposed model gives the best result by predicting the damping constant within 10 % of the experimental value. We study the validity of the proposed model over the entire range of perforation ratios (PR) by comparing its results with numerically computed results from 3 D Navier-Stokes equation. These results are also compared with other analytical models. The proposed model shows considerably better results than other models, especially for large values of PR...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{composite}} slabs {{is common}} {{because of its}} acceptance, technical quality and economic advantages. Design concepts for bending and longitudinal shear of the composite slabs are already embedded in the standardization. For the verification of the shear force capacity of composite slabs, the code of composite elements refers to the semi-empirical regulations for massive concrete beams without shear reinforcement. These empirical rules were not adapted to the specific bearing behaviour of composite slabs and a discrete model for composite slabs under shear load is missing. Latest investigations with composite slabs and structural lightweight aggregate concrete revealed a safety deficit in case of shear failure. The inaccuracy {{in the description of}} the failure mode depended on an unfavourable ratio between concrete tensile strength and compressive strength and interacts with the anchorage of the longitudinal reinforcement. Within the scope of this project the failure mechanisms of vertical shear in composite slabs were separated and described in their effect in order to develop a suitable shear model. For this purpose, shear tests on composite slabs with varying plate geometry and an alternating combination with normal and lightweight con-crete were performed. A mechanically justified, variable design model for composite slaps subjected to shear forces was formulated from the gain in knowledge. The model is characterized by a variable formulation. It can be adapted to varying sheet geometries and is valid for lightweight and normal weight concrete. The previously neglected shear bearing capacity of the metal sheet was taken into account. The shear model is composed by the vertical bearing components of the metal sheet, the uncracked compression zone and the activatible part of the fracture process zone. The components act in an additive manner. Thus, a first proposal of a closed solution for the shear design of composite slabs has been developed, which allows an efficient and safe utilization of this ceiling system. As the different bearing effects have been described individually, substitions or supplements of bearing mechanisms are easy. In future, the integration of the effect of fiber-reinforced concrete is conceivable. For the first time a research project dealt with an analysis for steel composite slabs under shear force. The findings allow conclusions on the structural behavior of composite slabs and the differences to reinforced concrete beams. This provides the basis for further research approaches. An extensive data collection was performed and recorded in a database of composite slabs with vertical shear failure in order to support further investigations. Verbunddecke ist ein Deckensystem, das Akzeptanz und Wirtschaftlichkeit bei gleichzeitig ausgereifter bautechnischer Qualität vereint. Nachweiskonzepte zur Biegetragfähigkeit und Längsschubtragfähigkeit wurden bereits für normative Regelungen erarbeitet. Für die Bemessung unter Querkraft orientiert sich das Regelwerk für Verbundbau am Nachweiskonzept für Massivbauteile. Eine eigenständige, an die besondere konstruktive Gestaltung von Verbunddecken angepasste Bemessung ist nicht vorhanden. Bisher wird somit ein empirisch gestütztes Querkraftmodell verwendet, dessen statistische Kalibrierung ohne Berücksichtigung von Verbunddeckenversuchen vorgenommen wurde. Neuere Untersuchungen an Verbunddecken mit gefügedichtem Leichtbeton zeigten, dass bei einem ungünstigen Verhältnis der Zug- zur Druckfestigkeit des Betons und in Abhängigkeit der Verankerung der Längsbewehrung relevante Sicherheitsdefizite infolge Querkraftversagen auftreten können. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden die das Querkraftversagen bei Verbunddecken auslösenden Mechanismen separiert und in ihrer Wirkung beschrieben. Hierzu wurden eine Vielzahl von Querkraftversuchen an Verbunddecken mit variierender Blechgeometrie und in wechselnder Kombination mit Normal- und Leichtbeton durchgeführt. Aus dem Zugewinn an Erkenntnissen wurde ein mechanisch begründetes, variables Bemessungsmodell für Verbunddecken unter Querkraftbeanspruchung formuliert. Das Modell zeichnet sich durch die Berücksichtigung der bisher vernachlässigten Eigentragfähigkeit des Verbundblechs aus und kann zudem flexibel an die verwendete Betonart sowie an variierende Blechgeometrien angepasst werden. Das Querkraftmodell setzt sich aus den additiv wirkenden Traganteilen des <b>Blechs,</b> der ungerissenen Druckzone sowie der aktivierten Bruchprozesszone zusammen. Damit wurde ein geschlossener Lösungsvorschlag zur Querkraftbemessung erarbeitet, welcher eine optimale und sichere Ausnutzung des Deckensystems ermöglicht. Da die Einzeltragwirkungen individuell und mechanisch beschrieben wurden sind Ergän-zungen leicht möglich, so dass zukünftig auch die Einbindung der Wirkung von Faserbeton denkbar wäre. In der Arbeit wurde erstmals der Frage nach einem ingenieurmäßigen Nachweisformat für Verbunddecken unter Schubbeanspruchung nachgegangen. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse ermöglichen Schlussfolgerungen zu dem von Stahlbetonbalken abweichenden Tragverhalten und liefern damit eine Basis für weitere Forschungsansätze. Um dies zu unterstützen wurde eine umfangreiche Datensammlung durchgeführt und in einer Versuchsdatenbank von Stahlverbunddecken mit Querkraftversagen festgehalten. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{interconnect}} {{technology in}} large-scale integration (LSI) {{is one of}} the importanttechnologies that determine the performance, characteristics, and components per chipof LSI. The most important characteristic of the “Planer patent” of Robert Noyce et al.,which addresses one of the fundamental concepts of integrated circuits, is theinterconnect technology, which involves printing and connecting semiconductor deviceson a substrate. This technology is cheap and suitable for mass production, and hencethe integration degree has evolved explosively with advancement in the processtechnology. Today, LSI has been developed to ultra large scale integration (ULSI),which involves device components that exceed hundreds of millions. Every device isconnected by interconnects, which are spread around in all directions. Multi-levelinterconnects are required for these circuit integrations. As of 2007, the multi-levelstructures have exceeded ten layers. Moreover, the interconnect dimension has beenreduced to 100 nm or less due to the evolution in the process technology. Along withthe augmentation of the integration degree, the interconnect technology continues tosignificantly contribute toward the quality and reliability of LSI. Electromigration was considered to be a significant issue with regard to thereliability of interconnects from that sudden rise period. Because Si substrates with large heat capacities are used, the nature of radiation of the interconnects that arecovered by SiO 2 with high thermal conductivity is outstanding as compared to that ofthe electric wire usually used. Therefore, this phenomenon allows large currentdensities and can contribute toward improvement in the speed of integrated circuitfunctions. However, this significantly high current density induces electromigration,which is the factor that affects the reliability of LSI interconnects. In order to control the electromigration over a product life cycle period,countermeasures must be adopted in all the phases of LSI product development, that is,action plans are required to maintain a sufficiently low probability of failure in eachphase of product development, planning, design, prototype, manufacture, and testing inorder to achieve high reliability. For this purpose, {{it is important to understand}} thefailure mechanisms correctly, and this becomes an important key for establishing aphysical and statistical model for reliability prediction. In particular, ensuringreliability {{is one of the}} important measures of success in the development of anext-generation LSI process technology. In this thesis, the reliability focused on electromigration and fundamentaltechnology of highly reliable, narrow damascene Cu interconnects are discussed. Thelifetime characteristics and failure mechanisms are clarified based on a reliability test. Moreover, the fundamental physical characteristics are investigated, and a methodologyto realize highly reliable interconnects is proposed. Based on this investigation, theadvanced process technologies were developed and a comparison between them wasperformed. The failure mechanisms of Cu interconnect, which are clarified in thisstudy, will contribute toward the development of ULSI process technologies in thefuture. Moreover, the approach adopted in this study will also be effective in thedevelopment of integrated circuits in next-generation nano-devices. This thesis comprises eight chapters. Chapter 1, “Introduction,” surveys the role and importance of the interconnecttechnology for achieving advanced LSI. Moreover, the modeling phase from a failurephysics model to a LSI lifetime prediction model is indicated, and the organic link andnecessity for each phase are discussed. Based on these relationships, the purpose ofthis thesis is proposed. In Chapter 2, “Reliability of narrow Cu interconnect and Failure Mechanism,” theelectromigration characteristics that are investigated by the conventional lifetime testare discussed. In particular, based on the comparison with aluminum interconnectsthat were widely adopted before Cu interconnect, the electromigration characteristicsand key points required to improve Cu reliability are proposed. In Chapter 3, “Void nucleation and growth,” the characteristics of theelectromigration-induced void nucleation and growth are discussed based on Blech’sbasic electromigration model. The coefficient of diffusion and driving force in Blech’smodel are investigated experimentally, and the Cu diffusion mechanism is discussed. In the study of the diffusion coefficient, the dominant diffusion mechanism isinvestigated experimentally by using the activation energy and crystal structure. Moreover, the atomic driving forces of Cu, electron wind force, and stress-inducedbackflow, are discussed in detail along with the electromigration threshold currentdensity-length product. In Chapter 4, “Dimension dependence on electromigration of Cu interconnect,” thevoid nucleation and growth are investigated with regard to line-width dependence, andthe effects of miniaturization based on <b>Blech’s</b> model are discussed. The contributionsof the diffusion path of Cu are discussed according to the line-width dependence. The current waveform, which flows into the interconnect in actual LSI operations,is a pulse current and not a direct-current electricity that is widely used for reliabilitytests. Hence, in Chapter 5, “Void nucleation and growth behavior under pulsecurrent,” the void nucleation and growth under pulse current are investigated, and the effect of the electromigration phenomenon on actual LSI operations is discussed. In Chapter 6, “Electromigration lifetime distribution and failure mode,” thepurpose, function, and superiority of the new proposed test structure are shown in orderto study the correlation between the failure mode and lifetime distribution. This teststructure enables the investigation of the electromigration failure modes of very lowcumulative failure probability physically and statistically by using the opticalbeam-induced resistance change (OBIRCH) method. The relationship between theelectromigration lifetime distribution and the results of the physical analysis arediscussed. In Chapter 7, “Advanced interconnect technology to improve electromigration,”the challenges involved in achieving performance and reliability are described based onthe development of interconnect technologies for 45 nm and beyond generation, and thenovel resistivity measurement technique for the efficient development is proposed. Byusing this technique, a comparison of the several advanced process technologies isperformed, and the efficiency of the technique is discussed. Moreover, the reliabilityimprovement efficiency of the impurity doping to Cu is investigated based on thephysical mechanism; further, the directionality and guidelines are proposed for thedevelopments of interconnect technology for 32 nm node and beyond. In Chapter 8, “Conclusion,” the conclusion of this thesis is summarized along withthe challenges involved in the development of a reliable LSI system in the future. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
