DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can be {{reversed}} for Pit's <b>body.</b> <b>On</b> his journey there, he, Palutena, and Viridi learn that Hades has been profiting off the wars against the Underworld Army, Forces of Nature, Aurum, and Chaos Kin by using the souls of slaughtered humans to add numbers to his forces. Upon arrival at the Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the Spring to restore her health and ultimately her physical body, but is still defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{foundation}} in the United Kingdom, Scouting {{spread around the}} globe. The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, there is now at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues {{to be seen as}} part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing <b>body</b> <b>on</b> policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.|$|E

5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus <b>body</b> <b>on</b> it.|$|E

5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless.

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the <b>body</b> <b>on</b> how to do things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected {{to a lesser degree}} than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the <b>body</b> <b>on</b> death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the <b>body</b> <b>on</b> days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E

5|$|Massino, Napolitano and Gerlando Sciascia, a Sicilian-born capo {{linked to}} the Montreal Rizzuto crime family, {{arranged}} a meeting at a Brooklyn social club with the three capos for May 5, 1981. They had four gunmen, including Vitale and Bonanno-affiliated Montreal boss Vito Rizzuto, hiding in a closet to ambush them. When Trinchera, Giaccone and Indelicato arrived with Frank Lino to meet Massino they were shot to death, with Massino himself stopping Indelicato from escaping. Lino escaped unscathed by running out the door. The hit further improved Massino's prestige, but was marred by both Lino's escape and the discovery of Indelicato's <b>body</b> <b>on</b> May 20.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her <b>body</b> <b>on</b> fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995.

He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
