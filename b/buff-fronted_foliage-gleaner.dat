In the Neotropics the leaders or [...] "core" [...] members may be black-throated shrike-tanagers in southern Mexico, or three-striped warblers elsewhere in Central America. In South America, core species may include antbirds such as Thamnomanes, antshrikes, Furnariidae (ovenbirds and woodcreepers) like the <b>buff-fronted</b> <b>foliage-gleaner</b> or the olivaceous woodcreeper, or Parulidae (New World [...] "warblers") like the golden-crowned warblers.
