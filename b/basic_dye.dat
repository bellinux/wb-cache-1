40|$|The exact {{mechanism}} by which the ordinary acid and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> stain bacterial protoplasm {{is yet to be}} explained. The leading theories have been staining (1) by chemical union with the protoplasm, (2) by nonspecific physical adsorption onto surfaces, (3) by adsorption onto specific chemical sites, and (4) by solution in protoplasmic constituents. If staining reactions as a whole are considered, each of these theories will explain some particular case of staining. This paper is restricted in its scope to the staining of bacterial protoplasm by common <b>basic</b> and acid <b>dyes.</b> Perhaps the most widely accepted theory of bacterial staining was presented by Stearn and Stearn (1929, 1930), who showed that acid dyes stain bacterial cells best under acid conditions and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> stain best under basic conditions. This was explained by the amphoteric nature of proteins; thus, acid dyes could react with amino groups, and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> could react with carboxyl groups, de-pending on the particular state of ionization of the protein. The idea of <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> combining with carboxyl groups of proteins was excellent. However, proo...|$|R

50|$|Biological tissue {{has little}} {{inherent}} contrast {{in either the}} light or electron microscope. Staining is employed to give both contrast to the tissue as well as highlighting particular features of interest. Where the underlying mechanistic chemistry of staining is understood, the term histochemistry is used. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E stain) is {{the most commonly used}} light microscopical stain in histology and histopathology. Hematoxylin, a <b>basic</b> <b>dye,</b> stains nuclei blue due to an affinity to nucleic acids in the cell nucleus; eosin, an acidic dye, stains the cytoplasm pink. Uranyl acetate and lead citrate are commonly used to impart contrast to tissue in the electron microscope.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism for}} metachromasia requires {{the presence of}} polyanions within the tissue. When these tissues are stained with a concentrated <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> solution, such as toluidine blue, the bound dye molecules are close enough to form dimeric and polymeric aggregates. The light absorption spectra of these stacked dye aggregates {{differ from those of}} the individual monomeric dye molecules. Cell and tissue structures that have high concentrations of ionized sulfate and phosphate groups—such as the ground substance of cartilage, heparin-containing granules of mast cells, and rough endoplasmic reticulum of plasma cells—exhibit metachromasia. This depends on the charge density of the negative sulfate and carboxylate anions in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The GAG polyanion stabilizes the stacked, positively-charged dye molecules, resulting in a spectral shift as the conjugated double bond π-orbitals of adjacent dye molecules overlap. The greater the degree of stacking, the greater the metachromatic shift. Thus, hyaluronic acid, lacking sulphate groups and with only moderate charge density, causes slight metachromasia; chondroitin sulfate, with an additional sulfate residue per GAG saccharide dimer, is an effective metachromatic substrate, whilst heparin, with further N-sulfation, is strongly metachromatic. Therefore, toluidine blue will appear purple to red when it stains these components.|$|E

The adsorbents were modified by HNO 3 to improve their biosorption capacity. The adsorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. The zeta potential was determined {{as a function of the}} pH, in order to explain the effect of pH on electrostatic adsorption ability of biosorbent. Modification of adsorbents with nitric acid led to an increase in accessibility of some functional groups on the surface or a decrease in negativity of surface charge. The modification of pine cone increased its adsorption capacity for the <b>basic</b> <b>dye,</b> whereas the modification of oak cups pulp decreased the adsorption ability for <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> to some extent.

The adsorption isotherm can be well fitted by both the Langmuir and the Freundlich models.
