5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the area}} is now Green Belt, placing {{restrictions}} on the kinds of developments that can take place. There are areas of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back to wet mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired {{at the end of}} 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E
5|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) studied {{potential}} future launch {{vehicles of}} the European Union under the Ausgewählte Systeme und Technologien für Raumtransport (ASTRA; English: Systems and Technologies for Space Transportation Applications) programme from 1999 to 2005, with additional studies continuing until 2009. The LFBB design {{was one of}} two projects within the ASTRA program, the other being Phoenix RLV. During development, scale models were constructed for testing various configurations in DLR's supersonic Trisonische Messstrecke Köln (TMK; English: Trisonic measuring section at Cologne) and in their Hyperschallwindkanal 2 Köln (H2K; English: Hypersonic wind canal at Cologne) wind tunnels. The preliminary mechanical design of other major elements was done <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> EADS Space Transportation and MAN.|$|E

5|$|The companies' {{first major}} {{projects}} were Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises. Since then, {{the majority of}} the games produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> have been localized for Western audiences, although the process was not given a high priority at Square until the international success of Final Fantasy VII. A dedicated localization department was consequently created at the company's Tokyo headquarters around 1998. Enix remained without a translation department until its merger with Square in 2003. In recent years, the process of localization has undergone changes, mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles. Most major titles are now developed with localization running in parallel to development, with more simultaneous releases and even occasional titles developed in localized form first in order to appeal to the Western market.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a degree}} of public and {{legislative}} distaste for a limitation of liability, with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity. The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). Insurance companies {{were excluded from the}} act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Companies</b> Act 1862. The minimum number of members necessary for registration as a limited company was reduced to seven <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Companies</b> Act 1856.

25|$|The {{success of}} Crane Iron {{and the many}} other iron {{companies}} that sprang up in the Lehigh Valley led to a major mining boom in Lehigh County, with no less than 261 mines of varying size being opened. Some were worked by independent operators and the ore sold on the open market, others leased by iron companies, and some owned outright <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies.</b> In 1875, Crane Iron leased eleven limonite mines in Lehigh County, owned three outright and one jointly with Thomas Iron, and leased a hematite mine at Zionsville.|$|E

25|$|An {{article was}} {{published}} by the Expresso dated 2004 which listed the most desirable graduates of universities and polytechnics by Portuguese companies {{in the fields of}} engineering, structural engineering, marketing, management, economics and finance. This non-scientific report used a survey made by some human resources recruiting firms, which means that the population surveyed comprised only the candidates who were seeking a job through those recruiting firms, and excluded the highly qualified candidates who were recruited directly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies,</b> by other important recruiting firms, or were recruited by headhunters before graduation. Additionally, some graduates are recruited from local higher learning institutions through partnerships with local companies or other institutions, bypassing full and open competition.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 United States Department of Agriculture {{report found}} the {{adoption}} of genetically engineered (GE) soy, corn and cotton reduced the amount of pesticides used overall, but did result in a slightly greater amount of herbicides used for soy specifically. The use of GE soy was also associated with greater conservation tillage, indirectly leading to better soil conservation, as well as increased income from off-farming sources due to the greater ease with which the crops can be managed. Though the overall estimated benefits of {{the adoption of}} GE soybeans in the United States was $310million, the majority of this benefit was experienced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> selling the seeds (40%), followed by biotechnology firms (28%) and farmers (20%). The patent on glyphosate-tolerant soybeans expired in 2014, so benefits {{can be expected to}} shift.|$|E
