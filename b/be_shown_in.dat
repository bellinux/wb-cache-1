5|$|A {{total of}} 112 fictional films {{are known to}} have been {{produced}} in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) between 1926 and the colony's dissolution in 1949. The earliest motion pictures, imported from abroad, were shown in late 1900, and by the early 1920s imported serials and fictional films were being shown, often with localised names. Dutch companies were also producing documentary films about the Indies to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands. The first reports of fictional film production in the Indies date from 1923, although the work in question was not completed. The first locally produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, was directed by L. Heuveldorp and released on 31 December 1926.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} nation's {{official}} censors ordered scenes {{cut from the}} film. According to Xinhua, the state news agency of the People's Republic of China, ten minutes of footage containing Chow Yun-fat's portrayal of Singaporean pirate Sao Feng were trimmed from versions of the film which may <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> China. Chow is onscreen for twenty minutes in the uncensored theatrical release of the film. No official reason for the censorship was given, but unofficial sources within China have indicated that the character gave a negative and stereotypical portrayal of Chinese people.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|Che {{opened in}} single theaters in N.Y.C. and L.A. where it made $60,100 with sellouts of both venues.

This successful run prompted IFC Films to show this version in nine additional markets on 16 January.

5|$|In January 2007, Casino Royale {{became the}} first Bond film ever to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> {{mainland}} Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that {{was added to the}} 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). Casino Royale has earned approximately $11.7million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5million.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E

5|$|The era of American film {{production}} {{from the early}} sound era to {{the enforcement of the}} Hays Code in 1934 is denoted as Pre-Code Hollywood. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions of violence in any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own guidelines, and New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a picture to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: the gangster picture and the prison film.|$|E

5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
