40|$|Context: Tissue banking {{informatics}} {{deals with}} standardized annotation, collection and storage of biospecimens that can further {{be shared by}} researchers. Over the last decade, the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at the University of Pittsburgh has developed various tissue banking informatics tools to expedite translational medicine research. In this review, we describe the technical approach and capabilities of these models. Design: Clinical annotation of biospecimens requires data retrieval from various clinical information systems and the de-identification of the data by an honest broker. Based upon these requirements, DBMI, with its collaborators, has developed both Oracle-based organ-specific data marts and a more generic, model-driven architecture for <b>biorepositories.</b> The organ-specific models are developed utilizing Oracle 9. 2. 0. 1 server tools and software applications and the model-driven architecture is implemented in a J 2 EE framework. Result: The organ-specific <b>biorepositories</b> implemented by DBMI include the Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource ([URL]), Pennsylvania Cancer Alliance Bioinformatics Consortium ([URL]), EDRN Colorectal and Pancreatic Neoplasm Database ([URL]) and Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) Head and Neck Neoplasm Database ([URL] The model-based architecture {{is represented by the}} National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank ([URL] These <b>biorepositories</b> provide thousands of well annotated biospecimens for the researchers that are searchable through query interfaces available via the Internet. Conclusion: These systems, developed and supported by our institute, serve to form a common platform for cancer research to accelerate progress in clinical and translational research.
