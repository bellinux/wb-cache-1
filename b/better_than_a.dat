5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the film}} {{takes place in}} Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, {{principal}} photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from {{around the same time}} as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture. However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, was shot in the town square of Blackeberg. Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, was shot in the nearby suburb of Råcksta. The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture. Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio. The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film. Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{spent the}} second half of the 1932–33 season as an amateur with Darlington in the Third Division North. He then {{returned}} to his home town where he turned professional with York City. He played six league matches for each club. In 1934, he joined another Third Division club, Hartlepools United, where he established himself as the regular selection at outside-left and scored at <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> goal every two games in his first season. Less prolific in his second year, he was sold to Chesterfield, newly promoted to the Second Division for 1936–37. Again, he was first choice on the left wing and productive in front of goal during his first season, less so in the next, in which he helped the team reach the fifth round of the 1937–38 FA Cup. In 1938–39, he fell out of favour, and requested a transfer. He joined Queens Park Rangers, but his career was cut short by the outbreak of war.|$|E

5|$|Benfica started November by hosting Beira-Mar on the 2nd in the {{official}} opening of their new stadium. Beira-Mar won 2–1, inflicting Benfica's second league defeat, which opened an 11-point gap to Porto. Camacho blamed the defeat {{on the lack of}} goal opportunities. Four days later, Benfica received Molde for the UEFA Cup, beating them 3–1 and assuring a two-goal lead for the second leg. Camacho recognized the team was struggling to defend against corner-kicks, as both Beira-Mar and Molde had scored in corners. On 9 November, the team visited Alverca and won three-nil, with two goals from Tiago and one from Geovanni. Camacho was pleased with the performance, but said that Benfica should have scored more. On 12 November, Benfica played Marítimo, in a fixture transferred from October. Weakened by injuries in some of the regular players, Benfica could not do <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> one-all draw. Camacho attributed the result to the excessive number of games in short amount of time, something most of the players were not accustomed to. After a 10-day international break, Benfica opened the Portuguese Cup campaign against Estrela da Amadora on the 22nd. They won 3–1 with all of the goals arriving late in the game. Benfica closed the month with a 2–0 win to Molde, on the second leg of the UEFA Cup, with Tiago again scoring twice.|$|E
