500|$|... "My Bologna" [...] is {{a parody}} of The Knack's hit song [...] "My Sharona", {{recorded}} and performed by musical parody artist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic. Yankovic originally wrote the song while he attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California; the original version of the parody was recorded in a bathroom {{across the hall from}} the radio station at which Yankovic worked. The title refers to <b>Bologna</b> <b>sausage,</b> specifically the Oscar Mayer brand popular in the United States. Yankovic sent [...] "My Bologna" [...] to Dr. Demento, who aired the song on his nationwide radio program, The Dr. Demento Show. [...] The song was a hit on the program, and eventually gained the number one spot on Dr. Demento's [...] "Funny Five" [...] countdown.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Alfred “Weird Al” Yankovic, {{was a student}} at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California, and in his spare time, he was a DJ for the university’s radio station, KCPR. Yankovic had a penchant for comedy music, and often played it on his radio show. In the summer of 1979, [...] "My Sharona" [...] by The Knack was a {{particularly}} popular song, and Yankovic started to consider spoofing the single. This parody eventually came to fruition during an ad hoc jam session with his friend and fellow KCPR DJ, Jon Iverson; while Iverson played the main riff to [...] "My Sharona" [...] on his guitar, Yankovic began to write lyrics for his parody. Yankovic's lyrics eventually coalesced into [...] "My Bologna", an ode to the Oscar Mayer brand of <b>Bologna</b> <b>sausage.</b> The duo started to play it in and around the Cal Poly campus at parties and local theaters.|$|E

High-fat sausages exhibited better binding properties than low-fat sausages. Freezing and frozen storage caused binding properties to deteriorate, the more so the lower the fat content. In general, addition of starch caused an increase in penetration force {{and a decrease in}} elasticity of sausages, and also favoured freeze-thaw stability. Addition of egg white had no influence (p> 0. 05) on the WHC of <b>Bologna</b> <b>sausages</b> but did influence texture. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This applied {{research}} {{was done in}} order to obtain cooked products (<b>bologna</b> <b>sausages)</b> with significantly lower amount of energy, total fat and saturated fat and higher amount of ω- 3 fatty acids than conventional ones. Two subsequent experiments were performed. RESULTS: Experiment 1 aimed a pork back-fat reduction and allowed to obtain sausages with 84 g kg- 1 of fat and 1334 kcal kg- 1, without significant negative effects on sensory quality. Carrageenan was used as fat replacer. Experiment 2 aimed improving the lipid profile of the “energy-reduced” sausages previously developed, by a partial substitution of the pork back-fat with a linseed oil-in water emulsion (substitution levels: 25 % to 100 %). Using the 100 % substitution level gave rise to products with 27 g kg- 1 α-linolenic acid, and low saturated fat content (13. 5 g kg- 1), showing good sensory results regarding taste, smell and texture. The use of antioxidant maintained low TBARs values in all formulations. CONCLUSION: It is possible to obtain cooked meat products (<b>bologna</b> <b>sausages)</b> with low energy, low saturated fat and high amount of ω- 3 fatty acids simultaneously, applying a combination of use of carrageenan, linseed oil emulsion and increment of water, without significant effects over the sensory quality. Functional products, interesting from a nutritional standpoint, were achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} fat (7. 0, 14. 0 and 20. 0 %), starch (0, 5 and 10 %) and egg white (0, 1. 5 and 3 %) on the {{microstructure}} {{and texture of}} <b>bologna</b> <b>sausages</b> were examined. As levels of fat and starch increased, the microstructure exhibited increasing numbers of holes (P 0. 05) in shape. No clear relationship was found between addition of egg white and these morphological variations. Low-fat sausage (7. 0 %) was less hard and chewy (P< 0. 05) than high-fat (200 %) sausage; likewise, a direct relationship was found between starch and egg white content and hardness and chewiness of the bologna.

40|$|The {{effects of}} plasma protein (PP) and soy fiber (SF) content on the {{properties}} (binding properties, color, and texture) of <b>bologna</b> <b>sausages</b> as influenced by fat level (F) were assessed by response surface methodology (RSM). Higher soy fiber and plasma protein contents favored {{the formation of}} harder, chewier structures with improved fat and water binding properties. Fat reduction decreased textural properties and increased weight loss. Cooking loss was affected (P < 0. 05) by interactions between PP and F and chewiness was affected (P < 0. 05) by interactions between SF and E Plasma protein influenced binding and textural properties more than soy fiber and was, therefore, thought best to limit the effect of fat reduction.

40|$|A little-studied {{procedure}} for adjusting the properties of low-fat products {{is to use the}} influence that both composition and certain processing factors exert on these properties. The object of the present work was to assess the effects of protein level (P, ranging from 10 % to 16 %), fat level (F, ranging from 10. 1 % to 22 %) and cooking temperature (HT, ranging from 77 °C to 105 °C) on the binding properties and colour of meat emulsions. Protein content was the variable that most influenced total expressible fluid (TEF) and purge loss. Heating rate had scarcely any effect on the binding properties of <b>Bologna</b> <b>sausages.</b> Analysis of variance indicated that the regression models for parameters L, a and b were not significant. © 1995.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{determined}} the sodium content of processed foods aimed at {{children and adolescents}} and the adequacy of its content {{in relation to the}} dietary reference intakes, and verified label compliance. METHODS: The sodium content of 17 food samples (instant noodles, breaded items, hamburger patties, hot dogs and <b>bologna</b> <b>sausages)</b> was determined by flame photometry and chloride titration, and the results were compared with nutritional data. The labels were checked for compliance with the pertinent laws. RESULTS: According to flame photometry and chloride titration, 13 and 5 products, respectively, had sodium contents that exceeded those reported on the nutrition facts label by more than 20 %. All samples had more than 480 mg of sodium per serving. The tolerable upper intake level for sodium for children aged 4 - 8 years was exceeded in 8 instant noodles and 3 breaded items according to flame photometry, and in 9 items according to chloride titration. Regarding the legislation, 5 products used a daily reference intake other than that provided by the legislation to report their percent sodium content per serving. Moreover, the serving sizes of 3 instant noodles, the terminology used in 1 instant noodles and the protein content of 1 breaded item were also not compliant with the legislation.

40|$|Research {{has proved}} a {{relationship}} between high fat consumption and rise in obesity, atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases and high blood pressure. Therefore is recommended the moderate consumption of fat, such that the total fat does not exceed 30 % of total energy intake. Our body needs fats because are providers of calories, essential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins and also they are necessary ingredients of the foods. The development of products with low-fat content can be considerate a challenge because the lipids offers aroma, texture, appearance, flavour and mouth feel, qualities that customers want in food products. A fat reduction {{can be achieved by}} using different fat replacers to ensure the functionality of the replaced fat. Functional components of fat replacers can have a significant role in promotion of wellbeing, in treating and preventing diseases. Thus, fat replacers should be recognized as safe and healthy, which have sensorial and functional properties. This paper reviews the fat replacers used to obtain foods as meat-based or dairy products. Some ways to obtain healthier meat products by reducing saturated fats content consist in the utilization of unsaturated vegetable oils, vegetable products, fibre. The utilization of fibre in products such <b>bolognas,</b> <b>sausages</b> or hamburgers, can improve the texture profile, binding properties and the characteristics regarding the cooking process. A fat reduction in dairy products can be achieved by replacing it with starches, polysaccharides, gums or fibres from cereal, vegetables and fruits. In acidified milk products, fibres have benefits as: low syneresis, sensory characteristics accepted by consumers, improvement of texture and rheological properties. In cheeses production, the fat reduction can be realised by replacing it with carbohydrate or protein-based replacers in order to obtain a final product with proper characteristics...|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} now {{showed me}} {{that one of the}} ends of the box could be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense <b>Bologna</b> <b>sausages,</b> an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on the seventeenth of June.|$|R
