500|$|Grim Fandango Remastered has {{received}} similar positive reception {{as the original}} release, with many critics continuing to praise the game's story, characters, and soundtrack. They also found the developer's commentary to be very insightful {{to the history of}} the game. Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds. Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when Grim Fandango was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the Monkey Island remake, would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful.</b> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp considering the direction taken in modern games, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms. In his review for Eurogamer, Richard Cobbett warned players to [...] "be careful of rose-tinted memories", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in more modern video game development. Wired Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was [...] "an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing".|$|E

Thus practicing and running the wheel offense <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> for developing a team spirit among the players.|$|R

2500|$|The debate {{likewise}} covered {{an upcoming}} {{vote on the}} use of coercive interrogation methods on enemy combatants. Allen stated that he had not yet made a decision on how to vote, but stated [...] "Now, the key {{in all of this is}} I don’t want to stop these interrogations. I’m not for torture, I’m not for waterboarding, but some of these techniques have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> to us, whether they are sleep deprivation, or whether there’s loud music. And I need to be absolutely certain that what the interrogations — interrogators are doing now — which is completely fine as far as I’m concerned, protecting Americans — will not be harmed by the proposal." [...] Webb expressed that this was an issue close to him as a former soldier, but also stated that he did not believe interrogations should be ended completely. Webb however reaffirmed his concerns that if the U.S. abandons the Geneva Convention its soldiers will suffer abroad.|$|E
2500|$|For decades β-blockers {{have been}} used in {{cardiovascular}} medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its oxygen requirement. β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as anti-arrhythmic drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient has already had a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their anti-arrhythmic effects and also anti-ischemic effects. [...] A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> for high-risk patients. [...] All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore are they the first choice of drugs for hypertension. But if they are used along with calcium channel blockers, β-blockers have more functionality. They also have an effect on cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and portal hypertension, to name a few.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{time when}} {{producers}} were structuring Shortland Street as a soap with a culturally diverse cast, the character of Grace Kwan was created - a hard working Asian doctor. In 1994, Lynette Forday joined the cast as the part of Grace. After 3 years on the soap, Forday left the soap with Grace making her final appearance in 1997. In 2013 Forday was offered to reprise the role after 16 years off screen, to which she was happy to agree. She signed an initial [...] "Major Recurring Guest" [...] contract, which would see the character appear through to 2014. Forday described returning to the set as [...] "odd" [...] but also [...] "wonderful". Forday had considered the idea of returning to play Grace as a [...] "no-brainer" [...] and was happy to work alongside her former co worker, Michael Galvin (Dr. Chris Warner), [...] "It was very surreal ... We have {{been doing a lot}} of work together and he's just lovely. He's <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> and is amazing." [...] In October Television New Zealand announced Grace would be returning to the show during the month. Grace made her return on screen on 23 October 2013. Grace departed on 24 February 2014 but returns a couple of months later in May 2014 she made her last appearance 11 December 2014.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Savanna-based theory, hominines {{descended from}} the trees and adapted to life on the savanna by walking erect on two feet. The theory {{suggests}} that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees. This theory {{is closely related to}} the knuckle-walking hypothesis, which states that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna, as [...] evidenced by morphological characteristics found in Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis forelimbs, and that it is less parsimonious to assume that knuckle walking developed twice in genera Pan and Gorilla instead of evolving it once as synapomorphy for Pan and Gorilla before losing it in Australopithecus. The evolution of an orthograde posture would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> on a savanna as it would allow the ability to look over tall grasses in order to watch out for predators, or terrestrially hunt and sneak up on prey. It was also suggested in P.E. Wheeler's [...] "The evolution of bipedality and loss of functional body hair in hominids", that a possible advantage of bipedalism in the savanna was reducing the amount of surface area of the body exposed to the sun, helping regulate body temperature. In fact, Elizabeth Vrba’s turnover pulse hypothesis supports the savanna-based theory by explaining the shrinking of forested areas due to global warming and cooling, which forced animals out into the open grasslands and caused the need for hominids to acquire bipedality.|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ...

60|$|All {{this has}} <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> {{and at times}} a little {{embarrassing}} to me. It has given me an opportunity of seeing the ideals I flung into the distance beyond Sirius and among the mountain snows coming home partially incarnate in girls and young men. It has made me look into individualized human aspirations, human impatience, human vanity and a certain human need of fellowship, at close quarters. It has illuminated subtle and fine traits; it has displayed nobilities, and it has brought out aspects of human absurdity to which only the pencil of Mr. George Morrow could do adequate justice. The thing I have had to explain most generally is that my New Republicans and Samurai are but figures of suggestion, figures to think over and use in planning disciplines, {{but by no means}} copies to follow.

I could not live for long in any portion of Caspak with which I was familiar; the moment my ammunition was exhausted, I should be as good as dead.|$|E
