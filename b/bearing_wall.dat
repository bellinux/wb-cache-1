2500|$|Because Sullivan's {{remarkable}} {{accomplishments in}} design and construction occurred at such a critical time in architectural history, he often {{has been described as}} the [...] "father" [...] of the American skyscraper. In truth, however, many architects had been building skyscrapers before or contemporarily with Sullivan. Chicago was replete with extraordinary designers and builders in the late years of the nineteenth century, including Sullivan's partner, Dankmar Adler, as well as Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root. Root was one of the builders of the Monadnock Building (see above). That and another Root design, the Masonic Temple Tower (both in Chicago), are cited by many as the originators of skyscraper aesthetics of <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> and column-frame construction respectively.|$|E

50|$|The Wellman Building, {{also known}} as the Wellman Block, is a {{historic}} commercial building located at Jamestown in Chautauqua County, New York. It consists of an 1897 masonry <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> structure and a steel frame structure built in 1910. The 1897 building is a five story, Renaissance Revival brick building. The 1910 addition retains the Renaissance Revival style. The building originally housed a druggist and stationery store on the first floor, with offices on the upper floors.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{all phases}} of Gothic {{architecture}} were concerned to some degree with levels of illumination {{and the appearance of}} structural lightness, Rayonnant takes this to the extreme. More of the wall surface than ever before was pierced by windows (see for example the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris) and buildings were often given lace-like tracery screens on the exterior to hide the bulk of load <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> elements and buttresses (such as at Strasbourg Cathedral or the Church of St Urbain, Troyes).|$|E
50|$|The Robert C. McEwen United States Custom House, {{also known}} as U.S. Customshouse, is a {{historic}} customshouse building located at Ogdensburg in St. Lawrence County, New York.

50|$|Load-bearing {{walls are}} one of the {{earliest}} forms of construction. The development of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central <b>bearing</b> <b>walls.</b> For example, the Notre Dame Cathedral has a load-bearing wall structure with flying buttresses.|$|R
50|$|Distinctive {{interior}} {{features include}} the vestibule, lobby and information desk, center stairway, cashier’s office, and {{public and private}} collectors offices. From the main entry on the front facade, a small vestibule opens into the lobby. In the lobby are bulletin cases of glass and wood marked “Immigration” and “Customs,” and a wood building directory. A recessed area contains a wood-panel information desk with a hinged gate. In {{the wall behind the}} desk, a shallow, elaborately detailed closet was built into one of the original arches in the masonry <b>bearing</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Art Annex is {{a single}} story (with basement), flat-roofed {{building}} of brick <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> construction. Built during a transitional period in UNM's architectural history, it incorporates elements {{from a number of}} different styles including Pueblo Revival, Beaux-Arts, modernist, and Mayan. The building features a symmetrical, classically organized facade with banks of tall hopper windows to supply light to the interior reading areas. The strongly battered exterior walls are stuccoed and decorated with stylized vigas and other simple geometric elements. The original plans also included a curvilinear Mission style parapet which was never built.|$|E
5000|$|The Podium and Cloud {{apartment}} buildings use various materials accordingly to their characteristics. Pre-cast concrete, white metal balconies and the matte appearance ties the Podium to its urban surroundings, streetscape and city environment whilst the reflective, shiny façade and white curtain wall {{system of the}} Cloud emphasises the floating design. The use of mirrors applied to the supporting columns and under croft of the Observatory also highlight {{the effect of a}} cloud-like structure. Originally a pre-cast <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> design was {{to be used in the}} Cloud apartment but the proposal switched over to concrete plates as the load <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> design exceeded the requirements significantly. Circular columns are used to support the Cloud apartment, with a transfer beam used on top in order to canter lever the structure. Pre-fabricated and powder coated balconies were sleeved into the openings, projecting over the street with the Cloud’s balconies protruding at lengths up to 3 metres. [...] The joinery within each unit which includes the bench, kitchen, table, etc. is pre-fabricated and shipped over from China. Upper House features a single central staircase, despite the unconventional lone staircase, the safety met the Metropolitan Fire Brigade requirements. All of the corridors are smoke vented, with smoke pushed out of louvres during a fire, in addition the corridors are also pressurised and sprinklers cover the entire building.|$|E

40|$|Cold–formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} used in low-rise and multi-storey buildings and hence their fire safety has become {{important in the}} design of buildings. A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where a thin insulation was sandwiched between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF walls. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of non-load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>wall</b> under standard conditions. However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of both the conventional load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>wall</b> panels with cavity insulation and the innovative LSF composite wall panel were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and available literature. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available fire test results of load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>wall.</b> This paper presents the details of the developed finite element models of load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>wall</b> panels and the thermal analysis results. It shows that finite element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards. Failure times of load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses. Finite element analysis results show that the use of cavity insulation was detrimental to the fire rating of LSF walls while the use of external insulation offered superior thermal protection to them. Effects of realistic design fire conditions are also presented in this paper...|$|R
