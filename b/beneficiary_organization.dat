The study was developed to identify the main issues encountered by the Tsunami affected SMEs in Southern Sri Lanka {{in the process of}} their post-tsunami recovery. The study: a) identifies tsunami damage and loss in micro and SMEs in the Galle district; b) ascertains the type of benefits received from various parties by the affected micro and SMEs; c) evaluates the problems and difficulties faced by the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>organizations</b> in the benefit distribution process; and d) recommends strategies and policies for the tsunami-affected micro and SMEs for them to become self-sustaining within a reasonable time frame. Fifty randomly selected tsunami-affected micro and SMEs were surveyed for this study.

The analysis identifies that the benefits were given the wrong priorities and that they were not sufficient for the recovery process. In addition, the many governance-related problems that arose while distributing benefits are discussed. Overall, the business recovery rate was approximately 65 %, and approximately 88 % of business organizations were sole proprietorships. Therefore, the policies of the tsunami relief agencies should adequately address the needs of sole proprietorship business requirements.

The most common cancers reported in the recent years have been included skin, stomach, breast, colon, bladder, leukemia, and esophagus respectively.

Materials and Methods : This health system research project was performed by participation of Social Determinants of Health Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Office of the Non-Communicable Diseases of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and other stakeholders in 2013. At first, the strategic committee was established and the stakeholders were identified and analyzed.

At the last with the qualitative approach, a systematic review of the studies, documents and reports was conducted as well as conversing for the national strategic plans of Iran and other countries and the experts’ views regarding management of the cancer risk factors. In practice, role and responsibilities of each stakeholder were practically analyzed.

Furthermore, few respondents anticipate changing giving behavior due to government subsidies.

We contribute to the literature in developing a comprehensive rational-choice-based governance approach to analyze all stakeholder relationships of NGOs. Applying the research program of ordonomics, we unpack two fundamental interaction problems: (a) the “stakeholder dilemma” between the NGO and a single accountability holder as a one-sided social dilemma and (b) the “competition dilemma” among rival NGOs as a many-sided social dilemma.

40|$|This {{research}} discusses transformational philanthropy {{and networks}} of cocreated value in Canada, {{focusing on the}} top segment Canadian philanthropists who make single donations of $ 5 Million CAD or more. This segment of donors, who with a single gift at that level can and do “transform” organizations by creating extraordinary value with a single donation. The context for this research is the sphere of post-secondary education, specifically universities and their affiliated medical institutions. Ultimately, this research attempts {{to answer the following}} questions: Why do donors make transformational donations? What are the characteristics of a “transformational donation” and, by extension, the “transformational donor”? How does the marketing literature, and more specifically, the cocreation construct, illuminate the donating behaviour of these philanthropists? And finally, what kind of experiences between the donor and the organization result in the donor making transformational donations? This body of qualitative research concludes that the act of transformational giving is not simply a dyadic relationship between the donor and the receiving organization, nor does the gift itself benefit only the “intended” or ultimate recipients. In Project one I develop the theoretical “philanthropic exchange system,” based on the literature. Building upon this theoretical development in Project one, in Project two, I propose an evolution of the “philanthropic exchange system,” further defining it as a philanthropic social system of reciprocal exchange and cocreated value, or, a “philanthropic ecosystem” as a metaphor to understand the complex web that underpins transformational giving. Project three elaborates this metaphor, based on more informant data, and suggests a self-sustaining constellation of networks comprising symbiotic interrelationships among the stakeholders – the donor, <b>beneficiary</b> <b>organizations,</b> as well as the people and micro-communities they each serve and support. It is suggested that the actions and interactions of the philanthropists have a “compounding” or leveraged effect on the philanthropic ecosystem, resulting in value creation that transcends the original donor-beneficiary dyad and extends its impact well beyond the boundaries of the initial relationship. Based on empirical evidence, this research proposes that transformational philanthropy is embedded in a philanthropic ecosystem – one that is defined more simply upon conclusion of this research project, as a network of cocreated value...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze sustainability of home gardens in the community Tziscao in the municipality La Trinitaria, Chiapas, Mexico using a sample of 30 families. Researchers analyzed environmental, technological, economic and social aspects of the gardens, taking into account attributes of stability, efficiency, adaptability, productivity, profitability, self-administration and equity through the use of 20 indicators.

Six of the fundraising letters include photographs of the signatory of the letter – usually the president of the NGO, as illustrated in Figure  3. Typically, these are coloured passport-sized photographs of close-ups of the ascribed author of the letter that are positioned next to their signature. As close-up pictures, these photographs contribute to creating a sense of intimacy between writer and reader. Significantly, the author of the letter usually looks straight out at the reader, indicating that the latter is been positioned to engage with, rather than observe, the former (Painter et al. 2013 : 19). Moreover, unlike the <b>beneficiaries</b> of the <b>organizations,</b> three {{of the authors of the}} letters are represented smiling, a way to seek to further establish emotive involvement and social affinity with the potential donor.
