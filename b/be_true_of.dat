5|$|This {{record of}} disputed {{succession}} {{was by no}} means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of Centwine in 685 to Egbert's seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings are far from clear and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same may <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Mercia from the death of Ceolred in 716 until the disappearance of the Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Sirius A is classed as an Am star {{because the}} {{spectrum}} shows deep metallic absorption lines, indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron. The spectral type {{has been reported}} as A0mA1 Va, which indicates {{that it would be}} classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am stars. When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by , which is equivalent to 100.5, meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface.|$|E

25|$|According to {{an ancient}} {{metrical}} theory, the Greek version of this metre (trochaic tetrameter catalectic) was composed of an iambic trimeter with a cretic foot (– u –) added at the beginning.

25|$|Otherwise, {{suppose we}} have m vectors of n coordinates, with m<n. Then A is an n×m matrix and Λ is a column vector with m entries, {{and we are}} again {{interested}} in AΛ= 0.

Consider the first m rows of A, the first m equations; any solution of the full list of equations must also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the reduced list. In fact, if 〈i1,...,i'm〉 is any list of m rows, then the equation must be true for those rows.|$|E

25|$|The {{supremum}} axiom of the reals {{refers to}} subsets of the reals {{and is therefore}} a second-order logical statement. It {{is not possible to}} characterize the reals with first-order logic alone: the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of hyperreal numbers satisfies the same first order sentences as R. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as R are called nonstandard models of R. This is what makes nonstandard analysis work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in R), we know that the same statement must also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> R.|$|E
25|$|The {{space of}} {{distributions}} on U is denoted by D′(U) {{and it is}} the continuous dual space of D(U). No matter what dual topology is placed on D′(U), a sequence of distributions converges in this topology if and only if it converges pointwise (although this need not <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> a net), which is why the topology is sometimes defined to be the weak-* topology. But often the topology of bounded convergence, which in this case {{is the same as the}} topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, is placed on D′(U) since it is with this topology that D′(U) becomes a nuclear Montel space and it is with this topology that the kernels theorem of Schwartz holds. No matter which topology is chosen, D(U) will be a non-metrizable, locally convex topological vector space.|$|E
25|$|In Oliver Twist Dickens {{provides}} {{readers with}} an idealised {{portrait of a}} boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in Bleak House and Amy Dorrit in Little Dorrit), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence. For example, Oliver Twist {{turns out to be}} the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones, which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.|$|E

25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E

Universal president Ron Meyer stated that nothing irreplaceable was lost, meaning everything could be rebuilt again at a price of at least $50 million. Unfortunately while this may <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the archive of video material, the fire also destroyed a huge and irreplaceable archive of analogue audio master tapes belonging to Universal Music, including all of Decca's masters from the 1930s to the 1950s and most of the original Chess masters which included artists such as Otis Redding, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. Days after the fire, it was reported that the King Kong attraction would not be rebuilt and would eventually be replaced by a new attraction that had yet to be announced. In August 2008, Universal changed its position and announced plans to rebuild the , basing the new attraction on the 2005 film adaptation.|$|E

25|$|In {{evolutionary}} psychology, {{learning is}} said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations. Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment. Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development. For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation. Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods. The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions. For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships. Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water. Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes. In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development. The same might <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> humans.|$|E

500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!" ...|$|E
