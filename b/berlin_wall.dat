5|$|The <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall,</b> as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall,</b> which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> in 1961. After the border was fortified and the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{general purpose}} of this study is to look at what four {{different}} Swedish newspapers reported about the <b>Berlin</b> <b>walls</b> fall. The newspapers chosen for the study are Ny Dag, Arbetet, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter. The method used is a qualitative method while analyzing newspaper materials. This is accomplished by using four different questions. What was the reaction? What was the predicted future? How the magazines opinion is shown through their general ideological believes? Was the <b>Berlin</b> <b>walls</b> fall viewed as a threat? The general reaction was a euphoric feeling and a new time for Europe. The future talks centered on the uniting of the two Germanys and why this should or shouldn’t happen. The political messages were different in every newspaper. Svenska Dagbladet went hard against communism while Ny Dag defended it. Arbetets reporting was milder and Dagens Nyheter tried to play both sides. The newspapers did report about a threat perspective and it was about the relationship between superpowers and the impending question about immigrants from DDR. The threat perspective was lowering while a peace perspective was rising...|$|R

5000|$|In many respects, {{the shows}} resembled American shows of the day: they had parades and a spec, their clowns wore red noses and silly hats, their shows {{were full of}} big cats and Liberty Horses. This {{commonality}} fostered a sense of international community. One man credited the “peace caravan of circuses,” which traveled {{through the streets of}} many cities, including Paris, Warsaw, Prague, and Berlin, with “contributing to the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall’s</b> removal.” He continued, “For a brief period in 1989, the clowns became the leaders, crossing cultural and national borders, celebrating the end of the Cold War before it was declared over by official parties.” ...|$|R

The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E

The Hamburg line was soon extended to Dresden and Prague, and the former Interzonenzug trains from Munich were converted to InterCity trains and now ran on the Stadtbahn as well.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E

50|$|When {{the general}} Phoumi Nosavan died in Bangkok in 1985, since the {{time-limit}} for conservation by the Department of Fine Arts was thirty years, questions arose regarding {{the statue of}} Kou Voravong. In 1989, {{the collapse of the}} communist Eastern Bloc - symbolized by the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall's</b> fall - allowed gradually Laos to enter the market economy, which then provided the opportunity for the Voravong children to approach the LPDR authorities for the return to the country of their father's statue. In 1992, the cost of conserving paid, the statue was legally returned to the family. The eldest daughter of Thao Bouaphet, who lived in Bangkok, entrusted it to the monastery of Amphawan (thai language: วัดอัมพวัน), around the Thai capital.|$|R
