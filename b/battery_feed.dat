40|$|Received (to be {{inserted}} by publisher) DC-DC power converters with multiple inputs {{and a single}} output are used in numerous ap-plications where multiple sources, e. g., two or more renewable energy sources and/or a <b>battery,</b> <b>feed</b> a single load. In this work a classical boost converter topology with two input branches connected to two different sources is chosen, with each branch independently being controlled by a separate peak current mode controller. We demonstrate {{for the first time}} that even though this converter is similar to other well known topologies that have been studied before, it exhibits many complex nonlinear behaviours that are not found in any other standard PWM controlled power converter. The system undergoes period incrementing cascade as a parameter is varied, with discontinuous hard transitions between consecutive periodicities. We show that the system can be described by a discontinuous map, which explains the observed bifurcation phenomena. The results have been experimentally validated...|$|E

In wireless sensor networks is the opposite, the coder is implemented in a <b>battery</b> <b>feed</b> device, having so very limited power resource, while the decoder is typically implemented in a powerful computer.

The proposed method, unlike other existing methods, takes into account the structure of multi-modal data, except the correlation in 1 D and 2 D it takes in consideration correlation between color channels.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the olfactory impact of the essential oils of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and rosemary (Rosmarlnus officinalis) on cognitive performance and mood in healthy volunteers. One hundred and forty-four participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three independent groups, and subsequently performed the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized cognitive assessment battery in a cubicle containing either one of the two odors or no odor (control). Visual analogue mood questionnaires were completed prior to exposure to the odor, and subsequently after completion of the test battery. The participants were deceived as to the genuine aim of the study until the completion of testing to prevent expectancy effects from possibly influencing the data. The outcome variables from the nine tasks that constitute the CDR core <b>battery</b> <b>feed</b> into six factors that represent different aspects of cognitive functioning. Analysis of performance revealed that lavender produced a significant decrement in performance of working memory, and impaired reaction times for both memory and attention based tasks compared to controls. In contrast, rosemary produced a significant enhancement of performance for overall quality of memory and secondary memory factors, but also produced an impairment of speed of memory compared to controls. With regard to mood, comparisons of the change in ratings from baseline to post-test revealed that following the completion of the cognitive assessment battery, both the control and lavender groups were significantly less alert than the rosemary condition; however, the control group was significantly less content than both rosemary and lavender conditions. These findings indicate that the olfactory properties of these essential oils can produce objective effects on cognitive performance, as well as subjective effects on mood...|$|E

Bacteria, plants and yeast can synthesize Thr and Met from HS, but this has not been shown in higher organisms. Several bioassays were carried out to determine the capacity of GAA to spare dietary Arg or HS to spare dietary Thr. Crossbred chicks were fed Arg-deficient dextrose-casein (0. 86 % Arg), Arg-deficient corn-corn coproduct-soybean meal (1. 0 % Arg), Thr-deficient dextrose-casein (0. 22 % Thr), or Thr-deficient corn-peanut meal (0. 46 %) basal diets during 9 -d <b>battery</b> <b>feeding</b> trials involving 5 pens of 4 chicks per treatment.

Recent research on rodents points to persistent behavioural effects of pre- and perinatal exposure to SSRI which last into adulthood. To study effects of developmental exposure in fish, three-spine sticklebacks were exposed to 1. 5 µg/l of the SSRI citalopram in the ambient water for 30 days, starting two days post-fertilisation. After 100 days of remediation in clean water the fish were put through an extensive test <b>battery.</b> <b>Feeding</b> behaviour was tested as the number of bites against a piece of food and found to be increased in the exposed fish. Aggression levels were measured as the number of bites against a mirror image during 10 minutes and was also found to be significantly increased in the exposed fish. Novel tank behaviour and locomotor activity was tested in an aquarium that had a horizontal line drawn half-way between the bottom and the surface. Neither the latency to the first transition to the upper half, nor the number of transitions or the total time spent in the upper half was affected by treatment. Locomotor activity was significantly reduced in the exposed fish. The light/dark preference was tested in an aquarium where the bottom and walls were black on one side and white on the other. The number of transitions to the white side was significantly reduced in the exposed fish but there was no effect on the latency to the first transition or the total time spent in the white half.

The experimental design was a 2 X 2 factorial with treatments of 0 and 2. 5 jug of aflatoxin/g of feed (ppm) and 0 and 16 Mg of DON/g of feed. The broilers were maintained on these dietary treatments from hatching to 3 weeks {{of age in}} electrically heated <b>batteries</b> with <b>feed</b> and water available ad libitum.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new maximum-power-point-tracking (MPPT) {{controller}} for a photovoltaic (PV) {{energy conversion system}} is proposed. Nowadays, PV generation {{is more and more}} used as a renewable energy source. However, its main drawback is that PV generation is intermittent because it depends on shading conditions consequently irradiance value. Thus, the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking Technique) together with the battery energy storage is necessary in order to obtain a stable and reliable maximum output power from a PV generation system. In our research work, the reference voltage for the MPPT is obtained by an artificial neural network (ANN) using the steepest negative gradient algorithm. The tracking algorithm adjusts the duty-cycle value of the dc/dc buck converter so that the PV-module voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MPPT for any given realistic operation irradiance and temperature. The controller, which uses the classical perturb and observe (P&O) technique processes then the information gathered to a ANN controller bloc, which in turn generates the optimal value of the buck converter duty-cycle. The energy obtained from the converter is stored in a lithium-ion <b>battery</b> which <b>feeds</b> a useful load.

40|$|This text {{presents}} a {{design of a}} device {{to be used for}} scanning gas pipeline external surface damaged by water corrosion. The corrosion defects appears when a protection on pipeline is damaged. Water than can infiltrate on a metal surface and cause corrosion. An area of these defects is from square centimetres to square decimetres. These defects have shape as different deep pits. The pits depth can achieve fifty percent of pipeline wall thickness. The defects are searched by ultrasonic sensing head on mobile devices, which goes through pipeline. It can only find the defects, but it cannot define accurate extent and shape of the defects. Then the pipeline must be uncovered on places with defects and cleaned. Our device provides a 3 D-map of the scanned surface {{in the form of the}} defect surface deviation from an ideal cylindrical shape. These 3 D-map data obtained serve as input data for the remaining carrying capacity assessment of the pipeline by means of the finite element method (FEM). The device applies a polar co-ordinate system that seems to be the most suitable one for this task. A relatively small mass of the device, together with its <b>battery</b> <b>feeding,</b> enables an easy manipulation in field conditions. The device is able to operate when being attached in any position on the pipe surface. The area scanned by the apparatus can in maximum reach 550 x 300 mm in the longitudinal and circumferential pipe directions, respectively. If a larger area of a pipe defect is to be scanned it is possible to connect more sections alongside. In order to achieve a sufficient measuring speed, e. g., 70 points per minute, the device operation is based on contact-less optical measuring methods. When using a short measuring step of 1 mm, as many as 165 000 scanned points are attained in 40 minutes. The device can scan tubes with diameter from 500 mm to 1400 mm. The measuring method is optical triangulation. A narrow light beam from semiconductor laser with collimating lens is projected perpendicularly to the surface. A small light spot is made on measuring tube. A disperse light from this spot is projected by lens to the light detector. it is possible to transfer a position of the spot image on the detector to the surface distance from the sensing head. As light detector we used position sensitive diode (PSD). The optical sensing head is moved above pipeline surface in two directions. One direction is longitudinal in line and second direction is along arc to keep the sensing head in suitable distance from cylindrical surface. A computer provides control and setting of the device. Software collects data from the device and converts it to the applicable form for the following analysis. Because the device measure surface deviation from a base cylindrical surface, that is fixed, all deviation must be convert to the shape deviation in relation of actual tube diameter.

The broilers were weighed, bled, killed by cervical dislocation, and necropzied at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 21 days of age. Body weights were significantly decreased by 5. 0 ppm aflatoxin at 6 days {{of age and}} by 2. 5 ppm at 17 days of age. Aflatoxin induced a sig-nificant increase in the relative weight of the proventriculus, gizzard, spleen, and kidney.

Serum levels of albumin and total protein were significantly reduced at 5. 0 and 2. 5 ppm aflatoxin by 3 and 6 days of age, respectively. Serum levels of uric acid, triglycerides, and cholesterol were significantly decreased from control values from 12 through 21 days of age by 5. 0 ppm aflatoxin and, to a lesser extent, by 2. 5 ppm aflatoxin. The activity of serum lactic dehydrogenase was significantly decreased at all aflatoxin treatment levels from 12 through 21 days of age. These data provide a description of the {{progression of}} aflatoxicosis in poultry which should provide a better understanding of aflatoxicosis in broiler chickens...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2013. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 68 - 69). The project is about the designing {{and implementation of the}} electrical drive system of a solar powered car. The solar panel collects energy from the sun during the day time and stores this in a lead-acid battery through a charge controller that to drive the motor of the car. The charge controller circuit has been used to supply the battery with the maximum amount charge possible, while protecting it from overcharge by the solar panels or the electric source as well as over discharge by the motor. Functionality of both the driver circuit and the charge controller circuit are controlled by the PIC 16 F 876 A microcontroller. For the charge controller circuit, the PIC detects the current and voltage of the battery and thereby, according to the state of the <b>battery,</b> it <b>feeds</b> back a Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) flow of charge from the panel to the battery. As the whole thesis project is based on Direct Current Power System, Direct Current (DC) motors are worthier in this case. DC motor has become familiar as an essential drive configuration or pattern for many applications widely in terms of power and speed. The number of applications implemented by DC motor will continue grow for the predictable future because of the quality of easy controlling and the outstanding performance of the DC motors. The main motive of this thesis project is to design a speed controller system or driver circuit for DC motor in both the theoretical and practical way. Karima KhatunRadita ChowdhuryMd.

40|$|This project {{belongs to}} energy {{harvesting}} field, {{which is a}} method of collecting energy from the environment to power small devices. This type of energy use is growing exponentially due to the appearance {{of many of these}} devices (sensors, wearables [...] .). The objective of this project is to design and implement an ultra-low-power boost converter, designed for energy harvesting applications, which is able to add different types of energy coming from the environment to charge a <b>battery</b> or to <b>feed</b> another electronic device. It is a very innovative project and therefore, the methodology used has contemplated a lot of time for studying, doing simulations, optimizing and testing a prototype. This has allowed us to carry out a study of great value and usefulness which establishes the basis to construct a device that adds energies of our surroundings. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the application, a two-input boost converter is built to add energy coming from two different sources (with the possibility of expanding this number) and also offers different types of output storage elements. In conclusion, the work has confirmed the possibility of adding energy from our environment and has shown the great potential of the application studied through a functional prototype...|$|R
30|$|When using QR Codes™ as triggers, {{which can}} be {{downloaded}} and printed out, no additional hardware, i.e., sets of RFID or NFC tags, has to be distributed. Thus, the system can remotely be made available for download. Some minor technical details are subject to our further investigation and development, such as {{the design of the}} application surface. Furthermore, strategies for accurate review and quality control of the teaching material have to be implemented. Programming and indexing tags with their corresponding video clips may be time consuming, as it is for any ultrasound video loop editing for educational purposes. As some mobile devices failed to <b>feed</b> <b>battery</b> power to the RFID antennas, the capability of using different triggering solutions provides a useful backup plan. Finally, the sole triggering of a video clip to be displayed does not encompass probe manipulation and image optimization skills as commercially available systems do, which is another field of further technical development for the system. Furthermore, the video output format of ultrasound machines and the anonymizing function varies. Several different file types and codecs may hamper their universal utilization for an ultrasound simulation library. This can easily be overcome using free file converters. Altogether, despite some minor technical issues, {{we did not want to}} withhold this important technical advance from publication, since we are convinced, that it will have a considerable impact on worldwide training in POC-US.|$|R
