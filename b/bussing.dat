25|$|In 1924, Ekebergbanen bought four Berliet buses with {{bodies from}} Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk {{and put them}} into service on two lines, from Jernbanetorget to Abildsø and from Sæter to Godheim. The latter route was used to feed the Ekeberg Line. In 1927, the company bought Republic and Studebaker buses, and in 1928 four <b>Büssing</b> buses which {{replaced}} the Berliet vehicles. From 1927 to 1931, the company ran a bus line from Jernbanetorget to Simensbråten, and also for some years from Nordstrandshøgda to Aker University Hospital. From 28 August 1932, the two original bus lines were combined and extended to Sværsvann. It was branded as Østmarkaruten and ran the route Jernbanetorget–Abildsø–Klemetsrud–Godheim–Sværsvann. In 1937, the company bought four diesel buses from <b>Büssing.</b> In 1940, the company had four modern diesel buses and three older gasoline buses. The company had silver buses with a wine red cheatline with the EB logo in silver on a blue background. The company also ran an automotive workshop and fuel station at Holtet.|$|E

500|$|Magic Johnson had an {{extremely}} {{close relationship with}} Lakers owner Jerry <b>Buss,</b> whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure. Calling <b>Buss</b> his [...] "second father" [...] and [...] "one of [...] best friends", Johnson spent five hours visiting <b>Buss</b> at the hospital {{just a few months}} before his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after <b>Buss</b> had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, [...] "Without Dr. Jerry <b>Buss,</b> there is no Magic." [...] <b>Buss</b> acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. <b>Buss</b> took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994. Johnson credits <b>Buss</b> with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|R

25|$|Despite massive {{protests from}} local residents, Trondheim Sporvei's board chose in 1963 {{to follow the}} director's proposal, with three against two votes. A <b>Büssing</b> bus from Oslo Sporveier was put into service for test runs from 22 September 1966. The buses had {{problems}} keeping the schedule, but this was because they were single manned. Four such buses had been ordered by Graakalbanen, the other municipal tram company where Hovdenak also was director. Since they were a limited company, they did not neet political approval to perform such purchases. In exchange for renting the buses, Graakalbanen would rent some trams from Trondheim Sporvei. 1967 ended {{with a loss of}} NOK340,000. Hovdenak believed that the following year would give a loss of NOK1.6 million for tram and 1.2 million for bus operation. Line 3 had the least passenger of the three tram lines, with 2.3million passengers annually. This was in part because it did not get more passengers when running through the city center.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{purchasing}} new rolling stock for the Gråkallen Line, the city trams were to start {{operating on the}} line. Trondheim Sporvei needed buses for {{the closing of the}} Singsaker Line, and made a deal with Graakalbanen, where the latter would purchase four new <b>Büssing</b> buses and rent them out to Trondheim Sporvei for the amortization cost, in exchange for renting excess trams. Each bus cost NOK 237,000. However, {{there was a lack of}} material in Trondheim Sporvei, and not until 7 November 1966 could a TS Class 7 city tram be taken into use. This was supplemented with a trailer on 6 February 1967. Also, there was operated a direct route from Lian to Lade during the morning rush hour. Seven additional buses were ordered in 1968, financed through a NOK 1.750,000 loan. In exchange the company got five additional trams. However, Trondheim Sporvei had problems delivering the trams. With this deal in place, the oldest trams could be retired. However, during from 30 June to 19 August 1968, Trondheim Sporvei needed the trams again, and the old Class 1 was back in service. The final run of the Class 1 in regular service was on 29 November 1968. From 19 May 1969 the trams lost their conductors.|$|E

2500|$|Following trials with {{a number}} of prototypes, a {{subsidiary}} of the <b>Büssing</b> company in 1971 commenced the development of the Ratel infantry fighting vehicle to meet the requirements of the South African Army. After evaluating several alternatives, including the EE-11 Urutu, Thyssen Henschel UR-416, and the Panhard M3, South Africa purchased the rights to Büssing's final prototype, then identified as the [...] "Springfield-Büssing Buffel". <b>Büssing</b> subsequently sold the same design to Belgium. The SIBMAS was still in the pre-production stage just as Ratel entered serial production. However, the obvious similarities between the two vehicles led some analysts to erroneously conclude their production was directly linked, and one was a licensed variant of the other.|$|E
