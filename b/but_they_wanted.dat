5|$|Sigismund {{adopted the}} title of Prince of Transylvania after Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. He was still a minor, and Ghyczy {{continued}} to rule as regent. Sigismund {{was one of the}} candidates to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His advisors knew that he had little chance to win, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to demonstrate that the Báthorys had a valid claim to rule the Commonwealth. Kovacsóczy officially announced Sigismund's application at the Sejm (or general assembly) on 14August 1587. Five days later, the assembly elected Sigismund III Vasa king. During the ensuing war of succession, Transylvanian troops supported SigismundIII against Maximilian of Habsburg, who had also laid claim to Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|During Congressional Reconstruction, U.S. General John Schofield {{administered}} Virginia as Military District One. After 1866, {{according to}} the Radical Reconstruction Acts, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to incorporate the 14th Amendment into its state constitution before it was allowed to participate again. By the time Schofield called a new state constitutional convention for 1868, three distinct parties had coalesced in Virginia. Radical Republicans, including most ex-slave freedmen, organized to advocate full political and social equality for blacks, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to exclude ex-Confederates from political participation either in government or at the ballot box. Moderate Unionists including many pre-war Whigs, sought political equality for blacks, but believed that ex-Confederates had {{to be included in}} the political community because of their majority in the white population. Conservatives wanted to ensure white control of the state without Radical influence on issues such as public education.|$|E
5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting rotation, and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could not get out of the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch for a month, and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with, and decided that he would retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason behind}} Rome's {{adoption}} of coinage was likely cultural. The Romans had no pressing economic need, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to emulate Greek culture; and {{they considered the}} institution of minted money a significant feature of that culture. However, Roman coinage initially saw very limited use.|$|E
25|$|The rulers wanted {{not only}} to record the {{autonomy}} of the New State, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to symbolize its wealth and virtue with the golden hill, its triumphs and victories with the palm, its abundance with the plantain tree, its freedom with the phrygian cap, and the whole Antioquian race with the matron.|$|E
25|$|After the Freedom Rides, {{students}} and activists of the Freedom Movement launched {{a series of}} merchant boycotts, sit-ins and protest marches, from 1961 to 1963. Businesses discriminated against black customers. For instance, at the time, department stores did not hire black salesclerks or allow black customers to use their fitting rooms to try on clothes, or lunch counters for meals while in the store, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> them to shop in their stores.|$|E

25|$|The book, purportedly {{based on}} a true story, {{describes}} the house at 112 Ocean Avenue as remaining empty for 13 months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The five-bedroom house was built in Dutch Colonial style and had a distinctive gambrel roof. It also had a swimming pool and a boathouse, as it was located on a canal. George and Kathy married in July 1975 and each had their own homes, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to start fresh with a new property. Kathy had three children from a previous marriage: Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa (Missy), 5. They also owned a crossbreed Malamute/Labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect their decision. After discussing the matter, they decided {{that it was not a}} problem.|$|E
25|$|During the 275 {{years that}} the house stood in its {{original}} location, it underwent many changes to accommodate the needs and tastes of new generations. The Brooklyn Museum’s curators might have chosen to exhibit and interpret the house to any point in its long history, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to add an early Dutch colonial house to the series of existing period rooms. This necessitated stripping away later additions and changes, such as the kitchen wing and porch, to rediscover the original two-room structure. The present reconstruction is based on careful analysis of surviving original elements and other surviving Dutch colonial houses. About 1730, when Martin Schenck, Jan’s eldest son, owned the house, it underwent several changes to accommodate his growing family. For a long period after about 1730, the two-room core of the house changed very little, and therefore the curators chose this moment in the early eighteenth century to which to interpret the house.|$|E

500|$|Season two delved {{deeper into}} Lex's darker moments, {{from the time}} he wavers to save his father's life, to his {{outburst}} at Jonathan for what he feels is unfair treatment. These moments play into Lex's psyche. Season three's [...] "Memoria" [...] finally explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Lex's infant brother, Julian. Gough explains that they had known the story of Julian Luthor back in season one, when the character was first mentioned in [...] "Stray", <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to find the right time to explain the situation. The creative team wanted the audience to think that Lex was responsible for Julian's death as an infant, before finally revealing that Lex was merely covering for his mother.|$|E
500|$|In hindsight, {{the team}} {{considered}} {{the story of}} Far Cry 3 [...] "great", even though they {{thought that it was}} separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending. The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign. Thompson added that they twisted the story of Far Cry 3 for Far Cry 4, and made outsiders the villains instead of the heroes. The team considered it a [...] "risk", <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to try something different.|$|E
