The study of noisy non-equilibrium processes is fundamental for modelling the dynamics of environmental interface regarded as biophysical complex system and for understanding the mechanisms of spatio-temporal pattern formation in contemporary environmental sciences. In this paper we will investigate an aspect of dynamics of energy flow based on the energy balance equation.

The sand termite was found in 80-100% of the circles, and in 100% of newly formed circles and was the only insect to live across the range of the phenomenon. [...] Sand termites create the fairy circle by consuming vegetation, and burrowing in the soil to create the ring. The <b>barren</b> circle allows <b>water</b> to percolate down through sandy soil and accumulate underground, allowing the soil to remain moist even under the driest conditions. Grass growth around the circle is promoted by the accumulated soil water, and in turn the termites feed on the grasses, slowly increasing the diameter of the circle.

Understanding the distribution of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its spatial variation will be helpful to decipher its mechanism and find out possible solution. This study tries to investigate and identify land use types which have the most influence to the increase of ambienttemperature in Vijayawada city. For the present study Landsat ETM+ images of 2001 was obtained from USGS for the study area. Using bands 1 - 5 and 7 of the pre-processed images the land use / cover pattern was mapped by supervised classification with the maximum likelihood classification algorithm of ERDAS imagine 9. 1 software. Five classes considered for the study are Built-up land, <b>Barren</b> Land, <b>Water</b> bodies, Agricultural fields and Vegetation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image was developed. The digital number ofthermal infrared band is converted in to spectral radiance using the equation supplied by the Landsat user’s hand book. The effective at-sensor brightness temperature is obtained from the spectral radiance using Plank’s inverse function. The surface emissivity based on NDVI classes is used to retrieve the final LST.

We used GPS-Satellite and VHF radio-collars on 6 (3 males and 3 female) tigers to study their ranging patterns and habitat preference. The average home range (95 % Fixed Kernel) for resident females was 56. 4 (SE 5. 69) and for males it was 110 (SE 49) km². Tigers crossed an average of 5 water channels > 30 meters per day with a mean width of 54 meters, whereas channels larger than 400 meters were rarely crossed. Tigers spent over 58 % of their time within Phoenix habitat but compositional analysis showed a habitat preference of the order Avicennia-Sonneratia > Phoenix > Ceriops > <b>Barren</b> > <b>Water.</b> Average daily distance moved was 4. 6 km (range 0. 1 - 23). Activity of tigers peaked between 05 : 00 hours and 10 : 00 hours showing some overlap with human activity. Territory boundaries were demarcated by large channels which tigers intensively patrolled. Extra caution should be taken while fishing or honey collection during early morning in Avicennia-Sonneratia and Phoenix habitat types along wide channels to reduce human-tiger conflict. Considering home-range core areas as exclusive, tiger density was estimated at 4. 6 (SE range 3. 6 to 6. 7) tigers/ 100 km 2 giving a total population of 76 (SE range 59 - 110) tigers in the Indian Sundarban.

This area is {{characterized}} by braided channels with numerous riverine islands bordered by cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) and willows (Salix spp.) along the high banks. Habitat between the high banks consists of open <b>water,</b> <b>barren</b> sandbars and mudflats, herbaceous islands, shrub islands, and floodplain forest. Prolonged summer flows during 1983 were among the highest recorded this century; in excess of 20, 000 cfs (cubic feet per second). Spring 1984 also consisted of high flows resulting in much scouring and shifting of alluvial sediments. By early July 1984, flows had dropped from about 3, 000 cfs to less than 400 cfs {{by the end of}} the month. These low flows continued until 6 September; then they increased to over 3, 000 cfs. During the drawdown phase of these flows, large mudflats were exposed in low-lying and backwater areas. These nutrient-rich sediments hosted multitudes of aquatic insect larvae, especially larvae of Chironomidae (midges). The abundance of both suitable habitat and an available food source coincided with the “fall” or southward migration of several species of shorebirds. These conditions resulted in an exceptional shorebird flight along the Platte River. The following species account summarizes our observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} facing climate {{challenges}} {{in the form of}} flash floods or harsh droughts, intense thunder storms or occasional rains, swamped plains or <b>barren</b> land, <b>water</b> assimilation or water scarcity. The aim of this research is to study the impact of climate changing events on Pakistan in general and its agriculture sector in particular. It will help in better copping against the future climate changing incidents. The intense rains of 2010, which resulted in a sever flood, is one of the climate change event in Pakistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was among the provinces affected by the flood event of 2010. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by ecological landscape can be divided into three zones or regions i. e. the Northern, the Central and the Southern regions. This study is an attempt to measure the climate variations in the three climate zones of the province, over the thirty year period (1980 - 2010). The environmental trend analysis results of the study shows that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a whole has experienced the climate change impacts in terms of rise in mean temperature from 0. 3 °C to 1. 2 °C and average rainfall from 11 mm to 15 mm over the thirty years span. The climate intense event of 2010 impact was observed in terms of decreased agricultural production of Kharif and rabi crop. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa agricultural statistics showed a decline of Kharif (maize) crop from 1880 kg/hector in 2008 - 09 to 1783 kg/hector in 200910 and Rabi (wheat) production of 1565 Kg/hector in 2008 - 09 was reduced to 1520 Kg/hector in 2009 - 10. The climate changing impacts on agricultural sector is accessed by analyzing the two seasoned crops i. e. Rabi and Kharif of the province. The economic regression analysis is performed in this respect. The findings of the study shows that climate factors does effects crop production. Climate impacts on rabi crop of the province are more distinct than the kharif crop. The regional regression results depicts a positive impact of climate change on {{the northern part of the}} province whereas a negative impact on crop production is seen due to the elevated temperatures and untimely rainfalls...|$|R
50|$|Illyria {{stretched}} from the River Drilon (Drin) in modern northern Albania to Istria (in modern Croatia and Slovenia) and the River Savus (Sava) in the north. It comprised the coastal plain, {{the mountains of}} the Dinaric Alps which stretch along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea for 645 kilometres (401 miles) width a width of about 150 kilometres) and, in the north-west, the Istrian Peninsula. There were numerous islands off the coast, but they lacked drinking water. The mountains were cultivated towards the coast, {{but for the most}} they were <b>barren.</b> Lack of <b>water</b> and poor or arid soil made much of Illyria poor agricultural area and this gave rise to piracy. The interior of the southern part of Illyricum (central and southern Albania) was more fertile. Illyria was inhabited by a dozens of independent tribes and tribal groupings. Most of them were labelled as Illyrians. In the north there were also Celtic tribes. The Pannonian (or Carpathian) plain in the north was more fertile. Its tribes were labelled as Pannonian. Archaeological finds and toponyms show that the Pannonians differed culturally form the Illyrians and the eastern Celts who lived to their west, in what is now Austria. They were later Celticised following a Celtic invasion of {{the northern part of the}} region at the beginning of the 4th century BC. Some tribes in the area (the Eravisci, Scordisci Cotini, Boii, and Anartii) were Celtic. The Pannonians also had cultural similarities with the Illyrians. Iron mining and production was an important part of their economy in the pre-Roman days.|$|R
40|$|Human disturbances, such as overfishing, may disrupt predator-prey {{interactions}} and modify food webs. Underwater surveys {{were carried out}} at six shallow-water reef <b>barrens</b> in temperate <b>waters</b> of northern-central Chile from October to December 2010 to describe the effects of predation, habitat complexity (low, medium and high) and refuge availability on the abundance and population structure of the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus (Rhynchocinetidae), an important mesoconsumer on subtidal hard substrata. Three sites were within managed (restricted access) areas for fishermen, and three were unmanaged (open-access). Field observations and tethering experiments were conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between fish and shrimp abundances, and the relative predation rates on shrimps. Direct effects of predation on R. typus body-size distribution were examined from shrimps collected in the field and fish stomachs. The presence and the abundance of R. typus increased with habitat reef complexity and refuge availability. Shrimp abundance was negatively related to fish abundance in managed areas, but not in open-access areas, where shrimp densities were the highest. Also, predation rates and body-size distribution of shrimps were unrelated, although fish consumed more large shrimps than should be expected from their distribution in the field. R. typus occurred most often in shelters with wide openings, offering limited protection against predators, but providing potential aggregation sites for shrimps. Overall, direct effects of predation on shrimp densities and population structure were weak, but indirect effects on shrimp distribution within reefs appear to have been mediated through behavioural responses. Our study highlights the need to assess both numerical and behavioural responses of prey to determine the effects of predator loss on mesoconsumer populations. © 2012 The Author(s). postprin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development and}} implementation of a geospatial data processing method and multi-decadal Landsat time series for computing general coastal U. S. land-use and land-cover (LULC) classifications and change products consisting of seven classes (<b>water,</b> <b>barren,</b> upland herbaceous, non-woody wetland, woody upland, woody wetland, and urban). Use of this approach extends the observational period of the NOAA-generated Coastal Change and Analysis Program (C-CAP) products by almost two decades, assuming the availability of one cloud free Landsat scene from any season for each targeted year. The Mobile Bay region in Alabama was used as a study area to develop, demonstrate, and validate the method that was applied to derive LULC products for nine dates at approximate five year intervals across a 34 -year time span, using single dates of data for each classification in which forests were either leaf-on, leaf-off, or mixed senescent conditions. Classifications were computed and refined using decision rules in conjunction with unsupervised classification of Landsat data and C-CAP value-added products. Each classification's overall accuracy was assessed by comparing stratified random locations to available reference data, including higher spatial resolution satellite and aerial imagery, field survey data, and raw Landsat RGBs. Overall classification accuracies ranged from 83 to 91 % with overall Kappa statistics ranging from 0. 78 to 0. 89. The accuracies are comparable to those from similar, generalized LULC products derived from C-CAP data. The Landsat MSS-based LULC product accuracies are similar to those from Landsat TM or ETM+ data. Accurate classifications were computed for all nine dates, yielding effective results regardless of season. This classification method yielded products that were used to compute LULC change products via additive GIS overlay techniques...|$|R
40|$|The UN Law of Sea defines {{an island}} as “a {{naturally}} formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide. ” However, {{according to the}} same international law, not every kind of island engenders the same legal effects: “rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic {{life of their own}} shall have no exclusive economic zone. ” In the Pacific Ocean, some 1750 kilometers south of Tokyo, the governor of Tokyo raised the Japanese flag, and placed an address plaque “ 1 Okinotori Island, Ogasawara Village, Tokyo” on a rock, or actually two rocks. The first one is roughly {{the size of a small}} room, the second one that of a twin bed. The smallest pokes some 7 centimeters out of the ocean, the bigger one arrives at double this altitude. In order to continue claiming territorial rights and assert exclusive economic control and fishing rights in a two hundred nautical mile zone around the rocks — i. e. in a part of the ocean larger than the surface of Japan’s mainland — these rocks need to be protected against the effects of global warming and typhoons. What is more: they need to naturally grow, in order to change status from mere rock into “a naturally formed area of land”. According to the New York Times the Japanese government has already spent over 600 million dollars to keep the <b>barren</b> islets above <b>water.</b> It encased the tiny protrusions in 25 meter thick concrete, at a cost of 280 million dollars, then made slits across the concrete, so it would comply with the UN law that an island be surrounded by water. Since then, Japanese scientists are developing genetically modified species of coral with the aim to grow the rocks into a small but internationally recognized archipelago: the Okinotori Islands...|$|R

Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) nest on barren sandy habitats, typically sandbars and shorelines within large river {{systems of the}} central United States. Loss of natural ecosystem processes which create and maintain these habitats is considered {{the primary reason for}} population decline and Federal listing of this population. Throughout their range, management for Least Terns focuses on maintenance of breeding habitats, including placement of dredged material specifically as nesting substrate. Wide expanses of barren land are known to attract Least Terns, yet specific small scale habitat features are thought to trigger nest habitat selection. Yet as a plunge-diving piscivore, Least Terns also rely on ready access to appropriately sized slender-bodied fish: < 52 mm total length for adults and < 34 mm total length for young chicks. It remains unknown whether sandbar construction is a benefit or a detriment to forage abundance for Least Terns. Lastly, the relationship between availability of nesting habitats and required foraging habitats remains ambiguous. This information is needed to refine understanding of Least Tern habitat needs from a foraging ecology perspective, and contribute to knowledge and potential value of habitat restoration efforts. This study evaluates 1) the shallow water (< 1. 5 m) fish community near river and mechanically created emergent sandbars during three nesting seasons (2006 - 2008), 2) nest-scale habitat selection to determine if nest habitats differ between constructed and natural sandbars, and it evaluates the consequences of this selection on nest success, and 3) the potential associations between specific habitat features, at differing spatial scales, associated with airborne and foraging Least Terns. The research effort focused on the 95 kilometers of Gavins Point Reach of the Missouri River, between Yankton, SD and Ponca, NE during the Least Tern nesting season in 2006 - 2008. We sampled fish within 15 - 16 areas every two weeks from late May - July to document the relative abundance, species richness, and size classes of fish. Using systematic surveys on sandbars every 2 - 3 days, we detected and tracked 869 Least Tern nests until eggs hatched or failed, on constructed and natural sandbars in the Missouri River examining them for evidence of microhabitat selection at the nest and 3 m from nest. Least Terns successful foraging sites (N= 416) were compared to a paired nearby random location to evaluate evidence of habitat selection during successful foraging in 2007 - 2008. We used systematic surveys every two weeks from late May - July in each year to identify Least Tern airborne (foraging or flying) locations within the river corridor (2006 : 966 sites, 2007 : 2940 sites, 2008 : 2003 sites), recording them using spot mapping. We modeled the probability that an observation (random and bird) as an airborne tern using logistic regression and habitat variables derived from remote sensing. Lastly, to refine our understanding of behavior in specifying habitat use, we modeled the probability of a location as a foraging site. Fish relative abundance was negatively related to depth. Catches were dominated by schooling species, including emerald shiner, sand shiner, spotfin shiner, and bigmouth buffalo. Significant inter-annual differences in relative abundance were observed, with generally increasing trends in intra-seasonal relative abundance of shiners and the smallest size classes of fish (< 34 mm). Significant differences in the fish communities between the sandbar types were not detected in this study. These results suggest that mechanical sandbar habitats host comparable fish communities at similar levels of relative abundance. Among nests, significant differences were observed in substrates, amount of debris, and measures of vegetation between natural and created habitats, and between microhabitat at nests and the surrounding area. In general, Least Tern nest sites had coarser and larger substrate materials at the nest, more debris, and shorter and less vegetation compared to areas within the 3 m surrounding area. Nests in constructed habitats had a greater proportion of coarse substrates and less vegetation or debris than naturally created habitats. Observed nest success among constructed sandbars was 1. 8 x greater than that recorded among nests on natural sandbars, but a greater proportion of nests on natural bars were in or adjoining moist habitats where they were frequently destroyed. The best supported model predicting nest success on constructed and natural sandbars each included positive associations with percentage of pebble substrate, but inclusion of additional habitat predictors differed by sandbar type. Selection of microhabitat characteristics at the nest and vicinity constrains this species to <b>barren</b> <b>water</b> and wind scoured habitats. Historically, scoured habitats and the comparative abundance of debris within sites may have been a cue indicating safe habitats as river stage decreased. Water management regimes during this study favored survival of nests on higher elevation sandbars which included limited areas of wet substrates, typical of mechanically constructed sandbars. Among the micro-site habitat assessments for foraging birds, differences were not observed in water depth availability between natural or mechanically created habitats. Based on AIC relative importance scores, the variables water depth and microhabitat characteristics were most critical among micro-site characteristics of successful foraging locations; turbidity and larger scale aquatic features were comparatively of less importance. Within the greater landscape, Least Tern airborne locations within the river corridor were best explained by multi-scale logistic regressions; birds concentrated in areas with higher proportions of sandbar and wet sand habitats (200 m radius), while avoiding trees (50 m radius). When applied to a reserved sample of random locations, results suggest that in any given year, 40 - 97 % of river corridor habitats were likely unsuitable for airborne terns. Furthermore, habitat use differed by behavior; foraging birds approached nearer to wet sand patches and in areas with less emergent sandbar habitat than flying birds, with some habitat relationships differing by year. Despite the surficial visual uniformity of many aquatic habitats on the Missouri River, successful foraging by Least Terns was associated with shallow, slack-water microhabitats adjacent to emergent sandbars and within areas with a greater proportion of sandbar habitat. This study demonstrates the importance of incorporating both spatial scale and behavior into ecological assessments of Least Tern foraging habitats...|$|R
