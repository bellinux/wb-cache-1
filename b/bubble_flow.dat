The meters are located upstream from the metabolic chambers. The flow meters are simple to use but should be calibrated twice daily {{for use in the}} respirometry system: once before recording begins (but after the animal has been sealed inside the chamber!!) and again {{at the end of the}} recording (before the animal is removed from the chamber). Calibration must be done with a <b>bubble</b> <b>flow</b> meter because the calibration marks on the acrylic meters are only approximate. For proper calibration of flow rates remember that both barometric pressure and temperature of the air streaming through the flow meter (which we assume to be equal to room temperature) must be recorded.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bubble</b> <b>flow</b> meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small rubber pipette bulb attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the glass surface along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass volumetric pipettes.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of <b>bubble</b> <b>flows</b> {{is important in}} the design of process equipment, particularly in the chemical and power industries. In vapour-liquid processes the mass and heat transfer between the phases is dominated by the liquid-vapour interface and is determined by the number, size and shape of the <b>bubbles.</b> For <b>bubble</b> <b>flows</b> these characteristics are often controlled by the generation mechanisms and, since <b>bubble</b> <b>flows</b> are often generated at an orifice, it is important to determine the controlling parameters which dictate how bubbles grow and detach. For bubbles growing at orifices the liquid displacement is an important feature and affects the pressure distribution acting on the bubble and the heat and mass transfer that may occur at the bubble interface. Therefore, in this study, the characteristics of the liquid velocity field are studied experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) during growth, detachment and translation of a bubble being generated at an orifice supplied with a constant mass flow rate of air. The process is transient and occurs over a period of approximately 50 msecs. In order to map the transient flow field a combination of high speed cine and cross correlation PIV image processing has been used to determine the liquid velocity vector field during the bubble growth process.

Focus has been on jointed pipe drilling with gas injection through the drill string. A description is made of a two‐phase drift‐flux model. The model has previously been developed in Matlab and is modeled to simulate the dynamic bottomhole pressure, during transient conditions in underbalanced operations. The original model only recognizes the slug flow regime and its corresponding slip parameters are implemented through the general slip law [29]. Extension {{has been made to}} the original model by including a model that distinguishes between <b>bubble</b> <b>flow</b> and slug flow, based on a simplified version of the suggestions made by Caetano [22]. Values for the slip parameters were chosen depending on existing flow pattern. For the transition zone, interpolation technique was used. The velocity profile coefficient for <b>bubble</b> <b>flow</b> was suggested to be 1. 0 by Caetano, however, as this made oscillations in the simulation results a value of 1. 1 was adapted, as proposed by Lage and Time [34]. Simulation runs of two‐phase flow in a vertical well were performed using the original model, the bubble slip parameters and the flow pattern dependent model.

40|$|Electrostatic charge {{generation}} in gas-solid fluidized beds {{is a significant}} industrial problem. Associated problems include particle agglomeration and particle wall fouling. In the polymerization industry this may result in "sheets" of fused polymer, due to exothermic reaction causing the melting of the polymer, which can fall off and block the distributor plate disrupting fluidizing gas flow. Additionally, blockage of the catalyst feed or the polymer removal system can take place or the product can become non-uniform. All of these problems require shut-down of the reactor which results in lost production time. While this phenomena has been identified for many years, the mechanisms involved are not well understood, especially wall fouling {{and the distribution of}} charge within the bed. Isolation of individual parameters such as hydrodynamics, operating conditions, and material involved is necessary to evaluate how each parameter impacts charge generation during fluidization. In this thesis, the fluidization system consisted of a stainless steel column, two online Faraday cups, and a retractable distributor plate. This system allowed for the simultaneous measurement of charge within different regions of the bed: the entrained fine particles, the particles adhered to the column wall, and the bulk of the bed. Additionally, mass and particle size distributions were measured and images of the layer of particles adhered to the column wall were taken for comparison. This allowed for a charge distribution comparison and evaluation of wall fouling. Three different parameters were investigated: duration of fluidization, column wall material, and relative humidity of fluidizing gas. Fluidization time was studied for 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 360 min; relative humidity was investigated for 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % relative humidity. Both fluidization time and relative humidity were evaluated at four different fluidization gas velocities, two each in the <b>bubbling</b> and slugging <b>flow</b> regimes. Column wall material was evaluated for a stainless steel and carbon steel column at two gas velocities, one each in the <b>bubbling</b> and slugging <b>flow</b> regimes. Fluidization time was found to influence wall fouling in the <b>bubbling</b> <b>flow</b> regime as the particle layer continued to build as fluidization progressed. In the slugging flow regime, the particle layer developed within 15 minutes of the onset of fluidization. The <b>bubbling</b> <b>flow</b> regime was shown to have a greater capacity for charge generation than the slugging flow regime. This was due to the vigorous mixing in the <b>bubbling</b> <b>flow</b> regime resulting in more particle-particle interactions. Column wall material was shown to influence wall fouling in the slugging flow regime due to the differences in surface roughness of the columns. This was due to the particle-wall contacts resulting in frictional charging which is the predominant charging mechanism in this flow regime. Charge was also impacted in the <b>bubbling</b> <b>flow</b> regime in those particles that were adhered to the column wall. Relative humidity was found to influence wall fouling at the lowest gas velocity tested. However, variations in generation of charge occurred at all fluidization gas velocities tested; the charge-to-mass ratios for the particles adhered to the column wall in the slugging flow regime decreased with high relative humidities. This was due to either the formation of a water film layer on the column wall or instantaneous surface water films on the particles throughout fluidization...|$|R
