Various reorganizations made Soviet units smaller and leaner; the last divisional standard (December 1944), <b>beefed</b> <b>up</b> against the 1943 minimum, provided for only 1,196 horses for a regular division and 1,155 horses for a Guards division.

25|$|Jews from Upper Nazareth, {{including}} apparently many Russian-speakers, attacked Arabs {{and their}} homes and businesses in Nazareth {{on the eve of}} Yom Kippur. Police, informed of the intention to attack Arabs, <b>beefed</b> <b>up</b> their forces and deployed them on the seam line between the two communities. When hundreds of Jewish youths from Nazareth Illit came down to throw stones and vandalize Arab properties, however, the police did not impede them. The Arab residents emerged from their homes to defend them, and reciprocal stone throwing clashes ensued. Police dispersed the riots with tear gas and live ammunition. Two Arabs who had attempted to rein in their own communities from getting near the Jewish youths and police, Omar Akawi and Wissam Yazbek, were shot dead, the latter by a gunshot wound to the head, fired by a policeman from behind him. The shooters were never identified.|$|E
25|$|It is {{less than}} 1/8inch long and their body color can range from a dark purple to a light reddish-brown color and is sparsely and weakly dotted with small pits. They have short wings and long legs. The beetle lives under rocks and logs, in sinkholes, rotting wood, termite nest, and caves, {{although}} it is now only known to still exist in four caves in the Edwards Plateau, Travis County, Texas. Not all caves {{in the region have}} been surveyed, so this may be an underestimate. It lives in total darkness so there is no use for eyes and uses elaborate appendages and <b>beefed</b> <b>up</b> nerve centers to interpret slight air-pressure or temperature changes, sounds, and smells. This sensory equipment helps the beetle travel, sense objects, and ambush prey. There is no distinct reproduction pattern for the beetle and may reproduce at any time of the year if conditions are steady in the cave. Little is known about daily life of the mold beetle because of their secretive habitats. When going to observe them they are rarely found and when they are found it is usually only one to two specimens. They are so secretive that finding an individual is a rare event. It is also very hard to distinguish Texamaurops reddelli from other beetles in the Pselaphide family. Only upon microscopic study can the beetle be distinguished by its ocular knobs on its head. This makes it hard to identify the beetles in the field as they can easily be mistaken for another beetle species in the same family.|$|E

Dacre claimed legislation passed in the last 20 years already helped stop necessary journalistic enquiry, and meant that the press was [...] "already on the very cusp of being over regulated". After returning to his negative opinion of liberals, who [...] "by and large hate all the popular press", he said [...] "that Britain's commercially viable free press – because it is in hock to nobody – is the only really free media in this country." [...] His advocacy of newspaper owners being legally unable to reject any regulatory body was viewed as a reference to Richard Desmond, whose Northern & Shell company owns the Daily Express, and had withdrawn from the PCC.|$|E
