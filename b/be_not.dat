5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am not, is not, are not, has not, {{and have}} not in the common English language vernacular. In some dialects ain't is also used as a contraction of do not, does not, and did not. The development of ain't for {{the various forms of}} to <b>be</b> <b>not,</b> to have not, and to do not occurred independently, at different times. The usage of ain't for the forms of to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> was established by the mid-18th century, and for the forms of to have not by the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|An't for is not {{may have}} {{developed}} independently from its use for am not and are not. Isn't was sometimes written as in't or en't, {{which could have}} changed into an't. An't for is not may also have filled a gap {{as an extension of}} the already-used conjugations for to <b>be</b> <b>not.</b> Jonathan Swift used an't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella (1710–13): It an't my fault, 'tis Patrick's fault; pray now don't blame Presto.|$|E
5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E is monitored by Meteo France's La Reunion {{tropical cyclone}} centre (MFR, RSMC La Reunion).

5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although {{it had been in}} the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> that different from a system in which all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E

5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> guilty by reason of insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, {{with the proviso}} that it <b>be</b> <b>not</b> carried out until she gave her approval. As {{there was no sign of}} her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, L. Sprague de Camp {{considered}} Morris's fantasies to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued the plots of the novels are heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just {{happened in the}} romances, the novels are still weakened by the dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres {{of the field of}} fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers' imitation of William Morris.|$|E

5|$|Tanks must {{be cleaned}} {{from time to}} time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank. Also, when tanks are to be {{inspected}} or maintenance must be performed within a tank, it must <b>be</b> <b>not</b> only cleaned, but made gas-free.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E

5|$|After the 1987 {{resignation}} of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded {{his own private}} equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm {{was responsible for the}} 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign {{of the end of the}} 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in , and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was {{selected}} for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127not out against Western Australia, but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> of first-class status, angering Barnes. He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in {{the final game of}} the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56), Barnes {{was selected}} as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could <b>be</b> <b>not</b> only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
5|$|Of the 74 German {{ships in}} Scapa Flow, 15 of the 16 capital ships, 5 of the 8 cruisers, and 32 of the 50 destroyers were sunk.

The beached ships were later dispersed to the allied navies, {{but most of}} the sunken ships were initially left at the bottom of Scapa Flow, the cost of salvaging them being deemed to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> worth the potential returns, owing to the glut of scrap metal left {{after the end of the}} war, with plenty of obsolete warships having been broken up. After complaints from locals that the wrecks were a hazard to navigation, a salvage company was formed in 1923, which raised four of the sunken destroyers.|$|E
