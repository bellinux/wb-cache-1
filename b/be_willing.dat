5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
