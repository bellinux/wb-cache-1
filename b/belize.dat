5|$|In <b>Belize,</b> a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000UTC on October12. It was discontinued about nine hours later. The Government of <b>Belize</b> suspended school classes, as the buildings were being used as storm shelters. Voluntary evacuations were recommended for residents of the coastal cayes. A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions. At Punta Negra, the National Guard of <b>Belize</b> evacuated residents on October13. However, no impact was reported in <b>Belize.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October2, the {{government}} of <b>Belize</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the entire <b>Belize</b> Defence Force due to the storm's threat. The airport in <b>Belize</b> City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, <b>Belize,</b> authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for <b>Belize</b> City, setting up shelters in Belmopan. Overall, about 25,000people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population. Three hospitals were evacuated in the country. In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of <b>Belize</b> City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from <b>Belize</b> City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). He instructed {{the newly created}} Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated <b>Belize</b> City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave <b>Belize</b> City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, by contrast, {{mangrove}} cover {{stood at}} 188,417 acres (76,250 hectares)—also 3.4% of <b>Belize's</b> territory, although {{based on the}} work of mangrove researcher Simon Zisman, <b>Belize's</b> mangrove cover in 1980 was estimated to represent 98.7% of the precolonial extent of those ecosystems. <b>Belize's</b> mangrove cover in 2010 was thus estimated to represent 96.7% of the precolonial cover. Assessing changes in <b>Belize's</b> mangrove cover over a 30-year period was possible because of <b>Belize's</b> participation in the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System, a regional observatory jointly implemented by CATHALAC, RCMRD, ICIMOD, NASA, USAID, and other partners.|$|R
25|$|While over 60% of <b>Belize's</b> land {{surface is}} covered by forest, some 20% of the country's land {{is covered by}} {{cultivated}} land (agriculture) and human settlements. Savanna, scrubland and wetland constitute the remainder of <b>Belize's</b> land cover. Important mangrove ecosystems are also represented across <b>Belize's</b> landscape. As {{a part of the}} globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor that stretches from southern Mexico to Panama, <b>Belize's</b> biodiversity – both marine and terrestrial – is rich, with abundant flora and fauna.|$|R
50|$|With {{uncertainty}} regarding actual {{rates of}} clearing of <b>Belize's</b> mangrove ecosystems, {{a recent study}} funded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has clarified the situation, making use of Landsat satellite imagery to comprehensively examine <b>Belize's</b> mangrove cover. That study, which spanned the thirty years from 1980-2010 and {{was based on the}} earlier work of mangrove researcher Simon Zisman, was conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) and found that in 2010, mangroves covered some 184,548 acres (74,684 hectares) or 3.4% of <b>Belize's</b> territory. By contrast, it is estimated that in 1980 mangrove cover stood at 188,417 acres (76,250 hectares) - also 3.4% of <b>Belize's</b> territory. Based on Zisman, it is also estimated that <b>Belize's</b> mangrove cover in 1980 represented 98.7% of the pre-colonial extent of those ecosystems. <b>Belize's</b> mangrove cover in 2010 was thus estimated to represent 96.7% of the pre-colonial cover. Where the 2010 update of the World Mangrove Atlas also indicated that a fifth of the world's mangrove ecosystems have been lost since 1980, the case of <b>Belize's</b> mangroves thus stands {{in stark contrast to the}} global picture.|$|R
5|$|<b>Belize</b> was, {{until the}} 15th century, {{a part of}} the Mayan Empire, {{containing}} smaller states headed by a hereditary ruler known as an ajaw (later k’uhul ajaw). The present monarchy of <b>Belize</b> {{has its roots in the}} Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the area was first colonised in the 16th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 21 September 1981, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of <b>Belize.</b> The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of <b>Belize,</b> Sir Colville Young.|$|E
5|$|Following Carmen's passage, {{officials}} {{feared the}} worst for {{an area of}} 1,000mi2 (2,590km2) where communication was lost in <b>Belize.</b> A reconnaissance task force was sent out from <b>Belize</b> City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm. One person was killed {{off the coast of}} <b>Belize</b> after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Belize,</b> a {{hurricane}} warning was issued about 23hours before Iris moved ashore. A state of national emergency was declared on October8 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall. All emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts. A mandatory evacuation was issued for Stann Creek and Toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands. The main hospital in <b>Belize</b> City was evacuated {{as a precaution}} and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order. Overall, 11,380people evacuated their homes in <b>Belize,</b> including many in <b>Belize</b> City. These evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll. Hurricane Keith had struck the nation a year prior, preparing some citizens for what to expect. Disaster response teams arrived the day after Iris was projected to make landfall. Pan American Health Organization staff were on standby in <b>Belize,</b> Guatemala and Honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Belize's</b> {{population}} was 324,528 in 2010. <b>Belize's</b> total fertility rate in 2009 was 3.6 children per woman. Its birth rate was 27.33 births/1,000 population, {{and the death}} rate was 5.8 deaths/1,000 population.|$|R

5|$|In contrast, {{the northeastern}} {{portion of the}} {{peninsula}} is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers, except for the Champotón River – all other rivers {{are located in the}} south. The Sibun River flows from west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast; the Río Hondo flows northwards from <b>Belize</b> to empty into the same lake. Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay. The Río Nuevo flows from Lamanai Lake in <b>Belize</b> northwards to Chetumal Bay. The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through <b>Belize</b> and join to form the <b>Belize</b> River, which empties into the Caribbean Sea. In the southwest of the peninsula, the San Pedro River, the Candelaría River and the Mamantel River, which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage.|$|E
5|$|In late October 1978, the United Methodist Church sent {{books and}} other {{supplies}} via aircraft to <b>Belize,</b> after a youth group rode out the storm there and desired to help residents. Despite the hurricane damage, the economy of <b>Belize</b> continued to grow after Greta struck, including an increase in banana production.|$|E
5|$|No Spanish {{military}} expeditions {{were launched}} against the Maya of <b>Belize,</b> although both Dominican and Franciscan friars penetrated {{the region in}} attempts at evangelising the natives. The only Spanish settlement in the territory was established by Alonso d'Avila in 1531 and lasted less than two years. In 1574, fifty households of Manche Ch'ol were relocated from Campin and Yaxal, in southern <b>Belize,</b> to the shore of Lake Izabal, but they soon fled back into the forest. In order to counter Spanish encroachment into their territory, the local Maya maintained an uneasy friendship with British loggers operating in central <b>Belize.</b> In 1641, the Franciscans established two reducciones among the Muzul Maya of central <b>Belize,</b> at Zoite and Cehake; both settlements were sacked by Dutch corsairs within a year.|$|E

5|$|About 50hours before landfall, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for <b>Belize</b> and the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, and about 12hours later it was upgraded to a hurricane watch. When the lack of significant intensification became apparent, {{a tropical}} storm warning was added {{for much of the}} Yucatán Peninsula and later for a portion of the Mexican coast along the Bay of Campeche. As the storm approached, nearly 2,500people in vulnerable areas of eastern Mexico evacuated to safer areas. About 8,000people evacuated in <b>Belize,</b> primarily on offshore islands. The government of <b>Belize</b> opened its emergency operation center and evacuated several hospitals. About 250airline flights were canceled, and some cruise ship paths were diverted to safer locations.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of <b>Belize</b> City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after <b>Belize</b> City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E

He was the oldest person to represent <b>Belize</b> at the London Games at the age of 32, and made his first appearance in the quadrennial event. Sanchez faced Miklós Ungvári of Hungary in the Round of 32 after receiving a bye and was defeated by his opponent after 19 seconds and therefore eliminated from the competition.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a storm tide {{of up to}} 14feet (4.3m) near <b>Belize</b> City, a city of 31,000people {{located at}} sea-level; its only {{defenses}} against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10ft (3m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150mph (240km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200mph (325km/h). When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in <b>Belize</b> City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the <b>Belize</b> Barrier Reef, although the reef recovered after the storm.|$|E
5|$|In RAF service, the Harrier {{was used}} in close air support (CAS), reconnaissance, and other ground-attack roles. The {{flexibility}} of the Harrier led to a long-term heavy deployment in West Germany as a conventional deterrent and potential strike weapon against Soviet aggression; from camouflaged rough bases the Harrier was expected to launch attacks on advancing armour columns from East Germany. Harriers were also deployed to bases in Norway and <b>Belize,</b> a former British colony. No. 1 Squadron was specifically earmarked for Norwegian operations {{in the event of}} war, operating as part of Allied Forces Northern Europe. The Harrier's capabilities were necessary in the <b>Belize</b> deployment, as it was the only RAF combat aircraft capable of safely operating from the airport's short runway; British forces had been stationed in <b>Belize</b> for several years due to tensions over a Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory; the forces were withdrawn in 1993, two years after Guatemala recognized the independence of <b>Belize.</b>|$|E

The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the <b>Belize</b> coastline from <b>Belize</b> City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the <b>Belize</b> coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E
