25|$|A {{number of}} other {{compounds}} may be included in irrigation fluids such as the steroid <b>budesonide</b> {{in an effort to}} treat chronic rhinosinusitis.|$|E
25|$|Steroid enemas {{can also}} be used to treat {{symptoms}} in the lower colon and rectum. Hydrocortisone and <b>budesonide</b> liquid and foam enemas are marketed for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{marketed as}} anti-inflammatories are often topical formulations, such as nasal sprays for {{rhinitis}} or inhalers for asthma. These preparations {{have the advantage}} of only affecting the targeted area, thereby reducing side effects or potential interactions. In this case, the main compounds used are beclometasone, <b>budesonide,</b> fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide. In rhinitis, sprays are used. For asthma, glucocorticoids are administered as inhalants with a metered-dose or dry powder inhaler.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for triamcinolone acetonide in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for salbutamol, fluticasone, formoterol and <b>budesonide</b> whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for prednisolone in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E
500|$|Corticosteroids, such as {{dexamethasone}} and <b>budesonide,</b> {{have been}} shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup. [...] Significant relief is obtained as early as six hours after administration. [...] While effective when given by injection, or by inhalation, giving the medication by mouth is preferred. [...] A single dose is usually all that is required, and is generally considered to be quite safe. Dexamethasone at doses of [...] 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6mg/kg appear to be all equally effective.|$|E
2500|$|Another oral corticosteroid, <b>budesonide</b> (trade name Entocort), {{has limited}} {{absorption}} {{and a high}} level of first-pass metabolism, meaning that lower quantities of the drug enter the bloodstream. It {{has been shown to be}} useful in the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease, and in maintaining remission. It is also effective when used in combination with antibiotics to treat active Crohn's disease. <b>Budesonide</b> is released in the ileum and right colon, and therefore has a topical effect against disease in that area.|$|E
2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of <b>budesonide</b> was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Budesonide</b> is {{contraindicated}} as {{a primary}} treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episode of asthma where intensive measures are required. [...] It is also contraindicated for patients who have hypersensitivity to <b>budesonide.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Budesonide,</b> in colonic release preparations, {{has been}} shown in {{randomized}} controlled trials to be effective in treating this disorder. It helps control the diarrheal symptoms and treatment is usually given for several weeks. Sometimes it is used to prevent frequent relapses.|$|E

50|$|The {{antihistamine}} azelastine, applied as a nasal spray, may {{be effective}} for vasomotor rhinitis. Fluticasone propionate or <b>budesonide</b> (both are steroids) in nostril spray form {{may also be}} used for symptomatic treatment. The antihistamine cyproheptadine is also effective, probably due to its antiserotonergic effects.|$|E

5000|$|Glucocorticoids (such as <b>budesonide,</b> cortisol, and beclomethasone) are a {{class of}} {{endogenous}} or synthetic anti-inflammatory steroid hormones that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. They are used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, including allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. Because they suppress inflammatory pathways, long-term use of glucocorticoid drugs can lead to side-effects such as immunodeficiency and adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
