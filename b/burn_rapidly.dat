500|$|The early {{motion picture}} {{industry}} primarily used nitrocellulose film stock, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires <b>burn</b> <b>rapidly,</b> and cannot typically be extinguished, capable of burning even underwater. Additionally, nitrocellulose {{is subject to}} thermal decomposition and hydrolysis, breaking down over time {{in the presence of}} high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even spontaneously combust. In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, there is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances necessary for self-ignition. Sustained temperatures of [...] or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, exacerbating several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions.|$|E
500|$|Rocket boosters: An {{illustration}} {{and description}} in the 14th century Chinese military treatise [...] Huolongjing by the Ming dynasty military writer and philosopher Jiao Yu shows the oldest known multistage rocket with rocket boosters. The Huolongjing describes and illustrates the oldest known multistage rocket. It was a two-stage rocket that had carrier or booster rockets that would automatically ignite {{a number of}} smaller rocket arrows that were {{shot out of the}} front end of the missile, which was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth, before eventually burning out. This multi-stage rocket may be considered the ancestor to the modern YingJi-62 ASCM. The British scientist, sinologist, and historian Joseph Needham points out that the written material and depicted illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the Huolongjing, which can be dated roughly from 1300–1350 AD. Solid rocket boosters finds its roots in the Chinese invented fire arrows invented during the medieval Song dynasty more than 1000 years ago, using gunpowder as solid rocket propellants. Gunpowder was packed into a bamboo case cylinder and an opening was created on the cylinders other end. As the gunpowder was ignited, it began to <b>burn</b> <b>rapidly</b> and created large amounts of gas that would rush out to create thrust.|$|E

60|$|We {{were beyond}} British ground, on the {{opposite}} bank, where any one guiding Europeans is threatened with punishment: we had expected a guide to follow us, but his non-appearance caused us to delay for some hours; four roads, or rather forest paths, meeting here, {{all of which were}} difficult to find. After a while, part of a marriage-procession came up, headed by the bridegroom, a handsome young Lepcha, leading a cow for the marriage feast; and after talking to him a little, he volunteered to show us the path. On the flats by the stream grew the Sago palm (Cycas pectinata), with a stem ten feet high, and a beautiful crown of foliage; the contrast between this and the Scotch-looking pine (both growing with oaks and palms) was curious. Much of the forest had been burnt, and we traversed large blackened patches, where the heat was intense, and increased by the burning trunks of prostrate trees, which smoulder for months, and leave a heap of white ashes. The larger timber being hollow in the centre, a current of air is produced, which causes the interior to <b>burn</b> <b>rapidly,</b> till the sides fall in, and all is consumed. I was often startled, when walking in the forest, by the hot blast proceeding from such, which I had approached without a suspicion of their being other than cold dead trunks.|$|E

50|$|Because of its {{cryogenic}} nature, {{liquid oxygen}} {{can cause the}} materials it touches to become extremely brittle.

50|$|The {{passage of}} the Rebellion Losses Bill {{on the night of}} April 25, 1849, led to the sacking and arson of the St. Anne's Market {{parliamentary}} building.

Over 23,000 volumes in the parliamentary library, as well as the partial archives of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, were lost in the fire. The parliament reconvened the following day, April 26, at the Bonsecours Market, where it would reside until moving permanently to Toronto.|$|R

50|$|Paper birch trees {{themselves}} have varied reactions to wildfire. A group, or stand, of paper birch {{is not particularly}} flammable. The canopy often has a high moisture content and the under story is often lush green.

The overheated bearings exploded, destroying the shaft; the turbine disc on the burning engine separated from the destroyed shaft; the freed disc spun to an enormous speed and, within seconds, explosively disintegrated, destroying it. Debris from the explosion violently spread around (with an estimated speed of 160 m/s), puncturing the fuselage, severing flight controls and electrical cables, and causing severe damage to engine No. 1 — the outer left one, which soon also started to burn. A piece of hot debris burst into cargo hold number 4 and caused a rapidly spreading fire; the inner left engine <b>burned</b> <b>rapidly</b> until impact.|$|R
