60|$|Wine, Feemy {{was going}} to say, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had none to offer.|$|E
60|$|It was a guarded {{promise and}} {{by no means}} all that she desired, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must be content with it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{could not}} tell him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> knew nearly for certain! It was most unlikely; {{circumstances}} had changed! Irene's words still rang in her head: [...] "I have left Soames. Where should I go?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Reluctant Rebel - Timid Beth Carson is {{confused}} for her rebellious cousin Beverly at her new school. Beth enjoys her new found notoriety <b>but</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> must {{tell the truth}} before things get out of hand.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few days}} later, on Beltane, Viviane sends Morgaine to {{be a part}} of a {{fertility}} rite as [...] "The Virgin Huntress", where Morgaine is to make love to the man who kills the king's stag. Both partners are masked, so neither knows who the other is; still afterward, Morgaine longs for it to be Lancelot, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> will never <b>know</b> for sure.|$|R
50|$|J.D. may {{not know}} the truth about her past, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she's</b> in danger, and she can't shake the dark visions {{haunting}} her dreams. She won't be safe until she figures out who she is and where she came from. She can trust no one, not even herself—especially not herself. Because {{it turns out that}} there's one thing even more terrible than forgetting her past: remembering.|$|R
60|$|We all enjoyed our {{turnovers}} except Sara Ray. She ate hers <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{should not}} have done so. Her mother did not approve of snacks between meals, or of jam turnovers at any time. Once, when Sara was in a brown study, I {{asked her what she}} was thinking of.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one could}} help liking him, Elspeth, he has such winning ways," [...] said Tommy, {{perhaps a little}} in the voice with which at {{funerals}} we refer to the departed. She loved his words, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had a surprise for him this time, and she tried to blurt it out.|$|E
60|$|She, desolate {{again as}} she had been when she was a child, went away and sobbed. She did not care, she did not care whether the water had turned to wine or not. Let him believe it if he wanted to. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had won. And an ashy desolation came over her.|$|E
50|$|Odile is restless {{because her}} father seldom praises her, even though (or perhaps because) she is growing {{to be his}} equal in magic. She has never seen {{much of the world}} outside her father's estate, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> would like the company of other people. She has no {{interest}} in the swans because they seem to lack her intelligence, and because von Rothbart has taught her to despise them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Crazy idiot," [...] she observed, {{apparently}} describing {{herself and}} the nervous young man together. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> {{wanted to see him}} again.|$|R
5000|$|Celario lusts after Azákia, {{and she has}} {{feelings}} for him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> must stay loyal to her husband, Ouábi. The Illinois sachem allows Celario {{to go to war}} with him, to prove himself worthy of his wife, Azákia. Celario is injured in battle and sent back to the settlement with Azákia. Ultimately, Ouábi realizes that the love Celario has for Azákia is unmatched by the love he has for her. Ouábi relinquishes his [...] "marriage" [...] to Azákia so she and Celario can be together as was truly meant to be.|$|R
6000|$|Kate {{liked his}} looks, {{and the way}} in which he held out his hand to her; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> should be scolded for her awkward greeting: so she put out her hand as if she had no use of her arm above the elbow, hung down her head, and said [...] "--do;" [...] at least no more was audible.|$|E
60|$|Allie {{recovered}} to {{find herself}} lying in a canvas-covered wagon, and being worked over by several sympathetic women. She did not see Durade. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had not been mistaken. The wagon was rolling along as fast as oxen could travel. Evidently the caravan had been alarmed by {{the proximity of the}} Sioux and was making as much progress as possible.|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} she had touched him, for he cast {{a quick glance at}} the door, as if to make sure that nobody had heard his boast. As he did so, Evelyn thought she heard a faint {{movement}} outside, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> might be mistaken, and Gomez did not seem to notice anything. To distract his attention, she flung another jibe at him.|$|E
5000|$|Mattie's is {{passionate about}} reading and writing; {{she looks up}} a new word in her {{dictionary}} {{so that she can}} educate herself. Her best friend, Weaver Smith, is also intelligent and has large aspirations. Weaver is African-American and is as strong in math as Mattie is in literature. Weaver shows Mattie's writings to their teacher, Miss Wilcox, who sends an application for Mattie to Barnard College [...] Mattie gets [...] "full scholarship" [...] to Barnard <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> can't afford to buy the books and a train ticket, or to leave her family's farm.|$|R
5000|$|Quicksand {{functions}} as a semi-autobiographical novel as there are direct ties between Nella Larsen's life {{and the life of}} the fictional Helga Crane. Like Larsen, Helga is of mixed racial background, functioning as a psychological problem due to her failure {{to create a sense of}} self that fits into the community. She finds this process alienating, her only comfortable identity is as an outsider. Due to this, Helga Crane produces a peculiar relationship with happiness in which <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> what it is, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> doesn't have it.|$|R
6000|$|He had faltered again, <b>but</b> all <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> now {{wanted to}} say. [...] "I'm speaking," [...] she said soothingly, [...] "of {{what he told}} her. It's that that I've taken you as knowing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't I?" [...] she laughed; and {{he led her}} on {{straight}} through the Short- horns. Some of them looked at her more than she fancied, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> might give up all hopes of Sam if he detected her fears. Then came the gap, where a tree had been cut down in the hedge, and such a jump down from it! But she gathered up her muslin, and made her leap so gallantly, that the boy cried, ...|$|E
60|$|Dame Gresford {{continued}} to be Grisell's protector, and let the girl sit and spin or embroider beside her, while the other ladies of the house played at ball in the court, or watched the exercises of the pages and squires. The dame's presence and authority prevented Grisell's being beset with uncivil remarks, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was like a toad among the butterflies, as she overheard some saucy youth calling her, while a laugh answered him, and she longed for her convent.|$|E
60|$|Farnam's hired man {{had driven}} {{across to the}} {{settlement}} {{in the afternoon and}} she wondered, rather anxiously, whether he would bring her a telegram. She had written to Thirlwell, telling him when she would be ready to begin her search for the ore, and now waited his reply. Her letter might take some time to reach him, and she must allow for his messenger's journey to the railroad from the mine; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would feel restless until the answer came.|$|E
6000|$|... "How did <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> I hadn't {{said a word}} at {{the phone}} except 'Yes--yes--yes.' <b>She</b> says <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> how <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>but</b> <b>she</b> did <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> was awake and she heard the ring and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that there was word from Jem.|$|R
6000|$|... "A folly--at such a time," [...] Sautron insisted. The Marquis {{looked a}} question. The Count {{answered}} it. [...] "Aline," [...] said he, pregnantly. [...] "She <b>knows.</b> How <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> I can't tell you, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> and <b>she</b> is deeply offended." ...|$|R
50|$|This poem also {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} money. During this time in history, those who had wealth were considered important in society. Amelia has money <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>she</b> had to sacrifice much {{in order to get}} the money.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they sat}} down, cross-legged, {{one on each}} side of the tarpaulin, and began the meal. That was the strangest supper Joan ever sat down to; it was like a dream where there was danger that {{tortured}} her; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was dreaming and would soon wake up. Kells was almost imperceptibly changing. The amiability of his face seemed to have stiffened. The only time he addressed her was when he offered to help her to more meat or bread or coffee. After the meal was finished he would not let her wash the pans and pots, and attended to that himself.|$|E
60|$|Miss Barrington went out; but her niece, who {{understood}} her smile {{and that she}} had received a warning, sat still with a strained expression in her eyes. The prosperity of Silverdale had been dear to her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must let something that was dearer still slip away from her, or, since they must come from her, trample on her pride as she made the first advances. It seemed a very long while before there was a knocking at the outer door, and she rose with a little quiver when light steps came up the stairway.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next time}} Kate saw {{her she was}} walking {{by the side of}} Alice's wheeled-chair, and Sylvia by her side, in a more plain and {{suitable}} dress. Kate set off running to greet them; but at a few paces from them was seized by a shy fit, and stood looking and feeling like a goose, drawing great C's with the point of her parasol in the sand; Josephine looking on, and thinking how [...] "bete" [...] English children were. Mrs. Wardour was not much less shy; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must make a beginning, and so spoke in the middle of Kate's second C: and there was a shaking of hands, and walking together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{wondered}} how he lived. It was evident {{that he could not}} be so poor as she had thought; his pretended poverty might be to escape notice. She could not tell, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> was dangerously interested in him.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not like}} this, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> could not have {{everything}} at once. [...] "You must know," [...] she said, [...] "that there is a bargain between me and Papa. I told him that I should tell you everything." ...|$|R
60|$|Bertha Kircher {{knew that}} he spoke the truth, and yet she could not bring herself to an {{admission}} that Smith-Oldwick would die. She was very fond of him, in fact her great regret was {{that she did not}} love him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> did not.|$|R
60|$|Hiram Powlett had no {{appetite}} whatever, but he meekly sat down, ate a few mouthfuls of food, and then, when Hesba {{left the}} room for a moment, took his cap from the peg and went out. Mrs. Powlett ate her meal standing; she had no more appetite for it than her husband, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> should not have an opportunity of coming downstairs again when once the doctor had left, so she conscientiously forced herself to eat as much as usual, and then, after clearing away the things, and warning the little servant that she must not make the slightest sound, {{she went into the}} parlour and sat down until the doctor came downstairs.|$|E
60|$|The hours {{passed away}} anxiously, and yet only too fast. So many had quitted the palace {{that there was}} nothing {{remarkable}} in packing, but as Anne collected her properties, she could not help wondering whether she should ever see them again. Sometimes her spirit rose at the thought of serving her lovely Queen, saving the little Prince, and fulfilling the King's trust; at others, she was full of vague depression at the thought of being cut off from all she knew and loved, with seas between, and with so little notice to her uncle, who might never learn where she was; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had his approval in venturing all, and making any sacrifice for the King whom all deserted; and she really loved her Queen and little Prince.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last she}} ventured out, and flew {{up to her}} own room more swiftly than ever she had darted before! She moved about quietly, and {{perceived}} by the sounds {{in the next room}} that Mrs. Bartley was dressing Aunt Jane, and Aunt Barbara reading a letter to her. This was surely a good moment; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must dress herself neatly, and not look scared, if she did not mean to be suspected and stopped; and she managed to get quietly into her little shaggy coat, her black hat and feather and warm gloves--even her boots were remembered--and then whispering to herself, [...] "It can't be wrong to get away from being made to tell stories! I'm going to Papa!" [...] she softly opened the door, went on tip-toe past Lady's Jane's door; then after the first flight of stairs, rushed like the wind, unseen by anyone, got the street door open, pulled it by its outside handle, and heard it shut! ...|$|E
60|$|Gomez {{looked so}} {{satisfied}} that Evelyn feared she had blundered, {{though she could}} not see how. Her heart beat fast and her nerves were tensely strung, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> must be calm. The man was her antagonist and she was fighting in the dark.|$|R
50|$|It {{seems that}} the blue glow sent out {{electromagnetic}} pulses that knocked out two satellites orbiting 20,000 miles above the Earth, and the Air Force wants to know what's going on. A battery of tests doesn't produce any answers, leaving the brass, led by Col. Roger Tennent and Major Samuel Harbeck, to debate whether Butler is an alien or an angel—someone to be dissected or to be worshipped. Warren doesn't know what Josh is either, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> doesn't trust the soldiers {{to make the right}} choice. This prompts her to try to save the recluse. The episode ends with Josh ascending back to his home while Judy chooses to destroy this information rather than divulge it.|$|R
60|$|In fact, {{during the}} latter part of August she {{wondered}} a good deal more about the Natchas than about Dr. Mitchell. But wondering about the Natchas would not help her. <b>She</b> felt, if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> where they were, <b>she</b> would fly to them. <b>But</b> then <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't.|$|R
