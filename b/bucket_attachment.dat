This thesis {{studies the}} concept of finite element method and its {{application}} to the <b>Bucket</b> <b>attachment</b> for excavator design. In fact, {{the purpose of this}} thesis was to find a new way for designing an excavator, which is more efficient from the economic and mechanical point of view. The present review provides brief information about the <b>Bucket</b> <b>attachment</b> for an excavator. The use of Hradox- 400 material instead of Steel ASAI C 2010 in the <b>Bucket</b> <b>Attachment</b> for the Excavator can increase the volumetric capacity of the bucket and make it lighter. As the present mechanism used in <b>Bucket</b> <b>attachment</b> for excavator is subjected to torsional and bending stresses, so it is necessary to design a new mechanism. The finite element method was used to find out the optimized design solution. SOLIDWORKS 2013 Software was used for CAD design. Finite Element Methodology was used to find out dynamic fatigue failure of excavator arm mechanism design using SIMWISE 4 D software for different material properties. Finite Element Methodology vi increased the productivity of <b>Bucket</b> <b>attachment</b> for excavator mechanism design, helped to conceptualize the product, reduced time required to design and analysis. The results of this thesis are stress; strain and displacement of the final geometry of the Hardox- 400 for arm and boom are lower than max stress and strain. In addition, the attach how can make the weight of the stick and boom lighter than steel. Although the costs of mechanical components made of Hardox- 400 are more expensive than those made of steel, {{the results of this study}} clearly reveal the benefit of the increased capacity of the excavator outweighs the initial cost problem in the end.

50|$|Manual: The {{operation}} {{of this type}} is done, usually {{by the use of}} tools, at the coupler itself. The operator needs to leave the operator's station (usually the cab) to go {{to the end of the}} work equipment in order to effect the release of a <b>bucket</b> or <b>attachment,</b> and to do the same in order to attach the next <b>bucket</b> or <b>attachment</b> to be used.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} quick couplers. The initial divergence is between those that can pick up any of a range of <b>buckets</b> and <b>attachments</b> by clamping onto the mounting pins for the attachment (known as [...] "pin grabbers" [...] or [...] "pin couplers") and those that work only with <b>buckets</b> and <b>attachments</b> designed to suit that quick coupler (known as [...] "dedicated"). The claimed advantage of pin-grabbers is flexibility in use in that a machine owner can use a variety of <b>buckets</b> and <b>attachments</b> without changing the quick coupler or buying an adaptor. The claimed advantages of dedicated couplers depend on their individual design but often include better performance and smaller size.|$|R
50|$|Semi-automatic: With {{this type}} the {{hydraulic}} {{system of the}} machine is used to operate the main attachment mechanism but the manual operation of a safety device is necessary at the coupler itself {{to ensure that the}} <b>bucket</b> or <b>attachment</b> is safely locked onto the coupler. The safety device is intended to prevent the release of the <b>bucket</b> or <b>attachment</b> in the event of the failure of the hydraulic system, or other major failure of the attachment mechanism. The safety device is most commonly a pin that must be inserted to prevent one of the components in the quick coupler moving to release the <b>bucket</b> or <b>attachment</b> but some designs require the manual operation of a lever on the quick coupler.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} {{operation}} (the picking up and releasing of <b>buckets</b> and <b>attachments)</b> causes the next divergence in design. The types {{can be described as}} manual, semi-automatic, and automatic.|$|R
50|$|Automatic: This type use the {{hydraulic}} {{system of the}} machine to operate the main attachment mechanism and have an internal safety device. As with semi-automatic systems the safety device is designed to prevent {{the release of the}} <b>bucket</b> or <b>attachment</b> {{in the event of a}} failure of {{the hydraulic}} system.|$|R
50|$|Quick {{couplers}} (also called quick hitches) {{are used}} with construction machines {{to allow the}} rapid change of <b>buckets</b> and <b>attachments</b> on the machine. They remove the need to use hammers to manually drive out and insert the mounting pins for attachments. They also bring with them additional safety risks that must be overcome by careful design and manufacture, and proper use.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{bucket of}} many skid loaders {{can be replaced}} {{with a variety of}} specialized <b>buckets</b> or <b>attachments,</b> many powered by the loader's hydraulic system. These include backhoe, hydraulic breaker, pallet forks, angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, stump grinder, tree spade, trencher, dumping hopper, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine.|$|R
25|$|A crusher <b>bucket</b> is an <b>attachment</b> for {{hydraulic}} excavators. Its way {{of working}} consists on a bucket with two crushing jaws inside, {{one of them is}} fixed and the other one moves back and forth relative to it, as in a Jaw crusher.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Pelton {{wheel is}} the only {{hydraulic}} turbine of the impulse type in common use, is named after an American engineer Laster A Pelton, who contributed much to its development around the year 1880. Therefore this machine is known as Pelton turbine or Pelton wheel. It is an efficient machine particularly suited to high heads, many modifications is being suggested up to now the major modification was near 1903 after that no major modification is being implemented. The author in this paper with his noble and native concept tried {{to increase the efficiency}} of the turbine with the modification in the blade and with some auxiliary attachments which will lead to less wastage of the head and result in better efficiency.

30|$|Most {{excavators}} used at {{construction sites}} {{are equipped with}} buckets. However, certain tasks cannot be performed using only these <b>buckets.</b> Thus, <b>attachments</b> with various functions, such as breakers and crushers, {{have been developed to}} expand the range of tasks that excavators can perform. Among them, breakers are equipment developed to demolish targets by repetitive impact. Although a variety of studies have been conducted to analyze and improve the dynamic behavior of impact devices with hydraulic systems, no study has so far provided a practically realizable design that can be applied to real systems (Noh et al. 2014 a, b; Seo et al. 2015). A hydraulic impact device such as a breaker is dominated by the repulsive properties of the impact target. It is difficult to simulate their dynamic behavior because of high nonlinearity (Oh et al. 2011). Although previous researchers have developed analysis models to predict the dynamic behavior, these models have large errors associated with supply pressure when compared with actual measurements. Because detailed pressure waveforms are highly sensitive to impact target characteristics, errors are generated; consequently, the pulsation amplification characteristics of the supply pressure that include the overall behavior of the breaker should be similar to actual measurements (Shin and Kwon 2011). Let us assume that a sensitivity analysis of the variables is carried out and optimum designs are obtained by utilizing an analysis model whose pulsation amplitudes of the supply pressure are completely different from the measured values. If a prototype is manufactured according to designs that are obtained as described above, it is not likely to meet the expected performance.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{was prepared}} {{in an effort}} to assist utility companies, electrical contractors, manufacturers of aerial bucket trucks and hydraulic impact tools, insurers of these companies, electrical lineman, and maintenance personnel in avoiding the hazards of using metal reinforced hoses on aerial bucket trucks near energized power lines. The case of a 37 year old electrical lineman who died when he jumped from a burning aerial bucket and fell 35 feet to the ground was reviewed. At the time of the accident the lineman was sagging the center phase of a three phase, 12, 400 volt energized power line. A metal reinforced, rubber hydraulic hose was attached to an impact wrench the lineman was using. The hose simultaneously contacted two phases of the line, and the heat generated caused the hose to melt and rupture. The hydraulic fluid from the ruptured hose ignited on contact with the power line and the bucket became engulfed in flames. He attempted to jump to safety, but caught his foot {{on the side of the}} bucket and fell on his head and chest. NIOSH recommends that employers remove any metal reinforced hoses currently installed on any part of the boom, aerial <b>bucket</b> or hydraulic <b>attachments</b> of aerial <b>bucket</b> trucks used to work near energized power lines.
