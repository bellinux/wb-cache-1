50|$|Bridging {{the fields}} of {{microbiology}} and immunology, Casadevall’s research is focused on fungal and bacterial pathogenesis and <b>basic</b> <b>immunology</b> of antibody structure-function. He has defined {{much of what is}} known about fungal pathogenesis and how fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans evade the host immune response. Fungal infections are particularly dangerous in immunocompromised individuals such as cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, making this work highly significant. With his collaborator Dr. Ekaterina (Kate) Dadachova, he pioneered the use of radioimmunotherapeutic strategies for the control of systemic fungal and other infections. During the course of his studies, he noted that certain fungi were radioresistant and worked to develop novel therapeutic strategies for a variety of human diseases including melanoma and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. He holds several active patents on these approaches.|$|E
