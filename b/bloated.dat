5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as <b>bloated</b> and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} the Flood, a parasitic alien life form {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form of the Flood, are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. <b>Bloated</b> Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a <b>bloated</b> E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{concept of}} “bloat ” in Genetic Programming is a {{well-established}} phenomenon characterized by variable-length genomes gradually increasing in size during evolution [1]. <b>Bloat</b> hampers {{the efficiency and}} ability of genetic programming for solving problems. A range of explanations have been proposed for the problem of <b>bloat,</b> including destructive crossover and mutation operators, selection pressure and individual representation. Different methods to avoid <b>bloat</b> and to control <b>bloat</b> have been proposed by researchers. This paper proposes a theoretical analysis of code <b>bloating</b> problem and the discussion on the work already done by various authors to handle <b>bloat</b> in genetic programming...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was <b>bloated</b> and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was <b>bloated</b> and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E

50|$|Ruminal tympany, {{also known}} as <b>bloat,</b> is a disease of {{ruminant}} animals, characterized by an excessive volume of gas in the rumen. Ruminal tympany may be primary, known as frothy <b>bloat,</b> or secondary, known as free-gas <b>bloat.</b>|$|R
40|$|In large {{flexible}} software systems, <b>bloat</b> {{occurs in}} many forms, causing excess resource utilization and resource bottlenecks. This results in lost throughput and wasted joules. However, mitigating <b>bloat</b> is not easy; efforts are best applied where savings would be substantial. To aid this we develop an analytical model establishing {{the relation between}} bottleneck in resources, <b>bloat,</b> performance and power. Analyses with the model places into perspective results from the first experimental study of the powerperformance implications of <b>bloat.</b> In the experiments we find that while <b>bloat</b> reduction can provide as much as 40 % energy savings, the degree of impact depends on hardware and software characteristics. We confirm predictions from our model with selected results from our experimental study. Our findings show that a software-only view is inadequate when assessing the effects of <b>bloat.</b> The impact of <b>bloat</b> on physical resource usage and power should be understood for a full systems perspective to properly deploy <b>bloat</b> reduction solutions and reap their power-performance benefits. 1...|$|R
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as <b>bloated</b> in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E

Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with <b>bloated</b> bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become <b>bloated</b> with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming <b>bloated,</b> causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the <b>bloated</b> armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>bloating</b> is a fastidious symptom {{reported}} by many patients {{who also have}} other gastrointestinal functional disorders. <b>Bloating</b> {{is more common in}} women, and it is often associated with meals and improves or disappears overnight. No specific treatments are to date available for this disturbing symptom. Aims: to evaluate the effects of an oral enterovaccine (Colifagina®) on <b>bloating</b> and other abdominal symptoms in patients with prevalent complaints of functional <b>bloating.</b> Patients and methods: one hundred and forty-eight patients with functional <b>bloating</b> according to Rome III criteria were recruited. Questionnaires and a VAS scale on their symptoms were administered at baseline and after four weeks of therapy with Colifagina®. Results: after treatment, a significant amelioration of <b>bloating</b> (p < 0. 0001), abdominal pain (p < 0. 0001) and flatus (p < 0. 0001) was observed; nausea and vomiting scores were not significantly different {{at the end of the}} treatment. Subjective wellbeing was also generally improved (p < 0. 001) in treated patients.
