25|$|The Aleppo Codex leaves two empty {{lines between}} the five Books of Psalms (following psalms 41, 72, 89, 106). Otherwise {{there is one}} <b>blank</b> <b>line</b> between each two psalms, the {{standard}} way of indicating an open parashah break {P} in poetic layout.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{break at}} all, however, between psalms 114-115, which were {{apparently}} considered a single psalm by the scribes. Psalm 119, which has sets of eight verses for each {{letter of the}} Hebrew alphabet, has an open parashah break (a <b>blank</b> <b>line)</b> between each set of eight verses.|$|E
25|$|In poetic layout, parashah {{divisions}} are typically indicated by a <b>blank</b> <b>line</b> {{for an open}} parashah. The gaps {{in the middle of}} lines are not considered parashah divisions, and each scribe formatted the verses as he saw fit for aesthetic and practical reasons. An exception to this rule, however, is for the introductory titles of many individual psalms which are followed by formal parashah breaks, often by continuing the text {{at the beginning of the}} next line. These formal breaks will be indicated in the list of parashot for Psalms.|$|E

2500|$|An [...] "open portion" [...] always {{started at}} the {{beginning}} of a new line. This could happen the way described above, but also by leaving a <b>blank</b> <b>line</b> between the two portions, thus allowing the previous portion to sometimes entirely fill its last line of text.|$|E

2500|$|Most printed Hebrew bibles today {{represent}} the parashot using the more limited techniques found in typical modern Torah scrolls: A {{space in the}} middle of a line for a closed portion, and beginning [...] at the start of the next line for an open portion (not a <b>blank</b> <b>line).</b> A notable exception is The Jerusalem Crown (The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2000), whose typography and layout is fashioned after the Aleppo Codex, and follows the medieval spacing techniques for parashah divisions by leaving an empty line for {P} and starts {S} on a new line with an indentation.|$|E

On at least one singles chart for the period, TOP 20 POPS, the song's position at No. 2 is represented by a <b>blank</b> <b>line.</b> It did reach No. 1 on the unofficial NME singles chart. It was banned by the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority which regulated Independent Local Radio.|$|E
2500|$|This {{sentence}} is built from two quotations from the Bible, specifically from the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah 30:7, [...] "For {{the help of}} Egypt shall be (הבלוריק) vain and empty ..."; and Isaiah 45:20. [...] "... No foreknowledge had they who carry their wooden images (וּמתפּלליםאל־אללאיוֹשׁיע) and pray to a God who cannot give success." [...] (New JPS) The line is still set out in full in Sephardi and Italian prayer books, but was omitted {{in most of the}} older printed Ashkenazi prayer books. In some older editions of other rites (e.g., the Maḥzor Aram Soba, 1560) a <b>blank</b> <b>line</b> was left in the printing, leaving it free for the missing line to be filled in handwriting. In many current Orthodox Jewish siddurim (prayer books) this line has been restored, and the practice of reciting it has increased.|$|E

He wanted a number of references to verify the Ranger report he had to turn in to Captain Neal. This precaution he took so as to place in Neal's hands all the evidence needed to convince Governor Smith. And now, as Steele returned to us and entered the stage, he spoke of this report. [...] "It's the longest and the best I ever turned in," [...] he said, with a gray flame in his eyes. [...] "I shan't let Russ read it. He's peevish because I want his part put on record.

30|$|Upon {{presentation}} {{of these groups}} of skills to the SMEs, additional feedback collection was also started. The feedback expected was {{in the form of}} comments against each skill, listed by group. SME feedback obtained included <b>blank</b> <b>lines</b> (no comments) and explicit comments grouping specific skills together. <b>Blank</b> <b>lines</b> (i.e., no comment) may be assumed as approval. However, given that SMEs had to parse 1351 skills and group numbers, <b>blank</b> <b>lines</b> may also reflect the case of partial feedback for the most obvious of skill groupings that were apparent to the SME. For the purpose of this paper, only skills accompanied with explicit feedback on their groupings (i.e., fungible) with other skills are considered for evaluation. Their comments were manually parsed and a set of 19 groups of skills (about 71 in total) were obtained. With this additional data, we could once again evaluate LINSUM against PCA {{as well as the other}} methods. The aforementioned skill groups constituted the exemplars against which different methods were evaluated. The LINSUM deployment process is shown in Fig.  6.|$|R
