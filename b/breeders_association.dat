5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising the Jack Russell terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as {{they did not want}} the breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association</b> formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association</b> renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 a Large Black sow was Supreme Champion at Smithfield (UK), {{and at the}} Royal Show {{that year}} 121 Large Blacks were entered, {{more than any other}} breed. Popularity of the breed peaked in the 1920s, however, and after World War II, {{population}} numbers declined as farmers began to favour pig breeds that would do well in intensive indoor farming. The breed association was merged with the National Pig <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association</b> (later the British Pig Association) in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Cavy {{clubs and}} {{associations}} {{dedicated to the}} showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide.

5|$|Jacobs {{were first}} {{exported}} to North America {{in the early}} 20th century. Some individuals acquired them from zoos in the 1960s and 1970s, but the breed remained rare in America until the 1980s; registration began in 1985. The first North American association for the breed, the Jacob Sheep <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association,</b> was established in 1989. The Jacob was introduced to Israel in 2016, when a small flock of about 120 head was shipped there from Canada by a couple who believes the breed {{is the same one}} mentioned in Genesis.|$|E
5|$|The Associacion Mexicana de Criadores de Caballos de Raza Azteca, or Mexican <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association</b> for the Azteca Horse, is the {{original}} breed registry and still maintains the international registry.

The majority of Aztecas are found in Mexico, and the Mexican association had registered between 10,000 and 15,000 horses as of 2005, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture. The Mexican registry adds approximately 1,000 horses per year.|$|E

For example, Thoroughbred crosses were freely registrable in NQHBA, and they even registered Thoroughbreds.|$|E

500|$|The American Saddlebred Horse Association {{was formed}} in 1891, then called the National Saddle Horse <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association</b> (NSHBA). Private {{individuals}} had produced studbooks for other breeds, such as the Morgan, as early as 1857, but the NSHBA was the first national association for an American-developed breed of horse. A member of Morgan's Raiders, General John Breckinridge Castleman, was instrumental in forming the NSHBA.

500|$|By 1880, through {{exports and}} war casualties, Canadian horses had almost become extinct. In 1885, the Canadian Horse <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association</b> {{was formed to}} inspect and approve {{breeding}} stock {{with the aim of}} creating a studbook for the breed, and in 1886, further export from Canada was forbidden by Quebec law. In 1913, an experimental breeding program was begun at Cap-Rouge by the Canadian government. The program's goal was to breed larger horses that retained the endurance and vitality for which the breed was known, and succeeded in increasing the size of stallions to [...] high and [...] in weight, with mares slightly smaller. However, mechanization, combined with World War I and World War II, ended the federal breeding program, and in 1940 all breeding stock was sold at auction. However, the province of Quebec re-established the program at Deschambault. The program lasted there until 1979, when the herd was again disbanded and sold at auction.|$|E
500|$|Breed {{organizations}} {{exist in}} many countries to provide accurate documentation of Haflinger pedigrees and ownership, and to promote the Haflinger breed. Most are linked to each other through membership in the World Haflinger Federation (WHF), established in 1976. The WHF establishes international breeding guidelines, objectives and rules for studbook selection and performance tests. They also authorize European and World Shows and compile an annual list of Haflinger experts, or adjudicators. The WHF is the international umbrella organization, with 21memberorganizations in 22countries. [...] Membership organizations include the Haflinger Horse Society of Australia, the Australian Haflinger Horse <b>Breeders</b> <b>Association,</b> the Canadian Haflinger Association, the Haflinger Pferdezuchtverband Tirol (Tyrolean Haflinger Breeding Association), the Italian Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Cavalli di Razza Haflinger Italia and the American Haflinger Registry, {{as well as a}} division for breeders in countries that are not already members. National organizations are allowed to become members of the WHF through agreeing to promote pure breeding and maintain the hereditary characteristics of the Haflinger breed. Member organizations must maintain both a purebred studbook and a separate part-bred studbook for animals with Arabian or other bloodlines.|$|E
50|$|Breeds {{of animals}} of a {{particular}} species may have an organization that covers {{a large number of}} breeds of the species, even though each individual breed may have its own breed club. Often the multiple-breed over-association will maintain the breed records in a central location. An example of this would be the Canadian Sheep <b>Breeder's</b> <b>Association,</b> incorporated under the Canadian Livestock Pedigree Act in 1915, which includes fifty different breeds of sheep.|$|R
50|$|In 1850, the Canadian Parliament {{discovered}} {{that the vast majority}} of cattle in Quebec were Canadienne, so they began to discourage its breeding and soon the breed received competition from other breeds. In 1886, a couple of men created a herd book; the French Canadian Cattle <b>Breeder's</b> <b>Association</b> was formed in 1895 to prevent the breed from becoming extinct. The breed later gained recognition in 1901 for being the most profitable dairy breed in the Pan-American show in Buffalo, New York.|$|R
50|$|The Oberhasli is {{a modern}} American breed of dairy goat. It derives from the subtype of Chamois Colored Goat from the Oberhasli {{district}} of the Bernese Oberland in central Switzerland. All purebred members of the breed descend from five Chamois Colored Goats imported to the United States in 1936. A <b>breeder's</b> <b>association</b> was formed in 1977, and a herdbook established in the following year. Until then, goats of this type had been known as Swiss Alpine, and interbred with Alpine goats of other types.|$|R
