2500|$|Marcus Allen – British {{publisher}} of Nexus, who said {{photographs of the}} lander would not prove that the United States put men on the Moon, and [...] "Getting to the Moon really isn't {{much of a problem}} – the Russians did that in 1959. The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> getting people there." [...] He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because radiation levels in outer space would be deadly. Another variant on this is the idea that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the Apollo 1 fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with Apollos 14 or 15 being the first real mission.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{fundamental}} flaw of 'War Horse' is that Nick Stafford, {{who wrote}} the script 'in association' (that's how the credit reads) with South Africa's Handspring Puppet Company, has taken a book that was written for children and tried {{to give it the}} expressive weight of a play for adults. Not surprisingly, Mr. Morpurgo's plot can't stand the strain. Dramatic situations that work perfectly well {{in the context of the}} book play like Hollywood clichés onstage. In the first act, the craftsmanship is so exquisite that this doesn't matter—much—but things go downhill fast after intermission. The really <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the last scene, about which, once again, the drama critics' code commands silence. This much must be said, though: A play that is so forthright about the horrors of war owes its audience a more honest ending." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} About.com, Mark Edward Nero {{characterized}} the album as [...] "basically one by someone with the persona of a backup player who's been thrust in a lead role." [...] While he praised {{songs such as}} [...] "Work" [...] and [...] "Like This," [...] Nero felt that the album contained too many [...] "weak songs" [...] and that Rowland, [...] "although she may feel comfortable in the role, can't carry the full weight— just like Scottie Pippen never could with the [...] Bulls." [...] Dotmusics Jaime Gill called Ms. Kelly [...] "old-fashioned", writing that [...] "Rowland's <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that she has the lungs but not the voice [...] She can holler like Beyoncé, growl like Kelis or swoon like Aaliyah, but has little to no natural style of her own." [...] Ken Capobianco's review for The Boston Globe was more emphatic dubbing it [...] "a solid if somewhat safe set of grooves, but the album never takes full flight to become something special." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christopher R. Weingarten of The Village Voice {{wrote that}} Wayne's lyrics [...] "still walk some {{fascinating}} line between signifying unmistakable genius, curious savant, or total dick", but viewed the album as lacking substance, stating [...] "Wayne's <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{that he seems}} to like the idea of rock music more than any actual rock music itself". Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called Rebirth [...] "an unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album". Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo described it as [...] "a total misperception of what makes a rock record" [...] and found its sound [...] "mostly unrecognizable, a twisted amalgam of tacky set pieces collected from throughout the genre's history". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, [...] "Given that everyone knows Carter can do so much better than this, it all smacks a bit of condescension, of locating a different audience, then talking down to them". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] " [...] Jordan returned to the basketball court after one ill-fated season in the farm leagues; we can only hope for the same for Wayne".|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{order to}} raise money," [...] said Irene, slowly and {{more seriously than}} she had before spoken, [...] "it is {{necessary}} {{for us to go}} into business. The other day, when I was riding with Alora, I noticed that the store between the post-office and the Citizens' Bank is vacant, and a sign in the window said 'Apply to Peter Conant, Agent.' Peter Conant being my uncle, I applied to him that evening after dinner, on behalf of the Liberty Girls. It's one of the best locations in town and right {{in the heart of the}} business district. The store has commanded a big rental, but in these times it is not in demand and it has been vacant for the last six months, with no prospect of its being rented. Girls, Peter Conant will allow us to use this store room without charge until someone is willing to pay the proper rent for it, and so the first <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved. Three cheers for Uncle Peter!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Malayalam and Tamil {{versions}} opened simultaneously on 10 October 2014 to mixed reviews. A critic from The Hindu concluded, [...] "It’s a weird {{love story}} and a crime thriller — and its <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that it can’t balance both".|$|E

50|$|The {{deforestation}} <b>is</b> a <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in {{this department}} {{because of the}} continuous advance of the human activity, creating a great shock to the natural resources of the region.

50|$|Much of {{the coral}} in the reefs just {{offshore}} is slowly disappearing, due to inexperienced divers being taken out in big numbers. Another <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that in Masbat local restaurants are dumping sand and rock {{into the sea}} to extend the shoreline, again causing disruption to local coral reefs.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of {{unemployment}} in 2008, Spriggs said, [...] "The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{that are not}} hiring[...] [...] And {{the first set of}} folks that they’re not hiring, of course, is us blacks[...] [...] [...] America is like a train and we’re the caboose.

5000|$|... "The {{idea that}} women are in any way {{inferior}} {{when it comes to}} doing physics or mathematics is a complete myth. Unfortunately, a <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that not all the great achievements made by the women physicists of the last century were properly recognised. But that has and will continue to change as more and more women are recognised for their contributions to science." ...|$|E
5000|$|Uncleanliness {{and illegal}} shops <b>are</b> the major <b>problems</b> of Model Town. One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>was</b> the damaged Kahuta/Sehala road.

50|$|MPD {{thruster}} {{technology has}} been explored academically, but commercial interest has been low due to several remaining problems. One <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that power requirements {{on the order of}} hundreds of kilowatts are required for optimum performance. Current interplanetary spacecraft power systems (such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators and solar arrays) are incapable of producing that much power. NASA's Project Prometheus reactor was expected to generate power in the hundreds of kilowatts range but was discontinued in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{that this}} cannot be done {{until they have}} a place to stay. Then comes Babbu (Babbal Rai), friend of Palli, to their rescue. It does not last long because of their parting one night. They have to look for another shelter. According to their budget, they are getting places that will only allow married couples to stay. So they lie about their marital status — somehow Palli and Jass {{convince}} Babu and Deputy to play their wives to get a roof over their heads.|$|E

50|$|One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> the {{inferior}} level of economy diversification they have. In 2008, they depended largely on services (45.2%), industry (52.9%) and agriculture (1.9%) strictly {{linked to the}} trade with South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Untener also {{organized}} {{a series of}} preaching seminars for priests. At the 1993 National Conference of Bishops, Untener reportedly interrupted the proceedings by commenting on how many people felt bored during Mass. Untener told a reporter, [...] "They {{were talking about the}} niceties of phrases - debating whether `prince' or `ruler' was a better word to use in the lectionary..." [...] Untener stood up and shouted, [...] "The <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> not whether we use `prince' or `ruler.' The <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the Mass is boring for most people." [...] Untener encouraged priests to stick to one point in their homilies and to keep their talks at seven minutes or less.|$|R
5000|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review, criticizing the case-of-the-week while praising the subplots. [...] "The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the case…is too transparent. The {{nature of her}} boyfriend was expectedly twisty, but it was largely irrelevant." [...] However, he lauded the {{development}} of the Fennels. [...] "The Alicia Fennel subplot, which I was dubious about when introduced, may still be problematic, but it did give us more time with Keith Mars in a variety of different moods…and the twist at the end…was not one I expected, so kudos on that.|$|E
50|$|As {{it can be}} {{seen from}} the table, the main {{polluted}} river with most sewage waters flows on it is Prishtevka. It can be said that Prishtevka has turned into a river flow of sewage waters, withmore than 400,000 inhabitants polluting it. Another <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> with sewage waters that are present in Taukbashçe Park, which besides the fact that they are polluted and are part of the park, they also smell horrible for people who visit the park. This may cause health problem to people, given the fact that elderly people are those that visit this park mostly.|$|E
50|$|Each canton FA organizes its own cup, held in Fall {{through early}} summer {{next year and}} each canton has two berths in Federation Cup. That makes 20 teams. Then, 20 teams are drawn to make 10 matchups of the final, which are played over one leg in late August or early September. Winners (10) qualify to {{national}} cup. <b>Big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> lack of interest at both clubs and cantonal FAs so Federation Cup never had 20 teams - {{if there are no}} 20 teams, some teams, depending on draw, get bye to national cup.Competition has no winner although it only stage is called final.|$|E

5000|$|Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) {{finds himself}} in a tricky situation. Locked in his {{creative}} process, he is entrapped in a disastrous economic situation: he is ruined, and he must repay a US$100,000 debt to the Cuban mafia. He is given a 30-day ultimatum to repay the money he owes them or they will kill him. And the only solution to this <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to finish his novel. Or rather, to start it, since he has not written one single line. But he has an idea for the story: A comedy about [...] "the powerlessness of being in love, how love devours the insides of a person like a deadly virus".|$|E

5000|$|Reginald [...] "Reggie" [...] Perrin (Martin Clunes)—Reggie {{is a man}} {{finding it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to put up with the monotony of life, a disappointing marriage, a boring office life and the daily commute. The appearance of Jasmine, a rather attractive new colleague, isn't helping his sanity. Slowly but surely, Reggie is falling to bits. He is now starting to imagine doing things that one shouldn't do in polite society (for example, shooting a boring house guest), and the <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> he is starting to vocalise some of these thoughts.
