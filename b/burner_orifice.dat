40|$|For {{prediction}} of incident radiative heat fluxes on the furnace {{walls of a}} boiler, {{one of the most}} accurate radiation models, the zone method of analysis, has been employed to analyze radiative heat transfer in the freeboard of large pulverized fuel utility boilers. By using this model, the behavior of the temperature and heat flux within the furnace and on the heat surfaces is investigated. The existing formula for the velocity field of a turbulent jet exit from the <b>burner</b> <b>orifice</b> is used to model the velocity field of the combusted fuel from the burner. Comparing model’s predictions with experimental measured radiative fluxes on the walls showed the accuracy of the method...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{effects of}} burner {{configurations}} {{on the natural}} oscillations of methane laminar diffusion flames under atmospheric pressure and normal gravity conditions have been studied experimentally. Three regimes of laminar diffusion flames, namely, steady, intermittent flickering and continuous flickering have been investigated. Burner configurations such as straight pipe, contoured nozzle and that having an orifice plate at the exit have been considered. All burners have the same area of cross section at the exit and same burner lip thickness. Flame height data has been extracted from direct flame video using MATLAB. Shadowgraph videos have been captured to analyze the plume width characteristics. Results show that, the oscillation characteristics of the <b>orifice</b> <b>burner</b> is {{significantly different from the}} other two burners; <b>orifice</b> <b>burner</b> produces a shorter flame and wider thermal plume width in the steady flame regime and the onset of the oscillation/flickering regimes for the <b>orifice</b> <b>burner</b> occurs at a higher fuel flow rate. In the natural flickering regime, the dominating frequency of flame flickering remains within a small range, 12. 5 Hz to 15 Hz, for all the burners and for all fuel flow rates. The time-averaged flame length-scale parameters, such as the maximum and the minimum flame heights, increase with respect to the fuel flow rate, however, the difference in the maximum and the minimum flame heights remains almost constant...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} higher energy {{efficiency}} of industrial scale burners to obtain low emission especially Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) has demanded experimental studies that are complemented with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Active and passive emission control methods are common techniques in controlling emission. However, {{the aim of this}} research is focused on the passive control techniques with a specifically modification on <b>burner</b> <b>orifice’s</b> geometry and different fuel properties are used to study the prediction of combustion modeling. Prediction is based on the nozzle orifice flow behaviour and spray characteristics as well as fuel-air mixture formation in mixing chamber through ANSYS FLUENT simulation. Multiphase of Volume of Fluid (VOF) and turbulence model of Transition Shear Stress Transport (SST) are used throughout whole simulation analysis. Other than that, Eulerian-Lagragian multiphase approach is used for the steady simulations and spray generation. Furthermore, experimental spray droplets sizes at selected locations from nozzle outlet are taken by direct photography method and validated with the simulated droplets size. The rapid mixing region is predicted at the area near to fuel and air inlet. Besides, the cavitation, spray dispersion and Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) are predicted increased when L/D dropped from 2. 5 to 1. 667. Furthermore, cavitation is predicted reduced but spray dispersion and SMD increased when orifice coefficient increased from K = 0 to K = 20. Meanwhile, high viscosity and density of Crude palm oil (CPO) biodiesel blends is believed to cause high cavitation inside orifice, wider spray dispersion and high SMD...|$|R
5000|$|The Thermal Valve Model, Type F, of the Ruud Instantaneous Automatic Water Heater is {{a design}} that allows the user to instantaneously heat water for on demand {{applications}} while not heating, thus saving fuel, when not in use. The Type F {{was able to use}} LP gas, natural gas, and gasoline, requiring only a change of <b>burner</b> spud <b>orifices,</b> and was manufactured in two variations, the [...] "Standard Pressure Heaters," [...] designed to operate in conditions where pressure was at least twenty-five pounds per square inch (1.7 bar), and [...] "Low Pressure Heaters," [...] where operational water pressure could be as low as four pounds per square inch (0.3 bar). Thermal Valve Model, Type F heaters were manufactured in four residential sizes reflective of their output in gallons per minute: 3, 4, 6, 8.In 1915, there were approximately one-hundred-thousand of the Type F installed throughout The United States and Canada.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} applications of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is its use in IC engines, particularly for automotive applications, {{as it is known}} to be a clean source of energy. Even though it is already being used in IC engines, the fundamental combustion properties such as laminar burning velocities, which is a physicochemical property of a fuel, is still not very well established, which can act as a basic input for engine modeling. The present work utilizes a few standard methods of flame speed measurement known from the literature to obtain the flame speed of LPG-air and LPG-air-diluent mixtures as a function of air-fuel ratio and diluent concentration. Variation of burning velocity obtained by two different experimental techniques, that is, <b>orifice</b> <b>burner</b> and cylindrical tube method for a mixture of LPG-air and diluent mixtures at different air fuel ratios is quantified. CO 2 is selected as a diluent to account for the presence of exhaust gases in the fresh charge as a consequence of exhaust gas recirculation. It was found that there is effect on burning velocity with the variation of effects of diluents on the burning velocities have been found to cause performance problems for combustion appliances using these types of fuel gases...|$|R
40|$|Malaysian {{agriculture}} industries produce {{large amount}} of biomass residue every year. Oil palm solid waste, rice husk, coconut shell and sawdust from wood are being disposed in an uncontrolled manner presently. Alternatively, this biomass {{can be used to}} produce energy by controlled combustion system or gasification process. This process produces producer gas that could generate electrical or mechanical energy. Pressurized induced flow was utilized in a downdraft gasifier with low emission burner. In this research, downdraft gasifier was coupled together with an air ejector, orifice cylinder and gas burner. Palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) shell and coal were used as feed. The solid feeds were combusted at a controlled condition inside the gasifier. Primary compressed air was supplied to assist the process. The process produced producer gas, which was consisted of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Producer gas flowed out from the gasifier to the orifice cylinder and gas burner to re-burn again. Secondary compressed air was supplied to the gas burner through an air ejector to assist the burning process. This ejector also acted as an induced flow. High pressure and high velocity air streaming through the ejector caused pressure inside of the gas burner to drop. This situation allowed producer gas inside of gasifier, which was at a higher pressure to flow into the gas <b>burner.</b> The <b>orifice</b> cylinderâ€™s function was to enhance the air-fuel ratio mixture before it was being burnt. Air ejector configuration was carried out using computer simulation software, FLUENT 5. 3. Five orifice cylinders with the diameters of 60, 70, 80, 100 and 120 mm were simulated to investigate the profile of gas flow mixing. From the simulation, orifice cylinders with 60 and 70 mm diameter produced choked gas flow. Thus, only orifice cylinder with 80, 100 and 120 mm diameters were tested in the experiment. Secondary air pressure supplied was varied from 0. 5 to 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 bar to obtain the emission level. From the experiment by using palm oil shell as feed based, and at 2. 5 bar secondary air pressure supplied, it was found that orifice cylinder with 80 mm diameter produced 53...|$|R
