5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules. The Cl–Cl {{distance is}} 198pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332pm within a layer and 382pm <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180pm). This structure means that chlorine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable.|$|E
5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules. The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm). This structure means that bromine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 just below the melting point, although this {{is better than the}} essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E

5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCell sheet {{engineering}} allows investigators/clinicians {{to prepare}} cell-dense three-dimensional (3 -D) tissues, and various clinical trials with these fabricated tissues {{have already been}} performed for regenerating damaged tissues. Cell sheets are easily manipulated and 3 -D tissues can be rapidly fabricated by layering the cell sheets. This study used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to noninvasively analyze the following processes: (1) adhesions <b>between</b> <b>layered</b> cell sheets, and (2) the beating and functional interaction of cardiac cell sheet-tissues for fabricating functional thicker 3 -D tissues. The tight adhesions and functional couplings <b>between</b> <b>layered</b> cell sheets could be observed cross-sectionally and in real time. Importantly, the noninvasive and cross-sectional analyses of OCT make possible to fabricate 3 -D tissues by confirming the adherence and functional couplings <b>between</b> <b>layered</b> cell sheets.

25|$|To prevent {{frustration}} with unsensed failures, all the connections <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> in the switch are allocated using first-in-first-out lists (queues).

25|$|Anhydrous chromium(III) {{chloride}} adopts the YCl3 structure, with Cr3+ occupying {{two thirds}} of the octahedral interstices in alternating layers of a pseudo-cubic close packed lattice of Cl− ions. The absence of cations in alternate layers leads to weak bonding between adjacent layers. For this reason, crystals of CrCl3 cleave easily along the planes <b>between</b> <b>layers,</b> which results in the flaky (micaceous) appearance of samples of chromium(III) chloride.|$|E

40|$|We study current-driven {{magnetization}} switching in nanofabricated magnetic trilayers, {{varying the}} magnetoresistance {{in three different}} ways. First, we insert a strongly spin-scattering <b>layer</b> <b>between</b> the magnetic trilayer {{and one of the}} electrodes, giving increased magnetoresistance. Second, we insert a spacer with a short spin-diffusion length <b>between</b> the magnetic <b>layers,</b> decreasing the magnetoresistance. Third, we vary the angle <b>between</b> <b>layer</b> magnetizations. In all cases, we find an approximately linear dependence between magnetoresistance and inverse switching current. We give a qualitative explanation for the observed behaviors, and suggest some ways in which the switching currents may be reduced. Comment: 3 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
25|$|Glaciers move, or flow, {{downhill}} due {{to gravity}} and the internal deformation of ice. Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50m (160ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50m causes plastic flow. At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds <b>between</b> <b>layers.</b> When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.|$|E

25|$|Lake {{and marine}} environments on Earth are {{favorable}} for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments {{they left behind}} are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary <b>between</b> <b>layers.</b> Variation <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> helps us to understand {{the sequence of events}} that formed the sedimentary rocks. The Mars Orbiter Camera found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors (alluvial fans) or in crater lakes (deltas). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay. More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.|$|E
