40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{information}} is available on the atmospheric corrosion of mild steel in the short, mid and even long term, but studies of the structure and morphology of corrosion layers are less abundant and generally deal with those formed in just a few years. The present study assesses the structure and morphology of corrosion product layers formed on mild steel after 13 years of exposure in five Spanish atmospheres of different types: rural, urban, industrial, and marine (mild and severe). The corrosion layers have been characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Long-term corrosion is seen to be more severe in the industrial and marine atmospheres, and less so in the rural and urban atmospheres. In all cases the corrosion rate is seen to decrease with exposure time, stabilising after the first 4 - 6 years of exposure. The most relevant aspects to be noted are: (a) the great compaction of the rust layers formed in the rural and urban atmospheres; (b) the formation of hematite and ferrihydrite phases (not commonly found) in the industrial and marine atmospheres, respectively; and (c) identification of the typical morphological structures of lepidocrocite (sandy crystals and flowery plates), goethite (cotton <b>balls</b> <b>structures),</b> and akaganeite (cotton <b>balls</b> <b>structures</b> and cigar-shaped crystals) ...|$|R

The design of well distributed <b>ball</b> <b>structures</b> has grown in importance in the last years, most of all in the field of sports, such as soccer. The current trend is directed mainly towards finding a fast ball that will give more dynamism to the game. In order to achieve a greater velocity of the ball during its movement it is important that it has not only an adequate distribution of panels, that give it a greater sphericity, but also that it has a structure that allows for a good distribution of the existing tension between the panels. Starting from an initial design, we define a process of readjustment of the panels in the ball cover, which will lead us to obtain optimal sphericity factors. Then, through a “twisting” process, we can add area to the surface without altering the sphericity factors, and solving the Missing Area Problem (or MAP). Finally, by redefining the final form of the panels, we propose tessellate strategies that will optimize the <b>ball’s</b> spherical <b>structure...</b>|$|R

With mutual passive motion of two sliced balls on the same one active axis, an omnidirectional motion can be achieved. The passive rotational axes of two sliced balls are inclined with 45 degree in two parallel planes, which are perpendicular to the active axis, to realize continuous contact with the ground. This wheeled mechanism also improves the wheel intensity to carry a heavy burden, which is a key problem for omnidirectional mechanism.

The ISCOM particles are perforated vesicles of very well-defined structures. We developed and implemented a novel (to our knowledge) modeling method based on Monte Carlo simulation integrations to describe the SAXS data. This approach {{is similar to the}} traditional modeling of SAXS data, in which a structure is assumed, the scattering intensity is calculated, and structural parameters are optimized by weighted least-squares methods when the model scattering intensity is fitted to the experimental data. SAXS data from plain ISCOM matrix particles in aqueous suspension, as well as those from complete ISCOMs (i. e., with an antigen (tetanus toxoid) incorporated) can be modeled as a polydisperse distribution of perforated bilayer vesicles with icosahedral, football, or tennis ball structures.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of large {{forces and the}} presence of errors due to dimensional coupling are significant challenges for multi-dimensional force sensors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an over-constrained six-dimensional force sensor based on a parallel mechanism of steel ball structures as a measurement module. The steel <b>ball</b> <b>structure</b> can be subject to rolling friction instead of sliding friction, thus reducing the influence of friction. However, because the structure can only withstand unidirectional pressure, the application of steel balls in a six-dimensional force sensor is difficult. Accordingly, a new design of the sensor measurement structure was designed in this study. The static equilibrium and displacement compatibility equations of the sensor prototype’s over-constrained structure were established to obtain the transformation function, from which the forces in the measurement branches of the proposed sensor were then analytically derived. The sensor’s measurement characteristics were then analysed through numerical examples. Finally, these measurement characteristics were confirmed through calibration and application experiments. The measurement accuracy of the proposed sensor was determined to be 1. 28 %, with a maximum coupling error of 1. 98 %, indicating that the proposed sensor successfully overcomes the issues related to steel ball structures and provides sufficient accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Fullerene {{research}} has advanced to elevated levels {{in a short}} period of time due to the unique chemical and physical properties of the caged molecule that have been utilized in numerous applications. Due to the spherical shape of the fullerene molecule which allows for a hollow cavity, encapsulation of atoms or small molecules can occur within the <b>ball</b> <b>structure.</b> This encapsulation creates an endohedral component that is limited from interacting with other molecules which creates potential of control over electronic information of the isolated molecule. Endohedral fullerenes have the potential as serving as the base unit in a quantum computer if control over global alignment is attained. Thus, by using the inherent self-assembling capabilities of some organic materials, ordered endohedral fullerenes can be achieved. This dissertation investigates the ability to use self-assembling strategies to obtain alignment which include ordering within a morphologically controlled copolymer matrix, forming a supramolecular polymer complex with cyclodextrin, and encapsulation within the helical wrap of polymer chains. The ultimate goal is to understand the dynamics that control association and orientation of varying fullerene-based molecules in each strategy in order to maximize control over the final alignment of endohedral elements.

However, the introduction of a third nonanatomic spherical condyle might prevent the joint from reaching full extension due to posterior soft tissue tightening. This study aimed to address these issues related to soft tissue tightening and full extension limitation. Methods: Biomechanical tests were performed on six cadaveric specimens of the entire lower extremities. The tri-condylar design was compared with a posterior cruciate sacrificing design of the same shape without the <b>ball</b> <b>structure.</b> Knee joint kinematics was measured, including the extension and flexion angles, the extension balance, and the extension gap. The test was repeated after release of the medial and lateral posterior intercondylar soft tissues at a safe distance from the popliteal artery and nerves.

The tri-condylar design showed an extension angle of – 11. 2 ± 5. 4 °, which was a significantly greater limitation than that obtained with the cruciate sacrificing design (– 3. 8 ± 4. 7 °; p= 0. 047).

By means of a photodissociation laser fluence dependence technique, binding energies of Nb x+ (x = 2 - 20), Co x+ (x = 4 - 20) and etc. were found to generally increase with cluster size. The desorption energies of Nb xN 2 + (x = 2 - 17) and Nb xCO+ (x = 2 - 10) also increase with cluster size with some oscillations similar to the size dependent reactivities of these clusters. Photodetachment studies revealed that electron affinities of copper clusters increase with cluster size with a sharp even/odd alternation.

40|$|Rat Kv 1. 4 {{potassium}} channels undergo rapid inactivation, {{which is}} {{mediated by the}} N-terminal structure of the polypeptide. This inactivation can be removed by N-terminal deletion of about 20 residues. However, more substantial deletion (e. g. 37 residues) restores inactivation suggesting a second inactivating domain [Kondoh et al. J Biol Chem 272 : 19333 - 19338, 1997]. Here we provide evidence that this inactivation shares all properties with N-type inactivation. Pore mutations, which are supposed to affect C-type inactivation, have no effect. In addition, the redox regulation of inactivation, which is typical for Kv 1. 4 channels, can be conferred to the inactivation of the deleted constructs by incorporation of an N-terminal cysteine residue. The most remarkable feature of this secondary inactivation is the existence of two components in the steady-state voltage dependence of inactivation. For mutant rKv 1. 4 2 - 37 about 90 % of the channels only activate when the holding membrane potential is more negative than about - 120 mV; the remaining 10 % show the typical threshold at - 60 mV.
