500|$|Roper {{was asked}} to {{demonstrate}} his 'self propeller' at the Charles River velodrome, a <b>banked</b> <b>concrete</b> bicycle racing track, where he first paced the racing cyclists, then raced professional rider Nat Butler, easily outpacing the bicyclists with timed laps at around 30mph (120.2sec/mile on the 1/3mile track). He was then encouraged to give a demonstration of maximum speed, and was timed at over 40mph, when a 'sudden pallor' was seen on his face, and his machine wobbled to a stop, Roper falling off his cycle. [...] He died at the track-side with his son Charles, of 'natural causes', at age 72.|$|E

50|$|The Motordrome itself {{underwent}} significant upgrades during 1933. The <b>banked</b> <b>concrete</b> {{motor racing circuit}} was demolished {{and replaced}} with a flat dirt track; this was not required by the agreement with the Association, and was simply because the surface, built in 1924, was no longer suitable for the higher powered vehicles which raced on it. In June 1933, the venue was renamed Olympic Park.|$|E
50|$|Dick Lane Velodrome, {{constructed}} in 1974, is a bicycle racing facility {{inspired by a}} group of residents and City officials that visited the Munich Olympics. Located eight miles south of downtown Atlanta, the Velodrome is 321.8 m and 36° <b>banked</b> <b>concrete</b> track, set in Sumner park in a residential part of East Point. Dick Lane is the only velodrome in the world with a green space that contains a large oak tree and a creek running through the in-field. The City of East Point owns the facility and has a long-term partnership with East Point Velodrome Association, Inc. (EPVA) to manage it.|$|E

5000|$|When the Dick Lane Velodrome {{was built}} in 1974, {{it was one of}} only two in the United States. Named after a {{longtime}} City Council member, the Velodrome was inspired by a facility seen by a group of residents and city officials who visited the Munich Olympics in 1972. The Velodrome is a 1/5 mile and 36° <b>banked</b> <b>concrete</b> track for bicycle racing, set in Sumner park in a residential part of historic East Point. Dick Lane is the only velodrome in the world with a green space that contains a large oak tree and a creek running through the in-field. It is located eight miles south of downtown Atlanta.|$|E
50|$|Maroubra Speedway, officially {{known as}} Olympia Motor Speedway was a motor racing venue in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra, New South Wales, Australia and was {{reported}} to have had a capacity of 70,000. Opening in December 1925 the 1 mile <b>banked</b> <b>concrete</b> bowl was the scene of some large and successful race meetings before a decline in attendances saw the track close in 1927, but reopened many times in the 1930s. Despite the banking being too steep to walk up it was still not enough for the speeds achieved, and four competitors lost their lives going over the top of banking. Three others also died at the circuit, two of whom were motorcyclists.|$|E
50|$|Western Springs Stadium {{was built}} on land {{purchased}} from the Motion family by Auckland City Council in 1875 {{in order to build}} the Western Springs reservoir and pump station. Situated in a natural amphitheatre, concrete terracing was constructed. It was designed and modelled on European stadiums which included a <b>banked</b> <b>concrete</b> cycling track, a cinder running track and a grassed centre area for football and sports. The original design included a covered grandstand which would fill the gap between the concrete terraces, the cycling track finishing straight was designed and built to start and finish in front of the proposed grandstand (where the pit area now is). The stadium was never completed.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to estimate factors responsible for sustaining riverine communities in stream sections with various bank regulation systems. The research were conducted on Porebianka stream in the Polish Western Carpathians, where 10 different types of river regulations were chosen for the analysis (strong incision without alluvial deposits, redeposition with sand and gravel <b>banks,</b> <b>concrete</b> revetment walls along the banks, channel with banks lined with rip-rap and reference unmanaged cross- section). We conclude that the carabid beetles assemblages of the studied river sections respond mainly to hydraulic parameters of the stream. Elimination of frequent natural bank inundation (due to the regulations of the banks) is the main factor responsible for the impoverishment and extinction of riverine communities...|$|R

The forests were cleared in the 16th or the 17th century and a field dominated until the 1950s when the urban sprawl of Praia entirely spread into Fazenda. Ribeira da Trindade's <b>banks</b> became <b>concreted</b> to protect the area from flooding.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the extent to which the quality of the leader-follower relationship, expressed by the LMX coefficient, affects the bank profitability. Banks characterised by a high level of LMX possess a successful social atmosphere and interpersonal relationships, which is reflected in the emotional support and willingness to share resources, knowledge, and information between employees. Such a relationship between leaders and followers contributes to creating favourable social atmosphere, significantly affecting the overall performance of banks. Empirical research presented in this paper uses the data collected from a business network of a specifically selected Bank. The data was collected via a modified version of the LMX- 7 questionnaire, focusing on each branch of a selected <b>bank.</b> <b>Concrete</b> indicators were analyzed (such as net profit margin, ROA, and ROE), which helped establish a link between profitability and the degree of leader-follower communication exchange (measured by LMX coefficient). The results reveal that the applied leadership style directly impacted on the profitability of a selected bank, indicating that this finding could be used as input for management systems of similar financial institutions as well as a catalyst for further research in this field...|$|R
50|$|On June 4, 2004, welder Marvin Heemeyer {{went on a}} rampage in {{a heavily}} {{modified}} bulldozer in Granby, Colorado, wrecking 13 buildings including the town hall, the public library, a <b>bank,</b> a <b>concrete</b> batch plant, and a house owned by the town's former mayor, resulting in over $ 7 million in damage. The police were initially powerless, as none of their weapons could penetrate the suspect's vehicle. However, the bulldozer's engine failed and the machine became stuck, so Heemeyer committed suicide by gunshot.|$|R
