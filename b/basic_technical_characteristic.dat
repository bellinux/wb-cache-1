40|$|The {{situation}} when the metal structure {{is subjected to}} the simultaneous impact {{of two or more}} sources of simple stress is common in mechanical engineering, aviation and civil engineering. The fatigue life of the material by the impact of Biharmonic loading is 1. 5 ‒ 4 times lower than in single-frequency operation loading. Unlike the single-frequency loading under Biharmonic loading degradation of the material is accelerated because of the intensification of the process of fatigue damage accumulation. Description of the process of damage accumulation of fatigue in the material under biharmonic loading is closer to the real situation. The aim of the workis ‒ to create an effective setting for testing of ferromagnetic samples for fatigue and durability. To achieve the objectives small-sized laboratory facility for testing ferromagnetic sample flexural fatigue developed and produced. Studies have been conducted using the method of magnetic Barkhausen effect. The article describes the design and its basic characteristics, as well as the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> the sample. The principle of operation is based on the bi-harmonic load acting on both ends of the sample. The device use two electric motors with two special agents of power, based on the use of rolling bearings. Installation and testing of samples by the method of independent regulation of dual-frequency cyclic loading allows to simulate the condition of the test sample in the approximation to the real working conditions. This allows a detailed investigation of fracture toughness of the material, the stages of fatigue crack propagation and identify new patterns of development of fatigue. Unlike analog unit has small dimensions and weight (the length of the sample does not exceed 20 cm, width – 13 cm, height – 25 cm, weight of the unit is 12 kg).

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the fact that thermal power plants are {{responsible}} for the 1 / 3 of the anthropogenic CO 2 emitted to the atmosphere, it is argued that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies will contribute drastically to the reduction of the Greenhouse effect. This reality justifies the intensive research activity towards the CO 2 abatement from thermoelectric power units in order to achieve feasible technical and economic solutions. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of a power plant representative to the Greek electricity production industry fired with low quality lignite. The gross power output of a typical Greek lignite power plant lies within the range of 300 - 350 MWel. Taking into account that the application of CCS technologies results in the considerable reduction of the net power output of the unit, the size of the unit under investigation is 380 MWel gross, while the fuel chosen is the lignite extracted from the region of Florina. In order to estimate the performance parameters of the thermal power plants, the GateCycle software is used which is developed by General Electric. In the context of this thesis, the basic design characteristics of the CCS units are determined. In addition, the optimization of the thermodynamic design as well as the economic feasibility study is included. The application of the oxy-fuel technology is examined in the 3 rd chapter of the thesis. Specifically, this chapter includes the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the steam boiler, the flue gas treatment line, the air separation unit and the CO 2 purification and compression system. Primarily, the power plant performance is assessed without any efficiency optimization options being investigated. However, a large amount of heat produced from the air separation and flue gas treatment processes, is rejected to the cooling water. The exploitation of this low quality heat results in the significant reduction of the efficiency penalty implied by the application of the oxy-fuel CO 2 abatement technology. Finally, the thermodynamic design that maximizes the plant’s net efficiency is proposed. In the 4 th chapter the CO 2 chemical absorption from the flue gas with amines is evaluated. The CO 2 removal equipment consists mainly of the absorption column and the amine solution regeneration column. The <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the equipment are presented. Importance has been placed on the examination of the requirements regarding the SOx and NO 2 concentration of the flue gas at the inlet of the absorber. Given that the amine will react preferentially with more acidic gases than CO 2 such as SO 2 and NO 2 to form more stable salts that cannot be broken down in the stripper, the concentration in the flue gas should be very low. Additionally, the technical options concerning the integration of low quality heat that is rejected to the cooling water are investigated. Finally the process integration that results in the optimal power plant performance is proposed. The conclusions that emerge from this thesis concern the performance of the steam generators, the specific heat consumption of the steam turbine as well as the net electrical efficiency of the power plant which integrate the CO 2 control technologies. The optimum plant design which maximizes the thermodynamic performance is proposed taking {{into account the}} CO 2 capture equipment requirements. As far as the economic viability is concerned, emphasis is placed on the economic remarks specific to the CO 2 control technologies application. ...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{we discuss}} the {{challenges}} of operating the grid with high penetrations of wind and solar generation, {{commonly referred to as}} “variable energy resources ” (VERs). We also present a variety of changes to system operation and planning that can help in meeting these challenges. The chapter provides background on ongoing industry and government efforts to integrate and increase the penetration of VERs, as well as context for later chapters. The topics described in this chapter are of primary interest to industry decision makers. Section 3. 1 describes the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> and economic <b>characteristics</b> of VERs and introduces the challenges for the power system derived from the variability and uncertainty of these generation sources. This is followed in Section 3. 2 by a discussion of the impact that high penetrations of VERs could have on system operating reserve requirements and several ways to limit system operation cost increases. These include improving VER forecasts and situational awareness, moving generation scheduling decisions closer to real time, and expanding cooperation among neighboring balancing areas. We find that these operational changes will become increasingly important as VER penetrations grow. Section 3. 3 discusses the impact of high VER penetrations on the future well-adapted generation mix and the need to ensure adequate system flexibility.
