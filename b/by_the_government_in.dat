5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{authority}} {{in its own}} country, the government administered the Belgian Congo and held negotiations with other Allied powers about post-war reconstruction.

The government also exercised influence within the Belgian army-in-exile and attempted to maintain links with the underground resistance.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the {{situation}} {{came to a}} head when al-Jamri ignored a final warning <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> June, he was dismissed from his job as a judge. In August, his son-in-law Abduljalil Khalil was arrested and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. In September, his elder son Mohamed Jameel was arrested and sentenced to ten years. The authorities then ordered al-Jamri's arrest; on 6 September, Colonel Adel Flaifel and a number of security forces arrived at his house. Al-Jamri's wife rushed to the nearby mosque and called people from its speakers. Amid neighbors' protests, security forces decided to let al-Jarmi go after only an hour's detention.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s.|$|E

Estimates made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities.|$|E

These famines and alleged partiality shown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> handling the Chingleput Ryots' Case and the Salem riots trial caused discontent among the population.|$|E
