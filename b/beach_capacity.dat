50|$|It weighed 16 {{tons and}} had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. To prevent fouling of the {{propellers}} in a craft destined {{to spend time in}} surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White's designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, pushing the craft ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5-6 knots and its <b>beaching</b> <b>capacity</b> was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.|$|R
40|$|Several {{published}} studies on beach management have defined sustainable {{strategies for the}} maintenance of their recreational capacity. However, coastal geomorphology and evolution have rarely been taken into consideration. To complete these studies, we analyzed the geomorphological characteristics, the users' perception and <b>beach</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> of two coastal stretches. Geomorphological characteristics were obtained from aerial photos and field survey data; beach perceptionwas assessed through questionnaires and interviews while the <b>beach</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> was calculated using two distinct methods. Our results suggest that the physical carrying capacity can be defined using geomorphological analyses, while the effective carrying capacity can be evaluated using the users' perception analysis...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) aims {{to promote}} {{sustainable}} management of coastal zones based on ecosystem and holistic management approaches. In this context, policies {{have to consider}} the complex interactions that influence the fragile equilibrium of coastal ecosystems. Beaches represent both valuable and vulnerable natural resources because of the various ecosystem services they provide and their sensitivity to climate change and sea level rise. We present the first comprehensive digital record of all Black Sea beaches and provide a rapid assessment of their erosion risk under different scenarios of sea level rise. Through the digitisation of freely available remote-sensed images on the web, we provide broad information on the spatial characteristics and other attributes of all Black Sea beaches (e. g. photo-based visual estimation of the sediment type, presence of coastal defences, urban development). These data have been assembled and stored in full Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) – allowing spatial queries, visualisation and data sharing – and are therefore particularly interesting to feed/supply web-GIS portals (coastal atlases) for visualisation purpose, spatial queries or spatial indicators calculations. The resulting Black Sea beaches database contains 1228 beaches, with a total coastline length of 2042 km with an area of 224 km 2. The majority of the Black Sea beaches have been found to have small widths (61 % have maximum widths less than 50 m), whereas 47 % of all beaches presented coastal defence schemes, suggesting an already serious beach erosion problem. The erosion risk of the Black Sea beaches was assessed through the comparison of their maximum widths with estimations of the sea level rise-induced retreat by an ensemble of six 1 -D analytical and numerical morphodynamic models. Following more than 17, 000 experiments using different combinations of wave conditions, beach sediment textures and slopes and 11 scenarios of sea level rise (up to 2 m), the means (best fits) of the lowest and highest projections by the model ensemble were estimated; these were then compared to the maximum widths of the Black Sea beaches. The analysis showed that sea level rise willhave highly significant impacts on the Black Sea beaches, as for a 0. 5 m sea level rise 56 % of all beaches are projected to retreat by 50 % of their maximum width. For a 0. 82 m sea level rise (the high IPCC estimate for the period 2081 – 2100) about 41 % are projected to retreat by their entire maximum width, whereas for 1 m sea level rise about 51 % of all Black Sea beaches are projected to retreat by (drowned or shifted landward by) their entire maximum width, if the high mean of the model ensemble projections is used. Results substantiate the risk of beach erosion as a major environmental problem along the Black Sea coast, which therefore needs {{to be taken into account}} in any future coastal management plans, as a matter of urgency. As these scenarios consider only sea level rise, they are considered to be conservative. Although the present results cannot replace detailed studies, the database and projections may assist Black Sea coastal managers and policy makers to rapidly identify beaches with increased risk of erosion, valuate accordingly coastal assets and infrastructure, estimate <b>beach</b> <b>capacity</b> for touristic development purposes, and rapidly assess direct and indirect costs and benefits of beach protection options. They also provide the necessary inputs to advance discussions relevant to the Black Sea ICZM...|$|E
50|$|A {{prototype}} motor {{landing craft}} (MLC1) was built and first sailed in 1926, finishing trials in 1927. It weighed 16 tons, with a draught of 6.5 ft. The MLC had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. It was also extremely noisy. In {{order to prevent}} fouling of the propellers in a craft destined {{to spend time in}} surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White's designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, pushing the craft ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5-6 knots and its <b>beaching</b> <b>capacity</b> was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.|$|R

50|$|City leaders claimed {{after the}} 1988 {{event that the}} number of Greekfest {{attendees}} overwhelmed Virginia <b>Beach's</b> <b>capacity</b> for large events. Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf made it plain that the African American end-of-summer event was simply not welcome in the city. Organizers of the event were told by city officials that they could not rent any public facilities for 1989's Greekfest. Without the use of city facilities, upwards of 100,000 Greekfest attendees in 1989 were left with nothing to do but mill around the oceanfront. City leaders additionally put new ordinances and policies in place that led to the arrests and citations of hundreds of party-goers, primarily for relatively minor offenses such as jay-walking and loud music. The Virginia National Guard was placed on call for Labor Day weekend 1989. Attendees claimed that they felt unwelcomed by the inhospitable nature of the police and other city officials.|$|R

40|$|Whatever {{other changes}} it engenders, {{desegregation}} invariably produces a re-organization {{of space and}} place, a fact whose implications the psychological literature on the process has generally disregarded. The present article begins to address this gap. Drawing on research on place–identity processes, we argue that desegregation may alter not only the relationship between self and other, but also the relationship between self and place. As such, it may be experienced {{as a form of}} dislocation: an event that undermines shared constructions of place and the forms of located subjectivity they sustain. In order to develop this idea, we analyse a series of interviews conducted with holiday-makers on a formerly white but now multiracial beach in South Africa. The analysis demonstrates how white respondents’ stories of desegregation evince an abiding concern with the loss of place, manifest in terms of an erosion of a sense of place belonging, attachment and familiarity and an undermining of the <b>beach’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to act as a restorative environment of the self. The implications of such accounts for understanding personal and ideological resistance to desegregation are explored. The paper concludes by arguing that this problem provides an opportunity to conjoin environmental and social psychological work...|$|R

50|$|The most {{damaging}} riverine flood {{recorded in the}} Ventura River watershed occurred in 1969. The watershed above Ojai received a staggering 43 inches of rain in nine days in January. The floodwaters and associated debris rolled {{down out of the}} mountains, flooding homes in Casitas Springs and Live Oak Acres. Much agricultural land, primarily citrus groves, was seriously damaged or destroyed. All over Ventura County, transportation facilities, including roads, bridges, and railroad tracks, were damaged. The wastewater treatment plant below Foster Park was severely damaged and dumped raw sewage into the Ventura River. In addition, sewer trunk lines were broken along the Ventura River and San Antonio Creek. Untreated sewage polluted the river and <b>beach.</b> The <b>capacity</b> of the Matilija reservoir was significantly reduced by siltation from the flood.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{influence of}} shoreline dynamics on beach {{use and the}} exploitation of beaches for recreational purposes is analysed for the Mediterranean coast. This is done by assuming that for intensively-used beaches, such as those considered in this work, <b>beach</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> is mainly influenced by the available subaerial surface. In mid-latitude areas with well-defined climatic seasons, managers will {{need to know the}} optimum configuration for the beach’s recreational purposes in May at the latest if they are to properly plan the services for users during the bathing season. This can be affected by three main aspects of shoreline dynamics: long-term erosion, shoreline reorientations in bayed beaches and storm-induced changes. To analyse the influence of these processes, here we introduce the concept of “optimum beach width”, which is the value ideally used by visitors when no spatial constraints exist. The effect on this width by each of the mentioned processes is discussed by using examples taken from Spanish beaches...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} {{aspects of}} the morphological behavior of Rio das Pacas Beach, situated in the Southeast portion of the Island of Santa Catarina - SC. The methodology adopted consisted in the monitoring of three beaches profiles, every twenty days, {{during the period of}} one year. Besides the topographical survey, there were also carried out observation on height and wave periods, wind direction and intensity and current direction. The results indicated a great variation on the profiles throughout the monitored period, especially evidenced in the values of width and sedimentary supply of the beach (highest variations reaching 30 m and 40 m 3 /m between two consecutive expeditions), where it was possible to identify seasonal behavior characterized by accretion during the end of spring and summer and erosion in autumn and winter. The erosive periods were of bigger magnitude than the accretion, and in the extremities of the beach, the complete recovery of sediments was not reached during the monitored period. Events of high energy (undertows) that reached the <b>beach</b> revealed <b>capacity</b> to modify the morphology of the beach system, also eroding frontal dunes settled for vegetation and partially destroying anthropic structures – such as walls, poles, props and fences - constructed on the frontal dune and backshore...|$|R
5000|$|Echo <b>Beach,</b> a 5000-person <b>capacity</b> outdoor concert venue on {{the east}} side of Ontario Place. Developed in {{collaboration}} with concert promoter Live Nation, Echo Beach is a general-admission concert venue designed to help re-create the popular ambience of the original Ontario Place Forum, minus the revolving stage but introducing a real sandy beach section with views of the Toronto nighttime skyline. Some of the first performers Echo Beach in 2011 included Sloan, Robyn and Platinum Blonde. Toronto Life Magazine wrote, [...] "The new Echo Beach is a reason to love Toronto because music sounds better under the stars".

40|$|This {{working paper}} focuses in {{enjoyment}} factors, specifically: number of beach users, perceived {{maximum number of}} beach users accepted, perceived maximum number of beach users that affects the tourism experience and perceived maximum number of beach users that affects the beach quality. At a deeper extent, the evaluation is categorized by number of visitation, visitation motivations, and Chenang Island’s push and pull factors. Relationships between variables were assessed using a two-phase evaluation framework where interestingly, only one demographic factor works with all the studied independent variables. It is also learned that the density of an area number of people seen is considered as a n accepted crowding factor, as opposed to this working paper scope experienced crowding. A unique relationship was observed for crowding level, and visitation satisfaction level and overall evaluation of Chenang beach quality. This working paper further supports the previous literature on the significance of <b>beach</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> management and it is learned {{that the idea of}} crowding standard is interlinks with ‘gender, ‘time spend’ and ‘number of boaters’. From findings, this working paper envisages the preferences polar exchange where this should be of interest to tourism-related personnel.
