5|$|The <b>Brighton</b> Marine Palace and Pier, {{commonly}} known as <b>Brighton</b> Pier or the Palace Pier is a Grade II* listed pleasure pier in <b>Brighton,</b> England, located in the city centre opposite the Old Steine. Opening in 1899, {{it was the third}} pier to be constructed in <b>Brighton</b> after the Royal Suspension Chain Pier and the West Pier, but is now the only one still in operation. It is managed and operated by the Eclectic Bar Group.|$|E
5|$|The western (<b>Brighton)</b> side, {{comprising}} platforms 9–19, is the terminus for Southern and Gatwick Express {{services to}} Surrey and Sussex, including Gatwick Airport and <b>Brighton</b> on the <b>Brighton</b> Main Line and the East Grinstead branch on the Oxted Line.|$|E
5|$|After his Supreme Court victory, Afroyim divided {{his time}} between West <b>Brighton</b> (Staten Island, New York) and the Israeli city of Safed until his death on May 19, 1984, in West <b>Brighton.</b>|$|E
5|$|By mid-1961, {{the section}} between <b>Brighton</b> and Marysville had opened. The gap to the east, from Highway28 in Port Hope to Highway30 in <b>Brighton</b> was opened on July 20, 1961.|$|E
5|$|Citibase <b>Brighton</b> (previously {{known as}} The <b>Brighton</b> Forum by Topcentre) {{is a complex}} of {{serviced}} offices on a prominent elevated position in the Round Hill area of <b>Brighton,</b> part of the English city of <b>Brighton</b> and Hove. The large Gothic Revival building, by two architect brothers from London, has had three greatly different uses since its construction {{at the edge of}} <b>Brighton</b> parish in 1854: for its first 85 years, it trained Anglican schoolmistresses; then it became a military base and records office; and in 1988 it opened as a multipurpose business centre and office complex. The elaborate flint exterior is finely detailed in the Gothic style, especially around the windows. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.|$|E

5|$|Formally, the Culver Line ends as {{the track}} curve enters {{the lower level}} of the double-decked station along the BMT <b>Brighton</b> Line's right-of-way, and the {{chaining}} track designation changes from IND tracks B1 and B2 to BMT tracks A1 and A2 of the <b>Brighton</b> Line. However, {{there is no longer}} a connection to the <b>Brighton</b> Line at this point, and for all practical purposes the Culver Line continues into tracks 5 and 6 of the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue Terminal.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Cowan was {{appointed}} player-manager at Mossley. He led {{the club to}} the seventh place in the Cheshire League and to the Manchester Challenge Shield title. On the pitch, he played 39 matches and scored one goal. At {{the end of the}} season Cowan resigned to join <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Albion coaching staff. In October 1945, a shortage of players resulted in Cowan taking to the field in a wartime match against Bournemouth. Aged 44 years and 156 days, he became the oldest ever <b>Brighton</b> player. While at <b>Brighton,</b> Cowan started a physiotherapy business based near the Goldstone Ground.|$|E
5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from <b>Brighton</b> works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time <b>Brighton</b> works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, <b>Brighton</b> sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 2009 Stockport {{agreed to}} allow Gannon to hold talks with <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Albion, who were seeking to fill the {{managerial}} position left vacant by Micky Adams. He suggested that his family would play a large part in his decision to move clubs, with Stockport's financial troubles looming but uprooting his family to move to <b>Brighton</b> being undesirable. Gannon was made favourite {{to be given the}} job by several bookmakers, and he met with <b>Brighton</b> chairman Dick Knight on the 25th, before announcing on the 26th that he had chosen not to take the job. Knight had indicated that Gannon was his first choice for the job, and former Stockport players now at <b>Brighton</b> had shown their desire for Gannon to be given the job. However, Gannon turned down the opportunity and vowed stay with at the Edgeley Park club.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June 2009, Crofts {{agreed to}} join League One club <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Albion on a two-year contract. He made his debut for <b>Brighton</b> during the 1–0 home defeat to Walsall on 8 August 2009 and scored his first goal for <b>Brighton</b> during the 2–2 draw at Yeovil Town on 10 October 2009. Crofts was given the role of captain by new manager Gus Poyet before the 3–1 away victory at Southampton. Crofts was later {{confirmed}} as permanent captain {{at the beginning of}} January 2010.|$|E
5|$|Rae's {{mother died}} in France during the war. The sisters {{remained}} there until the 1930s, when Hitler's rise to power prompted them to relocate to England, where they settled in St Leonards-on-Sea, in Sussex. Rae died on 16 March 1940 at <b>Brighton</b> Mental Hospital in <b>Brighton.</b>|$|E
5|$|The New <b>Brighton</b> Tower and Recreation Company {{formed a}} {{football}} team, New <b>Brighton</b> Tower F.C., and applied for membership to the Lancashire League. The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New <b>Brighton</b> Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The North Shore {{branch of}} the SIRT began at Saint George Terminal, using the northernmost {{platform}} and tracks of the terminal. After running through the St. George Freight Yard (near the modern Ballpark Station), the line ran {{on the shore of}} the Kill Van Kull from New <b>Brighton</b> to West <b>Brighton.</b> The line ran on land between St. George and New <b>Brighton,</b> and on a ballast-filled wood trestle supported by a wood retaining wall through Livingston and West <b>Brighton.</b> Though the right-of-way is distinguishable, little evidence of this portion of the line exists today, except for abandoned tracks and supports, much of which has eroded into the kull.|$|E
5|$|The area {{is close}} to many other bus routes, both from outside the front {{entrance}} of <b>Brighton</b> station and along London Road. There is a direct pedestrian and vehicular route along Stroudley Road to the rear entrance of <b>Brighton</b> station.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{now called}} <b>Brighton</b> Forum, {{at the junction}} of Ditchling and Viaduct Roads, forms a local landmark. The Grade II-listed knapped flint Gothic Revival structure, designed by William and Edward Habershon, was built in 1854 on open land at the northern boundary of <b>Brighton</b> Borough as the Diocese of Chichester's training college for Anglican schoolmistresses. It was extended to the north in 1886, and {{was used as a}} training college until the Second World War, when the Royal Engineers requisitioned it and used it to store their records and archives. After its closure in 1987, it was briefly threatened with demolition, but in 1988 it was converted into serviced offices under the name <b>Brighton</b> Business Centre (later <b>Brighton</b> Forum).|$|E
5|$|The {{composer}} Edward Elgar conducted his Enigma Variations at the New <b>Brighton</b> Tower Ballroom in 1898, {{the second}} time he performed the piece. In 1900 he conducted Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony at New <b>Brighton</b> Tower.|$|E
5|$|The first railway line in {{the area}} was the <b>Brighton</b> Main Line, which opened as far as Haywards Heath on 12 July 1841 and reached <b>Brighton</b> on 21 September 1841. It ran through Three Bridges, which was then a small village east of Crawley, and a station was built to serve it.|$|E
5|$|Victoria {{platforms}} 9–12 and 15–19 {{provide one}} of two London termini for services on the <b>Brighton</b> Main Line operated by Southern, serving South London, Sussex, <b>Brighton</b> and The South Coast. There are off-peak metro services to London Bridge and Sutton and main line services to Bognor Regis, <b>Brighton,</b> Epsom, Ore, Portsmouth Harbour and Southampton Central.|$|E
5|$|A line {{branching}} {{off of the}} IND Crosstown Line running via Franklin Avenue connecting with the BMT <b>Brighton</b> Line. This would have replaced the BMT Franklin Avenue Line.|$|E

5|$|After <b>Brighton</b> United {{and then}} <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Rangers disbanded, a new {{professional}} football club was formed {{at a meeting}} held in the Seven Stars Hotel in June 1901. The club adopted the name <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Albion and took over <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Rangers' place in the Southern League Second Division. They also entered the FA Cup for the first time, disposing of <b>Brighton</b> Athletic, Eastbourne, and Hastings & St Leonards before succumbing 3–2 at home to Clapton in the third qualifying round. The Goldstone Ground became Albion's permanent home in their second season, when the club entered a team in the South Eastern League to provide additional matches on those Saturdays free of Southern League or cup fixtures. Albion lost out on the 1903 Southern League Second Division title on goal average, but gained promotion to the First Division via the test match system. The committee's recommendation against accepting the promotion on financial grounds was overruled by the membership, but their fears were justified when the club lost £1,500 on their first year's trading as a limited company. To raise income from additional matches, a team was entered in the United League in 1905–06; these matches were played in midweek, because Saturdays and public holidays during the playing season were fully {{taken up by the}} Southern League and FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the <b>Brighton</b> Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the <b>Brighton</b> Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the <b>Brighton</b> Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E
5|$|Bus {{services}} are operated chiefly by Arriva Kent & Sussex, providing local town and rural services to Tonbridge, Paddock Wood and Sevenoaks, {{as well as}} express services to locations such as Bromley and Maidstone. Eastbourne and <b>Brighton</b> on the south coast are accessible on services run by Stagecoach in Eastbourne and <b>Brighton</b> & Hove respectively, and Metrobus operates hourly services to Crawley.|$|E
5|$|Carlton Hill's {{pattern of}} {{development}} {{was defined by}} the long-established structure of land ownership around <b>Brighton,</b> whereby land was divided into long, narrow strips with many different owners. This encouraged the development of terraced housing—the predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and high-density rebuilding in the mid-20th century. This work introduced more open space and varied land uses: <b>Brighton</b> Art College was able to expand into the area, and American Express opened a large, visually dominant headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Clearances around Albion Hill {{began in}} the 1950s. From 1959, the narrow, densely {{populated}} terraces between Albion Hill and Morley Street were cleared and replaced with landscaped open space and seven tower blocks—Brighton's first such buildings. The first, Highleigh, opened on 11 May 1961. Like its later neighbours, it has 11 storeys. The steep Richmond Street was severed {{as part of this}} redevelopment; its lower section was replaced by a zig-zag path down the hillside and a short road called Richmond Parade, and new roads (Grove Hill and Ashton Rise) were built between the tower blocks and across the slope of the hill. Similarly, the lowest section of Carlton Hill was renamed Kingswood Street when it was redeveloped in the 1960s: <b>Brighton</b> Art College (now part of the University of <b>Brighton)</b> was extended in 1967 by <b>Brighton</b> borough architect Percy Billington, taking up a large corner plot.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008–09 season, Stockport {{defied the}} odds by {{challenging}} for a play-off place, but their form dipped {{during the final}} months of the season, which saw them slip to mid-table. Gannon was approached by <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Albion and the approach was accepted by Stockport, but after talks with the chairman of <b>Brighton,</b> Gannon rejected the job and stayed at Stockport.|$|E
5|$|Fox (age 30) is {{a screen}} {{printing}} artist from <b>Brighton.</b> Since starting HRT six months ago, Fox is all-too {{aware that the}} hormones are slow to manifest visible changes.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} career with Gillingham, for whom he made his Football League debut {{at the age of}} 16, and made over 190 {{appearances}} for the Kent-based club. He had loans at Peterborough United and Wrexham during the 2008–09 season and joined <b>Brighton</b> & Hove Albion in 2009. After a successful season at <b>Brighton</b> he transferred to Norwich City in 2010, before moving back to the South Coast club in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{diverging}} {{diamond interchange}} was added {{at the intersection}} of I-590 and Winton Road in the <b>Brighton</b> suburb of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to <b>Brighton</b> were introduced, {{the second}} to replace a {{withdrawn}} Southdown Motor Services service. To improve profits on the <b>Brighton</b> route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses along the route alongside passengers. The scheduled service operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three vehicles, on 1 November 1982, although some were withdrawn a year later.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{after making}} three {{substitute}} appearances for <b>Brighton,</b> Holroyd was loaned out to another League Two {{side in the}} form of Bury. His loan spell ran {{until the end of the}} 2010–11 season. Holroyd made his debut a day after signing for the club, coming on as a 69th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at Rotherham United. Three days later, Holroyd scored in a 2–1 home loss to Torquay United. <b>Brighton</b> opted to recall Holroyd on 11 April 2011. He made four appearances for Bury during his loan spell, scoring one goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season as manager, 2000–01, Adams guided <b>Brighton</b> to {{promotion}} as Division Three champions after the club had spent five seasons in the league's basement division. A late chase for the title proved to be unnecessary, as high flying Chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities, leaving <b>Brighton</b> ten points clear at the season's end. He was named as Third Division Manager of the season for a second time, also picking up the Third Division Manager of the Month award in September 2000.|$|E
