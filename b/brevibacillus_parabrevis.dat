40|$|Organophosphate {{pesticides}} are {{of common}} interest {{due to increased}} envionmenal contamination. Such agents cause several undesired and un-solved problems in non-target species. The enzyme organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) producing bacterial strain <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> SR 2729 (B. parabrevis SR 2729) was isolated from soil contaminated with chlorpyrifos. <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> SR 2729 was subjected to strain improvement by physical and chemical mutagenesis; where two strains B. parabrevis SR 2729 -A and B. parabrevis SR 2729 -B were selected after classical screening through Triton-x- 100 and 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol. The mutant derived strains <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> SR 2729 -A and <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> SR 2729 -B showed 229 and 240 % greater OPH production as compared to parental strain. The optimum levels of six variables (pH, temperature, incubation time, carbon source, nitrogen source and pesticide concentration) were obtained after statistical analysis by RSM. After process optimization, the activities of OPH from B. parabrevis SR 2729 -A and B. parabrevis SR 2729 -B were 195 and 178 % greater than OPH from parental strain B. parabrevis SR 2729. The specific activity for purified enzyme was observed to be 935, 1521 1911 U mg- 1 from parental and mutant derived strains B. parabrevis SR 2729 -A and B. parabrevis SR 2729 -B, respectively. After kinetic and thermodynamic analysis, the enzyme from mutant derived strains was observed to be more suitable for utilizing chlorpyrifos as substrate, with higher thermostability {{as compared to the}} enzyme from parental strain. The molecular weight of OPH enzymes from parental and mutant derived strains were 37 kDa. In soil, the OPH from mutant derived strains B. parabrevis SR 2729 -A and B. parabrevis SR 2729 -B showed 206 and 208 % greater degradation of chlorpyrifos as compared to parental strain. The enzyme from mutant derived strains B. parabrevis SR 2729 -A and B. parabrevis SR 2729 -B degraded 28 and 65 % greater insecticide in water compared to enzyme from parental strain. In conclusion, the strain improvement by physical and chemical mutagenesis resulted in the selection of potential mutant derived strains which were more significant agents for the degradation of chlorpyrifos in soil and water samples...|$|E
40|$|Microbial plant biostimulants {{represent}} one of {{the solutions}} for the negative impacts associated with high residues agricultural systems. We developed a hydro-gelified and film forming formulation, which we used for in situ formation of a bio-composite mulch, by treatment on crop residues. Into this hydro-gelified and film forming composition we included microbial biostimulants strains, Trichoderma asperellum T 36 and <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> B 50. We tested the effects of application of such microbial plant biostimulant formulation on polyamines and ortosilicic acid release from a mixture of hairy vetch and corn residues, on controlled conditions. We evaluated the influence of crop residues treatment with our formulation on crop yield and soil characteristics - water stable aggregates, glomalin related soil proteins. The results demonstrate that treatments on crop residues with our formulation of microbial plant biostimulants compensates some disadvantages of high residues conservation agriculture, enhancing its effects on soil aggregate stability, due to the promotion of glomalin related soil proteins formation...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{bacterial}} {{composition of}} iru produced by natural, uncontrolled fermentation of Parkia biglobosa seeds {{was assessed using}} culture-independent method in combination with culture-based genotypic typing techniques. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed similarity in DNA fragments with the two DNA extraction methods used and confirmed bacterial diversity in the sixteen iru samples from different production regions. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V 3 region of the 16 S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE identified species related to Bacillus subtilis as consistent bacterial species in the fermented samples, while other major bands were identified as close relatives of Staphylococcus vitulinus, Morganella morganii, B. thuringiensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Tetragenococcus halophilus, Ureibacillus thermosphaericus, <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis,</b> Salinicoccus jeotgali, Brevibacterium sp. and Uncultured bacteria clones. Bacillus species were cultured as potential starter cultures and clonal relationship of different isolates determined using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) combined with 16 S- 23 S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR amplification, restriction analysis (ITS-PCR-RFLP) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR). This further discriminated Bacillus subtilis and its variants from food-borne pathogens such as Bacillus cereus and suggested the need for development of controlled fermentation processes and good manufacturing practices (GMP) for iru production to achieve product consistency, safety quality and improved shelf life...|$|E
30|$|Restrepo-Flórez et al. (2014) {{discussed}} {{the effect of}} biotic and abiotic factors on the initiation of polyethylene degradation by including enzymatic hydrolysis, photo-oxidation (UV light), etc. The number of carbons present on the polymer influenced the rate of degradation via enzyme interactions. Structural arrangements are also important in degradation; {{it was observed that}} amorphous regions are more susceptible to microbial attack. Thomas et al. (2015) reported three microbial species for polythene degradation, i.e., P. fluorescens, S. aureus and A. niger. They used P. fluorescens and evaluated the degradation in laboratory conditions as well as the field environment; 8.06 % degradation was found within a month under laboratory conditions, and 8 and 16 % degradations were observed in 9 and 12  months, respectively, in field conditions. Pramila et al. (2012) reported LDPE degrading bacterial strains isolated from the municipal landfill, i.e., <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> PL- 1, Acinetobacter baumannii PL- 2, A. baumannii PL- 3 and P. citronellolis PL- 4. The polymer (LDPE) degradation potentials of bacterial strains were determined by the biofilm formation ability on polymers and CO 2 evolution from the carbon mineralization of polymer. Muenmee et al. (2015) used a bacterial consortium (heterotrophs, autotrophs and methanotrophs) for HDPE and LDPE degradation and found Methylobacter sp. or Methylocella sp. (methanotrophs) predominantly on the surface of deteriorated samples. The LDPE degradation rate was reported as lowest in comparison to HDPE degradation.|$|E
40|$|A Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium, Gsoil 3088 T, was {{isolated}} from soil from a ginseng field in Pocheon Province in South Korea and characterized {{in order to}} determine its taxonomic position. On the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain Gsoil 3088 T was shown to belong to the family Paenibacillaceae, being related to Brevibacillus centrosporus (96 ? 6 %), Brevibacillus borstelensis (96 ? 3 %), <b>Brevibacillus</b> <b>parabrevis</b> (96 ? 1 %), Brevibacillus formosus (96 ? 1 %), Brevibacillus brevis (96 ? 1 %) and Brevibacillus laterosporus (96 ? 0 %). The phylogenetic distances from other validly described species within the genus Brevibacillus were greater than 4 ? 0 % (i. e. there was less than 96 ? 0 % similarity). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 52 ? 1 mol%. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data (major menaquinone, MK- 7; fatty acid profile, iso-C 15 : 0, iso-C 14 : 0 and anteiso-C 15 : 0) supported the affiliation of strain Gsoil 3088 T to the genus Brevibacillus. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed strain Gsoil 3088 T to be distinguished genotypically and phenotypically from Brevibacillus species with validly published names. Strain Gsoil 3088 T, therefore, represents a novel species of the genus Brevibacillus, for which the name Brevibacillus ginsengisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Gsoil 3088 T (=KCTC 13938 T =LMG 23403 T) ...|$|E
