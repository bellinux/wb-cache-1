5|$|In the 1967/68 season, John left Llanelli {{and joined}} Cardiff, where he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards. Although John and Edwards later became the scourge of New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore's touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins {{in the final two}} matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of £16,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played in a cutting, rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field. Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first half into the gale, and finished the half 8–0 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> from Wales' number8, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try. The game ended 13–6 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John's kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history.|$|E
5|$|Buffon was {{included}} in the Italian squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil and played in every match of the tournament as captain. On 16 June 2013, he featured in Italy's opening 2–1 win against Mexico, where he was beaten only by a Javier Hernández penalty. In the next game, on 19 June 2013 against Japan, the referee awarded Japan a penalty in the 20th minute of the first half when he declared that Shinji Okazaki had been brought down by Buffon after a misplaced <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> by Mattia De Sciglio; Buffon received a yellow card. The squad's eventual 4–3 win allowed Italy to progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time, where they were to face Spain in a rematch of the Euro 2012 final. After a 0–0 draw, they lost 7–6 in the resulting penalty shootout. Although both Buffon and Spanish counterpart Iker Casillas had managed to keep a clean sheet throughout the match, neither goalkeeper was able to stop a penalty in the shootout; the lone miss, by Leonardo Bonucci, was hit over bar. In the third-place match, Italy defeated Uruguay 3–2 in the penalty shootout after a 2–2 deadlock following extra time. Buffon saved three penalties; those taken by Diego Forlán, Juventus teammate Martín Cáceres and Walter Gargano.|$|E
25|$|Lehmann left Schalke for Milan in 1998, but his {{performances}} were below par. In one game Gabriel Batistuta scored a hat-trick against him, including a goal from a free {{kick in the}} box which Lehmann had conceded by handling a <b>back</b> <b>pass.</b> In another game he was substituted after giving away a penalty. After just five matches, Lehmann was dropped. Believing he wouldn't get another chance at Milan, he left during the winter.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{incident}} in Havana, Birnbaum was {{in the starting lineup}} when NYCFC came to RFK in the final home game of the regular season for DC. Playing before an announced crowd of over 30,000, United played as strong a half as the team had at any time under Coach Ben Olsen. Patrick Mullins put DC out in front as he finished a Lloyd Sam cross in the 27th minute. Four minutes later, Boswell headed in a Sam corner kick to give the home team a much deserved 2-0 lead. Just before halftime, a defensive error allowed United to extend the lead to 3-0. An errant <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> found its way to Mullins, who then found Rob Vincent {{at the top of the}} box, leaving Vincent with a wide-open goal to shoot at for his second MLS goal. NYCFC got one back after the 70' mark, when David Villa drew a soft penalty call, and then beat Hamid on the penalty kick. The 3-1 win clinched a postseason spot for United and left them a point ahead of Montreal in the race for 4th place and a home-field advantage in the play-in game.|$|E
25|$|And fail to win they did, losing 2–1 to a Chelsea {{side that}} {{had had an}} extra day to recuperate from their Champions League tie against Liverpool in mid-week. Coming {{off the back of}} a poor display in Barcelona, United were looking to cement their claim to the Premier League title, which would have been all but won with a win over Chelsea. However, with several players rested with Barcelona on Tuesday in mind, and Nemanja Vidić having to be {{substituted}} early on after a knee to the face, the odds never looked in United's favour. Owen Hargreaves took Vidić's place in defence, with Wes Brown switching from right-back to centre-back. Joe Cole had the first real chance, but could only smash the ball into the woodwork from 18yards after he regained the ball from a poor clearance. United held out for 45 minutes, but finally went behind on the stroke of half-time to a Michael Ballack header, after the German had lost his marker to find room at the back post. After the break, United came out a new team, taking the game to Chelsea. After 57 minutes, United conceded a free kick just inside Chelsea's half, but a poor <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> from Ricardo Carvalho allowed Wayne Rooney to pounce on the ball and place a shot beyond Petr Čech into the corner of the net, his first career goal against Chelsea. However, he appeared to have injured himself during his celebration and was soon substituted, making way for Cristiano Ronaldo. The game went quiet for the last 20 minutes, until a Michael Essien cross was handled by Michael Carrick just inside the United penalty area with four minutes left to play. Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, and Ballack stepped up to convert and give Chelsea the win. United went all out for a much needed equaliser, but the closest they came were two shots blocked on the line by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko. The result brought Chelsea level on points with United with two games to go, United holding on to top spot by virtue of their +53 goal difference. This now meant that United would have to win both of their remaining games to secure the title, provided that Chelsea did not drop any more points.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 2015, in a {{match against}} Burnley, Forster {{suffered}} a severe knee injury after clearing a <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> and was escorted off the pitch by medics, {{and replaced by}} Kelvin Davis. Koeman said Forster's injury was [...] "looking bad" [...] and that the doctors were [...] "not positive". Up to this point, he had been ever-present for Southampton throughout the season and kept the most clean sheets in the League. Four days later, Southampton confirmed Forster's injury to be a broken kneecap {{and that he would}} be out {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

500|$|For {{the match}} against Crystal Palace on 14 February 2005, Wenger named an Arsenal squad {{that did not}} feature a single British player – a first in the club’s history. The team did not get off {{to the best of}} starts with Lehmann miskicking a <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> and Vieira losing {{possession}} routinely, but grew as the game went on and scored three goals in seven minutes. On his 200th league appearance, Henry scored in either half, with the result 5–1 to Arsenal. The result was somewhat overshadowed by the foreign makeup of the team; former player Paul Merson called it a [...] "joke" [...] and PFA chairman Gordon Taylor noted it was a [...] "worrying pattern for English football". When asked about his team selections, Wenger said: [...] "I don't look at the passport of people, I look at their quality and their attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor <b>back</b> <b>pass</b> from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
60|$|Next for the packing: as the ox {{lies on the}} ground, scrape a hole in {{the sand}} under his belly, and then, having laid a few skins on his <b>back,</b> <b>pass</b> a thong round him and them, several times; tie the ends fast, and, taking a stick, pass it through and twist it round, until the {{lashings}} are extremely tight, then let it be secured. Now let the ox go, and get quickly out of his way, in case he should be savage. When the ox gets up, he is sulky and ferocious by turns; and kicks, jumps, and bellows, but at last joins his companions.|$|E

50|$|Behind-the-back passes are passes dealt to {{a target}} behind the passer's back.
