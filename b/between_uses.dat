25|$|In {{the case}} of {{compressed}} air, or Nitrox mixtures, the exhaled gas is not valuable enough to justify the expense of recycling, but helium-based mixtures are considerably more expensive, and as the depth increases, the amount of gas used (in terms of mass, or number of molecules) increases {{in direct proportion to}} the ambient pressure. As a result, gas cost is a significant factor in deep open circuit diving with helium-based mixtures for long periods. By using a return line for the exhaled gas, it can be recompressed and used again, almost indefinitely. It is necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the reclaimed gas, but this is relatively cheap and uncomplicated. It is generally removed by a scrubber, which is a filter packed with a chemical which reacts with and removes the carbon dioxide from the gas. The reclaimed gas is also filtered to remove odour and microorganisms, and oxygen is added to the required concentration. The gas is compressed for storage <b>between</b> <b>uses.</b>|$|E

Respondents were asked to provide their outlook on commodity prices, methodologies for estimating prices, preference for different valuation techniques, and priority of various capital structuring decision factors. The analysis includes single and multi-variable regressions that demonstrate correlations between different survey categories. The analysis suggests that price outlook is on average higher than the public futures market, but the popularities of different price estimation methodologies have no correlation with outlook average price or probability density. Other cross-category findings of note were the positive correlation <b>between</b> <b>use</b> of hurdle rate analysis and priority of setting a target capital structure, the negative correlation <b>between</b> <b>use</b> of IRR/hurdle analysis and priority of comparable company debt levels, the negative correlation <b>between</b> <b>use</b> of NPV and priority of interest tax shields, and the significance of our bankruptcy cost multivariate regression model...|$|R
