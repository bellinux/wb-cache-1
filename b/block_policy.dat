40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding a specific target individual hiding in a social network. We propose a method for network vertex search that looks for the target vertex by sequentially examining the neighbors {{of a set of}} "known" vertices to which the target vertex may have connected. The objective is to find the target vertex as quickly as possible from amongst the neighbors of the known vertices. We model this type of search as successively drawing marbles from a set of urns, where each urn represents one of the known vertices and the marbles in each urn represent the respective vertex's neighbors. Using a dynamic programming approach, we analyze this model and show that there is always an optimal "block" policy, in which all of the neighbors of a known vertex are examined before moving on to another vertex. Surprisingly, this <b>block</b> <b>policy</b> result holds for arbitrary dependencies in the connection probabilities of the target vertex and known vertices. Furthermore, we give precise characterizations of the optimal <b>block</b> <b>policy</b> in two specific cases: (1) when the connections between the known vertices and the target vertex are independent, and (2) when the target vertex is connected to at most one known vertex. Finally, we provide some general monotonicity properties and discuss the relevance of our findings in social media and other applications. Comment: 38 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

Looking at policy areas in cross section, the authors find that policy areas in which policymakers' interests are more nearly aligned, and in which there is more rapid exogenous change, are associated with more successful efforts at reform, while in areas in which the interests of the Executive and the various veto players diverge, policy tends to stagnate. ...|$|E

Men emerged as a topic to be addressed within the context of emancipation, a process shaded by feelings of ambivalence.

The way in which policy incorporates these feelings is being studied in three social sectors - in education, care as a school subject; with the social partners; and in volunteer work and senior citizens societies. It appears that policy must rely on motivating and facilitating strategies. The latter condition-setting strategy reinforces the dilemmas of social choice that go {{hand in hand with the}} feelings of ambivalence.

40|$|The {{essays in}} this thesis explore the effects of {{legislative}} leaders on the behaviour of parliamentarians in the European Parliament and the UK House of Commons, {{and the consequences of}} this relationship for parliamentary outcomes. The first paper argues that when party leaders are motivated to maintain the voting cohesion of their legislative contingents, and when disciplinary resources are in short supply, leaders may <b>block</b> <b>policy</b> proposals that threaten to divide their members. Accordingly, as the preferences of party members become more diffuse, agenda setting party leaders will be able to maintain cohesion but the actions they take to do so may contribute to the overall level of gridlock in the legislature. I introduce new data and methods to evaluate these relationships in the European Parliament, where agenda control and ‘carrot and stick’ disciplinary powers are held by different sets of parliamentary actors. The second paper argues that by making the status quo less attractive and by increasing legislators’ tolerance to new policies, external crises empower leaders who have the ability to propose legislation. In the context of the European Union’s response to the 2008 financial crisis, I combine topic modelling with a two-stage least squares procedure to show that voting coalitions in the European Parliament changed after the crisis in ways consistent with the theoretical model. The implication of the analysis is that prointegration agenda-setters were able to pass legislation in the post-crisis period that would have been impossible to pass {{in the absence of the}} crisis. In the third paper, I argue that when members of previously under-represented groups are appointed to positions of high office within the legislature, they can serve as role models to their fellow group members. Using a difference-in-differences design, I demonstrate that the appointment of a female cabinet minister in the UK House of Commons leads to an increase in the participation of other female members of parliament in legislative debates. Furthermore, I develop a novel approach for measuring the influence of legislators in debate, and use this to show that female members of parliament also become more influential following the appointment of a female minister. In exploring the mechanisms that underpin this role-model effect, I introduce an additional quantitative measure which reveals that female ministers are more responsive to the speeches made by female legislators than are male ministers. Taken together, these papers provide important theoretical arguments and empirical evidence concerning the central role that leaders play in the legislative process...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} prevent {{undesired}} policy changes {{is a fundamental}} source of political power. In a series of recent publications, Cox and McCubbins have identified a key mechanism to <b>block</b> <b>policy</b> shifts in modern legislatures: {{the design of the}} legislative agenda. A major conclusion resulting from their research is that in most modern legislatures the majority party or coalition is granted the exclusive right to block bill access to the floor. Further, they explain that the need to solve coordination and cooperation problems within their ranks is what drives majority parties to seize all positions with agenda-setting authority in legislatures as diverse as Japan, Brazil, Germany, Italy, and the U. S. House and Senate. These authors recognize that in some legislatures scheduling rights are also granted to minority and opposition parties, an agenda-setting structure that they call consensual. However, they do not explore the characteristics of this type of agenda-setting configuration or the conditions that explain its emergence. This study aims at filling this gap using Argentina as a case study. It examines two types of evidence: the congressional rules that distribute formal gate-keeping authority over the legislative process, and patterns of legislative behavior consistent with one or another model of agenda control. The analysis focuses first on the landmark procedural reform that in 1963 created the scheduling committee, or Labor Parlamentaria, which I argue was critical in establishing a Chamber which both in norm and behavior conforms to the consensus agenda model. By granting small and large legislative blocs equivalent representation in Labor Parlamentaria, as well as equal voting power in its procedural decisions, the new scheduling committee amply distributed veto rights over the plenary schedule to majority and opposition parties. Further, measures for centralizing gate-keeping authority in the parties' leadership were passed to facilitate the inter-party negotiations that sustained the effective functioning of a consensual process of agenda formation. The analysis also identifies an explanation for the emergence of consensual agenda control, arguing that this institutional choice {{was the result of a}} ruling party who, unsure of its long term majority standing in the electorate, limited its own immediate power in the legislature to promote minority-protecting rules that would benefit it in the future. Over the intervening decades these rules have been locked-in, and they have long outlived the specific political situation that made them relevant. The analysis later examines behavior consistent with a consensual process of agenda formation, by adopting Cox and McCubbins' roll rate as a measure of agenda control by legislative parties. Contrary to traditional approaches that identify partisan rolls by observing legislators' behavior on the floor, the present study calculates roll rates using a new dataset of legislators' endorsements of alternative bill reports in committee. A great strength of this measure lies in the fact that, in the Argentine context, committee behavior is a better source than are floor votes for estimating the true policy preferences of legislators. Roll rates are computed for the main government and opposition parties in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies using an original dataset of every law passed between 1983 and 2002. The analysis shows that, consistent with the theory, the design of the legislative agenda in the Argentine legislature operates consensually. Finally, this study explores the effects of presidential decree authority on agenda-setting behavior within the Chamber of Deputies. Using a simple spatial model of legislative decision-making, it shows that, under certain distributions of preferences and status quo points, the threat of a decree, and more specifically, the credibility of such threat, alters the parties' strategic decision whether or not to block unwanted bills from reaching the assembly floor. The empirical results show that when the credibility of a decree threat is high [...] for example, on presidentially-initiated bills [...] the roll rates for the opposition party increase, suggesting that, on occasion, the president can seize the power to determine the congressional agenda from the legislative parties. In sum, this study shows how a specific set of legislative procedures, introduced under distinctive political circumstances in 1963, have been reproduced over nearly five decades, long outliving those circumstances. The legacy has been a form of legislative politics in Argentina, based on the joint design of the legislative agenda by majority and opposition parties, in which neither sees legislation passed that makes them worse off...|$|E

First, {{a common set}} of mechanisms that allow new systems to be implemented simply by defining new policies. Second, a structure for how policies, themselves, should be specified. In the case of distributed storage systems, PADS defines a data plane that pro-vides a fixed set of mechanisms for storing and trans-mitting data and maintaining consistency information. PADS requires a designer to define a control plane policy that specifies the system-specific policy for orches-trating flows of data among nodes. PADS then divides control plane policy into two parts: routing <b>policy</b> and <b>blocking</b> <b>policy.</b> The PADS prototype defines a concise interface between the data and control planes, it provides a declarative language for specifying routing policy, and it defines a simple interface for specifying <b>blocking</b> <b>policy.</b> We find that PADS greatly reduces the effort to design, implement, and modify distributed storage systems.

Most of my work has focused on distributed stream processing [2, 3, 6, 7, 8], but I have also explored distributed storage systems [1], and security in peer-to-peer content distribution networks [4]. My methodology is to start by developing a formal model, and then to use the model to guide the design and implementation of a working system. Starting with a formalism enables a clear understanding of the system’s behavior, and confidence in the correctness of its implementation. Building a working implementation helps to uncover details that the formalism elides, and provides an artifact that can be evaluated in practice. I am extremely collaborative, and have worked with researchers from several institutions including MIT, IBM [2, 3, 6, 7, 8], and Intel [5].

Performance analysis and functional verification, e. g. deadlock freedom, of heterogeneous QNs are in general difficult. We propose a framework for combined functional and performance analysis of heterogenous QNs with finite capacity and blocking based on an architectural description language (ADL) relying on stochastic process algebra (SPA). First, we define a library of parametrized models of finite capacity queue service centers supporting certain blocking mechanisms, as they are the basic building blocks of the QNs with blocking. This is done with Æmilia, an ADL for assembling in a controlled way the SPA descriptions {{of the behavior of}} the components of the service centers. Then, we construct Æmilia models of heterogeneous QNs with blocking by simply composing the basic QN building blocks described with Æmilia. Functional properties, such as deadlock freedom, can be automatically verified on the Æmilia models of the heterogeneous QNs with blocking. Likewise, the Markov chains underlying the heterogeneous QNs with blocking can be automatically derived from their Æmilia models. Moreover, we can easily define new and different <b>blocking</b> <b>policies</b> in a heterogeneous QN by providing the related Æmilia descriptions that can be compositionally integrated in the QN model and analyzed by the proposed approach...|$|R
