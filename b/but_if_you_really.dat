"A lot {{of people}} think of Shane as a clear villain and that he did a bad thing. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> analyze that situation, he’s a good guy and has done the right thing at every turn. Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E

[...] "Disgorging your cathartic trauma in the studio is an admirable pastime <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to compete with Corgan, Vedder or even 'im indoors, then the Top 40 is still where it's at." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} aired on December 3, 2009, on the CNBC documentary [...] "Inside the Mind of Google," [...] Schmidt was asked, [...] "People are treating Google like their most trusted friend. Should they be?" [...] He replied: [...] "I think judgment matters. If {{you have something}} that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be {{doing it in the}} first place. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time. And it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that information could be made available to the authorities." ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{an awfully}} {{long way to}} haul ice {{climbing}} gear, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> keen, <b>you</b> will be rewarded with ascents of the lovely Twin Falls (100 m, WI 4-5).|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>really</b> {{grasp the}} shameful grotesqueness {{of the old}} life, you will begin to {{appreciate}} the interpretation of old Mrs. Verrall's appearance that leapt up at once in my mind.|$|R

6000|$|... "Estimate {{its value}} in cash?"--Hugh sharply took her up. [...] "Ah, Lady Sandgate, I am in your debt, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> bargain for your {{precious}} information I'd rather {{we assume that}} I haven't enjoyed it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I? <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to know, {{the reason}} is simple enough. I have been used to solitude. I prefer it. If I cannot have it {{absolutely}} I can have it comparatively, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, uncle George!" [...] said Rollo, [...] "that is {{only your}} politeness. <b>But</b> then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{think that we}} ought to have some more company, perhaps the Parkmans are going to Holland, and we might go with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Try to talk {{sensible}} for once, Hudson," [...] he said. [...] "See here, I don't want to {{take advantage}} of your beastly temper, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> bent on selling the place, and not vaporing as usual, I'm open to make you an offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, sir," [...] the man answered. [...] "I {{will do so}} with pleasure. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> an {{ordinary}} tourist, sir,--as I have no doubt you are,--let this man drive you to Streuen, and take the train for the Austrian frontier.

6000|$|... "Well, now, that's {{very good}} of you, Meldrum," [...] said he heartily, shaking my {{hand across the}} table. [...] "It's not a thing that I should have ventured to propose, for it is asking {{a good deal of}} a casual visitor, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> mean it----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{not at all}} sure. Of course, I am not an Englishman, so it is of no {{particular}} interest to me, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> came over here on important affairs, I {{am not sure that}} I approve of your playing golf the day after your arrival." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{perfectly}} obvious {{person like}} myself," [...] the woman remarked, [...] "is always {{fascinated by the}} unusual. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> {{not going to give}} yourself away, Duchess, I am afraid I must move on. One hates to leave your beautifully cool rooms. Shall I see you to-night, I wonder, at Esholt House?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Madeleine {{looked at}} him doubtfully for an instant, and then said with a sudden {{simplicity}} and cheerfulness: [...] "Oh, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> sorry it is all right. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are horribly sorry {{it is all the}} better. You have only to go and tell the priest so and he will give you God out of his own hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> so, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{were the}} only person that did {{understand}} her. No doubt what she did was quite right, seeing that she was a saint; but we sinners would have thought it very wicked to have made such a will, and then to have trusted to the generosity of another person after we were dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, no; don't believe her, Dr Crofts. It was not so;--I {{think it}} was not so. Mind you, I can say nothing as coming from her. She has not told me her own mind. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> love her, she will be mad to refuse you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} star. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have no {{inclination}} to sleep, let us {{sit down and}} have a little conversation; or perhaps we had better take a stroll. It is a warm night." [...] As he spoke, Mr. Beckendorff gently put his arm within Vivian's, and led him down the steps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Mr. Lane," [...] she begged, [...] "wait for {{a little}} time before you nurse these sad thoughts, and when you know how {{impossible}} what you ask is, it will seem easier. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> care to hear something, if it would really please you sometimes {{to think of it}} when you are alone and you remember this little foolishness of yours, let me tell you, if I may, that I am sorry--I am very sorry." ...|$|E
25|$|All I ask {{of you is}} one thing... I {{ask this}} {{particularly}} {{of the young people}} who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> work <b>really</b> hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I see, what I saw," [...] Maria returned, [...] "is {{that you}} dressed up even the virtue. You were wonderful--you were beautiful, as I've had the honour of telling <b>you</b> before; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>really</b> to know," [...] she sadly confessed, [...] "I never quite knew WHERE you were. There were moments," [...] she explained, [...] "when you {{struck me as}} grandly cynical; there were others when you struck me as grandly vague." ...|$|R
5000|$|BYTE in 1985 {{described}} the Husky as [...] "the first lap-held computer".

6000|$|... "The truth! My dear Sir George! Supposing {{that the}} {{whereabouts}} of your charming young friend had been known to me, do you suppose that I should have permitted myself to be bullied into disclosing it? Forgive me if I speak plainly, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> wished for information which you supposed that I had, your method of seeking it put you at once out of court. A French gentleman does not permit himself to be bullied." ...|$|E
60|$|Bobby Coon {{had waited}} so long {{that it was almost}} more than he could do to be patient any longer, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want a thing, it is worth waiting for, and so Bobby gave a great sigh and tried to make himself more comfortable. At last Mistah Buzzard came sailing down {{straight}} for the tall dead tree. With two or three flaps of his great wings he settled down on his favorite perch and looked down at Bobby Coon.|$|E
6000|$|He drew a long breath. [...] "They're a bit affectionate, you know," [...] he murmured, {{stroking}} his beardless chin in hesitation. [...] "She's a hot 'un, Sissie is. She pitches it pretty warm on the affection-stop, I can tell you. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{think you can}} give the other Johnnie a cut {{on the head with}} her letters--well, in the interests of true love, which never DOES run smooth, I don't mind letting you have a squint, as my friend, at one of her charming billy-doos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, mamma. I think I {{might have}} been better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had had a little more {{patience}} with me, <b>but</b> even now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> wish me to stay at home I will do so. I can write again to uncle and tell him that I have changed my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bomford is {{very fond}} of money," [...] she continued. [...] "He is fonder of money, I think, than he is of me. And then," [...] she added, her voice sinking to a whisper, [...] "there is Garden Green. Of course, I do not know much about these things, <b>but</b> I suppose <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> wanted to, and {{spent a great deal}} of money, you could buy your freedom, couldn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} {{received}} your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee {{that a little}} writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean {{to let you know}} that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham continued: [...] "I don't see {{any harm}} in hoping that he'll take a fancy to her. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think it won't do {{to mix the}} two things, I advise you not to take Mr. Corey into the business. It will do all very well if he DOES take a fancy to her; but if he don't, you know how you'll feel about it. And I know you well enough, Silas, {{to know that you}} can't do him justice if that happens. And I don't think it's right you should take this step unless you're pretty sure. I can see that you've set your heart on this thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was a gude servant o' the town," [...] {{said the}} Bailie, [...] "though {{he was an}} ower {{free-living}} man. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think this rascal Ratcliffe could do us ony service in discovering these malefactors, I would insure him life, reward, and promotion.

Queen Caroline, God bless her! is a woman--at least I judge sae, and it's nae treason to speak my mind sae far--and ye maybe ken as weel as I do, for ye hae a housekeeper, though ye arena a married man, that women are wilfu', and downa bide a slight.

6000|$|... "It {{was a great}} success. So I went on, {{and when}} the {{journals}} were done, I used to read other things, and picked up books for their library, and helped in any way I could, while learning to know them better and give them confidence in me. They are proud and shy, just as we should be <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>REALLY</b> want to be friends and don't mind rebuffs now and then, they come to trust and like you, and {{there is so much}} to do for them one never need sit idle any more. I won't give names, as they don't like it, nor tell how I tried to serve them, but it is very sweet and good for me to have found this work, and to know that each year I can do it better and better. So I feel encouraged and am very glad I began, as I hope you all are. Now, who comes next?" ...|$|E
30|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{stop and}} <b>really</b> think about it, Microsoft {{the company is}} {{probably}} more of a marvel of human creativity and ingenuity than any of its products. Before Gates and Allen started Microsoft, pure software companies didn’t exist. Gates identified a business opportunity in what most computer companies saw as a necessary but nettlesome accoutrement to the hardware that pulled in the big bucks. In the end he created a masterpiece (Stewart et al. 1999).|$|R
