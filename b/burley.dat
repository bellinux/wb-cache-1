5|$|George <b>Burley</b> was {{appointed}} manager in January 2008. <b>Burley</b> suffered from disruptions to the squad. During a goalless home draw against Norway, <b>Burley</b> substituted in Chris Iwelumo, who missed an open goal from 3 yards. Striker Kris Boyd, {{who had been}} left on the bench, announced his retirement from international football. <b>Burley</b> dropped Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor from the team for a qualifying match against Iceland after it was reported they had been drinking through {{the night at the}} team hotel. The two players made gestures at photographers while sitting on the substitutes' bench during the match against Iceland and were then banned by the SFA. Despite failing to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the SFA initially decided to keep <b>Burley</b> in the job, but then decided to dismiss him after a heavy defeat in a friendly match against Wales.|$|E
5|$|Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin is an {{artificial}} {{lake in the}} centre of Canberra, the capital of Australia. It was completed in 1963 after the Molonglo River—which ran between the city centre and Parliamentary Triangle—was dammed. It is named after Walter <b>Burley</b> Griffin, the American architect who won the competition to design the city of Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Canberra is {{a planned}} {{city and the}} inner-city area was {{originally}} designed by Walter <b>Burley</b> Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burley's</b> {{associates}} {{were all}} closely {{involved in these}} attempts at canonisation (none of which was successful). One was Richard de Bury, a bibliophile and patron {{of the arts and}} sciences, who became <b>Burley's</b> patron and at whose request Bury translated some works of Aristotle into English.|$|R
50|$|<b>Burley's</b> latest novel, Betrayal, was {{released}} in May 2012.|$|R
60|$|He was {{interrupted}} by <b>Burley's</b> quick and authoritative interference.|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{the growth}} of Canberra and the ACT was slow. The American {{architect}} Walter <b>Burley</b> Griffin won the competition to design Australia's new capital and was appointed to oversee its construction. He was frequently dogged by disputes with Australian authorities and the onset of World War I, which hindered progress. In 1921, <b>Burley</b> Griffin was fired, and multiple planning bodies were established, but achieved little, {{in part due to}} the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Lyall's successor, George <b>Burley,</b> {{was unable}} to turn team {{performances}} around, and Ipswich suffered a Premiership record defeat, 9–0, at Manchester United, {{on their way to}} relegation. Back in the second tier of the league, <b>Burley</b> led the club to three consecutive promotion playoffs, but they were to endure defeats in all three semi-finals. Ipswich finally returned to the Premiership in 2000 after coming from behind to beat Barnsley 4–2 in the last Division One playoff final at Wembley Stadium. Ipswich performed well in the Premiership in their first season with Burley's side finishing in an impressive fifth place—being pipped by Liverpool {{on the last day of}} the season for a place in the Champions League. Consolation was a UEFA Cup place and FA Premier League Manager of the Year Award for <b>Burley.</b>|$|E
5|$|Revolt also flared in {{neighbouring}} Kent. Sir Simon de <b>Burley,</b> a close {{associate of}} both Edward III {{and the young}} Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf {{from one of his}} estates. <b>Burley</b> sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which <b>Burley</b> would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter. From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the gaol, and then onto Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without a fight and Belling was freed.|$|E

50|$|Elgar took Miss <b>Burleys</b> advice, and set {{the poem}} as {{narratives}} and recitatives interspersed with orchestral interludes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Burley's</b> {{acting career}} began in 2005 when she {{appeared}} as Michelle in the Dominic Savage film Love + Hate.|$|R
5|$|She {{was buried}} in the family vault at Ravenstone, Buckinghamshire and five royal dukes {{attended}} her funeral. Her youngest daughter was allowed to maintain their apartments at St James's. Her will was mainly portioned out between her three surviving children. Her memorial by Francis Leggatt Chantrey (1820), is in Holy Cross Church, <b>Burley,</b> adjacent to <b>Burley</b> House, the Rutland mansion of her son, George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea.|$|E
5|$|Weston Park is {{situated}} on a peninsula near {{the western end}} of Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin. The park includes swimming areas, children's play equipment and wading pools, and a miniature railway, and is a popular barbecue spot on weekends. Weston Park forms part of a string of parks that line the southern shore of Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin; other parks include Yarralumla Bay, Lennox Gardens (incorporating a Japanese garden named Canberra Nara Park) and Stirling Park.|$|E
5|$|Westridge {{was renamed}} Yarralumla in the 1950s. In 1963, Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin was filled and Yarralumla was {{expanded}} to include Westlake, which had up until then been part of Acton.|$|E
50|$|The Leeds and Liverpool Canal and River Aire form <b>Burley's</b> {{southern}} boundary, and {{are popular}} with walkers, cyclists and fishermen.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, he {{was called}} up to George <b>Burley's</b> first Scotland squad {{alongside}} fellow on loan Plymouth player Russell Anderson.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{several former}} Terrapins were signed by NFL teams as free agents {{shortly after the}} draft. These {{consisted}} of: linebacker Dave Philistin, center Edwin Williams, wide receiver Isaiah Williams, defensive end Jeremy Navarre, offensive tackle Scott <b>Burley,</b> linebacker Chase Bullock, offensive tackle Dane Randolph, and defensive lineman Dean Muhtadi.|$|E
5|$|At most {{swimming}} locations around Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin {{there are}} fenced-in swimming areas for safety. In {{the more popular}} areas, there are also safety lockers with life belts and emergency phones for requesting help. Between 1962 and 1991, seven people died from drowning.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Maryland {{was able}} to hold the nation's third-ranked rushing offense to just 114yards on the ground. Nevada quarterback Kaepernick, who ran for 1,115yards, was held to just 19rushing yards, 15of which were gained during a {{touchdown}} run. Two players made their first career interceptions: true freshman safety Kenny Tate and senior defensive back Jeff Allen. Tate's interception in the Maryland end zone prevented a Nevada score, while Allen's interception with 4:54remaining helped seal the victory for Maryland. Offensive lineman Scott <b>Burley</b> forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall, who had recovered a third-down fumble by Turner. <b>Burley</b> subsequently recovered the forced fumble and gave Maryland a first down.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>Burley's</b> {{conclusions}} {{have been}} questioned by Okusitino Māhina, lecturer in Pacific Political Economy and Pacific Arts Anthropology at the University of Auckland.|$|R
40|$|After having {{summarized}} {{the results of}} contemporary scholarship, the paper focuses on those features that might have attracted medieval readers, although <b>Burley's</b> expositio is not an original work in the strictest sense of the term. It shoould rather be read in a tradition, and especially on {{the background of the}} so-called Aquinas- Peter of Auvergne commentary, which has been identified as its main source. The paper compares methodically <b>Burley's</b> text with ist model, evaluating changes and shifts. Alessandro D. Conti {{is the editor of the}} volume...|$|R

5|$|Statistically {{the most}} {{successful}} manager was Alex McLeish, who won seven of the ten games during his tenure. Discounting managers who took charge of less than ten games, the least successful manager was George <b>Burley,</b> with just three wins in 14 games.|$|E
50|$|Scotland were {{defeated}} 3-0 in Amsterdam by the Netherlands, but then recovered by beating Iceland 2-1 at home. The team lost 4-0 to Norway in their next match, putting <b>Burley's</b> bid to take Scotland to the World Cup {{for the first}} time since 1998 in jeopardy. Qualification to the play-offs remained in Scotland's hands, with the team needing to win the two remaining fixtures to be guaranteed second place. Scottish FA chief Gordon Smith moved to confirm that <b>Burley's</b> position was not under threat, but said that much depended on the final two matches.|$|R

5|$|The Olympics {{were then}} halted {{due to the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. There were five skiers, two cross-country and three downhill—who either failed to finish or whose results were unknown—three figure skaters and one speed skater. Adrian Swan and Nancy <b>Burley,</b> who finished 10th and 14th in figure skating, {{were the only two}} Australia competitors to place in the top 20, although neither placed in {{the top half of the}} field. <b>Burley</b> and fellow figure skater Gweneth Molony were the first two women to represent Australia at the Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} of Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin began in 1960 with the clearing of vegetation from the floodplain of the Molonglo River. The {{trees on the}} golf course and along the river were pulled up, along with the various sports grounds and houses.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} creeks, {{including}} Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, {{flow into the}} Molonglo and Murrumbidgee. Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes Ginninderra and Tuggeranong. Until recently the Molonglo River {{had a history of}} sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake <b>Burley</b> Griffin.|$|E
