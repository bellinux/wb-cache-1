In a looser context, it can be said that small-scale fisheries mainly rely on skill, whereas <b>bottom</b> <b>trawlers</b> rely more on technology. This study concludes that there is space for improvement in efficiency, mainly for small-scale vessels, which could allow the achievement of the same level of output by using reduced inputs...|$|R

50|$|Gold {{was easily}} {{extracted}} from the rivers, by scooping and silling the river soil and gravel. The <b>bottom</b> <b>trawler</b> method was also developed to extract more gold at once. This was the pulling of metal baskets and rakes across the river beds to stir up gold, and scoop out gravel that was rich in gold. It was later, when the gold in the river bed wasn't as plentiful, that new mining techniques were being developed to extract gold more efficiently from the ground. One of the main, and also most destructive methods was that of hydraulic mining. This involved the redirecting {{of water from the}} river into a narrow channel, into a large canvas hose, and iron nozzle. Then these water canons which were called monitors it would shoot a very high pressure stream that would break apart hillsides. The water, slurry, and debris, mostly gravel would flow over large sluices and drainage tunnels. This was also when mercury was beginning to be used to help extract the gold from the masses of ore and silt.|$|E

40|$|Information {{acquired}} by fishermen while fishing {{play a crucial}} role in their decision-making process. Those are used to form the basis for update of beliefs on productivity of a range of available fishing grounds while acting in an uncertain environment. In this paper, we focus on the formation of fishermen's beliefs about the productivity of fishing grounds based on signals obtained through harvest activity. We task ourselves with better understanding of the impact of prior experience on the at-sea day-to-day decision with respect to location choice. We investigate how obtained signals are propagated over time and space considering knowledge decay with increasing spatial and temporal separation, hence, incorporating intertemporal and spatial correlation between gained experience and future expectations. The parameters of the updating process are derived by fitting a dynamic Bayesian model to available data of location choices. The signal propagation parameters are derived by fitting the multinomial logit model to simulated expectations data paired with observed discrete location choices. Our motivation is that successful fisheries management must be able to accurately predict the response of fishermen to fishery regulations with particular attention paid to flexible technologies where individuals can adjust effort and alter fishing behavior. Good understanding of fishermen location choice and location adjustment flexibility can contribute substantially to a design of management practices with spatial components.

40|$|The {{fishing grounds}} of the Patagonian Shelf support {{some of the most}} {{important}} fisheries in the world. The great abundance of marine resources among parallels 35 º and 54 º South, is associated with the Subtropical Convergence formed by the Brazil and Falkland/Malvinas currents. The mixing of the flow of La Plata River and the western branch of the Falkland/Malvinas Current generates areas of high plankton production on the shelf. Hakes (Merluccius hubbsi and Merluccius australis) and cephalopods (Illex argentinus and Loligo gahi) have been found the main commercial species, with important amounts of accompanying species in the catches such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), Kingclip (Genypterus blacodes), Hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), Red cod (Salilota australis), Southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), etc. These fisheries are currently among the most important to the Spanish <b>bottom</b> <b>trawler</b> freezing fleet that has around 40 vessels fishing in this area, besides another 20 that operate in joint ventures sailing Falkland flag. It is estimated that this fleet generates approximately 2, 000 direct offshore jobs, and more than 10, 000 indirect onshore jobs. This paper presents results from the EC Study Project 99 / 016 “Data collection for stock assessment of two hakes (Merluccius hubbsi and M. australis) in international and Falkland waters of the SW Atlantic”.

40|$|International audienceModern {{sediment}} deposits on continental margins form a vast {{reservoir of}} particulate matter that is regularly affected by resuspension processes. Resuspension by bottom trawling on shelves with strong fishing activity can modify {{the scale of}} natural disturbance by waves and currents. Recent field data show {{that the impact of}} bottom trawls on fine sediment resuspension per unit surface is comparable with that of the largest storms. We assessed the impact of both natural and anthropogenic processes on the dispersal of riverborne particles and shelf sediments on the Gulf of Lion shelf. We performed realistic numerical simulations of resuspension and transport forced by currents and waves or by a fleet of bottom trawlers. Simulations were conducted for a 16 -month period (January 1998 –April 1999) to characterise the seasonal variability. The sediment dynamics takes into account bed armoring, ripple geometry and the cohesive and non-cohesive characteristics of the sediments. Essential but uncertain parameters (clay content, erosion fluxes and critical shear stress for cohesive sediment) were set with existing data. Resuspension by waves and currents was controlled by shear stress, whereas resuspension by trawls was controlled by density and distribution of the <b>bottom</b> <b>trawler</b> fleet. Natural resuspension by waves and currents mostly occurred during short seasonal episodes, and was concentrated on the inner shelf. Trawling-induced resuspension, in contrast, occurred regularly throughout the year and was concentrated on the outer shelf. The total annual erosion by trawls (5. 6 × 106 t y− 1, t for metric tonnes) was four orders of magnitude lower than the erosion induced by waves and currents (35. 3 × 109 t y− 1). However the net resuspension (erosion/deposition budget) for trawling (0. 4 × 106 t y− 1) was only one order of magnitude lower than that for waves and currents (9. 2 × 106 t y− 1). Off-shelf export concerned the finest fraction of the sediment (clays and fine silts) and took place primarily at the southwestern end of the Gulf. Off-shelf transport was favoured during the winter 1999 by a very intense episode of dense shelf water cascading. Export of sediment resuspended by trawls (0. 4 × 106 t y− 1) was one order of magnitude lower than export associated with natural resuspension (8. 5 × 106 t y− 1). Trawling-induced resuspension is thought to represent one-third of the total export of suspended sediment from the shelf. A simulation combining both resuspension processes reveals no significant changes in resuspension and export rates compared with the sum of each individual process, suggesting the absence of interference between both processes...|$|E
