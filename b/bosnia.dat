5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina. It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for <b>Bosnia.</b> An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E
5|$|Operation Deny Flight was a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) {{operation}} that began on 12 April 1993 as {{the enforcement of}} a United Nations (UN) no-fly zone over <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina. The United Nations and NATO later expanded {{the mission of the}} operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in <b>Bosnia</b> and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in <b>Bosnia.</b> Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased dramatically {{in the first few}} months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum on <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina to support the HVO.|$|E

5|$|The reforms became firmly {{rooted in}} <b>Bosnia</b> during the 1860s, when the Ottoman {{governor}} (vali) {{of the province}} was Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, {{though most of the}} changes proceeded at a slow pace. According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law, each vilayet (first-order administrative division) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette. The Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of <b>Bosnia,</b> published in 1865, promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet, and Article9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital. Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house. At that time, the press in the Principality of Serbia and in South Slavic parts of the Austrian Empire sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in <b>Bosnia.</b> Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in <b>Bosnia</b> also disseminated nationalist sentiment, which Osman Pasha saw as anti-Ottoman. In his view, the national movement of the Serbs in <b>Bosnia</b> presented a danger for Ottoman state interests. To protect their hold on <b>Bosnia,</b> the Ottomans sought to promote the idea of a unitary Bosnian nation, thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia's Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the conference, Mihailović sent Ostojić to {{establish}} a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south-eastern <b>Bosnia.</b> Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in <b>Bosnia,</b> which was to use Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region, northern <b>Bosnia</b> and northern Dalmatia. The plan was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailović believed was imminent. The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western <b>Bosnia</b> and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. The plan was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović's headquarters in Montenegro, and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, the plan assumed that Mihailović's forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western <b>Bosnia,</b> but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East <b>Bosnia</b> not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern <b>Bosnia</b> had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E

5|$|As {{far as the}} Germans were concerned, Operation Hackfleisch was a {{moderate}} success, with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken. It delayed, but did not prevent, the Partisans' advance into Serbia. In order to allow the 7th SS Division to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central <b>Bosnia,</b> both I/28 and III/28 were placed {{under the command of}} that division for the period of 8–17 August 1944. During the remainder of August 1944, the rump of the division fought hard to keep the Partisans out of the security zone. The Partisan 11th Krajina Division and 38th <b>Bosnia</b> Division quickly infiltrated into {{the southern part of the}} security zone and the 27th East <b>Bosnia</b> Division crossed into the area north-west of Srebrenica and drove towards Bratunac. After a series of rapid redeployments and battalion and regimental attacks, the division scattered the 11th Krajina Division and mauled the 27th East <b>Bosnia</b> Division.|$|E

This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, the Bosnian Serb army bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations.|$|E

At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E
5|$|By 1995, the ARBiH and the HVO had {{developed}} into better-organised forces employing comparably {{large numbers of}} artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications. The VRS was not capable of penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics, for instance in the Battle of Orašje in May and June 1995. In August 1995, {{after the fall of}} most of the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia during Operation Storm, the HV shifted its focus to western <b>Bosnia.</b> The shift was motivated by the desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border, establish Croatia as a regional power and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War. The government of <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal of securing western <b>Bosnia,</b> as well as the largest Bosnian Serb-held city, Banja Luka.|$|E
5|$|By February 1943, Himmler's {{ideals of}} Waffen-SS racial purity had been {{significantly}} diluted. The first division {{to be raised}} by Berger's recruiters that was clearly outside the Waffen-SS racial and ethnic strictures used manpower from the Muslim community of <b>Bosnia.</b> The 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) first went into action in February 1944, and was of limited value, especially outside of its area of operations in eastern <b>Bosnia.</b> While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern <b>Bosnia,</b> the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern <b>Bosnia</b> left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by {{the spring and summer}} of 1944.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{high rates}} of {{desertion}} from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to <b>Bosnia</b> and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to <b>Bosnia</b> from Hungary.|$|E
5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina. In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina, most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E
