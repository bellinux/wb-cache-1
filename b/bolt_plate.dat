40|$|The Underground Mine Education Center (UMEC) and World Museum of Mining {{facilities}} {{began as}} shallow underground mines in the 1880 ’s during the mining boom that populated Butte, Montana. The UMEC is a multi-disciplinary facility that provides an on-campus underground laboratory environment {{and a place}} for students to learn and practice practical underground mining techniques; therefore, the longevity of the facility is important to Montana Tech. The goal of this project {{is to develop a}} Ground Control Management Plan (GCMP) for the UMEC and World Museum of Mining facilities. The World Museum of Mining (Orphan Girl) and UMEC (Orphan Boy) facilities are unique due to the shallow depth of underground mining activities that resumed in 2005 and in 2012, respectively. The Orphan Boy and Orphan Girl mines are connected at the 100 -level. Ground support methods in these facilities consist of historic timber square sets in older workings, rock bolts with mesh, and some shotcreted areas in current workings. The GCMP contains a schedule for routine observational checks of the support systems to inspect for mesh tension, wire breakage, rock <b>bolt</b> <b>plate</b> bending, bolt head deformation, and shotcrete cracking (Carlisle, 2015). The GCMP defines a list of minimum geotechnical standards to uphold while developing new headings in these facilities. To construct the GCMP, geologic and geotechnical profiles for each mine were developed to aid in identifying areas of weakness due to rock alteration and/or adverse jointing caused by faulting or seismic activity. Locations in the UMEC that are believed stable regions will become permanent control survey regions to allow accurate measurements to monitor weaker areas for movement. A scanline survey (SLS) was conducted to determine the general direction joints in the granite occur. A joint surface map was created using Maptek Vulcan software. Rock support assessments based on the joint surfaces were completed using Rocscience DIPS software...|$|E
50|$|However, {{because it}} mainly {{manufactured}} guitars under contract, {{the role of}} Matsumoku was largely unknown outside of Japan's guitar making circles until its name began appearing on neck <b>bolt</b> <b>plates,</b> headstocks, and sound hole labels in the late 1970s.|$|R
40|$|In this research, both {{experimental}} and numerical methods {{were used to}} investigate the fatigue behaviour of <b>bolted</b> <b>plates.</b> In the experimental part of the research, a holed plate was clamped using a bolt and a nut, and then tested under axial cyclic load in a fatigue testing machine. In order to obtain S-N curves and investigate the direct effect of the isolated clamping force on the fatigue behaviour of the <b>bolted</b> <b>plates,</b> three batches of specimens each subjected to different clamping forces were fatigue tested. The clamping forces were obtained experimentally from the compressive axial strain of a steel bush which was placed between the nut and the plate. In the numerical method, to determine the stress and strain distributions due to combined clamping force and axial load in plate, 3 D finite element models were generated using a numerical package. Numerical simulation and experimental {{results showed that the}} fatigue life of <b>bolted</b> <b>plates</b> improve because of the compressive stresses created around the plate hole due to clamping force. The life improvement was greatest at the high cycle fatigue life region of the S-N curves. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{material}} {{is very interesting}} for its use as the sole material {{in the construction of}} structures because of its remarkable lightness, which reduces seismic forces; its ease of assembly; and its durability. All-FRP structures use bolted connections to form nodes between columns and beams, particularly steel bolts. This research focuses on the use of FRP pultruded plates instead of web and flange cleats for bolted beam-to-column joints. Currently, angles and bolts between columns and beams are widely employed, whereas <b>bolted</b> <b>plates</b> are still a novelty. Both experimental and numerical studies of two different configurations of bolted connections made by pultruded plates and C-shape FRP profiles demonstrated that the plates have considerable influence on the moment-rotation response of joints so that the joint's failure mode involves mainly the <b>bolted</b> <b>plate.</b> The experimental program in this paper determined the initial stiffness of each connection, the ultimate moment capacity, and the rotation associated with the ultimate strength. These results were then compared against numerical predictions obtained using a commercial code for finite-element analysis...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{topography}} {{has long}} been considered {{a key factor in}} the performance of many contact applications including thermal contact resistance. However, essentially all analytical and numerical models of thermal contact resistance and thermal contact conductance either neglect surface topography or make simplifications and assumptions {{about the nature of the}} surface. This work combines measured surface geometry with an iterative thermal/structural finite element model to more accurately predict microscopic and macroscopic thermal contact resistance. A commercial power electronics module which exhibits both macroscopic surface form and micro scale surface roughness is analyzed using three different macro scale surface models to verify the accuracy of the model and to demonstrate the impact of geometric surface assumptions. Finally, the factors influencing the thermal/structural behavior of <b>bolted</b> <b>plates</b> are examined and recommendations for reducing both contact resistance and the overall thermal resistance of <b>bolted</b> <b>plate</b> systems are presented. by Mary Kathryn Thompson.

30|$|Further {{improvements}} for {{estimating the}} position of the <b>bolt</b> <b>plates</b> could be realised by incorporating different feature sets into the visual analytics approach. For example, ambiguities associated with the class of target identification methods based on signal strength alone could be significantly mitigated through the use of resonant frequency target identification techniques (Hargrave et al. 2013), which have remarkable properties for aspect-independent imaging. The features extracted using this technique could be incorporated into the classifier algorithm to further refine the discrimination results.|$|R

30|$|We have {{described}} a novel radar-based system for underground mine machine localisation. The approach avoids {{the need to}} install additional reference infrastructure by exploiting mining structures already present in the underground mining environment, such as <b>bolt</b> <b>plates</b> and cut-throughs, to generate feature-rich radar signal returns. Different probabilistic data processing techniques were explored {{in order to provide}} estimates of the equipment’s along-track and across-track position. These estimates were subsequently validated through the use of laser range scanners and found to be in close agreement. The success of these trials has spurred development of a modified system that is now ready for integration into an operational mine machine automation system. Work is ongoing to improve the classifier algorithm performance with the view to incorporating these results into an operational automation system.|$|R
