25|$|The 1996 route saw a {{decrease}} in the amount of kilometers that were dedicated to time trials and the removal of the climbing time trial that had been a staple in years past. Lluis Simon of El Punt felt that the penultimate stage that crossed Mendola, Tonale Pass, Gavia Pass, Mortirolo, and Aprica would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> of the race. Paolo Viberti, a writer for El País, believed that the race would be decided by the final week when the race entered the Alps and the lengthy individual time trial.|$|E
25|$|Rock climber Peter Croft began what {{continues}} to be a long and illustrious climbing career in Squamish in the late 1970s.

More recently, Brad Zdanivsky became the first quadriplegic ever to reach the summit on 31 July 2005.

25|$|The climb of Alpe d'Huez {{has become}} one of the more noted {{mountain}} stages. During the 2004 Tour de France it was the scene of a 15.5km mountain time trial on the 16th stage. Riders complained of abusive spectators who threatened their progress up the climb. Mont Ventoux is often claimed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> in the Tour because of the harsh conditions. Another notable mountain stage frequently featured climbs the Col du Tourmalet, the most visited mountain in the history of the Tour. Col du Galibier is the most visited mountain in the Alps. The 2011 Tour de France stage to Galibier marked the 100th anniversary of the mountain in the Tour and also boasted the highest finish altitude ever: 2,645 m. Some mountain stages have become memorable because of the weather. An example is a stage in 1996 Tour de France from Val-d'Isère to Sestriere. A snowstorm at the start area led to a shortening of the stage from 190 to just 46km.|$|E
25|$|After another league title, {{this time}} with Beitar Jerusalem in 1996-97, Zohar was sold to English club Crystal Palace for £1,200,000 but quickly {{returned}} to Israel after failing to make an impression at the club. In a league match against Southampton, Zohar stepped up to take a penalty kick in place of regular penalty kick taker, Bruce Dyer. His weakly hit shot cost Palace the win and so his reputation with the supporters was forever tainted. His dismal performances for Palace caused him to be voted by the fans {{as one of the}} top ten worst signings. In April 2012 Talk Sport magazine rated Zohar as Crystal Palace's Worst Foreign player. After returning from England, he was signed by Maccabi Haifa, as a replacement for Ukrainian midfielder Serhiy Kandaurov, who was sold to Portugal's Benfica. Haifa manager, Daniel Brailovsky was disappointed with Zohar's performances during practices and decided to let him languish on the bench during the season. After a falling out with Brailovsky, Zohar joined Maccabi Tel Aviv for his third stint but suffered an injury that saw him off the pitch for about 10 months. In retrospect, he later credited this injury to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> part of his footballing career.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's first {{choices for}} the boat's crew were Worsley and Tom Crean—the latter, he said, [...] "begged to go". Crean was a shipmate from the Discovery Expedition, 1901–04, and had also been with Scott's Terra Nova Expedition in 1910–13, where he had {{distinguished}} himself on the fatal polar march. Shackleton was confident that Crean would persevere to the bitter end, and had great faith in Worsley's skills as a navigator, especially his ability to work out positions in difficult circumstances. Worsley later wrote: [...] "We knew it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> thing we had ever undertaken, for the Antarctic winter had set in, and {{we were about to}} cross one of the worst seas in the world".|$|E

Stepeck searched Los Angeles {{and was unable to}} find a suitable bed. He had to order the bed from a specialized furniture store in San Francisco. Mulder's paycheck and envelope were created after several calls to the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. The checks were made to be as realistic as possible without looking too convincing. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, the police cruisers were all turned off, because the combined noise of the cars would drown out dialogue. To ensure their flashing lights, car coordinator Danny Briggs installed battery chargers in the cars.|$|E
500|$|Forest Whitaker had {{suggested}} McAvoy to director Kevin Macdonald {{for the role}} of Nicholas Garrigan in 2006's Academy Award-winning low-budgeted The Last King of Scotland. McAvoy portrayed a Scottish doctor who becomes the personal physician to dictator Idi Amin (played by Whittaker) while in Uganda. While the film is based on factual events of Amin's rule, the details of the story and the character McAvoy played are fictional and adapted from Giles Foden's acclaimed 1998 novel. McAvoy assessed his character to be a [...] "completely selfish prick". An overwhelmed McAvoy fainted during his first take of what would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> scene for him to shoot, Nicholas's torture. McAvoy was named Best Actor of the year by Scotland's own BAFTA Awards, where the film swept the major categories, and received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The film received three awards, including the Outstanding British Film of the Year. This was accompanied by praise for McAvoy's performance.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Dale {{replaced}} Peter Davison in {{the lead}} role of King Arthur in the London West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at the Palace Theatre. He accepted the role {{because he was a}} fan of Monty Python and considered that [...] "life's too short" [...] for him to have turned down a West End part. Although he has seen all of the shows and the other films, Dale had never seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail (from which Spamalot is [...] "lovingly ripped off") and had to buy a copy to prepare for the role. It was not his first experience in musical theatre because he appeared in a 1984 Australian production of Applause, but Dale found the comic timing of the part to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> task. [...] "On stage, the battle is to find all of the humorous moments and not skip over them. [...] There's an art to Python humour and I'm aiming to try and get every single joke just right." [...] He was succeeded in the role by Sanjeev Bhaskar on 23 June 2008.|$|E

500|$|While filming The Dressmaker, Winslet {{became aware}} of an {{upcoming}} biopic of Steve Jobs penned by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle. Adamant to play Jobs' marketing chief and confidant Joanna Hoffman, she campaigned for the part by sending a picture of herself dressed as Hoffman to the film's producer. Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role, is told in three acts, each depicting a key milestone in Jobs' career. In preparation, Winslet spent time with Hoffman, and worked with a dialect coach to adopt Hoffman's accent, a mixture of Armenian and Polish, which she considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> one of her career. The cast rehearsed each act like a play and filmed it in sequence. Winslet collaborated closely with Fassbender, and their off-screen relationship mirrored the dynamic between Jobs and Hoffman. The film received {{some of the best}} reviews of Winslet's career but was a box office flop. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star commended her for finding [...] "strength and grace" [...] in her part, and Gregory Ellwood of HitFix thought that she had provided Hoffman with a [...] "gravitas that isn’t always in the script". She won the Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actress, and received her seventh Oscar nomination for it.|$|E

[...] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Stop-motion animation may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> and most tedious job in Hollywood, but the makers of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride deserve a couple of years in Tahiti celebrating their effort." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an instant classic."

500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|E
