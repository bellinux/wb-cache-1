5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. <b>By</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E

5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E
5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E

5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in buoyancy) <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive.

When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered <b>by</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E
