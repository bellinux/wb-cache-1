Chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease of amphibians, {{is caused by}} the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and has been linked to global declines in amphibians. Results We monitored the prevalence of Bd for four years in the Northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, which is critically imperiled in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The prevalence of Bd initially increased and then remained constant {{over the last three years}} of the study. Young of the year emerging from breeding ponds in summer were rarely infected with Bd. Some <b>individuals</b> <b>cleared</b> their Bd infections and the return rate between infected and uninfected individuals was not significantly different. Conclusions The BC population of R. pipiens appears to have evolved a level of resistance that allows it to co-exist with Bd.

40|$|Genital infections with Chlamydia trachomatis {{continue}} to be a major health problem worldwide. While some <b>individuals</b> <b>clear</b> their infection (presumed {{to be the result of}} an effective Th 1 /interferon-γ response), others develop chronic infections and some are prone to repeat infections. In females in particular, chronic asymptomatic infections are common and can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Recent studies suggest that the genital tract microbiota could be a significant factor and explain person-to-person variation in C. trachomatis infections. One hypothesis suggests that C. trachomatis can use its trpBA genes to rescue tryptophan from indole, which is a product of anaerobic members of the genital tract microbiota. Women with particular microbiota types, such as seen in bacterial vaginosis, have increased numbers of anaerobes, and this would enable the chlamydia in these individuals to overcome the host's interferon-γ attempts to eliminate it, resulting in more repeat and/or chronic infections...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar has {{superior}} {{performance to}} conventional one. It {{has been introduced}} to almost every application field of conventional radar in recent years. In practical application, MIMO radar also faces the problem of congested spectrum assignment, which makes it not {{possible to have a}} continuous clear band with large bandwidth. Sparse frequency waveform that contains several <b>individual</b> <b>clear</b> bands is a desirable solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a method to design sparse frequency waveform set with low sidelobes in autocorrelations and crosscorrelations by optimizing an objective function constructed based on Power Spectrum Density requirement and sidelobe performances of waveform set. Thus, besides the property of approximate orthogonality, the designed waveforms obtain the ability of avoiding spectrum interference to/from other users. The waveform is phase-coded and thereby has constant modulus. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical studies. Practical implementation issues such as quantization effect and Doppler effect are also discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHepatitis C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of liver disease and {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma worldwide. HCV establishes a chronic infection in the majority of cases. However, some <b>individuals</b> <b>clear</b> the virus, demonstrating a protective role for the host immune response. Although new all-oral drug combinations may soon replace traditional ribavirin–interferon therapy, the emerging drug cocktails will be expensive and associated with side-effects and resistance, making a global vaccine an urgent priority. T cells are widely accepted to play an essential role in clearing acute HCV infection, whereas the role antibodies play in resolution and disease pathogenesis is less well understood. Recent studies have provided an insight into viral neutralizing determinants and the protective role of antibodies during infection. This review provides a historical perspective of the role neutralizing antibodies play in HCV infection and discusses the therapeutic benefits of antibody-based therapies.

Using a variety of techniques, including network analysis, wiretap conversations were analyzed in detail to determine the roles and status of individuals in the organization. The analysis confirmed that the organization was of the "corporate " type, involving a large number of <b>individuals,</b> <b>clear</b> division of labor and a recognizable hierar-chy. The field workers had few contacts with others in the organization. This fact means they would be unable to provide information about those at higher levels in the organization to law enforcement officers. The analysis also revealed that those running the organization placed a heavy reliance on telephone contacts. This reinforces the value of wire-tap data, not just for law enforcement, but also for social scientists studying these organizations. The methods developed {{in the course of this}} research may, therefore, have more general value in studying the operations of large criminal organizations...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{research into}} whether face perception is impaired in autistic <b>individuals,</b> <b>clear</b> answers have proved elusive. In the present study, {{we sought to}} determine whether co-occurring alexithymia (characterized by difficulties interpreting emotional states) {{may be responsible for}} face-perception deficits previously attributed to autism. Two experiments were conducted using psychophysical procedures to determine the relative contributions of alexithymia and autism to identity and expression recognition. Experiment 1 showed that alexithymia correlates strongly with the precision of expression attributions, whereas autism severity was unrelated to expression-recognition ability. Experiment 2 confirmed that alexithymia is not associated with impaired ability to detect expression variation; instead, results suggested that alexithymia is associated with difficulties interpreting intact sensory descriptions. Neither alexithymia nor autism was associated with biased or imprecise identity attributions. These findings accord with the hypothesis that the emotional symptoms of autism are in fact due to co-occurring alexithymia and that existing diagnostic criteria may need to be revised...|$|R

The CD 4 + cell count decreased in the AIDS patients but was stable in the ARC patient. Clinically, there was an initial improvement in all patients, but five of six of the advanced/terminal AIDS patients had died by month 17. Our studies suggest that passive immunization may be safe in ARC and AIDS patients. It reduces HIV- 1 viremia to levels undetectable even by PCR. To advanced/terminal patients, the benefit is of limited duration, while to ARC patients it may be long-term. Therefore, passive immunization should start early in the disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a strategy for}} measuring the column-averaged CO_ 2 dry air volume mixing ratio X_(CO_ 2) from space. It employs high resolution spectra of reflected sunlight taken simultaneously in near-infrared (NIR) CO_ 2 (1. 58 -mm and 2. 06 -mm) and O_ 2 (0. 76 -mm) bands. Simulation experiments, show that precisions of 0. 3 – 2. 5 ppmv for X_(CO_ 2) can be achieved from <b>individual</b> <b>clear</b> sky soundings {{for a range of}} atmospheric/surface conditions when the scattering optical depth t_s is less than 0. 3. When averaged over many clear sky soundings, random errors become negligible. This high precision facilitates the identification and correction of systematic errors, which are recognized as the most serious impediment for the satellite X_(CO_ 2) measurements. We briefly discuss potential sources of systematic errors, and show that some of them may result in geographically varying biases in the measured X_(CO_ 2). This highlights the importance of careful calibration and validation measurements, designed to identify and eliminate sources of these biases. We conclude that the 3 -band, spectrometric approach using NIR reflected sunlight has the potential for highly accurate X_(CO_ 2) measurements...|$|R

40|$|Parasites may {{severely}} {{impact the}} fitness and life-history of their hosts. After infection, surviving individuals may suppress {{the growth of}} the parasite, or completely clear the infection and develop immunity. Consequently, parasite prevalence is predicted to decline with age. Among elderly individuals, immunosenescence may lead to a late-life increase in infection prevalence. We used a 21 -year longitudinal dataset from one population of individually-marked Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) to investigate age-dependent prevalence of the GRW 1 strain of the intracellular protozoan blood parasite Haemoproteus nucleocondensus and whether infections with this parasite affect age-dependent survival. We analyzed 2454 samples from 1431 individuals and found that H. nucleocondensus infections could rarely be detected in nestlings. Prevalence increased strongly among fledglings and peaked among older first year birds. Prevalence was high among younger adults and declined steeply until ca 4 years of age, after which it was stable. Contrary to expectations, H. nucleocondensus prevalence did not increase among elderly individuals and we found no evidence that annual survival was lower in individuals suffering from an infection. Our results suggest that <b>individuals</b> <b>clear</b> or suppress infections and acquire immunity against future infections, and provide no evidence for immunosenescence nor an impact of chronic infections on survival...|$|R

In this study we investigated whether genetic risk factors {{are involved in the}} development of symptomatic pertussis upon B. pertussis infection. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, MBL 2, IL 17 A, TNFα, VDR, and IL 10 were genotyped in a unique Dutch cohort of symptomatic clinically confirmed (ex-) pertussis patients and in a Dutch population cohort. Of the seven investigated SNPs in five genes, a polymorphism in the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene (rs 10735810) was associated with pertussis. The VDR major allele and its homozygous genotype were more present in the symptomatic pertussis patient cohort compared to the control population cohort. Interestingly, the VDR major allele correlated also with the duration of reported pertussis symptoms. Vitamin D 3 (VD 3) and VDR are important regulators of immune activation. Altogether, these findings suggest that polymorphisms in the VDR gene may affect immune activation and the clinical outcome of B. pertussis infection...|$|R
