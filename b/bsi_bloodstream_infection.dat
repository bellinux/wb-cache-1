40|$|Introduction The {{health and}} {{economic}} burdens of community-onset methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CO-MRSA) infections {{are needed to}} inform policy, planning and evidence-based practice. We aimed to synthesise data {{from a range of}} public sources to generate the first estimate of the national incidence and cost of CO-MRSA infections. Methods Incidences of CO-MRSA skin and soft tissue (SSTI), lower respiratory tract (LRTI) and <b>bloodstream</b> (<b>BSI)</b> <b>infections</b> were calculated for regions of Australia using data from existing literature and correspondence with specialists. Simulations estimated costs using treatment models developed for children and adults in primary or tertiary care settings and including bed-stay, diagnostics, procedures, mortalities and loss of productivity. Results Annually, in Australia there were found to be 3702 CO-MRSA SSTIs, 559 CO-MRSA BSIs and 425 CO-MRSA LRTIs, occupying 147, 000 bed-days, including 1600 bed-days in intensive care. Incidence ranged from 4 / 100, 000 person-years in Tasmania to 243 / 100, 000 person-years in central Australia. CO-MRSA cost 3. 5 b annually in Australia. The higher incidence of SSTIs resulted in costs greater than summing the costs of BSIs and LRTIs. The greatest cost was mortality.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the pathogenesis of}} <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> by Staphylococcus epidermidis, using the molecular epidemiology, in high-risk neonates. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of a cohort of neonates with <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> using central venous catheters for more than 24  h. “National Healthcare Safety Network” surveillance was conducted. Genotyping was performed by DNA fingerprinting and mecA genes and icaAD were detected by multiplex-PCR. Results: From April 2006 to April 2008, the incidence of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> and central venous catheter-associated <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> was 15. 1 and 13. 0 / 1000 catheter days, respectively, with S. epidermidis accounting for 42. 9 % of episodes. Molecular {{analysis was used to}} document the similarity among six isolates of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> by S. epidermidis from cases with positive blood and central venous catheter tip cultures. Fifty percent of neonates had <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> not identified as definite or probable central venous catheter-related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> Only one case was considered as definite central venous catheter-related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> and was extraluminally acquired; the remaining were considered probable central venous catheter-related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections,</b> with one probable extraluminally and another probable intraluminally acquired <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> Additionally, among mecA+ and icaAD+ samples, one clone (A) was predominant (80 %).

MethodsFor this study, 192 patients were randomly selected from among all patients undergoing median sternotomy between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2003. ResultsNinety-eight (51 %) of the 192 eligible patients were male. The median patient age was 5. 4 months (interquartile range: 1 day– 41. 5 years). <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> occurred in 12 (6. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 3 %– 10. 7 %) patients within the first 30 days after median sternotomy. <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> developed a median of 11 days (range: 3 – 29 days) after median sternotomy. Gram-negative bacilli caused 6 (50 %) of the 12 <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> Specific causes of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3), Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Serratia marcescens (n = 1), and Candida albicans (n = 1). Multivariable analysis revealed that the development of mediastinitis (odds ratio [OR], 28. 16; 95 % CI, 3. 37 – 235. 22) and the requirement for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 12. 52; 95 % CI, 2. 99 – 52. 41) were associated with <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> after median sternotomy.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> is {{a common}} cause of hospitalization, {{morbidity}} and death in children. The impact of antimicrobial resistance and HIV infection on outcome is not firmly established. Methods We assessed the incidence of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> and risk factors for fatal outcome in a prospective cohort study of 1828 consecutive admissions of children aged zero to seven years with signs of systemic infection. Blood was obtained for culture, malaria microscopy, HIV antibody test and, when necessary, HIV PCR. We recorded data on clinical features, underlying diseases, antimicrobial drug use and patients' outcome. Results The incidence of laboratory-confirmed <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> was 13. 9 % (255 / 1828) of admissions, despite {{two thirds of the}} study population having received antimicrobial therapy prior to blood culture. The most frequent isolates were klebsiella, salmonellae, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, 21. 6 % had malaria and 16. 8 % HIV infection. One third (34. 9 %) of the children with laboratory-confirmed <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> died. The mortality rate from Gram-negative <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> (43. 5 %) was more than double that of malaria (20. 2 %) and Gram-positive <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> (16. 7 %). Significant risk factors for death by logistic regression modeling were inappropriate treatment due to antimicrobial resistance, HIV infection, other underlying infectious diseases, malnutrition and <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> caused by Enterobacteriaceae, other Gram-negatives and candida. Conclusion <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> was less common than malaria, but caused more deaths. The frequent use of antimicrobials prior to blood culture may have hampered the detection of organisms susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials, including pneumococci, and thus the study probably underestimates the incidence of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> The finding that antimicrobial resistance, HIV-infection and malnutrition predict fatal outcome calls for renewed efforts to curb the further emergence of resistance, improve HIV care and nutrition for children. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize microbiological factors independently associated with higher mortality rates following nosocomial <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> All patients admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 1 July 1989 and 30 June 1990 who developed a nosocomial <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> were included. The crude in-house mortality for the 364 patients with nosocomial <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> was 33 %. These deaths accounted for 25 % of all in-hospital deaths. Significant risk factors for death from <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> included diagnoses of cancers and diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (p < 0. 01). Neither previous surgery nor neutropenia was associated with higher mortality rates. Whereas the crude mortality rates associated with gram-negative (33 %) and gram-positive (31 %) <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> were similar, that associated with fungemia was higher (54 %, p < 0. 02). The mortality associated with secondary <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> (46 %) was higher than that associated with primary <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> (28 %, p < 0. 001). Furthermore, polymicrobial infections had a worse prognosis than infections from which a single pathogen was isolated (p < 0. 05). A multivariate, logistic regression model identified four variables that independently predicted mortality (p = 0. 025) : age (OR 1. 01 per year; CI 95 1. 00 - 1. 02); cancer (OR 2. 35, CI 95 1. 26 - 4. 37) or diseases of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems (OR 2. 20, CI 95 1. 04 - 4. 67); polymicrobial infection (OR 2. 34; CI 95 1. 21 - 4. 53); and secondary <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> (OR 2. 46; CI 95 1. 50 - 4. 02).

Catheter related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> rates were compared before and after program implementation. The patient population was selected based upon a recommendation in the 2010 National Healthcare Safety Network report on device related infections. This report indicated a need for more data on pediatric populations requiring admission to a long term care facility. The study design is a retrospective cohort study. Catheter related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> data was gathered between 2008 and 2011. In October of 2008 a program implementation began to reduce the number of catheter related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> The key components of this initiative were to implement a standardized catheter maintenance checklist, introduce the usage of a chlorhexadine gluconate based product for catheter maintenance and skin antisepsis, and a multidisciplinary education plan that focused on hand hygiene and aseptic technique. The catheter related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> rate in 2008 was 21. 21 infections per 1000 patient-line days. After program implementation the 2009 catheter related <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> rate dropped to 1. 11 per 1000 patient-line days.

The incidence of subsequent <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> did not differ with regard to the presence or absence of active antibiotics at catheter removal: zero of 23 vs. two of 121 (p = 1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the risk of subsequent <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> in intensive care unit patients when the Brun-Buisson technique is used to define isolated positive catheter culture is low...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>Infections</b> (<b>BSIs)</b> in neutropenic {{patients}} often cause considerable {{morbidity and}} mortality. Therefore, the surveillance and early identification of patients {{at high risk}} for developing BSIs might be useful for the development of preventive measures. The aim of the current study was to assess the predictive power of three scoring systems: Infection Probability Score (IPS), APACHE II and KARNOFSKY score for the onset of <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>Infections</b> in hematology-oncology patients. Methods A total of 102 patients who were hospitalized for more than 48 hours in a hematology-oncology department in Athens, Greece between April 1 st and October 31 st 2007 were included in the study. Data were collected by using an anonymous standardized recording form. Source materials included medical records, temperature charts, information from nursing and medical staff, and results on microbiological testing. Patients were followed daily until hospital discharge or death. Results Among the 102 patients, <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>Infections</b> occurred in 17 (16. 6 %) patients. The incidence density of <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>Infections</b> was 7. 74 per 1, 000 patient-days or 21. 99 per 1, 000 patient-days at risk. The patients who developed a <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>Infection</b> were mainly females (p = 0. 004), with twofold time mean length of hospital stay (p Conclusion Between the three different prognostic scoring systems, Infection Probability Score had the best sensitivity in predicting <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>Infections.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{has been}} an {{important}} pathogen causing <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> Our study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and genetic diversity of clinical S. aureus isolates from patients with <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> in four hospitals of Shanghai from 2009 to 2011. METHODS: A collection of S. aureus isolates causing <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> from four hospitals in the central part of Shanghai was carried out. Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of collected isolates were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and spa-type, multi-locus sequence typing, agr type and toxin gene profiling were performed to explore the molecular diversity. Moreover, MRSA strains were also characterized by Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. RESULTS: The drugs such as linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin were efficacious for treating S. aureus including MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains displayed distinct diversity in molecular characterization and toxin genes, and three virulent MSSA strains encoding at least five toxins were detected. Five community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains were found, but the majority (88. 7 %) of MRSA strains belonged to two epidemic clones (ST 239 -MRSA- III and ST 5 -MRSA- II) with different toxin gene profiles among patients with <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains were still the main pathogen causing <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> in spite of the emergence of CA-MRSA strains in hospital setting...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{provide a}} global, {{up-to-date}} {{picture of the}} prevalence, treatment, and outcomes of Candida <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> {{in intensive care unit}} patients and compare Candida with bacterial <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the Extended Prevalence of Infection in the ICU Study (EPIC II). Demographic, physiological, infection-related and therapeutic data were collected. Patients were grouped as having Candida, Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and combined Candida/bacterial <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> Outcome data were assessed at intensive care unit and hospital discharge. SETTING: EPIC II included 1265 intensive care units in 76 countries. PATIENTS: Patients in participating intensive care units on study day. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 14, 414 patients in EPIC II, 99 patients had Candida <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> for a prevalence of 6. 9 per 1000 patients. Sixty-one patients had candidemia alone and 38 patients had combined <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> Candida albicans (n = 70) was the predominant species. Primary therapy included monotherapy with fluconazole (n = 39), caspofungin (n = 16), and a polyene-based product (n = 12). Combination therapy was infrequently used (n = 10). Compared with patients with Gram-positive (n = 420) and Gram-negative (n = 264) <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections,</b> patients with candidemia {{were more likely to have}} solid tumors (p <. 05) and appeared to have been in an intensive care unit longer (14 days [range, 5 - 25 days], 8 days [range, 3 - 20 days], and 10 days [range, 2 - 23 days], respectively), but this difference was not statistically significant. Severity of illness and organ dysfunction scores were similar between groups. Patients with Candida <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections,</b> compared with patients with Gram-positive and Gram-negative <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections,</b> had the greatest crude intensive care unit mortality rates (42. 6 %, 25. 3 %, and 29. 1 %, respectively) and longer intensive care unit lengths of stay (median [interquartile range]) (33 days [18 - 44], 20 days [9 - 43], and 21 days [8 - 46], respectively); however, these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Candidemia remains a significant problem in intensive care units patients. In the EPIC II population, Candida albicans was the most common organism and fluconazole remained the predominant antifungal agent used. Candida <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> are associated with high intensive care unit and hospital mortality rates and resource use...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} the epidemiology of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> in Switzerland, comparing selected pathogens in community and university hospitals. DESIGN Observational, retrospective, multicenter laboratory surveillance study. METHODS Data on <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> from 2008 through 2014 {{were obtained from}} the Swiss infection surveillance system, {{which is part of the}} Swiss Centre for Antibiotic Resistance (ANRESIS). We compared pathogen prevalences across 26 acute care hospitals. A subanalysis for community-acquired and hospital-acquired <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> in community and university hospitals was performed. RESULTS A total of 42, 802 <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> episodes were analyzed. The most common etiologies were Escherichia coli (28. 3 %), Staphylococcus aureus (12. 4 %), and polymicrobial <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> (11. 4 %). The proportion of E. coli increased from 27. 5 % in 2008 to 29. 6 % in 2014 (P =. 04). E. coli and S. aureus were more commonly reported in community than university hospitals (34. 3 % vs 22. 7 %, P<. 001 and 13. 9 % vs 11. 1 %, P<. 001, respectively). Fifty percent of episodes were community-acquired, with E. coli again being more common in community hospitals (41. 0 % vs 32. 4 %, P<. 001). The proportion of E. coli in community-acquired <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> increased in community hospitals only. Community-acquired polymicrobial infections (9. 9 % vs 5. 6 %, P<. 001) and community-acquired coagulase-negative staphylococci (6. 7 % vs 3. 4 %, P< 0. 001) were more prevalent in university hospitals. CONCLUSIONS The role of E. coli as predominant pathogen in <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> has become more pronounced. There are distinct patterns in community and university hospitals, potentially influencing empirical antibiotic treatment. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016; 37 : 1060 - 1067...|$|R
40|$|Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) -specific {{hospital}} discharge codes {{were introduced}} in October 2008. The purpose of this project is to study the correlation of these codes with laboratory-proven pediatric MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> Methods: Laboratory and discharge databases were used to identify patientsChildren’s Hospital Medical Center from October 2008 through December 2010 with MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> The laboratory database identified patients with a positive blood culture for MRSA, and the discharge database identified patients with an MRSA bloodstream discharge code (038. 12 for MRSA sepsis or 041. 12 for MRSA infection with either 790. 7 for bacteremia or 771. 81 for newborn sepsis or 771. 83 for newborn bacteremia). The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the codes were determined, using laboratory-confirmed infection as the gold standard. Results: During the 27 month study period, 65 patients with MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> were identified from laboratory data and 58 patients were identified from administrative data; 36 were concordant. The overall sensitivity was 55. 4 %, and the overall PPV was 62. 1 %, and neither showed a significant trend over time. The sensitivity varied with the clinical manifestation of the <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection.</b> Of the 22 patients coded for MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> without a positive blood culture, almost half (45. 4 %) had only a localized MRSA infection. Of the 29 patients with positive MRSA blood culture but insufficient discharge coding, the majority (55. 2 %) were coded only for MRSA <b>infection</b> without <b>bloodstream</b> involvement. Conclusions: Discharge coding for MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infection</b> {{was found to be}} insensitive and to have a low PPV. Using these codes alone will lead to an underestimation of pediatric MRSA <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
