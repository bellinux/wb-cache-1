5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|COBOL syntax {{has often}} been criticized for its verbosity. Proponents {{say that this was}} {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance.

5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology.

5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for even his mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land was {{designed}} by Masahiro Sakurai, who intended {{it to be a}} simple game that could <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to pick up and play even by those unfamiliar with action games. For more advanced players, he offered additional optional challenges such as an unlockable hard mode and the ability to edit Kirby's maximum HP and starting number of lives. Kirby's Dream Land has been re-released on the Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console in 2011 and {{was also one of the}} games included in the compilation game Kirby's Dream Collection for the Wii, released to celebrate Kirby's 20th anniversary.|$|E

5|$|Representatives enthusiastically {{described}} {{a language that}} could work {{in a wide variety}} of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to use, even at the expense of power.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun because it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots were said to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out to summon the whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|While F-105s did score 27 air-to-air victories, {{the overall}} {{exchange}} ratio was near parity. On January 2, 1967, the Americans sprang a surprise on the MiGs when they launched Operation Bolo. F-4 Phantoms, {{using the same}} radio call signs, direction of approach, altitude, and speed as a typical flight of bomb-laden F-105s, lured a group of MiG-21s toward what the MiG pilots thought would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> prey. The result was seven MiG-21s shot down within 12 minutes for no U.S. losses.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stripped}} of the victory in previous year's race {{because of an}} underweight car, Audi Sport ABT team principal Hans-Jurgen Abt said his team's objective was to get onto the podium. He acknowledged that getting the victory would not <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> because of the competitiveness of the field. After retiring from the preceding Buenos Aires ePrix, Bird stated that he would enter the Mexico City race with a positive attitude and affirmed his belief in his team and he felt {{there was a possibility}} of getting onto the podium in the event they perform well in qualifying. Mitch Evans reiterated that despite his team Jaguar not scoring points in the season's opening three races, the Buenos Aires race showed that he was becoming more confident and wanted to carry over his momentum from the four-month break. He also said he was excited to compete in the Mexico City event.|$|E

50|$|Mnemonics and Qualitative Reasoning: In many instances, {{specific}} {{properties are}} more intuitive or <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> to remember {{than the original}} properties in SI or English units.

5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be perfect for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty {{is one way to}} measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Wang's {{only hope}} for rescue was an {{intervention}} by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. For Dou, the situation, as presented by his councillor Liu Bin, offered both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation was critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. Dou's army was a huge force, reportedly over 100,000 strong, and the two earliest sources report 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within {{the capabilities of the}} time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.|$|E
