5|$|Smallpeice {{initially}} held {{discussions in}} 1965 with {{the newly formed}} Overseas Containers group, which {{was focused on the}} UK to Australia and Far East routes, about Cunard's Port Line subsidiary and Ronald Vestey's <b>Blue</b> <b>Star</b> Line joining British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P and the Ocean Steamship Company in the joint venture. Their approaches were rebuffed, and it was quickly decided that Cunard and <b>Blue</b> <b>Star</b> Line should try to form a rival group, which would be called Associated Container Transportation. The venture was formed in late 1965 and early 1966, with the first board meeting taking place on 12 January 1966. Cunard's Port Line and Vestey's <b>Blue</b> <b>Star</b> Line were joined by Ben Line, Ellerman Lines and Harrison Line in the venture.

5|$|The turnpike runs east–west across Pennsylvania, {{from the}} Ohio state line in Lawrence County to the New Jersey state line in Bucks County. It {{passes through the}} Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia areas, along with {{farmland}} and woodland. The highway crosses the Appalachian Mountains, in {{the central part of}} the state, through four tunnels.

5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{an object}} that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star HIP 78530.
