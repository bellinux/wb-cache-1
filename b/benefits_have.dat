5|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1982, {{the program has been}} providing low-income families living in Puerto Rico with cash benefits used for food purchases. It is a collaborative effort between the USDA and the island's government, where the former provides annual federal appropriations for the Puerto Rican government to distribute individually among eligible participants. Although the methods of providing such <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> changed over the years, the program's basic objective of helping low-income families meet their nutritional needs has remained constant.|$|E

The Airlift <b>Benefit</b> <b>has</b> also drawn special guests including actor Aaron Eckhart {{and baseball}} manager Bobby Valentine.|$|R

25|$|The above {{examples}} {{highlight the}} intent of humans to introduce species {{as a means of}} incurring some benefit. While these <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> in some cases been realized, introductions have also resulted in unforeseen costs, particularly when introduced species take on characteristics of invasive species.|$|E
25|$|According {{to recent}} {{research}} on the British Columbia halibut fishery, where the commons has been at least partly privatized, substantial ecological and economic <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> resulted. There is less damage to fish stocks, the fishing is safer, and fewer resources are needed to achieve a given harvest.|$|E

SG Biofuels also claims additional <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> arisen from such strains, including improved flowering synchronicity, higher resistance to pests and diseases, and increased cold-weather tolerance.|$|E
25|$|The {{orthogonality}} {{allows for}} efficient modulator and demodulator implementation using the FFT algorithm on the receiver side, and inverse FFT on the sender side. Although {{the principles and}} some of the <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> been known since the 1960s, OFDM is popular for wideband communications today by way of low-cost digital signal processing components that can efficiently calculate the FFT.|$|E

25|$|Gallium nitrate (GaN) {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{as a possible}} treatment for navicular disease, but its <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> not been confirmed by formal clinical studies. One pilot study examined horses given gallium nitrate in their feed rations. While it was absorbed slowly, it did stay in the animals' system, providing a baseline dosage for future studies.|$|E
25|$|Organizational {{reward systems}} have a {{significant}} impact on employees' level of motivation. Rewards can be either tangible or intangible. Various forms of pay, such as salary, commissions, bonuses, employee ownership programs and various types of profit or gain sharing programs, are all important tangible rewards. While fringe <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> a positive impact on attraction and retention, their direct impact on motivation and performance is not well-defined.|$|E
25|$|There has {{not been}} {{adequate}} evaluation of changing the diet to reduce eczema. There {{is some evidence that}} infants with an established egg allergy may have a reduction in symptoms if eggs are eliminated from their diets. <b>Benefits</b> <b>have</b> not been shown for other elimination diets, though the studies are small and poorly executed. Establishing that there is a food allergy before dietary change could avoid unnecessary lifestyle changes.|$|E

40|$|Marguerite La Caze has {{recently}} published a stimulating {{analysis of the}} emotions of envy and resentment in which she argues that to envy others for a <b>benefit</b> they <b>have</b> received or to resent them for such a reason can be ethically acceptable in cases where that <b>benefit</b> <b>has</b> been unjustly obtained (La Caze, 2001). I question this {{on the ground that}} the judgement that the <b>benefit</b> <b>has</b> been unjustly obtained plays a more complex role in the structure of envy and resentment than La Caze allows and should alter the nature of the feeling that is evoked. From the perspective of virtue ethics there is nothing creditable about still feeling envy or resentment in such circumstances. <br /...|$|R
25|$|Moderate {{hookworm}} infections {{have been}} demonstrated to have beneficial effects on hosts suffering from diseases linked to overactive immune systems. This is possibly explained by the hygiene hypothesis. Research at the University of Nottingham conducted in Ethiopia observed a small subset of people with hookworm infections were half as likely to experience asthma or hay fever. Potential <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> also been hypothesized in cases of multiple sclerosis, Crohn's Disease and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{exogenous}} GH {{is indicated}} only in limited circumstances, and needs regular monitoring {{due to the}} frequency and severity of side-effects. GH is used as replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset (usually {{as a result of}} an acquired pituitary tumor). In these patients, <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> variably included reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, increased bone density, improved lipid profile, reduced cardiovascular risk factors, and improved psychosocial well-being.|$|E
25|$|Desirable actions such as enrolling {{children}} in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families {{to stay at home}} rather than work to collect <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E

25|$|Long-term <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> {{also been}} {{associated}} with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms that younger age {{is associated with a}} much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. The population-based cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.|$|E
25|$|Masturbation is {{the sexual}} {{stimulation}} of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually {{to the point}} of orgasm. The stimulation may involve hands, fingers, everyday objects, sex toys such as vibrators, or combinations of these. Mutual masturbation (mutual manual stimulation of the genitals between partners) can be a substitute for sexual penetration. Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005 {{census of}} Australian {{demographics}} {{showed that the}} Indigenous population had grown at {{twice the rate of}} the overall population since 1996 when the Indigenous population stood at 283,000. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the total resident Indigenous population to be 458,520 in June 2001 (2.4% of Australia's total), 90% of whom identified as Aboriginal, 6% Torres Strait Islander and the remaining 4% being of dual Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parentage. Much of the increase since 1996 can be attributed to greater numbers of people identifying themselves as Aboriginal or of Aboriginal descent. Changed definitions of Aboriginality and positive discrimination via material <b>benefits</b> <b>have</b> been cited as contributing to a movement to indigenous identification.|$|E
