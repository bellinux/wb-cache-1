5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> pressure. Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded almost entirely by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.|$|E
5|$|For safety, divers {{sometimes}} {{carry an}} additional independent scuba cylinder {{with its own}} regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this extra equipment is not needed or used. This extra cylinder {{is known as a}} bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant iceberg that would float <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> However, the wreck is far too fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E
5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{considered}} {{sending the}} two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans {{to abandon the}} plan. Bremse {{was one of the}} ships interned at Scapa Flow {{under the terms of the}} armistice in November 1918. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for Ernest Cox, though they had to contend with large quantities of oil and the risks of fires and explosions. Having been brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> along fissures or cracks. These features are {{sometimes referred to as}} dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E

5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E
5|$|However, as he dies, Tyball {{reveals that}} {{he had decided to}} contain the Slasher of Veils, whose prison he had been weakening, within Arial as a way to prevent it from {{destroying}} the world. Arial asks the Avatar to prevent the Slasher of Veils from being unleashed, and magically teleports <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> to evacuate its inhabitants. With help from Garamon's ghost, the Avatar gathers the eight talismans of Cabirus and throws them in the volcano {{at the base of the}} Abyss; the energy they release allows Garamon to open a portal that will send the Slasher of Veils into another dimension. The Avatar is sucked through the portal into a chaotic alternate dimension, but escapes back to the Isle of the Avatar and makes it on board the Baron's ship as the volcano erupts. As the game ends, Garamon's spirit reveals that he teleported the inhabitants of the Abyss to another cave.|$|E
5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with a sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coronal rain is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs in the sun's corona. It occurs when hot plasma in the corona cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields, usually associated with regions that produce solar flares.

5|$|They are soon {{captured}} by the police of the underground community, known as the Colony. In prison, Will is visited by Mr. Jerome, and his son Cal. They reveal Will was actually born in the Colony, {{and that they are}} his real family; Mr. Jerome his father and Cal his younger brother. Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, where Will and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to see him and informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps — a place even deeper in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are either going to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself.

5|$|Yoshimura first {{pitched the}} show to the Homicide: Life on the Street {{production}} team in May 1997 at the San Francisco production center of executive producer Barry Levinson. The episode was discussed and well-received during a round-table discussion involving Levinson, executive producer Tom Fontana, producer David Simon, supervising producer Julie Martin, and consulting producer Gail Mutrux. During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve the homicide case quickly and get the trains moving again, an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script. Levinson suggested ending the episode with the detectives walking <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> then feeling the hum and vibration of the train starting back up under their feet. This suggestion, however, did {{not appear in the}} final episode.|$|E
5|$|Another early roguelike whose {{development}} pre-dated Rogue was Sword of Fargoal (1982), {{developed by}} Jeff McCord starting in 1979. The game {{was based on}} GammaQuest, an earlier title McCord had created on the Commodore PET which he shared locally with friends while a student at Henry Clay High School in Kentucky; the game itself {{was based on a}} Dungeons & Dragons campaign he had run himself in the prior years. Before graduating and attending the University of Tennessee in 1981, he had started work on GammaQuest II, which required the player to navigate through randomly generated dungeon levels, acquire a sword, and make it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> with that sword through more randomly generated levels. The more advanced computers available at the school, such as the Commodore VIC-20, enabled him to expand out the game further from the highly limited memory on the PET. On seeing the prospects of selling computer software, he eventually got a publication deal with Epyx, where they helped him to refine the marketing of the game, renaming it Sword of Fargoal, and giving him access to the more powerful Commodore 64, enabling him to use graphics and sound as part of the game. The game was considered a success, and when it was ported to the PC in 1983, it out-shone Rogues PC release the same year due to Sword of Fargoals superior graphics and sound.|$|E

5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
25|$|Water also infiltrates {{the ground}} and goes into aquifers. This {{groundwater}} later flows <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.|$|E

After this sequence, immediately push the water backward. In this style, turning point from drowning to floating {{is at the}} time of waist bend.|$|E
5000|$|Subsea Systems- Subsea Systems are {{actually}} wellheads, which {{sit on the}} sea floor and extract oil straight from the ground. They use pipes <b>to</b> force <b>the</b> oil <b>back</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> and can siphon oil to nearby platform rigs, a ship overhead, a local production hub, or even a faraway onshore site. This makes the Subsea system very versatile and a popular choice for companies.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT 4 contains a phenylalanine-based targeting motif that determines its steady state distribution between <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and <b>the</b> interior of cells (Piper, R. C., C. Tai, P. Kuleza, S. Pang, D. Warnock, J. Baenziger, J. W. Slot, H. J. Geuze, C. Puri, and D. E. James. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 121 : 1221). <b>To</b> directly measure <b>the</b> effect that the GLUT 4 amino terminus has on internalization and subsequent recycling <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>surface,</b> we constructed chimeras in which this sequence was substituted for the amino- terminal cytoplasmic domain of the human transferrin receptor. The chimeras were stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells and their endocytic behavior characterized. The GLUT 4 -transferrin receptor chimera was recycled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>surface</b> with a rate similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transferrin receptor, indicating that the GLUT 4 sequence was not promoting intracellular retention of the chimera. The GLUT 4 -transferrin receptor chimera was internalized at half the rate of the transferrin receptor. Substitution of an alanine for phenylalanine at position 5 slowed internalization of the chimera by twofold, to a level characteristic of bulk membrane internalization. However, substitution of a tyrosine increased the rate of internalization <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of the transferrin receptor. Neither of these substitutions significantly altered {{the rate at which the}} chimeras were recycled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>surface.</b> These results demonstrate that the major function of the GLUT 4 amino-terminal domain is <b>to</b> promote <b>the</b> effective internalization of the protein from <b>the</b> cell <b>surface,</b> via a functional phenylalanine-based internalization motif, rather than retention of the transporter within intracellular structures...|$|R
