5|$|The {{lectures and}} book had been {{originally}} scheduled for 2009, but were {{moved up to}} 2008 to avoid conflicting with Atwood's forthcoming novel after the latter book was delayed by its publisher. The content examines <b>borrowing</b> <b>and</b> <b>lending</b> from financial, psychological, theological, literary, and ecological points of view. Its release coincided with extensive {{media coverage of the}} recent financial crisis which led numerous critics to comment on the book's timeliness. In the Canadian market, the book peaked at #1 on The Globe and Mail bestseller list on October 25 and out-sold all previous Massey Lecture books. Critics found the book well-researched, thought-provoking, and humorous. Various reviewers found the discussions on the non-monetary aspects of debt to be the better parts of the book, while some critics identified the sections on ecological debt as the worse parts of the book.|$|E

The promotion of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage <b>borrowing</b> <b>and</b> <b>lending</b> has given rise to debates regarding government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E
500|$|... "Ow'st" [...] in line ten {{can also}} carry two {{meanings}} equally common at the time: [...] "ownest" [...] and [...] "owest". [...] Many readers interpret it as [...] "ownest", {{as do many}} Shakespearean glosses ("owe" [...] in Shakespeare's day, was sometimes used as a synonym for [...] "own"). [...] However, [...] "owest" [...] delivers an interesting view on the text. [...] It conveys the idea that beauty is something borrowed from nature—that it must be paid back as time progresses. [...] In this interpretation, [...] "fair" [...] can be a pun on [...] "fare", or the fare required by nature for life's journey. Other scholars {{have pointed out that}} this <b>borrowing</b> <b>and</b> <b>lending</b> theme within the poem is true of both nature and humanity. Summer, for example, is said to have a [...] "lease" [...] with [...] "all too short a date." [...] This monetary theme is common in many of Shakespeare's sonnets, as it was an everyday theme in his budding capitalistic society.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend Chatterjee, Corbae, Nakajima, and Ros-Rull (2001) to include {{aggregate}} real shocks to economic activity. The model, that includes agents that <b>borrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>lend</b> <b>and</b> a competitive credit industry, {{and that has}} endogenous default and credit limits, allows us to explore {{the extent to which}} aggregate events are amplified or smoothed via the mechanism of household bankruptcy filings. In the model agents are subject to shocks to earnings opportunities, to preferences and to their asset position <b>and</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>lend</b> to smooth consumption. On occasion, the realization of the shocks are bad enough that agents take advantage of the opportunities provided by the U. S.

60|$|His first {{impression}} {{was one of}} pure pleasure and amusement at finding his sitting-room transformed into an atelier strewed with miscellaneous drawings and with the contents of two chests from Rome, {{the lower half of}} the windows darkened with baize, and the blonde Hans in his weird youth as the presiding genius of the littered place--his hair longer than of old, his face more whimsically creased, and his high voice as usual getting higher under the excitement of rapid talk. The friendship of the two had been kept up warmly since the memorable Cambridge time, not only by correspondence but by little episodes of companionship abroad and in England, and the original relation of confidence on one side and indulgence on the other had been developed in practice, as is wont to be the case where such spiritual <b>borrowing</b> <b>and</b> <b>lending</b> has been well begun.|$|E
6000|$|Let it serve {{then for}} a scrap of detail that the {{appearance}} of William's further fortune enjoyed thereabouts a grasp of my attention scarce menaced even by the call on that faculty of such appearances of my own as I had naturally in some degree also to take for graces of the banquet. I associate the sense of his being, in a great cause, far away on the billow with that clearance of the air through the tremendous draught, from sea to sea, of the Northern triumph, which seemed to make a good-natured infinitude of room for all the individual interests and personal lives that might help the pot to bubble--if the expression be not too mean for {{the size of our}} confidence; that the cause on which the Agassiz expedition to South America embarked was of the greatest being happily a presumption altogether within my scope. It reawoke the mild divinatory rage with which I had followed, with so little to show for it, the military fortune of my younger brothers--feeding the gentle passion indeed, it must be added, thanks to the letter-writing grace of which the case had now the benefit, with report and picture of a vividness greater than any ever to be shed from a like source upon our waiting circle. Everything of the kind, for me, was company; but I dwelt, for that matter and as I put it all together, in company so constant and so enchanting that this amounted to moving, in whatever direction, with the mass--more and more aware as I was of the [...] "fun" [...] (to express it grossly) of living by my imagination and thereby finding that company, in countless different forms, could only swarm about me. Seeing further into the figurable world made company of persons and places, objects and subjects alike: it gave them all without exception chances to be somehow or other interesting, and the imaginative ply of finding interest once taken (I think I had by that time got much beyond looking for it), the whole conspiracy of aspects danced round me in a ring. It formed, by my present vision of it, a shining escort to one's possibly often hampered or mystified, but never long stayed and absolutely never wasted, steps; it hung about, after the fashion of winter evening adumbrations just outside the reach of the lamplight, while one sat writing, reading, listening, watching--perhaps even again, incurably, but dawdling and gaping; and most of all doubtless, if it supplied with colour people and things often by themselves, I dare say, neutral enough, how it painted thick, how it fairly smothered, any surface that did it the turn of showing positive and intrinsic life! Ah the things and the people, the hours and scenes and circumstances, the inénarrables occasions and relations, that I might still present in its light if I would, and with the enormous advantage now (for this I should unblushingly claim), of being able to mark for present irony or pity or wonder, or just for a better intelligence, or again for the high humour or extreme strangeness of the thing, the rare indebtedness, calculated by the long run, in which it could leave particular cases! This necessity I was under that everything should be interesting--for fear of the collapse otherwise of one's sustaining intention--would have confessed doubtless to a closest connection, of all the connections, with the small inkpot in which I seemed at last definitely destined to dip to the exclusion of any stream more Pactolean: a modest manner of saying that difficulty and slowness of composition were clearly by this time not in the least appointed to blight me, however inveterate they were likely to prove; that production, such as it was, floundered on in spite of them; and that, to put it frankly, if I enjoyed as much company as I have said no small part of it was of my very own earning. The freshness of first creations--since we are exalted, in art, to these arrogant expressions--never fails, I take it, to beguile the creator, in default of any other victim, even to the last extravagance; so that what happened was that one found all the swarm of one's intentions, one's projected images, quite [...] "good enough" [...] to mix with the rest of one's society, setting up with it terms of interpenetration, an admirable commerce of <b>borrowing</b> <b>and</b> <b>lending,</b> taking and giving, not to say stealing and keeping. Did it verily all, this freshness of felt contact, of curiosity and wonder, come back perhaps to certain small and relatively ridiculous achievements of [...] "production" [...] as aforesaid?--ridiculous causes, I mean, of such prodigious effects. I am divided between the shame on the one hand of claiming for them, these concocted [...] "short stories," [...] that they played so great a part, and a downright admiring tenderness on the other for their holding up their stiff little heads in such a bustle of life and traffic of affairs. I of course really and truly cared for them, as we say, more than for aught else whatever--cared for them with that kind of care, infatuated though it may seem, that makes it bliss for the fond votary never to so much as speak of the loved object, makes it a refinement of piety to perform his rites under cover of a perfect freedom of mind as to everything but them. These secrets of the imaginative life were in fact more various than I may dream of trying to tell; they referred to actual concretions of existence {{as well as to the}} supposititious; the joy of life indeed, drawbacks and all, was just in the constant quick flit of association, to and fro, and through a hundred open doors, between the two great chambers (if it be not absurd, or even base, to separate them) of direct and indirect experience. If it is of the great comprehensive fusion that I speak as the richest note of all those hours, what could truly have been more in the sense of it than exactly such a perfect muddle of pleasure for instance as my having (and, as I seem to remember, at his positive invitation) addressed the most presuming as yet of my fictional bids to my distinguished friend of a virtual lifetime, as he was to become, William Dean Howells, whom I rejoice to name here and who had shortly before returned from a considerable term of exile in Venice and was in the act of taking all but complete charge of the Boston [...] "Atlantic"? The confusion was, to be plain, of more things than can hope to go into my picture with any effect of keeping distinct there--the felt felicity, literally, in my performance, the felt ecstasy, the still greater, in my receipt of Howells's message; and then, naturally, most of all, the at once to be recorded blest violence in the break upon my consciousness of his glittering response after perusal.|$|E
