25|$|He {{joined the}} Northamptonshire staff in 1950 {{and made his}} {{championship}} debut that summer, no qualification period was necessary for a Kettering boy, <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred,</b> against Sussex at Northampton. After national service {{and an opportunity to}} demonstrate his shoemaking skills at the Festival of Britain, he returned to the County Ground and broke through in 1956 by passing 1,000 runs {{for the first time to}} earn his county cap. Reynolds missed the entire 1959 season thanks to a football injury (he appeared for both Kettering Town and Peterborough United, later qualifying as a referee) but was hardly ever absent from the Northamptonshire side between 1960 and 1968, when he ceased to be automatic choice.|$|E
25|$|Pfeiffer {{was born}} in Augsburg on September 20, 1889. His parents were Carl Pfeiffer, the {{proprietor}} of a print-shop, and Elise (née Naegele). The boy's grandfather Jakob, also a printer, had purchased {{the house of the}} humanist Konrad Peutinger, and Pfeiffer would later consider it a special stroke of fate that he had been <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> in the former home of a central figure from the golden age of humanism in Augsburg. He studied at the Gymnasium of the Benedictine St. Stephen's Abbey, where he was a pupil of P. Beda Grundl, a follower of Wilamowitz. Pfeiffer spent his leisure time with Beda Grundl reading Homer {{and a host of other}} Greek authors.|$|E
25|$|King Amadeus {{made him}} prince of Vergara. The Restoration caused a statue {{to him to}} be built near {{the gate of the}} Retiro Park in Madrid. A {{magnificent}} statue and fountain was raised in his memory at Logrono. Spaniards of all political factions, except Carlists and Ultramontanes, paid homage to his memory when he died at his La Rioja on 8 January 1879. His preferences were modest, his manners rather reserved but always kind and considerate of humble folk. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician but had more of the better traits of the soldier <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> than of the arts of the statesman. His military traits did not always make it easy for him to accommodate himself to courtiers and professional politicians.|$|E

25|$|Another {{poet who}} {{supported}} the Young Irelanders, although not directly connected with them, was Samuel Ferguson (18101886). Ferguson once wrote: 'my ambition (is) to raise the native elements of Irish history to a dignified level.' To this end, he wrote many verse retellings of the Old Irish sagas. He also wrote a moving elegy to Thomas Davis. Ferguson, who believed that Ireland's political fate ultimately lay within the Union, brought a new scholarly exactitude to the study and translation of Irish texts. William Allingham (18241889) was another important Unionist figure in Irish poetry. <b>Born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> in Ballyshannon, Donegal, {{he spent most of}} his working life in England and was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, and a close friend of Tennyson. His Day and Night Songs was illustrated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. His most important work is the long poem, Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland (1864), a realist narrative which wittily and movingly deals with the land agitation in Ireland during the period. He was also known for his work as a collector of folk ballads in both Ireland and England.|$|E

500|$|On 23 September 2004, Brosnan {{became a}} citizen of the United States, but {{retained}} his Irish citizenship. Brosnan said that [...] "my Irishness is in everything I do. It's the spirit of who I am, as a man, an actor, a father. It's where I come from." [...] Brosnan was asked by a fan if it annoyed him when people get his nationality confused. He said: [...] "It amuses me in some respects that they should confuse me with an Englishman when I'm dyed-in-the-wool, <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> Irishman...

500|$|Xenophon {{advised that}} {{male and female}} slaves should be lodged separately, that [...] "…nor {{children}} <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad." [...] The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so {{it may have been}} cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.|$|E

50|$|Grey Lag (1918-1942) was a Thoroughbred race horse <b>born</b> in Kentucky <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> by John E. Madden.

500|$|In 1827, when giving {{evidence}} {{to a government}} select committee on emigration, {{an agent of the}} laird was asked [...] "And were the people willing to go?"; [...] "Some of them", came the reply, [...] "Others were not very willing, they did not like to leave the land of their ancestors". Years later an eyewitness, a local shepherd, was more florid in his description of the events: [...] "The people of the island were carried off in one mass, for ever, from the sea-girt spot where they were <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred...</b> The wild outcries of the men and heart-breaking wails of the women and children filled all the air between the mountainous shore of the bay" ...|$|E
500|$|Another theme {{frequently}} reflected {{is that of}} [...] "breeding", {{in several}} senses: [...] "pedigree, an inborn sense of manners and behavior, and, elliptically, sex." [...] Showcasing contemporary views of [...] "entitlement and noblesse oblige, the novel reflects Terhune's place {{as a member of}} the aristocracy and attempts to [...] "justify the natural rights of the well-bred." [...] The Place is owned by a rich family, that needs to be guarded against threats by foreigners, thieves of all varieties, Negroes, poachers, and the homeless. Within the novel, Terhune notes the provisions of the [...] "Guest Law", which reflect a fear of [...] "the flotsam of the American polity". In the character Hamilcar Q. Glure, shows his dislike for the nouveaux riches, those with [...] "new money", over those <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> into wealth.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} book (ch. 52–57), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a {{classical}} utopia presented in order to critique and assess {{the state of the}} society of Rabelais's day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice. [...] It is a utopia where people's desires are more fulfilled. [...] Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais's fiction. [...] The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being [...] "Do What Thou Wilt". Rabelais believed that men who are free, well <b>born</b> <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, because men desire what they are denied.|$|E
50|$|Set {{against them}} are the legendary Niphilim, a race <b>born</b> for conquest <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> for killing.

Uruk and Ander must make their stand against this unstoppable juggernaut, or else be wiped {{from the face of}} history.|$|R
60|$|I {{conceive}} {{that the}} sordid coarseness and brutality of Jonas would be unnatural, {{if there had}} been nothing in his early education, and in the precept and example always before him, to engender and develop the vices that make him odious. But, so <b>born</b> <b>and</b> so <b>bred,</b> admired for that which made him hateful, and justified from his cradle in cunning, treachery, and avarice; I claim him as the legitimate issue of the father upon whom those vices are seen to recoil. And I submit that their recoil upon that old man, in his unhonoured age, is not a mere piece of poetical justice, but is the extreme exposition of a direct truth.|$|R
60|$|Among the Victorian novelists {{were two}} men who were {{frequent}} rivals {{in the race for}} fame and fortune. Thackeray, well <b>born</b> <b>and</b> well <b>bred,</b> with artistic tastes and literary culture, looked doubtfully at the bustling life around him, found his inspiration in a past age, and tried to uphold the best traditions of English literature. Dickens, with little education and less interest in literary culture, looked with joy upon the struggle for democracy, and with an observation that was almost microscopic saw all its picturesque details of speech and character and incident. He was the eye of the mighty Victorian age, as Tennyson was its ear, and Browning its psychologist, and Carlyle its chronic grumbler.|$|R
