2500|$|Heatly's {{notes on}} the visit said, [...] "This massive, muscular youth <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be oozing with hostility [...] that {{something}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be happening to him and that he didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody ever <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> notice my good conduct," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Vyner, still bent {{on making}} conversation. [...] "They always <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> notice {{the other kind}} fast enough; but the ’good’ <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> escape them." ...|$|R
6000|$|And I,--what I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> my friend, you see: [...] What I soon shall <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> his love, you guess: [...] What I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> myself, {{do you ask}} of me? [...] No hero, I confess.|$|R

50|$|She is a pilot on {{the ship}} and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> hate men. However this <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> just be a facade she puts so she can appear {{stronger}} in front of them. After a short while she <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> like Hyousuke and later confesses.|$|R
25|$|Rather {{than the}} formal definition, {{it is more}} {{understandable}} with some historical context. The British generally <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be most consistent between theory and practice, although the minimum-effort theory, which worked in Malaya, did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> apply to Northern Ireland. French doctrine {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, involving working with locals, did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be the heart of doctrine in Algeria and Indochina. France does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> manage cooperation with former colonies, now clients.|$|R
50|$|Town's {{fortunes}} {{during the}} season didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> improve on the previous season. Even the 14 goals from veteran Peter Doherty didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> pull Town away from almost certain relegation. Relegation <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be certain for 2 out of Town, Preston North End and Sheffield United. With 10 minutes of Town's last match at home against Manchester City <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be heading down the trapdoor to Division 2.|$|R

60|$|When {{the first}} faintness {{consequent}} on having moved about had left him, he subsided into his former state. One of the night-tunes {{was playing in}} the wind, when {{the door of his}} room <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> open to a light touch, and, after a moment's pause, a quiet figure <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> stand there, with a black mantle on it. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> draw the mantle off and drop it on the ground, and then it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be his Little Dorrit in her old, worn dress. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> tremble, and to clasp its hands, and to smile, and to burst into tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saving life don’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{agree with}} you, George," [...] said the skipper. [...] "I like modesty, but you <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> me {{to carry it}} a trifle too far." ...|$|R
60|$|A curious {{quietness}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have crept over Mannering. When he answered, {{his voice}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> rise scarcely above a whisper.|$|R

25|$|In {{the middle}} period, the system <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be developing. The {{use of a}} dash and a curved {{horizontal}} line is found. A lotus (flower) mark <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> mark the end, and a circular mark appears to indicate the full stop. There <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be varieties of full stop.|$|R

50|$|ROCKs {{regulate}} cell-cell adhesion: Loss of ROCK activity <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> lead to loss {{of tight}} junction integrity in endothelial cells. In epithelial cells inhibition of ROCK <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> decrease tight junction integrity. Active ROCK in these cells <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> stimulate {{the disruption of}} E-Cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts by activating actomyosin contractility.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sound of}} my voice <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> steady him into a sudden rigidity, but {{otherwise}} he took no notice. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> listen, to expect something for a moment, then went on-- ...|$|R

5000|$|Fantasy {{life and}} real life cannot be distinguished. Real occurrences <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been {{imagined}} and fantasy thoughts <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have actually happened.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, some {{empirical}} evidence <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> exist at the aggregate level about two facts: first, {{changes in the}} number of disability pensions granted to the group of pre-retirement workers <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> respond to adjustments in the speed of economic growth. Second, the number of disability pensions granted to this group of individuals <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> accelerate after the introduction of the reform in 1997.|$|R

50|$|Star Wraith and Star Wraith II do {{not easily}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{flow into the}} stories of Star Wraith III and Star Wraith IV. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Star Wraith and Star Wraith II are no longer canon. The most {{important}} factor is that time scales don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> match between games.|$|R
50|$|Celsus <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} {{interested}} in Ancient Egyptian religion, and he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> know of Hellenistic Jewish logos-theology, both of which suggest The True Word was composed in Alexandria.

40|$|Ecofeminism {{is one of}} {{the newest}} {{varieties}} of feminism, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be one of the brightest. There 2 ̆ 7 s something appealing in combining feminist and ecological concerns, and something positively seductive in the implied possibility of one big solution out there somewhere that will end not only the oppression of women but the abuse of nature as well. There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be something right about ecofeminism too: it points out that our culture has formed a conceptual association between women and nature which certainly does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> exist and certainly does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have undesirable consequences. And it points out a dichotomy between humans and nonhuman nature that is fundamental to our culture 2 ̆ 7 s world-view [...] this also certainly <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> exist and also certainly <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have undesirable consequences...|$|R
