It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.|$|E
5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian subcontinent.

50|$|Raiffa argues as follows. Suppose {{someone has}} the {{following}} preferences. If {{forced to take}} Gamble A they would <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boxer, but if given a free choice between the gambles they would prefer Gamble B. Presumably, such a person when allowed to choose Gamble A would prefer to simply <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boxer rather than toss a coin to decide the matter of whether they should <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boxer or the wrestler. But this randomised approach is equivalent to Gamble B. So, by the axioms of substitutability and transitivity for utilities, they should also prefer to <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boxer than <b>on</b> Gamble B. A similar argument {{can be used to}} show that when the player has no preference between the boxer and the wrestler he should also have no preference between Gamble A and Gamble B.|$|R

5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|Little {{published}} {{their next}} two books in April and June 2003. The first, Speed, had Clark fighting hate crimes in Smallville. The second, Buried Secrets, followed Clark and Lex as they both {{fell in love}} with a mind-reading, substitute Spanish teacher.

On September 9, 2004, Aspect published Shadows, where Clark must stop a girl's scientist father, who has created a monster that is killing people. Runaway featured Clark leaving Smallville and living on the streets of Metropolis with other homeless teenagers. Clark {{fell in love with}} one of the girls before eventually returning home. Smallville: Silence has Clark and his friends investigating the appearance of zombies. Little's Greed followed Clark and his friends as they took jobs as summer counselors to disadvantaged youths. Pete tried to abuse Clark's abilities by tricking him into playing in a basketball game, and then <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outcome.|$|E
5|$|Non-human mammals play a {{wide variety}} of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of {{millions}} of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world. Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht DÃ¼rer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals. Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals. Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outcome. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Mammals further play {{a wide variety}} of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E

Bettors tend to prefer to <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> favorites in athletic competitions, and sometimes will accept even <b>bets</b> <b>on</b> favorites when offered more favorable <b>bets</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> less likely outcome (e.g., an underdog team).|$|R
5|$|The Last Story is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (ARPG) incorporating elements of tactical and stealth gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael {{for the majority}} of the game. Zael is primarily controlled using the Wii Remote from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or the Classic Controller. The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with story-related and side quests. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party can pick up money and items from non-playable characters <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fight.|$|E

25|$|At Wimbledon Odesnik {{lost his}} first round match to 30th-ranked JÃ¼rgen Melzer.

25|$|As CS:GOs {{popularity}} as an eSport grew {{with increased}} viewership, there also came {{a desire for}} players to bet and gamble on matches. Outside of the United States, several sites arose to allow users to bet with direct cash funds on the result of matches from games like CS:GO. Cash gambling on sports, including eSports, is banned within 46 American states and in some European countries. However, American case law has determined that use of virtual goods for <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outcome of matches is legal and not covered under gambling laws. Companies like Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have made strong delineations between virtual currencies and real-money to stay within these prior rulings while offering betting on matches within their games using strictly-virtual funds.|$|E
