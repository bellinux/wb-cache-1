To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E
5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, <b>but</b> <b>our</b> life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E

25|$|While we {{know about}} the types of {{cytokine}} patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, <b>but</b> <b>our</b> understanding is nowhere near complete.|$|E

25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, and we watched her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; <b>but</b> <b>our</b> signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E
25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; <b>but</b> <b>our</b> analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. <b>But</b> <b>our</b> commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E
