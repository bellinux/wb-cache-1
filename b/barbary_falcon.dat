5000|$|The {{phylogeny}} and delimitations of the peregrine and hobbies {{groups are}} more problematic.

The morphology of the syrinx, which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the Falconidae, is not very informative in the present genus.

500|$|Numerous {{subspecies}} of Falco peregrinus {{have been}} described, with 19 {{accepted by the}} 1994 Handbook of the Birds of the World, which considers the <b>Barbary</b> <b>falcon</b> of the Canary Islands and coastal north Africa to be two subspecies (pelegrinoides and babylonicus) of Falco peregrinus, rather than a distinct species, F. pelegrinoides.

500|$|The peregrine's {{breeding}} range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics. It {{can be found}} nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme polar regions, very high mountains, and most tropical rainforests; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand. This makes it the world's most widespread raptor, {{and one of the}} most widely found bird species. In fact, the only land-based bird species found over a larger geographic area is not always naturally occurring, but one widely introduced by humans, the rock pigeon, which in turn now supports many peregrine populations as a prey species. The peregrine is a highly successful example of urban wildlife in much of its range, taking advantage of tall buildings as nest sites and an abundance of prey such as pigeons and ducks. Both the English and scientific names of this species mean [...] "wandering falcon," [...] referring to the migratory habits of many northern populations. Experts recognize 17 to 19 subspecies, which vary in appearance and range; disagreement exists over whether the distinctive <b>Barbary</b> <b>falcon</b> is represented by two subspecies of Falco peregrinus, or is a separate species, F. pelegrinoides. The two species' divergence is relatively recent, during the time of the last ice age, therefore the genetic differential between them (and also the difference in their appearance) is relatively small. They are only about 0.6–0.8% genetically differentiated.|$|E
5000|$|Assuming {{a genetic}} {{distance}} of 2% in hierofalcons {{corresponds to a}} divergence roughly 200,000-130,000 years ago, the 0.6-0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex [...] suggests its current taxa evolved in the Late Pleistocene some 100,000 years ago or less, but before the Upper Paleolithic. The presumed time of divergence between peregrine and <b>Barbary</b> <b>falcons</b> approximately coincides with {{the start of the}} last ice age, when desertification was prominent in North Africa and the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf became a landlocked inland sea that slowly dried up. Populations of ancestral [...] "peregrinoid" [...] falcons living in marginal habitat at the fringe of the African-Middle Eastern desert belt either adapted (and might have become isolated e.g. in the Persian Gulf region, which turned into semiarid habitat surrounded by vast deserts), or left for better habitat, or became extinct. During interstadials, deserts receded and the aridland and humidland populations could expand to contact again, causing some limited gene flow. This scenario by and large parallels the proposed evolutionary history of the saker falcon in relation to the other hierofalcons; indeed, that group shows similar patterns of molecular paraphyly though it is of somewhat earlier origin.|$|R

Richness increased with slope and decreased with altitude. Threatened species (osprey, <b>Barbary</b> <b>falcon,</b> and raven) occupied cliffs farther away from houses and roads, and more rugged areas than the non-threatened species.

40|$|Predators may {{influence}} {{many aspects of}} the daily life and seasonal movements of their prey. Here we quantify direct, and evaluate indirect effects of predation by three falcon species (Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus, <b>Barbary</b> <b>Falcon</b> Falco pelegrinoides and Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus) on coastal shorebirds wintering on the Banc d’Arguin, Mauritania, an area hosting approximately 30 % of the East Atlantic Flyway population of shorebirds. On the basis of 754 h of observation over five winters, 97 witnessed attacks and 585 collected prey remains, we show that shorebirds were safer in larger flocks, which tended to be attacked less often. Furthermore, species that forage relatively close to shore and in small flocks were depredated more often than expected from their relative abundance. In three species, Red Knot Calidris canutus canutus, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica taymyrensis and Dunlin Calidris alpina, the juveniles were more vulnerable than adults. We estimated that on average 1 % of the juvenile and 0. 1 % of the adult Red Knots present were killed by large falcons each winter. For Red Knots we simultaneously quantified annual survival on the basis of an individual colour-marking programme: mortality due to predation by falcons accounted for an estimated 6. 2 % (juveniles) and 0. 8 % (adults) of annual mortality. We suggest that juvenile Red Knots are 10 times as likely to be killed by falcons because they use riskier habitats, i. e. early and late tide foraging areas closer to shores where surprise attacks are both more common and more successful. These results indicate that the strength of indirect effects of predation operating in a shorebird population largely outweigh the effects of mortality per se. ...|$|E
