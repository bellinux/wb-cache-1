40|$|Context and Motivation] Business {{modeling}} is nowadays {{a common}} approach in huge enterprise software developments. It notably allows to align business processes and supporting IT solutions at best, {{to produce a}} documentation of the company’s "savoir-faire" and to look for possible optimizations. The business modeling discipline of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) has enriched the semantic of the Unified Modeling Language’s (UML) <b>use</b> <b>case</b> diagrams for the special purpose of representing the organization’s processes with accurate elements. [Question/Problem] RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> scemantics are nevetheless only intended to further stereotype <b>use</b> <b>case</b> models {{and not to be}} used for reasoning. In parallel and in line with artificial intelligence concepts, researchers have developed the i* framework enabling the evaluation and decomposition of multiple design opportunities. RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> semantics could be used more efficiently to integrate the latter benefits. [Principal ideas/results] Through a systematic mapping of elements from i* on the one side and of the RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> model on the other, we have set up a RUP/UML graphical notation for i* elements. Applicability has been shown on an illustrative example. [Contribution] The main contribution of the framework is allowing to model in an i* fashion using CASE-tools meant for RUP/UML and proposing an interface for forward engineering the produced model in a classical UML requirements model. Future work is required to fully validate the proposal, notably to measure the method’s efficacy. status: publishe...|$|R

In Natural Language Processing, {{more complex}} <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> and shorter {{delivery}} times drive a growing need of smoother, more flexible and faster implementations.

By decoupling UIMA NLP models from other solution specific platforms and services, we obtain major architectural improvements. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We are {{currently}} devoloping an integrated business application platform named Corinna 3 where the long-term {{goal is to}} combine Semantic Web technologies with Natural Language Processing (NLP) {{to increase the efficiency}} of the enterprise search process. In this paper we consider one of the Corinna <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> namely the Human Resource (HR) <b>use</b> <b>case,</b> which has already reached a prototype implementation. While NLP is used for automatic categorization of an unstructured resource, ontologies represent these resources in a taxonomical way with arbitrary properties. On top of the resource ontologies we use both the NLP for the information extraction as well as ontology-based similarity in order to get more acceptable similar search results. Our implemented approach of contextualized hybrid similarity search within the Corinna platform derives strongly from the defined <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> It combines and extends existing similarity measures under consideration of additional context information. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{software}} applications using UML embodies an incremental process, transitioning a design {{from state to}} state over time. The integration of security, namely, role-based access control (RBAC) and mandatory access control (MAC), into this process is critical, dictated by the increasing need to capture an application’s security requirements. This paper reports on a novel functional framework that incorporates RBAC and MAC into UML to promote secure software design by tracking an application’s security requirements as UML elements (e. g., <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>actors,</b> classes, etc.) and connections (e. g., inheritance, association, etc.) are added, modified, and deleted. As a result, the framework is able to capture and check snapshots of each design state containing security constraints and insures that information assurance with respect to the application’s security requirements is always maintained. To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of our efforts, we have begun to transition our approach into Borland’s UML too...|$|R

Automatic service discovery, dynamic service composition and process adaptability will bring SOA to its full potential.
