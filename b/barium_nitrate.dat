2500|$|The chart shows {{solubility}} curves {{for some}} typical solid inorganic salts (temperature is in degrees Celsius i.e. kelvins minus 273). Many salts behave like <b>barium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and disodium hydrogen arsenate, and show a large increase in solubility with temperature. Some solutes (e.g., sodium chloride in water) exhibit solubility that is fairly independent of temperature. A few, such as calcium sulfate (gypsum) and cerium(III) sulfate, become less {{soluble in water}} as temperature increases. This {{is also the case}} of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) whose solubility at 70°C is about half of its value at 25°C. The dissolution of calcium hydroxide in water is also an exothermic process and obeys to the Le Chatelier's principle. A lowering of temperature will thus favour the dissolution heat elimination and increases the equilibrium constant of dissolution of Ca(OH)2, and so increase its solubility at low temperature. This temperature dependence is sometimes referred to as [...] "retrograde" [...] or [...] "inverse" [...] solubility. Occasionally, a more complex pattern is observed, as with sodium sulfate, where the less soluble decahydrate crystal loses water of crystallization at 32°C to form a more soluble anhydrous phase.|$|E

O- 2 (g) treatment of the BaOx(10 MLE) /Pt(111) surface at 873 K facilitates the BaO 2 formation and results in the agglomeration of BaOx domains leading to the generation of exposed Pt(111) surface sites. BaO 2 formed on BaOx(10 MLE) /Pt(111) is stable even after annealing at 1073 K, whereas on thinner films (theta(BaOx) = 2. 5 MLE), BaO 2 partially decomposes into BaOx indicating that small BaO 2 clusters in close proximity of the exposed Pt(111) sites are prone to decomposition. Nitrate decomposition temperature decreases monotonically from 550 to 375 K with decreasing BaOx coverage within theta(BaOx) = 0. 5 to 1. 0 MLE.

The FRC provides a site for investigators in the NABIR Program to conduct research related to in situ bioremediation of metals and radionuclides.

The FRC includes a contaminated area {{that can be used}} for conducting experiments on a plume of contaminated groundwater and sediment, and a background area that provides for comparison studies in an uncontaminated environment (Fig. 1).

40|$|An aerosol {{time-of-flight}} {{mass spectrometer}} (ATOFMS) {{was used to}} determine, in real time, the size and chemical composition of individual particles in the atmosphere at the remote inland site of Eskdalemuir, Scotland. A total of 51980 particles, in the size range 0. 3 – 7. 4 µm, were detected between the 25 th and 30 th June 2001. Rapid changes in the number density, size and chemical composition of the atmospheric aerosol were observed. These changes are attributed to two distinct types of air mass; a polluted air mass that had passed over the British mainland before reaching Eskdalemuir, interposed between two cleaner air masses that had arrived directly from the sea. Such changes in the background aerosol could clearly be very important to studies of urban aerosols and attempts at source apportionment. The results of an objective method of data analysis are presented. Correlations were sought between the occurrence of: lithium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, beryllium, strontium, <b>barium,</b> ammonium, amines, <b>nitrate,</b> nitrite, boron, mercury, sulfate, phosphate, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and carbon (both elemental and organic hydrocarbon) in both fine (d 2. 5 µm) particle fractions.

The results suggest that about 2 in 3 of all fine particles (by number rather than by mass), and 1 in 2 of all coarse particles containing carbon, consisted of elemental carbon rather than organic hydrocarbon (although a bias in {{the sensitivity of the}} ATOFMS could have affected these numbers). The ratio of the number of coarse particles containing nitrate anions to the number of particles containing chloride anions exceeded unity when the air mass had travelled over the British mainland.

40|$|A Professional Project {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, at the University of New Mexico. Recent {{studies have shown that}} hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is present in some drinking water systems across the United States. These studies are important because stricter standards on chromium are currently being researched by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and implemented by California. With renewed attention to the occurrence and toxicology of chromium, a better understanding of its occurrence in the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (Water Authority) water supply is important. The Water Authority water system receives water from approximately 90 production wells and surface water from the Rio Grande. The San Juan Chama Surface Water Treatment Plant was completed in 2008 to reduce the dependence upon the aquifer. In 2011 a study was conducted to determine the presence of Cr(VI) in groundwater wells and measured general chemistry, metals, field parameters, and chromium speciation. The general chemistry and metals analyses were completed by the Water Authority Water Quality Laboratory (WQL) while the hexavalent speciation and total chromium analyses were performed by Montgomery Watson Harza (MWH) Laboratory in California. The purpose of this project was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} occurrence of total and hexavalent chromium in the Water Authority water supply. The project consisted of two fundamental objectives. Graphical and statistical methods were used to determine if a correlation of Cr(VI) exists with other analytes which could allow for easier identification of areas with suspicion of increased Cr(VI) levels. Secondly, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping determined the spatial distribution of total and hexavalent chromium in the Water Authority source waters. Results for total and hexavalent chromium in the Water Authority system approach a one to one relationship in both the production wells and distribution system. Statistical analyses determined that seven analytes correlated to chromium concentrations. These include calcium, <b>barium,</b> sodium, fluoride, <b>nitrate,</b> field pH, and temperature. Coefficients of determination were higher than found in previous national studies. The best correlation and point distributions were associated with calcium and sodium. The highest correlation analytes also displayed similar occurrence patterns as in the correlation analyses when displayed on GIS plots. When comparing the spatial distribution of total chromium to that reported by Bexfield (et al., 1999) study, a stronger presence on the west side of Albuquerque was noted with the occurrence pattern in the remainder of town exhibiting little change. New wells that were drilled and equipped in the area since 1999 show that total and hexavalent chromium concentration correlates to volcanic deposits located west of Albuquerque...|$|R
