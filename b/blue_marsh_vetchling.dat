50|$|State Hill is {{a rather}} large and sparsely {{populated}} unincorporated community in Lower Heidelberg Township, Pennsylvania, in Berks County. The area that is now State Hill was once called Lorah, Pennsylvania. This was named for the first settler within the village's boundary. At one time, the main road through the unincorporated community was called Dry Road. It received the name for lack of water to tap into for wells. This road {{is now known as}} Brownsville Road. The village started out as just a few cabins, but by the mid-1800s had built a Tavern. It was called Dry Tavern, named after the road it was on. The village has a great view of <b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> Lake along Brownsville Rd. It is also home to an extinct elementary school, Lower Heidelberg Consolidated School, which ran from 1931 to 2006. It is served by the academically prestigious Wilson School District. State Hill also has several businesses, including Berks Western Telecom, Ganly's Pub and Deli, <b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> Taxidermy, a Fire Station, and a Police station. Ganly's was built in 1993. It was built where The Beer Garden Tavern used to be on. There are also 5-6 row homes on the intersection of State Hill Road and Brownsville Road.

Commonly found in marshes associated with forest streams, plantations and canals. The common name for this species is <b>blue</b> <b>marsh</b> hawk.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> was {{the name}} of the village that was located where the lake now is. It was the first {{settlement}} in Lower Heidelberg Township. The land was very fertile. It was also a heavily forested area with abundance of wildlife. There were many Farms, and 18th and 19th century homes. The village also had a church, schoolhouse, post office, and Pyles General Store. Some buildings were spared, such as Gruber Wagon Works, which was originally in <b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> but was moved a safe distance away before the dam was created. Others include Old Dry Rd. Farm, which most of its buildings were relocated out of the village. Residents were put under eminent domain and had no choice but to move out. Initial authorization for the reservoir was granted by the Flood Control Act of 1962 that started eight projects on the Delaware River basin. [...] The Pennsylvania Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act provided funding and permitted the eminent domain acquisition of the land that would later become the lake with the governor's permission in 1969. The United States Army Corps of Engineers began constructing the lake in March 1974 with the impoundment of the Tulpehocken Creek and was completed in September 1979.|$|R
50|$|A {{colourful}} {{variety of}} flowers {{may be seen}} throughout spring and summer. These include cuckoo flower, marsh-marigold, great burnet, meadowsweet, common knapweed, meadow <b>vetchling,</b> <b>marsh</b> ragwort, meadow buttercup, sorrel, ragged-robin, reed canary-grass, sweet vernal-grass and meadow brome. The wet conditions encourage many sedges including brown sedge, oval sedge, yellow sedge and carnation sedge. The slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) grows in this meadow which is rare in Gloucestershire.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, the building's {{original}} site on Licking Creek in Pleasant Valley fell {{within the}} planned area of <b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> Lake, {{so it was}} bought by the Army Corps of Engineers and {{during the winter of}} 1976-1977 they relocated it 5 mi east to its present location. The building is now part of the Berks County Heritage Center, an open air complex that also includes the C. Howard Hiester Canal Center with exhibits about canal transportation, Wertz's Covered Bridge, Melcher's Grist Mill, Deppen Cemetery, several memorials and gardens. The Center is open seasonally and offers tours of the historic buildings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> National Recreation Area is an {{artificial}} lake located {{northwest of the}} city of Reading, Pennsylvania, USA and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District. It is in western Berks County, fed into by the Tulpehocken Creek. The main span of the lake is along the border between Bern and Lower Heidelberg Townships. However, the northwesternmost portions lie in the more sparsely populated North Heidelberg and Penn Townships. In the middle of the lake is a large, uninhabited island (claimed by Bern Township). The lake is a popular recreation area in the summer, where people can fish, swim, and boat.|$|R
50|$|On Wednesday, June 28, 2006, {{after an}} {{extremely}} dry late winter and early spring, heavy rains struck eastern Pennsylvania in May and June 2006, eventually culminating {{in what is}} now known as the Flood of 2006. Heavy rains deluged the area causing the Ontelaunee and <b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> reservoirs to fill beyond capacity and begin to overflow. Fearing the dams would give way, the Reading Water Authority opened the sluice gates to relieve the pressure on the dams. In a matter of minutes the Schuylkill River transformed from a quiet, slow-moving stream into a raging torrent. The river crested at a record 33 ft, inundating the low-lying southern half of Reading.|$|R

40|$|The {{flathead}} catfish {{is at the}} top of many “least wanted ” {{invasive species}} lists because of its ferocious feeding habits, large size, and ability to swim long distances in a short time. This unique catfish, is hailed by anglers as one of the best of all freshwater sport fish – great fun to hook and excellent eating. Introduced flathead popularity with anglers presents a challenge for managers of native fish populations. Species Description As the name suggests, flathead catfish are most easily recognized by their broad, flat head and lower jaw which projects beyond the upper jaw. The flathead catfish also has a distinctive tail fin outline that is square or slightly notched. While the coloration can vary, most adults have an olive cast to their back and sides with dark-brown to yellow-brown mottling. Their belly is yellowish-white, and their eyes are relatively small. Young flathead catfish are nearly black on the back. Native & Introduced Ranges The flathead catfish is native to the Mississippi River basin, including the Ohio River drainage in western Pennsylvania. The first report of flatheads in the Delaware River basin was from <b>Blue</b> <b>Marsh</b> Reservoir (Schuylkill River) in 1997. Since then, introduced flatheads have spread throughout regions of the Delaware, Schuylkill, and Susquehanna rivers...|$|R

The wetland received a continual input of nutrients pri-marily from the south and intermittently from the west and east, respectively, which ceased in the mid- 1990 s. Since then the marsh system has been undergoing natural succession. We used (i) ordinary kriging to characterize the spatial patterns of total P and labile P forms across the wetland, (ii) local, moving spatial correlations to investigate relationships between total P and labile P forms, and (iii) a clustering technique to link the identified spatial patterns to biogeochemica...|$|R
