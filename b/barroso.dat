5|$|In 2004 José Manuel <b>Barroso</b> became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting {{to the proposed}} membership of the <b>Barroso</b> Commission. Due to the opposition <b>Barroso</b> was forced to reshuffle his team before taking office. The <b>Barroso</b> Commission {{was also the first}} full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members and hence the number of Commissioners {{at the end of the}} Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian ironclad <b>Barroso</b> was an {{armoured}} gunboat {{built for}} the Brazilian Navy during the Paraguayan War in the mid-1860s. <b>Barroso</b> bombarded Paraguayan fortifications in 1866 and 1867 {{a number of times}} before she participated in the Passagem de Humaitá in February 1868. Afterwards the ship provided fire support for the army {{for the rest of the}} war. She was assigned to the Mato Grosso Flotilla after the war. <b>Barroso</b> was decommissioned in 1882, but was not scrapped until 1937.|$|E

5|$|On 30 October 2006, in {{agreement}} with the President of the Commission, <b>Barroso,</b> the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. <b>Barroso</b> assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism. Before Orban, Varujan Vosganian, a former Romanian National Liberal Party Minister of Economy and Commerce, had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under Ceauşescu and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu refused a nomination.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Barroso</b> Commission {{took office}} in late 2004 after being delayed by {{objections}} from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, <b>Barroso</b> adopted a more presidential style {{of control over the}} college, which earned him some criticism.|$|E

The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed protocol with a bidirectional ring improved the system performance by 8 % to 30 % as compared to <b>Barroso's</b> protocol using a unidirectional ring. Assuming the bidirectional ring structure in both cases, the proposed protocol yields up to a 13 % performance improvement over <b>Barroso's</b> protocol...|$|R

Since 2012, they have lived in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, having previously lived in Miami and New York.|$|E
5|$|However, under <b>Barroso,</b> the Commission {{began to}} lose ground to the larger member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased {{with the creation of}} the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.|$|E

5|$|Once <b>Barroso</b> {{put forward}} the {{candidates}} {{for his next}} Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests.

5|$|As European Commissioner for Multilingualism in the <b>Barroso</b> Commission, Orban was {{responsible}} for the language policy of the European Union, i.e. promoting multilingualism for the citizens and the institutions of the European Union. He was the first to hold this portfolio. Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism, Ján Figeľ, the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.|$|E
5|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{finally came}} into force on 1 December 2009, {{granting}} Parliament powers {{over the entire}} EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the Commission President to Parliament's own elections. Despite some calls for the parties to put forward candidates beforehand, only the EPP (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing <b>Barroso.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the <b>Barroso</b> Commission to take office.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} at the time, Joaquim Inácio began his {{education}} {{at home and}} was later enrolled in Seminário de São José (Saint Joseph School) and after that, in Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. His teachers included Januário da Cunha Barbosa, who later {{became one of the}} leading figures in the Brazilian independence movement. Joaquim Inácio chose to follow his father, a naval officer who achieved the rank of second lieutenant, in his choice of a career. On 20 November 1822 at the age of 14, Joaquim Inácio was admitted as aspirante a guarda-marinha (aspiring midshipman or naval cadet) at the Navy Academy. On 11 December 1823, he graduated from the academy, majoring in mathematics, with the rank of guarda-marinha (midshipman). As he had in previous studies at other schools, Joaquim Inácio proved to be a brilliant student. Among his colleagues at the academy was Francisco Manuel <b>Barroso</b> da Silva (later Baron of Amazonas) whom he befriended.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} vote, Parliament demanded {{a number of}} {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-lead international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. <b>Barroso</b> considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Barroso's</b> second address, on 28 September 2011, {{he called}} for a eurozone bond and a {{financial}} transactions tax to stem the eurozone crisis and came out against the Franco-German proposal for an intergovernmental economic eurozone government - stating that that role belonged to the Commission; ...|$|R

50|$|Santana Lopes himself {{failed to}} gain a {{reputation}} as a competent Prime Minister. His unusual rise to power, as <b>Barroso's</b> successor rather than by election, contributed to these difficulties. Although his appointment was in fact constitutional, he was not a Member of Parliament but only a municipal leader, as the Mayor of Lisbon.|$|R
5|$|From 1993 to 2001, Orban {{served as}} a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, where he was {{responsible}} for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the Association Agreement between the EU and Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with the EU and as Secretary of State of the Ministry of European Integration of Romania, directly responsible for coordinating Romania's preparation for accession to the EU, as well as drafting the Treaty of Accession. On 25 April 2005, together with the Romanian president Traian Băsescu, the Romanian prime minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, Orban was one of the signatories for Romania on the country's Treaty of Accession in Luxembourg. After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the Council of the European Union and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs. On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission. From 1 January 2007, Orban became European Commissioner for Multilingualism for Romania in the <b>Barroso</b> commission. He wrote numerous newspaper articles and analyses and gave several speeches on European affairs.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, <b>Barroso</b> {{steadily}} won {{support from}} leaders {{for a second}} term as president, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi both declared their support for <b>Barroso,</b> though <b>Barroso</b> himself stated {{it is up to the}} political parties in Parliament. On 19 July 2008 <b>Barroso</b> stated for the first time that he was seeking a second term and was backed by the EPP for re-election. In the 2009 elections, the EPP maintained their position as largest party, though without an absolute majority even with the support of other parties to their right. Yet the second and third largest groups, the PES and ALDE, failed to put forward an alternative candidate to challenge <b>Barroso</b> even if they had won. Despite this, a loose red-green-yellow coalition (the PES/S and ALDE with The Greens–European Free Alliance) formed against <b>Barroso</b> in an attempt to gain concessions from him. They demanded <b>Barroso</b> set out clearly his policy guidelines for his next term and offer key posts in the Commission to their group members. They also attempted to push the vote back beyond the ratification date for the Treaty of Lisbon to have more power over his appointment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Barroso</b> Commission {{is led by}} {{president}} José Manuel <b>Barroso</b> and consists of 26 other Commissioners (24 between 2004 and 2007).
