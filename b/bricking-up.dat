50|$|Although the 1874 {{south and}} west timber {{verandah}}s and brick porch remain, the north verandah was added in 1914 {{at the same time}} as 24 pane composite windows were inserted into each of the three brick gables. Within the building, brick panels were removed and RSJ beams inserted to allow construction of the large glazed door partition to the northern verandah, and the opening into the southern porch area. The existing glazed partitions between classrooms were also constructed in 1914, contemporary with removal of the galleries and <b>bricking-up</b> of selected doors and windows.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} middle of the 19th century, a fire has damaged the church, in {{particular}} the southern wall. As a result, its porch was also destroyed. The following restoration in the year 1847 brought some unfortunate alterations, for example the damaging of the frescos in the upper parts of the church as the wooden ceiling was replaced, the <b>bricking-up</b> of the lateral doors, the addition of a porch at the western facade as well as the installation of two rectangular windows in the southern wall. The initial iconostasis was replaced by a new one and the frescos on the western facade got painted over with three rider saints.|$|E
