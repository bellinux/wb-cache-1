40|$|According {{to their}} origin the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>gobies</b> {{can be divided}} to Ponto-Caspian relicts and Mediterranean immigrants. The {{increase}} of species diversity in the Black Sea {{is a consequence of}} Mediterranean immigrants. The present study investigated the variability in Cytochrome b sequences isolated from two former Mediterranean immigrant species: Gobius niger and Zosterisessor ophiocephalus. The annotated at NCBI Cyt b sequences of the species were also used to extend the reach of the study. The analyses demonstrated that Black Sea inhabited by four haplotypes of G. niger. Four other haplotypes were found in sequences of Mediterranean <b>black</b> <b>gobies.</b> In the <b>Black</b> Sea haplotype, 6 is predominant and 83. 5 % of all G. niger representatives belong to it. Three other haplotypes (H_ 1; H_ 7 and H_ 8) were found to form isolated populations. The Tajima D-test indicated that in the Black Sea G. niger in a stage of expansion and significant evolutionary pressure according to data from Maximum Composite Likelihood model of Tamura-Nei, which can explain the accumulation of mutation and appearance of new haplotypes. Unlike G. niger, Z. ophiocephalus populations are shrinking according to Tajima D-test and only one haplotype is still surviving in isolated locations in the Black Sea. These data are in agreement with previous reports of other authors which alarmed that the grass goby is a critically endangered species close to extinction...|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> {{feeds on}} small {{invertebrates}} on the seabed. It breeds {{in the summer}} at which time the male creates a territory in a shallow weedy area and prepares a nest on a clean piece of seabed. He invites the female to inspect it and if she approves, she lays her eggs there and the male guards them until they hatch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> is {{native to}} shallow waters in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Its range extends from Cape Blanc in Mauritania to Trondheim in Norway and the Baltic Sea and it is usually found at depths less than 50 m. Its typical habitat is lagoons, {{estuaries}} and inshore waters, on sandy or muddy bottoms and among seagrasses and seaweeds, and it occasionally moves into fresh water.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether mating behavior (sperm expenditure, courtship rate, and nest guarding) varied {{according to}} {{different levels of}} sperm competition in territorial males of two goby species, the grass and the <b>black</b> <b>gobies.</b> We measured sperm expenditure (sperm released after 30 min {{from the beginning of}} the spawning), male courtship rate, and nest-guarding behavior in territorial males of both species during simulated spawnings, in which we varied the number of attending sneakers. Our results showed that, in both species, territorial males adjusted their effort in nest guarding to the presence of rival sneakers by increasing the time spent patrolling the territory and attacking the sneakers. In contrast, sperm expenditure and male courtship rate were not influenced by the number of attending sneakers. These results are in agreement with those reported for other fish with alternative mating tactics and help to interpret previous inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and measured levels of sperm released at different levels of sperm competition by sneakers of the two gobiids studied here.

5000|$|Gonarezhou National Park, {{encompassing}} an area {{of about}} 5000 km2, in southeastern Zimbabwe is in a remote region along the Mozambique border and is the second largest such park in the country; the first largest park is the Hwange National Park. ‘Gonarezhou’ in Shona means [...] "elephant's tusk" [...] (which the herbalists used to store their medicines) and it also means [...] "place of many elephants." [...] The park’s habitat consists of baobabs, scrub lands and sandstone cliffs in the lowveld region. The park is very large, in rugged terrain, and hence remains unaffected by human interference. The park is within the ambit of the transboundary part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Gonarezhou with the Kruger National Park in South Africa and the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique. Animals move freely between the three sanctuaries. The park's rich wild life consists of 500 species of birds, 147 species of mammals, more than 116 species of reptiles, 34 species of frogs and 49 species of fish.

In 1993, the composition of the Gobiid fish assemblage of the Vaccares lagoon was dominated by the <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> (63 %) and finally evolved to an assemblage dominated by the common goby (80 %). The <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> disappeared from the Vaccares lagoon 2 years after the inflow, whereas catches of the common goby increased significantly after the environmental changes and reached maximum values in 1998. Catches of sand goby did not seem to be affected by environmental changes and depended on the communication between sea and lagoon.

40|$|Male {{reproductive}} {{phenotypic plasticity}} related to environmental–social conditions is common among teleost fish. In several species, males adopt different mating tactics {{depending on their}} size, monopolizing mates when larger, while parasitizing dominant male spawns when smaller. Males performing alternative mating tactics are often characterized by a strong dimorphism in both primary and secondary reproductive traits. According to studies on sex-changing species and on species where only one male morph is reproductively active, male alternative phenotypes are expected to vary also in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in forebrain preoptic area (POA). Here, we compared the intra- and inter-sexual variations in number and size of GnRH neurons, along with gonads and male accessory structure investment, in two goby species, the grass goby, Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, and the <b>black</b> <b>goby,</b> Gobius niger, characterized by male alternative mating phenotypes. In both species, older and larger males defend nests, court and perform parental care, while younger and smaller ones try to sneak territorial male spawning. We found that grass goby and <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> have different patterns of GnRH expression. Grass goby presents a clear intra-sexual dimorphism in GnRH expression, related to the occurrence of alternative mating tactics, while in the <b>black</b> <b>goby,</b> only inter-sexual differences are observed. The interand intra-specific variability in the GnRH neurons in these two goby species is discussed {{in light of the}} differences in migratory behavior, nest type, and mating system...|$|E

Experiments were {{carried out in the}} eastern Mediterranean in September 2007 using a conventional bottom trawl with 600 meshes around the mouth. A constant 15 min towing duration was used for all hauls. The towing speed varied between 2. 0 and 2. 5 knots. Codend covers, supported by two hoops, were used to retain escaping fish. At the end of each haul, these covers were detached from the codend, fixed to the sea floor at depths of 19 to 28 m, and then observed by the divers for a period of seven days. On the eighth day, all of the covers were lifted up and the survivors and mortalities were counted and measured. The mean survival percentages of open codend and experimental cages were found to be 97. 1 % and 98. 3 % for brown comber, 69. 0 % and 77. 2 % for <b>black</b> <b>goby,</b> and 97. 5 % and 98. 6 % for annular seabream respectively...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{consequences}} of the switch of tactic from parasitic to parental male in the <b>black</b> <b>goby,</b> Gobius niger (Teleostei: Gobiidae), a species showing two alternative male mating tactics. Older and larger males defend nests, court, and perform parental care on eggs, while younger and smaller ones behave as parasites, sneaking into nests while spawning occurs. Males adopting different tactics are known to present differences in primary and secondary sex traits. The social context of sneaker males was manipulated to induce a tactic switch. Sneakers were kept under two different experimental treatments with or without a female, and under exclusion of male-male competition. Males changed tactics, courting females, spawning, and performing parental care. All males showed substantial changes in primary sexual traits, such as a reduction in gonadal development and an increase in the investment in accessory structures. The experimental groups differed in the functionality of gonads and accessory organs and {{in the development of the}} secondary sex traits. These results demonstrate that the moment of switching is not genetically fixed in the <b>black</b> <b>goby.</b> Sneaker males are able to quickly reallocate energy in primary and secondary sex traits, in accordance with the adopted tactic. Several aspects of this flexible reproductive pattern resemble the socially controlled sex change found in sequential hermaphrodites...|$|E
40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>goby,</b> Gobius niger, shows {{alternative}} male mating tactics, i. e., parental and sneaker males. Males {{release a}} sexual pheromone that attracts females and stimulates aggressive displays in males. This pheromone {{is produced by}} the mesorchial gland, a structure well developed in parental males but markedly undeveloped in sneakers. We measured the behavioral response of parental males to the ejaculates of males performing different reproductive tactics. Parental males reacted to the ejaculate of other parental males, with stereotypic aggressive behaviors, {{but not to the}} ejaculate of sneakers; consequently sneaker male ejaculate appears to be pheromonally inconspicuous...|$|E

40|$|Offshore {{wind farms}} {{are being built}} at a high rate {{around the world to}} meet the demand for {{renewable}} energy. We studied fish and sessile communities on and around offshore wind-turbine foundations in the southern Baltic Sea, 7 years after construction, using visual census techniques to determine how fish, sessile-invertebrate and algal communities are affected by the introduction of such structures. Fish assemblages were dominated by two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens) that were found in large shoals in close association with the vertical surface. At the seabed, close to the foundation, the <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius niger) was recorded in large numbers. The most obvious difference in fish densities was found between wind-power foundations extending through the entire water column and the surrounding open waters. Fouling assemblages on the vertical foundation surfaces and at the seabed just below differed from those at the seabed further away by having higher coverage of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and less algal growth. The results from the present study suggest that the introduction of offshore wind turbines in marine waters could {{have a positive effect on}} fish numbers and the presence of sessile invertebrates...|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{competition}} theory {{predicts that}} males should strategically allocate their sperm reserves {{according to the}} level of sperm competition, defined as the probability that the sperm of two males compete for fertilizing a given set of ova. Substantial evidence from numerous animal taxa suggests that, at the individual level, sperm expenditure increases when the risk of sperm competition is greater. In contrast, according to the ‘‘intensity model’’ of sperm competition [Parker, G. A., Ball, M. A., Stockley, P. &Gage, M. J. G. (1996) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 263, 1291 – 1297], when more than two ejaculates compete during a given mating event, sperm expenditure should decrease as the number of competing males increases. Empirical evidence supporting this prediction, however, is still lacking. Here we measured sperm expenditure in two gobiid fishes, the grass (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) and <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius niger), in which up to six sneakers can congregate around the nest of territorial males and release their sperm when females spawn. We show that, in accordance with theory, sneaker males of both species release fewer sperm as the number of competitors increases...|$|E
40|$|Male <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> Gobius niger, {{adopting}} parental or sneaking tactics, {{differed in}} secondary sex traits (elongation of the 4 th ray {{of the first}} dorsal fin and black nuptial colouration) thus allowing the classification of wild-caught males. Parental males were larger and older than sneaker males, suggesting that the mating tactic is expression of an ontogenetic gradient. Males adopting alternative tactics differed also in primary sex traits, including their testes and their two pairs of accessory structures: the seminal vesicles and mesorchial glands. Sneaker males had a higher investment in testes, while parental males showed larger seminal vesicles and more developed mesorchial glands. Histological analyses also showed that seminal vesicles from parental males presented some functional differences from those of sneakers. In the former these organs were devoted solely to mucin secretion, while in the latter they stored sperm and had a lower activity of secretion. Seminal vesicle features influenced ejaculate (sperm trail) characteristics and performance. Parental male trails were richer in mucins, but poorer in sperm than trails deposited by sneakers. As a consequence, while sneakers produced trails that released {{a large amount of}} immediately active sperm, trails laid by parental males released less sperm more constantly over a long time...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{chemicals}} in the aquatic environment are known to cause reproductive disturbances in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms by interfering with the endocrine systems. Large efforts have recently been devoted to dissect the mechanisms of action of xenobiotics in aquatic species, with the ultimate aim of detecting and controlling the effects of chemical exposure on the aquatic ecosystem and humans. In the present paper, males of a marine species, the <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius niger), were treated with estrogenicand dioxin-like compounds commonly discharged into the environment from industry, agriculture, and urban waste such as nonylphenol (NP) and beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF). Their effects were compared with those induced by estradiol (E 2), analyzing the expression of biomarkers commonly used in ecotoxicological studies such as vitellogenin (VTG) and cytochrome P 4501 A 1. The treatment with NP induced the synthesis of the female specific protein VTG in males, showing its estrogenic activity. NP and E 2 lowered cytochrome P 4501 A 1 basal levels while beta-NF determined a significant rise of its expression. The detoxification pathway was investigated,and the most relevant finding {{of this paper was}} the evidence that cytochrome P 4501 A 1 inhibition by estrogen and estrogen-like compounds is mediated through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor...|$|E
40|$|In the field, parental {{males of}} the <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> Gobius niger were always> 9 cm LT, showed a {{conspicuous}} elongation {{of the first}} dorsal fin, and were darkly coloured. Larger parental males did not occupy larger nests or obtain more eggs, suggesting that over a threshold size reproductive success was not correlated with male size. The mating system was polygynous with different egg clutches simultaneously present in a nest. Smaller sexually mature males were observed around and inside nests in which spawning was occurring. These opportunistic males ranged in body size between 6 to 8 cm LT. In contrast to parental males, they did not show an exaggeration of the first dorsal fin and were cryptically coloured, thus resembling small females in their external morphology. Aquarium experiments confirmed that smaller males perform a sneaking behaviour, releasing sperm when parental males spawn. As a consequence, {{it is possible to}} define three male types: type I are small, without an elongated dorsal fin and adopt a sneaking mating tactic; type III are large, have a pronounced elongation of the dorsal fin and perform parental behaviour; type II are intermediate both in size and elongation of the first dorsal fin and behave as either as sneakers or, possibly, as parental males according to nest availability and male competition...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the Etang de Thau (Herault, France), {{three species}} of Helicometra parasitize in their adult stage the {{digestive}} tract of the <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> Gobius niger, the grass goby Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, the grey wrasse Symphodus cinereus, and the common eel Anguilla anguilla (Teleostei). These fish act as definitive hosts in the biological cycle of these platyhelminths. Also H. gobii exists in G. niger, Z. ophiocephalus, S. cinereus and A. anguilla; H. fasciata is found in G. niger; and H. pulchella is only found in S. cinereus. In {{the case of the}} two gobies and the eel, these three congeneric digenes sometimes coexist in the same infracommunity. Spatio-temporal analysis of these different populations has enabled : 1) detection of seasonal variations in their structure, 2) identification of the relationships between the nature of their specificity and demographic strategy, and 3) the global absence of statistical dependence between the intensities of different species in the same infracommunity to be show. Implications arising from previous research concerning the demographic behaviour of these trematodes in their first intermediate host (mollusc compartment), were taken into account when interpreting structures observed in the definitive hosts. The problems of coexistence between these species, which are taxonomically very close in the same parasite community, and the under-lying speciation mechanisms are discussed in the light of population structuration...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} diet, use and allocation of available food resources, and feeding relationships of resident fish {{species in the}} coastal lakes of the Circeo National Park, stomach contents of 1729 fish have been examined, belonging to the species Aphanius fasciatus, Atherina boyeri, Gobius niger and Knipowitschia panizzae. Fish have been collected in the coastal lakes of Fogliano, Monaci and Caprolace {{in the course of}} four seasonal samplings carried out between 2003 and 2004, that have also allowed to collect, in the same moments and in the same sites, samples relative to zooplankton and to zoobenthic community. Occurrence frequencies of preys and correspondence analysis used for comparing the food spectra with the available resources have revealed alimentary choices of the fish and their feeding strategies in the three coastal lakes studied. The two pelagic species, A. boyeri and A. fasciatus were mainly zooplanktivorous. Copepods were the prey item most frequent, while larvae of bivalves and chironomids, this last one only for big-scale sand smelt specimens, were common prey. G. niger and K. panizzae showed definite benthic habits. Crustaceans, in particular amphipods, were the most important item in the diet of both benthonic fish, while larvae of chironomids were only secondary prey item. Instead small fishes were a common prey item only for the <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> specimens. Planktonic feeders had a similar spectrum, quite narrow as it presented a reduced number of items.

40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} worldwide {{are currently}} threatened due to overfishing and other humanimpacts. To monitor marine fish, which represents a main component in present monitoring ofmarine ecosystem health, one is mainly depending on invasive and selective methods. Thesemethods are also dependent on physical identification of species, which {{in many cases}} can bedifficult, or in some cases, impossible. Such limitations of traditional surveillance methodshave created a demand for alternative methods. One such alternative is the environment-DNAmethod, i. e. analysis of genetic material from a sample collected in the environment. In this paper I explore the possibilities of using environmental-DNA (eDNA) extracteddirectly from marine water samples, to detect selected marine fish species. eDNA samplesfrom eight different stations were collected {{along the coast of}} Southern Norway, and analyzedwith species-specific and universal primers. With species-specific primers I could prove thatcod (Gadus morhua) and <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius niger) were present in all eight localities. Tostudy the effectiveness of eDNA the results were compared to fish species observed in abeach sine survey in the same areas (conducted by the Institute of Marine Research in Agder,Flødevigen). The beach seine survey could only detect these species in seven of eightlocalities. This confirms earlier findings that shows that the eDNA method has a higherpossibility of detection than conventional methods. With universal primers I could not providea complete list of species present in the different localities, as the primers did not work asexpected. In this paper I conclude {{that it is possible to}} use eDNA for species detection inmarine water samples, although more information regarding factors affecting eDNA in marineecosystems is required for good estimates of presence and quantity of species. Nevertheless,the method shows huge potential to become a reliable monitoring method for marine fauna inthe future...|$|E
40|$|Significance of {{fish for}} food webs in the Wadden sea Moritz Pockberger, Florian Kellnreitner, Harald Asmus The Wadden Sea, an UNESCO world {{heritage}} site since 2009, is widely known as a nursery ground for commercially important fish of the North Sea, and also provides a habitat for small-sized fish species. Recently the fish fauna of the North Sea shows profound alterations respecting species compositon, standing stocks and migration behavior. Therefore, {{in the frame of}} long term observations of biological parameters in the Sylt-Rømø Bight (=SRB), a fish survey was conducted since 2007, to document possible changes of species composition and stock size, considering the rise of temperature on a local scale. Sampling takes place monthly on seven locations inside SRB using a bottom trawl, which is designed to be deployed also as flyde trawl for pelagic fishing. On every location a benthic and on deeper sites additionally a pelagic haul is performed. To achieve a clear picture of trophic positions and interactions between fish species inside the SRB gut content analysis and feeding experiments are carried out. Most of the long term data will be used to portray a food web for the total SRB {{as well as for the}} particular habitats of this area. This food web will reflect certain scenarios of environmental conditions and biological status to give a holistic view of the current as well as the expected changes. Until now, fish species are underrepresented in this food web and due to the lack of basic data only eight fish species could be included. Increasing temperatures in summer may lead to immigration of lusitanian species, such as the sand smelt (Atherina presbyter), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) into the Wadden Sea. Additionally a higher proportion of thermophile species is expected to visit the Wadden Sea, whereas boreal species may move to more northern regions. During a warm summer period in 2003 a high immigration of small thermophile fish, such as sand smelt and anchovy and emigration of indigenous fish was observed in the SRB. Considering the above described changes and varying residence times during seasons, shifts in the food web can be expected. In winter, higher temperatures may delay the migration of fish species into depths that have more stable environmental conditions. Several findings indicate ongoing changes in the SRB, e. g. sand smelt was found rarely, but is now found regularly in summer during sampling and it is assumed that reproduction takes place inside the SRB. In autumn, hatchlings of grey mullets (Chelon labrosus) were caught both in beach seine and bottom trawl. This species was only recorded as a summer guest before. Furthermore, catches of <b>black</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius niger), may be an example for ongoing faunal changes occurring in the area. To identify potential seasonal differences in species abundance and the role of southern species in the Wadden sea food web, an analysis of guild structures was conducted. Another subject of investigation will be the impact of new established habitats, like reefs of the Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Japanese Sargasso weed (Sargassum muticum) on fishes. These two species occur densely in high numbers and are able to change abiotic factors. Identification of feeding relationships and of key prey species provide important information for coastal area management and may help to explain structural variations of fish community in an area that is subject to constant change. ...|$|E
