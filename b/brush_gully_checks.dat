40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of farmers' investments in indigenous {{soil and water conservation}} measures in the semi-arid tropics of India. Many types of indigenous conservation measures are observed in three study villages, including investments in terracing, levelling, <b>gully</b> <b>checks,</b> field boundary bunds, grass strips, drainage, and other measures. A simple theoretical model is used to develop hypotheses about {{the determinants of}} such investments in the context of possibly imperfect factor markets, and these hypotheses are tested using data from the three study villages. Across the three study villages, we find that conservation investment is significantly greater on steep plots, on plots of higher quality, on plats that have incomplete conservation structures, and on plots that are owner-operated. The latter finding confirms that land markets have important impacts on investment incentives. We also find strong evidence that credit and labor market imperfections are affecting conservation investments in one of the study villages, where investment is greater among households having more education and debt, a higher percentage of off-farm income, more adult males, fewer adult females, who farm less land, or who are of low caste. We interpret these results as reflecting transaction costs of participation in credit and labor markets, which may be high relative to the small size of investments in the village where these effects are most notable.

40|$|Abstract: Study was {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of watershed management programme on natural resource conservation in North – Western India. The watershed planning was based on Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and the technologies are being executed for development of watershed in participatory mode through watershed committee. Out of 682. 5 ha watershed area, about 460 ha has been treated with silt retention masonry check dams, water storage check dams, masonry spillways, masonry gully plugs, graded bunds with loose boulder waste weirs, leveling and small farm pond. A total of 538 ha cm surface runoff was harvested by constructing two small farm ponds on community land, and three small earthen and two masonry check dams on private waste lands to recharge ground water/drinking water otherwise going waste. It was observed that silt retention behind stone masonry check dams in upper, middle and lower reaches of the watershed was 59. 6, 16. 7 and 9. 9 t/(ha yr) respectively and 618. 27, 23. 49 and 1, 775. 81 kg of available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were arrested. It was found that soil moisture at 0 cm— 15 cm, 15 cm— 30 cm and 30 cm— 60 cm depth was 27. 66, 32. 23 and 38. 11 % higher respectively as compared to <b>gullies</b> without <b>check</b> dams. Nearly 2. 65 ha gullied land was reclaimed for cultivation due to nine small check dams. The average yield of mustard and chickpea in reclaimed gullies was 48. 82 and 58. 82 % higher respectively than normal yield of these crops in the region...|$|R
40|$|Debris flow {{activity}} has recently caused serious property damage {{as well as}} loss of life in Yunnan, Southwest China. Moreover, ground failure caused by debris flow needs {{a long time to}} be recovered. The hazards of debris flow can be prevented or released by some engineering countermeasures such as erosion control. The check dam {{is one of the most}} effective structures to control the debris flow in the original area. Based on the examination of architectonic geology, engineering geology, rock mechanics and remote sensing geology, two major tributary <b>gullies</b> (one with <b>check</b> dams but the other without) of Jiangjia Gully in Yunnan Province, are compared in three aspects (channel longitudinal gradient, stability of lateral slopes and trailing edge of channel, soil erosion by debris flow) to prove that check dam or check dam series can: (1) effectively uplift the basic level of erosion of debris-flow channel; (2) reduce the longitudinal gradient of the debris-flow channel, and accordingly velocity slowed down and energy dissipated; (3) fix the channel and stabilize the slope so as to facilitate or restore the growth of the vegetation. In addition, several problems, needed to be taken into account during the design of check dam, are also discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of adequate and reliable water supplies {{has always been}} a critical concern in central Arizona since prehistoric times. The early European settlers in 1868 initially utilized the ancient Hohokam Indian canal system which drew water from the Salt River. However, the river fluctuated with periods of drought and periods of high flows which destroyed the diversion structures. The settlers proposed a dam to store water and to regulate flows. In 1903, the Salt River Water Users Association was formed and an agreement was reached with the U. S. Government {{for the construction of a}} dam on the Salt River at its junction with Tonto Creek. The Salt River drains more than 4, 306 square miles (mi 2) from the White Mountains of eastern Arizona to the confluence with Tonto Creek. Tonto Creek drains a 1, 000 -mi 2 watershed above the confluence. The agreement was authorized under the Reclamation Act of 1902. The Theodore Roosevelt Dam was started in 1905, completed in 1911, and dedicated in 1911 (Salt River Project 2002). The dam has the capacity to store 2. 9 million acre-feet (af) of water. However, between 1909 and 1925, 101, 000 af of sediment were accumulated behind Roosevelt Dam (Rich 1961). Much of it came from erosion on the granitic soils from the chaparral lands above the reservoir, and much of the erosion was blamed on overgrazing by domestic livestock. Water users were concerned that accelerated sedimentation would eventually compromise the capacity of the dam to hold sufficient water for downstream demands. The Tonto National Forest was originally created to manage the watershed above Roosevelt Dam and to prevent siltation. The Summit Plots, located between Globe, Arizona, and Lake Roosevelt were established in 1925 by the U. S. Department of Agriculture to study the effects of vegetation recovery, mechanical stabilization, and plant cover changes on stormflows and sediment yields from the lower chaparral zone (Rich 1961). The area initially was part of the Crook National Forest which was later added to the Tonto National Forest. The Summit Watersheds consisted of nine small watersheds ranging in size from 0. 37 to 1. 23 acres (ac). Elevations are between 3, 636 and 3, 905 feet (ft). The treatments included: exclusion of livestock and seeding grasses, winter grazing, hardware cloth check dams, grubbing <b>brush,</b> sloping <b>gullies</b> and grass seeding. Protection from grazing did not pro duce changes in runoff or sedimentation. Treatments that reduced surface runoff also reduced erosion. Hardware cloth check dams reduce total erosion, and mulch plus grass treatments checked erosion and sediment movement. Runoff was reduced by the combined treatments (Rich 1961). The Summit Watersheds were integrated into the Parker Creek Erosion-Streamflow Station in 1932...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale aerial {{photographs}} and high-resolution satellite images, available for Ethiopia {{since the second}} half of the twentieth century as for most countries, allow only the length of gullies to be determined. Understanding the development of gully volumes therefore requires that empirical relations between gully volume (V) and length (L) are established in the field. So far, such V–L relations have been proposed for a limited number of gullies/environments and were especially developed for ephemeral gullies. In this study, V–L relations were established for permanent gullies in northern Ethiopia, having a total length of 152 km. In order to take the regional variability in environmental characteristics into account, factors that control gully cross-sectional morphology were studied from 811 cross-sections. This indicated that the lithology and the presence of check dams or low-active channels were the most important controls of gully cross-sectional shape and size. Cross-sectional size could be fairly well predicted by their drainage area. The V–L relation for the complete dataset was V= 0 562 L 1381 (n = 33, r 2 = 0 94, with 34 9 % of the network having check dams and/or being low-active). Producing such relations for the different lithologies and percentages of the <b>gully</b> network having <b>check</b> dams and/or being low-active allows historical gully development from historical remote sensing data to be assessed. In addition, gully volume was also related to its catchments area (A) and catchment slope gradient (Sc). This study demonstrates that V–L and V–ASc relations can be very suitable for planners to assess gully volume, but that the establishment of such relations is necessarily region-specificstatus: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The two {{programmes}} identified about 1000 farmer innovators {{and concluded}} that innovation is a fairly common phenomenon in regions where there is high population pressure on available natural resources. This is not surprising as farmers have to adapt to changes in rainfall, soils, demographics and markets, for example, in order to survive. Farmers with their ´backs against the wall´ have no choice: innovate to improve their livelihoods, {{continue to live in}} poverty or leave the land and settle elsewhere. Farmer innovators Innovators were identified by extension agents or by field staff of NGOs as well as by researchers. They not only observed farmers who were doing things differently, but also asked villagers whether they knew of farmers who were achieving better results than others who were producing under similar conditions. In Tunisia, the partners created a special weekly programme on ´agriculture and innovation´ for a regional radio station. Farmers responded positively to this programme and some submitted reports on their innovations to the radio station. Farmers improved technologies in areas such as soil and water conservation, water harvesting, soil fertility management and agroforestry and tested new crops and new crop varieties in their farming systems. Not all of the innovations were technical in nature; some farmers also defined new rules for the management of a community resource, such as water for irrigation. The improved traditional planting pits used in the Sahel to rehabilitate seriously degraded land are a well-known example of farmer innovation in the early 1980 s. Farmers drew upon many sources of inspiration for their innovations. Many picked up ideas while working elsewhere, and upon return, tried the new techniques on their own fields. In other cases they experimented with ideas gleaned from extension agents, study visits to research stations or from projects in other regions. However, some were {{as a result of their}} own creativity. Most innovators were fairly old and experienced but some were young. In Cameroon, a small network of 15 innovators had four members aged 23 - 32 years. These were young men who, after losing their jobs in urban centres during the economic crisis in Cameroon in the 1990 s, returned to their home villages and took up farming. Most innovators were illiterate, but the ability to be innovative was not related to the level of formal education. Most were men, but an increase in the number of female innovators was noted when women were involved in the identification process. Most of the innovators had strong personalities and were capable of withstanding considerable social pressure. Tensue Gebremedhin, a widow in Tigray, Ethiopia, started to plough with an ox and a donkey and by doing so broke two taboos: a woman behind a plough with a donkey in front of it. In East Africa, 33 % of innovators identified were women and their innovations in land husbandry did not differ from those of men. In Tanzania, for example, Mrs Grace Bura built up barriers with earth and <b>brush</b> to block <b>gullies,</b> and Mrs Martha Mwaso reclaimed large sections of riverbed through labour-intensive efforts. In Kenya, Mrs Kalekye excavated large quantities of earth to reclaim gullies for agricultural production. All innovators increased their production and income, and were considered to be better off because of their innovations. Data from Tanzania and from Burkina Faso show that many innovators who were resource-poor 10 - 20 years ago are now resource-rich. By investing in land rehabilitation, innovators in Burkina Faso systematically expanded their resource base and produced sufficient food to feed their families even in drought years. Not only did they build up their assets, but they also became less vulnerable to drought. Chains of innovation Some innovations triggered others. Innovators in Babanki, Cameroon, for example, contributed to a significant increase in the production of nightshade (Solanum nigrum) as a result of improved soil fertility management and the construction of a network of irrigation canals. A farmer then devised a simple, low-cost harvesting tool to cut leaves quickly and efficiently without damaging the plants. Improving the marketing channels was their next project. Farmer innovation and formal research Both regional programmes emphasized that farmer innovations are not necessarily perfect. They can be improved and it is essential to build partnerships between researchers and innovators for joint experimentation based on agendas set by the farmers. The case of innovators in Cameroon who expressed their problems and their priorities clearly, and were accepted by researchers, is a good example. In Tunisia the programme of experimentation was more researcher-driven, but responded adequately to farmers´ priorities. Working with farmer innovators requires a change in attitudes for many researchers. They need to communicate with farmers as equals and should be willing and able to listen to and learn from farmers. Innovation and extension Top-down approaches to extension have failed to produce tangible results. It is still too often assumed that there are sufficient, readily available technologies that can be transferred to farmers. More participatory approaches to extension have not yet been mainstreamed. It has been repeatedly demonstrated and reported that farmers are keen to learn from fellow farmers, and that they often more readily accept innovations observed on the fields of other farmers working under similar conditions than messages transmitted by extension agents. When farmers from Niger went on a study tour to Burkina Faso in 1989, they were impressed by the improved traditional planting pits used to rehabilitate degraded land. Some applied this technique on their return [...] The results were surprisingly good, even in 1990, which was a drought year. This success led to the accelerated dissemination of this technique and, by 1992, the emergence of a farmers´ land market with farmers actively buying and selling degraded land. Building on farmer innovation implies a fundamental change in the roles of extension agents from transmitters of technical messages to facilitators of knowledge exchange between farmers and other farmers and between farmers and extension officers themselves. Recent initiatives The number of initiatives to promote farmer experimentation and innovation seems to be increasing. In March 2004 CTA and IFAD organized a regional workshop in West Africa on farmer innovation and extension. IFAD subsequently launched an Innovation Mainstreaming Initiative and ICRAF and partners developed a proposal to promote farmer experimentation and innovation in the Sahel. The creativity of farmers in Africa and other ACP regions remains a major untapped resource that can be used to realize the promise and potential of ACP agricultural and rural development. The challenge is for policymakers, researchers and extensionists to embrace farmer innovation as a valuable tool for transforming ACP agriculture.
